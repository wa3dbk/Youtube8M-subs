00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
compact fluorescent bulb in there and I

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.390 
compact fluorescent bulb in there and I
might<00:02:14.060> end<00:02:14.330> up<00:02:14.599> deciding<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.590> go<00:02:15.799> to<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.040> store

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
might end up deciding to go to the store

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:27.250 
might end up deciding to go to the store
and<00:02:17.019> get<00:02:18.019> a<00:02:18.700> different<00:02:19.700> bulb<00:02:25.780> fit<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:27.019> on

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
and get a different bulb fit that on

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.460 
and get a different bulb fit that on
there<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:29.180> actually<00:02:29.840> came<00:02:30.019> with<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.230> little

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
there this actually came with a little

00:02:30.470 --> 00:03:00.320 
there this actually came with a little
rubber<00:02:30.739> washer<00:02:31.630> don't<00:02:32.630> flick<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:33.049> on<00:02:33.290> there

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.090 

where<00:03:00.960> they<00:03:01.080> don't<00:03:01.200> make<00:03:01.440> things<00:03:01.740> like<00:03:01.950> they

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
where they don't make things like they

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.910 
where they don't make things like they
used<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.550> anymore<00:03:03.060> do<00:03:03.240> they

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
used to anymore do they

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.280 
used to anymore do they
this<00:03:04.920> thing<00:03:05.160> seems<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.730> little<00:03:05.850> loose<00:03:06.630> on<00:03:06.990> here

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
this thing seems a little loose on here

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.200 
this thing seems a little loose on here
but<00:03:07.470> it's<00:03:07.620> as<00:03:07.740> tight<00:03:08.010> as<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.370> gonna<00:03:08.550> go

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
but it's as tight as it's gonna go

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.190 
but it's as tight as it's gonna go
I<00:03:09.800> don't<00:03:10.800> think<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.160> can<00:03:11.280> go<00:03:11.490> down<00:03:11.520> any<00:03:12.000> further

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:32.770 

see<00:03:16.200> what's<00:03:16.410> happening

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.010 

guess<00:03:33.470> this<00:03:33.770> is<00:03:34.010> on<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.190> little<00:03:34.610> nut<00:03:35.210> here<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.720> I

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
guess this is on a little nut here and I

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.830 
guess this is on a little nut here and I
can<00:03:36.200> loosen<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:36.800> up<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.280> screw<00:03:38.270> that<00:03:38.480> down<00:03:38.780> a

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
can loosen that up and screw that down a

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.810 
can loosen that up and screw that down a
little<00:03:39.080> bit<00:03:39.350> further<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:40.010> think<00:03:40.160> that's<00:03:40.580> what's

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
little bit further I think that's what's

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.640 
little bit further I think that's what's
happening<00:03:42.130> okay<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:44.930> I'll<00:03:45.110> loosen<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.590> up

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
happening okay so I'll loosen that up

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.710 
happening okay so I'll loosen that up
gotta<00:03:46.130> get<00:03:46.280> a<00:03:46.310> little<00:03:46.520> pair<00:03:46.790> of<00:03:46.850> pliers<00:03:47.120> loosen

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
gotta get a little pair of pliers loosen

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.890 
gotta get a little pair of pliers loosen
that<00:03:47.840> up<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.670> then<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.760> will<00:03:49.880> fit<00:03:50.180> down<00:03:50.209> tight

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
that up and then it will fit down tight

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.900 
that up and then it will fit down tight
do<00:03:51.770> a<00:03:51.800> good<00:03:52.040> job<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:54.310> had<00:03:55.310> it<00:03:55.430> loosen<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.850> nut

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
do a good job I had it loosen that nut

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.530 
do a good job I had it loosen that nut
up<00:03:56.450> tighten<00:03:57.380> that<00:03:57.650> rod<00:03:58.130> down<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:59.150> know<00:03:59.270> screw

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
up tighten that rod down you know screw

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.330

it<00:03:59.570> down<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.840> little<00:04:00.020> bit<00:04:00.170> further<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:00.860> then

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
it down a little bit further and then

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.490 
it down a little bit further and then
tighten<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.790> nut<00:04:02.000> and<00:04:02.240> then<00:04:02.420> put<00:04:02.690> this<00:04:02.870> on<00:04:02.930> and

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
tighten the nut and then put this on and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.350 
tighten the nut and then put this on and
now<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.680> fits<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.100> lot<00:04:04.220> better<00:04:04.840> okay<00:04:05.840> Wow

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
electrical tape so I got the electrical

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.880 
electrical tape so I got the electrical
tape<00:05:33.919> and<00:05:34.360> see<00:05:35.360> you<00:05:35.990> put<00:05:36.169> electrical<00:05:36.680> tape

that kind of mimics beam at dark and the
light<00:05:42.429> went<00:05:43.269> on<00:05:43.449> that<00:05:44.229> cool<00:05:45.869> okay<00:05:46.869> so<00:05:46.929> now<00:05:47.199> if

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
light went on that cool okay so now if

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.219 
light went on that cool okay so now if
you<00:05:47.409> turn<00:05:47.589> the<00:05:47.679> light<00:05:47.860> switch<00:05:48.129> off<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:50.050> light

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
you turn the light switch off the light

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.600 
you turn the light switch off the light
goes<00:05:50.439> off<00:05:51.659> turn<00:05:52.659> back<00:05:52.869> on<00:05:53.080> it<00:05:53.289> goes<00:05:53.409> on<00:05:53.610> that's

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
goes off turn back on it goes on that's

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.909 
goes off turn back on it goes on that's
how<00:05:54.759> it<00:05:54.849> works<00:05:55.059> at<00:05:55.269> night<00:05:55.449> you<00:05:55.899> leave<00:05:56.080> it<00:05:56.199> on

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
how it works at night you leave it on

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:02.239 
how it works at night you leave it on
right<00:05:57.249> now<00:05:58.080> during<00:05:59.080> the<00:05:59.319> day<00:05:59.469> you<00:05:59.800> can<00:05:59.949> do<00:06:00.099> that

right now during the day you can do that

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:04.979 
right now during the day you can do that
and<00:06:03.249> it<00:06:03.429> will<00:06:03.550> stay<00:06:03.819> off<00:06:04.059> okay<00:06:04.539> so<00:06:04.599> you've<00:06:04.869> got

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:04.989 
and it will stay off okay so you've got

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:10.069 
and it will stay off okay so you've got
two<00:06:05.289> ways<00:06:05.529> to<00:06:05.889> control<00:06:06.009> that<00:06:06.459> light<00:06:06.869> that<00:06:07.869> cool

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:10.079 
two ways to control that light that cool

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:12.689 
two ways to control that light that cool
now<00:06:11.079> doesn't<00:06:11.529> that<00:06:11.589> make<00:06:11.829> the<00:06:12.339> front<00:06:12.489> of<00:06:12.639> the

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
now doesn't that make the front of the

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:18.290 
now doesn't that make the front of the
house<00:06:12.879> look<00:06:13.300> that<00:06:13.569> much<00:06:13.839> mo<00:06:14.110> bettah

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.459 

here's<00:06:19.300> something<00:06:19.659> else<00:06:19.839> I<00:06:20.050> want<00:06:20.229> to<00:06:20.289> point

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:20.469 
here's something else I want to point

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.979 
here's something else I want to point
out<00:06:20.709> can<00:06:21.579> you<00:06:21.879> install<00:06:22.269> this<00:06:22.509> particular

out can you install this particular

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:26.009 
out can you install this particular
light<00:06:23.219> fixture<00:06:24.219> upside<00:06:24.759> down<00:06:25.119> kinda<00:06:25.629> you<00:06:25.839> see

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:26.019 
light fixture upside down kinda you see

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:27.479 
light fixture upside down kinda you see
some<00:06:26.259> at<00:06:26.349> the<00:06:26.469> store<00:06:26.499> some<00:06:26.979> are<00:06:27.099> upside<00:06:27.459> down

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:27.489 
some at the store some are upside down

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:30.059 
some at the store some are upside down
some<00:06:27.969> are<00:06:28.089> facing<00:06:28.300> straight<00:06:28.719> up<00:06:29.139> I<00:06:29.349> wouldn't

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:30.069 
some are facing straight up I wouldn't

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:31.799 
some are facing straight up I wouldn't
do<00:06:30.279> that<00:06:30.309> if<00:06:30.639> I<00:06:30.789> was<00:06:30.969> you<00:06:30.999> if<00:06:31.300> you<00:06:31.449> want<00:06:31.719> one

00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:31.809 
do that if I was you if you want one

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:34.079 
do that if I was you if you want one
that's<00:06:32.079> facing<00:06:32.409> down<00:06:32.889> get<00:06:33.279> one<00:06:33.459> that<00:06:33.610> faces

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:34.089 
that's facing down get one that faces

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:37.379 
that's facing down get one that faces
down<00:06:34.529> because<00:06:35.529> that<00:06:35.709> top<00:06:35.979> piece<00:06:36.279> fits<00:06:36.819> over

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389 
down because that top piece fits over

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.619 
down because that top piece fits over
the<00:06:37.659> glass<00:06:38.319> at<00:06:38.619> the<00:06:38.649> top<00:06:38.769> okay<00:06:39.429> in<00:06:40.239> case<00:06:40.449> it

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:40.629 
the glass at the top okay in case it

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:43.169 
the glass at the top okay in case it
gets<00:06:40.749> moisture<00:06:41.349> in<00:06:41.469> it<00:06:41.499> rain<00:06:41.979> whatever<00:06:42.459> this

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:43.179 
gets moisture in it rain whatever this

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:44.759 
gets moisture in it rain whatever this
one<00:06:43.360> happens<00:06:43.689> to<00:06:43.719> be<00:06:43.809> underneath<00:06:44.139> an<00:06:44.319> overhang

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:44.769 
one happens to be underneath an overhang

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:46.049 
one happens to be underneath an overhang
so<00:06:44.979> chances<00:06:45.339> are<00:06:45.490> you're<00:06:45.639> not<00:06:45.699> going<00:06:45.789> to<00:06:45.969> get

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:46.059 
so chances are you're not going to get

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:47.850 
so chances are you're not going to get
any<00:06:46.179> moisture<00:06:46.360> in<00:06:46.689> there<00:06:46.899> but<00:06:47.529> if<00:06:47.619> you<00:06:47.679> put

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
any moisture in there but if you put

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.040 
any moisture in there but if you put
that<00:06:47.949> upside<00:06:48.159> down<00:06:48.550> all<00:06:48.909> any<00:06:49.300> water<00:06:49.629> moisture

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
that upside down all any water moisture

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.350 
that upside down all any water moisture
whatever<00:06:50.619> is<00:06:50.919> gonna<00:06:51.129> seep<00:06:51.519> down<00:06:51.759> in<00:06:51.939> there<00:06:52.119> and

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
whatever is gonna seep down in there and

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.850 
whatever is gonna seep down in there and
it's<00:06:52.479> gonna<00:06:52.599> collect<00:06:52.959> inside<00:06:53.529> the<00:06:53.709> light

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
it's gonna collect inside the light

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.839 
it's gonna collect inside the light
fixture<00:06:54.399> okay<00:06:55.300> all<00:06:55.539> light<00:06:55.809> fixtures<00:06:56.229> are<00:06:56.379> are

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:56.849 
fixture okay all light fixtures are are

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:59.999 
fixture okay all light fixtures are are
made<00:06:58.259> different<00:06:59.259> they're<00:06:59.409> not<00:06:59.529> all<00:06:59.740> created

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:00.009 
made different they're not all created

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:03.629 
made different they're not all created
equal<00:07:00.669> so<00:07:01.509> look<00:07:02.110> at<00:07:02.289> the<00:07:02.409> store<00:07:02.709> and<00:07:03.009> get<00:07:03.399> the

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 
equal so look at the store and get the

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:10.079 
equal so look at the store and get the
one<00:07:03.879> you<00:07:04.029> want<00:07:08.339> well<00:07:09.339> that's<00:07:09.459> all<00:07:09.610> I<00:07:09.669> got<00:07:09.699> time
