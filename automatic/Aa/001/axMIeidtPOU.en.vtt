 yes, before I tell so much now 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.200
 Let's start with the recipe 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.629
 we need cut rhubarb 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.780
 pieces of mail brown sugar and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.860
 vanilla sugar melted butter natron 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.539
 or baking powder and eggs taraba must before 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.960
 Of course, peeled the cut still 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.850
 become 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.100
 you cut something of the ends 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.020
 off and cuts something on the edge and 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.170
 top one layer and then draws with 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.640
 Carefully peel the peel off a knife 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.439
 that's easy and if everything 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.790
 peeled her cuts small pieces 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.790
 and collect them in a bowl 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.119
 if they also stick very thin rava 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.860
 You can also do this in smaller ones 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.290
 cut pieces and then later in the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.000
 Fill in spaces and then give 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.860
 her to have but a little cane sugar 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.110
 this is roughly seduced by your hands 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.340
 and let the pull as long as you for 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.690
 the dough needs 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.670
 for the dough, first come the eggs 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.800
 by train to a mixing bowl and 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.340
 need for about ten minutes 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.170
 be pitched 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.360
 then comes the little bit by little 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.160
 then butter it and finally followed by the 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.160
 soda and spoonful of flour 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.610
 the finished part comes on now 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.410
 baking sheet that I still here with something 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.180
 Baking paper was designed around the 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.110
 do not cut my shape too much 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.030
 claim 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.800
 and if you use the baking paper with something 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.220
 Water will slip after sliding on 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.720
 do not fill back and forth then comes 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.610
 the day on the tin and still has 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.030
 evenly distributed in all corners 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.030
 become 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.320
 now I still have the discount 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.930
 something close to each other in the dough 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.340
 pressed and to the end you can 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.410
 then the interstices with the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.410
 small cut rests on heights 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.020
 now the cake is at 170 degrees above 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.630
 and heat it down for about 30 minutes 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.490
 baked and bake after tests her 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.440
 simply with a toothpick whether the day 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.820
 already finished is you recognize then 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.060
 because the dough is no longer on 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.170
 Stick sticks 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.180
 Last time I have the cake with me 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.230
 Decorate some cake glaze and then 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.760
 can already be tried 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.770
 You see her as well now as well 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.420
 Fluffy is the consistency and how it feels 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.420
 the dough looks easy 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.750
 I hope you liked the video there 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.790

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.200

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.780

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.310
