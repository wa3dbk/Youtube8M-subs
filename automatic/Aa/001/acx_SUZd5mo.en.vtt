okay<00:00:13.440> now<00:00:13.559> we<00:00:13.620> will<00:00:13.740> look<00:00:13.980> at<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> practical

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
okay now we will look at the practical

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.660 
okay now we will look at the practical
aspect<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.120> placing<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.509> mini<00:00:15.719> implant<00:00:16.080> and

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
aspect of placing a mini implant and

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.970 
aspect of placing a mini implant and
what<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.390> my<00:00:18.600> hand<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.910> handle

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
what I have in my hand is the handle

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.240 
what I have in my hand is the handle
this<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> driver<00:00:23.990> between<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.250> first

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this is a driver between the first

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.790 
this is a driver between the first
second<00:00:27.150> premolar<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> first<00:00:27.900> molar<00:00:28.140> we

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
second premolar and the first molar we

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.669 
second premolar and the first molar we
have<00:00:28.949> selected<00:00:29.789> your<00:00:29.939> sight<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.750> said<00:00:31.080> that

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
have selected your sight so we said that

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.819 
have selected your sight so we said that
we<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.399> said<00:00:32.640> earlier<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.480> all<00:00:34.260> places

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
we have said earlier that for all places

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.150 
we have said earlier that for all places
except<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.180> maxillary<00:00:37.079> buccal<00:00:37.530> alveolus<00:00:37.950> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
except the maxillary buccal alveolus and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.240 
except the maxillary buccal alveolus and
the<00:00:38.700> mandibular<00:00:40.820> bacala<00:00:41.820> Willis<00:00:42.829> we<00:00:43.829> go<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.219> a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the mandibular bacala Willis we go for a

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.869 
the mandibular bacala Willis we go for a
perpendicular<00:00:44.640> insertion<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.520> what<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.700> can

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
perpendicular insertion so what we can

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.819 
perpendicular insertion so what we can
for<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.660> maxillary<00:00:49.110> buckle<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
for the maxillary buckle and the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.770 
for the maxillary buckle and the
mandibular<00:00:50.219> buccal<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:51.120> first<00:00:51.390> go<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.750> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
mandibular buccal you first go for a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.369 
mandibular buccal you first go for a
perpendicular<00:00:52.170> insertion<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
perpendicular insertion and then a

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:08.510 
perpendicular insertion and then a
oblique<00:00:55.379> incision

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.520 

okay<00:01:09.520> we'll<00:01:09.640> just<00:01:09.820> show<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.420> few<00:01:10.510> cases<00:01:11.110> here

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
okay we'll just show a few cases here

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.620 
okay we'll just show a few cases here
and<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:13.240> appliance<00:01:14.140> was<00:01:15.360> fabricated<00:01:16.360> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.650 

buccal<00:01:19.630> tube<00:01:20.590> without<00:01:21.550> any<00:01:21.850> prescription<00:01:22.570> in

buccal tube without any prescription in

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.050 
buccal tube without any prescription in
it<00:01:22.810> it's<00:01:23.620> not<00:01:23.710> an<00:01:23.950> MBT<00:01:24.370> buckle<00:01:24.670> T<00:01:24.790> which<00:01:24.910> in<00:01:25.000> a

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
it it's not an MBT buckle T which in a

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.469 
it it's not an MBT buckle T which in a
choice<00:01:25.300> buckle<00:01:26.340> 202<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.700> buckle<00:01:28.000> tube<00:01:28.180> without

choice buckle 202 to buckle tube without

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.360 
choice buckle 202 to buckle tube without
any<00:01:28.630> prescription<00:01:29.200> in<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.500> was<00:01:29.830> placed<00:01:30.130> and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
any prescription in it was placed and

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.920 
any prescription in it was placed and
the<00:01:30.550> wire<00:01:30.729> bent<00:01:31.110> place<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:34.479> have<00:01:34.720> a

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
the wire bent place so that you have a

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.280 
the wire bent place so that you have a
rectangular<00:01:35.350> wire<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.880> open<00:01:37.270> coil<00:01:38.790> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
rectangular wire and the open coil and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.930 
rectangular wire and the open coil and
then<00:01:41.290> it<00:01:41.440> is<00:01:41.560> being<00:01:41.770> this<00:01:42.190> is<00:01:42.310> being<00:01:42.550> done<00:01:42.790> on<00:01:42.820> a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
then it is being this is being done on a

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.900 
then it is being this is being done on a
rectangular<00:01:43.360> wire<00:01:43.600> in<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.810> rectangular<00:01:44.229> slot

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
rectangular wire in the rectangular slot

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.390 
rectangular wire in the rectangular slot
so<00:01:45.910> you<00:01:45.970> have<00:01:46.240> bodily<00:01:46.630> movement<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.740> mini

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
so you have bodily movement the mini

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.230 
so you have bodily movement the mini
implant<00:01:48.820> is<00:01:49.090> just<00:01:49.450> supporting<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:51.240> first

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
implant is just supporting the first

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.960 
implant is just supporting the first
premolar

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
premolar

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.230 
premolar
and<00:01:55.020> preventing<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.140> from<00:01:56.170> moving<00:01:56.530> anteriorly

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
and preventing it from moving anteriorly

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.080 
and preventing it from moving anteriorly
no<00:01:58.240> posteriors<00:01:58.990> so<00:01:59.920> these<00:02:00.130> are<00:02:00.369> cases<00:02:00.610> I<00:02:00.880> call

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
no posteriors so these are cases I call

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.960 
no posteriors so these are cases I call
orthodontic<00:02:01.720> rejects<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.369> what<00:02:03.580> will<00:02:03.729> you<00:02:03.820> do

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
orthodontic rejects so what will you do

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.420 
orthodontic rejects so what will you do
you<00:02:04.210> have<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:05.020> put<00:02:05.290> some<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.800> want<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.070> go<00:02:06.220> for

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
you have to put some you want to go for

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.430 
you have to put some you want to go for
an<00:02:06.490> extraction<00:02:06.759> correction<00:02:07.300> so<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.110> place<00:02:08.410> a

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
an extraction correction so you place a

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.729 
an extraction correction so you place a
mini<00:02:08.709> implant<00:02:09.040> in<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.340> adventurous<00:02:10.269> area

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
mini implant in the adventurous area

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.690 
mini implant in the adventurous area
tight<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:13.440> premolar<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:15.070> band<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.610> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
tight to the premolar the band on the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.270 
tight to the premolar the band on the
premolar<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.390> then<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.680> go<00:02:17.860> in<00:02:17.980> with<00:02:18.220> your

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
premolar and then you go in with your

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.850 
premolar and then you go in with your
normal<00:02:18.610> treatment
