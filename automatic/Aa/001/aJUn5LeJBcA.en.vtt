00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.890
 aggravating comes 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.890

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.579
 ensures that nothing first a wasp nest 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.980

 Petersen Photoshop 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.470
 and l 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.470
 I want to go under the microscope 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.970
 and looking for answers by always getting in spite of crisis 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.220
 and cope 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.130

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.450
 Soost, I take it now 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.450
 but now it's a tool to send the feeling 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.600
 That's where it all comes down to by simply expressing that respect for countering the idea 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540
 so the most beautiful hits 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.910
 So I have to shoot now but just hurt games out of sight 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.229
 Attack z Sudhoff climbs 0 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.940
 Sat. 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.940
 painters do the same thing 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.500
 Dirt is still very rough 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.690
 I could be up to 08 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.370

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.370
 I have done now 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.600
 Twelve times pretty good 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.330
 do it now rather happens 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.890
 and always 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.890
 and Michael narrow walk 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.820
 Often the beautiful days are personally branded as I mean before you 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.939
 divide 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.430
 It's almost as if looking for a ball that is actually quite easy to get into 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.259
 rave 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.259

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.730
 and forget Mainz Castle 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.009
 Goal of this castle 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:29.809
 around the Altmühl in the east are dead 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:34.049
 and China's young man and it can work during this level 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.569

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:41.239
 and one in Sweden 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.259

 Here it is, that is not a joke 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.379
 and that in me just do it 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.139
 she was appointed 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.139
 Percent Christin Steuer and Plus shot 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:58.989
 and Gomez will make that selection 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.259
 Zierke Munich corner points 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:05.339
 of goals with that Bern so it already in Bernau bigger or smaller 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:06.189
 becomes 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.089
 the one in Zurich the 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:10.339
 big keyboard to hold 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:13.339
 so that's how Kleinschmidt six is ​​laid 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.769
 Of course, you will find animal art here 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.289
 the powerhouse needs to be 32 percent supple 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.339
 and so is not a nice piece of cake 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.289
 and pushes that seemingly normal 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:37.289
 bad Homburg 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.149

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.659
 IPS other that is punishable 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.659
 here also the eye dry 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.289
 and now Munich is generated here 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.719
 with that I react up here to survive says a professional thinks 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.729
 his 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.729

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.829
 Hello, that's not great yet 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.819
 and therefore 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.939
 Importance in lifting 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.860
 they're off on a copy 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.620

 Stops pressed relentlessly 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.599
 and then click on the other sad though are selected from them 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.699
 Achammer right click below to reduce this is shrub 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.509
 and if everything here has to give one another copies 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.409
 Privacy protection off 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.039
 and 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.039
 si the Quartz 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.569
 let's leave to proxy 1 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:14.159
 night clubs 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.800
 I will not go back 8 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.460
 Now I made a mistake Hamlet 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.589
 the fuel will have 32 percent 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:25.759
 SOB Stöß times in about 100 social services 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:30.509
 and Matthias Selz give a stronger even though 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:34.900
 and this place Schmitz on in a minute 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.449
 and now I have Schiele 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.699
 my Tscharnke Hanau 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.480
 who that looks a bit too upset 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.480
 Kanye of Power Plants Pole Vaulter 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.449
 can set to zero then you really see nothing 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.590
 and put on 101 x bit from championship something like that 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.119
 Oh nonsense goes to night itself 

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:00.110
 Chris Meyer turns 80 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.949
 and that's it 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.270
