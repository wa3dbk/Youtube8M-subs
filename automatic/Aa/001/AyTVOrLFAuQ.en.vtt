just<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> show<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:14.549> saris<00:01:14.939> would<00:01:15.119> look

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
just to show you what saris would look

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.179 
just to show you what saris would look
like<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.140> were<00:01:16.259> sitting<00:01:16.290> right<00:01:16.830> next<00:01:17.009> to

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
like if you were sitting right next to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.190 
like if you were sitting right next to
it<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.670> dark<00:01:17.850> side<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.659> darkness<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
it on the dark side in the darkness of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.380 
it on the dark side in the darkness of
space<00:01:19.320> where<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.100> would<00:01:20.250> not<00:01:20.430> hardly<00:01:20.759> see<00:01:21.090> any

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
space where you would not hardly see any

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.200 
space where you would not hardly see any
features<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.110> saris<00:01:22.530> at<00:01:22.710> all<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.220> any<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:24.060> what

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
features of saris at all if any but what

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.399 
features of saris at all if any but what
you<00:01:24.330> would<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:24.750> as<00:01:24.930> you're<00:01:25.080> seeing<00:01:25.259> right

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
you would see as you're seeing right

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.190 
you would see as you're seeing right
here<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.549> bright<00:01:26.970> shining<00:01:27.450> spot<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:28.049> of

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
here is this bright shining spot out of

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.830 
here is this bright shining spot out of
this<00:01:28.350> crater<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.119> when<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.240> zoom<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.630> this

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
this crater and when you zoom in on this

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.749 
this crater and when you zoom in on this
crater<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.259> we're<00:01:31.439> doing<00:01:31.619> right<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.579> can

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
crater as we're doing right now you can

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.450 
crater as we're doing right now you can
see<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:34.350> doesn't<00:01:34.650> look<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.159> it's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
see that this doesn't look like it's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.819 
see that this doesn't look like it's
separate<00:01:36.299> pieces<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:37.020> light<00:01:37.200> shining<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.740> of

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
separate pieces of light shining out of

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.410 
separate pieces of light shining out of
this<00:01:37.979> crater<00:01:38.220> what<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.640> looks<00:01:38.850> like<00:01:39.030> here<00:01:39.329> in

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
this crater what it looks like here in

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
this image published by NASA is when you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.210 
this image published by NASA is when you
zoom<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.869> crater<00:01:43.170> there<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.890> one

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
zoom in on this crater there is one

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.020 
zoom in on this crater there is one
single<00:01:45.030> spot<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.869> light<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.159> all<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
single spot of light and all of the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.749 
single spot of light and all of the
lights<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.960> outside<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.680> looks<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.640> be

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
lights on the outside of it looks to be

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.899 
lights on the outside of it looks to be
reflections<00:01:51.299> off<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:52.220> structures<00:01:53.220> inside<00:01:53.729> of

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
reflections off of structures inside of

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.270 
reflections off of structures inside of
craters<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:55.110> there's<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.829> looks<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.159> if

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
craters so there's so it looks as if

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.719 
craters so there's so it looks as if
there's<00:01:56.460> only<00:01:56.610> one<00:01:57.469> actual<00:01:58.469> source<00:01:58.829> for<00:01:59.579> this

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
there's only one actual source for this

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.639 
there's only one actual source for this
light<00:01:59.969> which<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.869> see<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.259> giant

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
light which you can see the giant

up on saris you can't miss them and of
course<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.640> have<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:39.000> one<00:02:39.210> here<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:40.020> add<00:02:40.170> to

course we have this one here to add to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.160 
course we have this one here to add to
its<00:02:40.860> because<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.610> is<00:02:41.760> very<00:02:42.030> anomalous<00:02:42.300> nASA

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
its because this is very anomalous nASA

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.860 
its because this is very anomalous nASA

the large crater which definitely looks

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.690 
the large crater which definitely looks

directly underneath the surface because

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.010 
directly underneath the surface because
as<00:03:25.710> you<00:03:26.160> can<00:03:26.310> see<00:03:26.520> it's<00:03:26.940> lighting<00:03:27.480> up<00:03:27.600> without

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
as you can see it's lighting up without

structures that are surrounding this

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.840 
structures that are surrounding this
light<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.070> makes<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.370> wonder<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.760> it

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
light so it makes you wonder and it

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.120 
light so it makes you wonder and it
brings<00:03:33.030> into<00:03:33.270> question<00:03:33.300> many<00:03:33.840> things<00:03:34.170> such<00:03:35.100> as

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
brings into question many things such as

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.910 
brings into question many things such as
what<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.090> hell<00:03:36.240> is<00:03:36.390> on<00:03:36.510> Cirrus<00:03:36.960> why<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.590> this

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
what the hell is on Cirrus why is this

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.280 
what the hell is on Cirrus why is this
giant<00:03:38.220> spotlight<00:03:38.820> there<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.390> why<00:03:39.780> can<00:03:39.990> we<00:03:40.110> see

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
giant spotlight there and why can we see

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.320 
giant spotlight there and why can we see
it<00:03:40.380> in<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.590> dark<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:41.040> why<00:03:41.460> hasn't<00:03:41.700> NASA<00:03:42.030> come

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
it in the dark and why hasn't NASA come

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.510 
it in the dark and why hasn't NASA come
out<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.600> just<00:03:42.750> told<00:03:42.930> us<00:03:43.110> what<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.520> because
