00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
ok now you must have a dual layer burner

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.250 
ok now you must have a dual layer burner
by<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.470> way<00:02:19.680> because<00:02:20.040> 360s<00:02:21.030> new<00:02:21.600> layer<00:02:21.840> media

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
by the way because 360s new layer media

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.560 
by the way because 360s new layer media
so<00:02:22.620> yeah<00:02:23.570> now<00:02:24.570> I<00:02:25.730> don't<00:02:26.730> know<00:02:26.910> if<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.150> have<00:02:27.390> to
