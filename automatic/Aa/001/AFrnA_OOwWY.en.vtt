same time you get the full ubuntu
operating<00:00:40.200> system<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.489> don't<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.760> to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
operating system but you don't have to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.020 
operating system but you don't have to
worry<00:00:42.030> about<00:00:42.149> partitioning<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.809> drive<00:00:43.170> and

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
worry about partitioning the drive and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.580 
worry about partitioning the drive and
after<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> partition<00:00:45.780> arm<00:00:47.870> that<00:00:48.870> has<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> boon

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
after the partition arm that has a boon

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.880 
after the partition arm that has a boon
to<00:00:49.770> want<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.039> failed<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.940> mean<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.899> runs<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:52.770> I'm

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
to want it failed I mean it runs but I'm

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.470 
to want it failed I mean it runs but I'm
still<00:00:53.160> getting<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.430> ten<00:00:53.789> second<00:00:54.270> thing

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
still getting that ten second thing

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.470 
still getting that ten second thing
essentially<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.350> i<00:00:55.829> think<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.579> sad<00:00:56.910> said

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
essentially a i think a sad said

essentially a i think a sad said
something<00:00:58.140> about<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> sound<00:00:58.739> library<00:00:59.309> missing

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
something about a sound library missing

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.729 
something about a sound library missing
anyway<00:01:02.160> i'm<00:01:03.140> considering<00:01:04.140> cleaning<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
anyway i'm considering cleaning up the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.440 
anyway i'm considering cleaning up the
system<00:01:04.920> putting<00:01:05.369> vista<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> putting

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
system putting vista on it and putting

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.420 
system putting vista on it and putting
Lubuntu<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.439> an<00:01:07.560> application<00:01:08.130> over<00:01:08.340> the

Lubuntu on as an application over the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.710 
Lubuntu on as an application over the
top<00:01:08.670> um<00:01:10.670> now<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> boon<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.479> booby

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
top um now the boon to the booby

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.170 
top um now the boon to the booby
installer<00:01:13.110> installs<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.680> boon<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.890> as<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
installer installs a boon to as a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.210 
installer installs a boon to as a
completely<00:01:16.080> different<00:01:16.439> operating<00:01:16.830> system

completely different operating system

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.310 
completely different operating system
okay<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.240> two<00:01:18.450> computers<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.049> one

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
okay it's like two computers in one

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.179 
okay it's like two computers in one
without<00:01:20.159> having<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> reformat<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.540> drive<00:01:22.189> so

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
without having to reformat the drive so

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.070 
without having to reformat the drive so
I'm<00:01:23.549> considering<00:01:24.090> doing<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.630> I'm<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
I'm considering doing that I'm going to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.330 
I'm considering doing that I'm going to
need<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> fair<00:01:25.439> amount<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.710> time<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.189> it

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
need a fair amount of time to do it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.560 
need a fair amount of time to do it
though<00:01:26.490> because<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.820> last<00:01:27.000> time<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.360> still

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
though because the last time in still

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.350 
though because the last time in still
installed<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.350> Vista<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.400> was<00:01:29.610> pre<00:01:29.939> service

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
installed a Vista this was pre service

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.410 
installed a Vista this was pre service
pack<00:01:30.570> 1<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.229> took<00:01:31.619> roughly<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.100> three<00:01:32.520> hours

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.440

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
direct me to an open-source partitioner

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.760 
direct me to an open-source partitioner
for<00:01:46.770> windows<00:01:47.840> so<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.869> i<00:01:49.020> could<00:01:49.079> uninstall

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
for windows so that i could uninstall

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.609 
for windows so that i could uninstall
the<00:01:50.250> partition<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:52.890> ubuntu<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.290> possibly<00:01:55.290> run

the partition of ubuntu and possibly run

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.200 
the partition of ubuntu and possibly run

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
five gigs of disk space I'm a little bit

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.260 
five gigs of disk space I'm a little bit
nervous<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.890> purchase<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.490> petitioner<00:02:06.000> because

nervous to purchase a petitioner because

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.130 
nervous to purchase a petitioner because
I've<00:02:06.390> never<00:02:06.420> really<00:02:06.960> used<00:02:07.200> one<00:02:07.469> before<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:09.140> I

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
I've never really used one before and I

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.350 
I've never really used one before and I
think

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
think

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.230 
think
the<00:02:12.020> computer<00:02:12.530> has<00:02:12.560> assigned<00:02:13.300> SD<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.410> 32<00:02:15.410> ubuntu

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
the computer has assigned SD a 32 ubuntu

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.200 
the computer has assigned SD a 32 ubuntu
but<00:02:17.240> I'd<00:02:17.330> want<00:02:17.570> to<00:02:17.660> double<00:02:17.900> check<00:02:17.930> on<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.350> um

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
but I'd want to double check on that um

but I'd want to double check on that um
I'm<00:02:20.210> new<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.930> whole<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.230> mean<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:21.830> knew<00:02:22.520> how

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
I'm new to the whole I mean I knew how

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.800 
I'm new to the whole I mean I knew how
to<00:02:22.760> go<00:02:22.970> in<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.210> create<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.720> partition<00:02:24.320> um

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
to go in and create the partition um

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.050 
to go in and create the partition um
ubuntu<00:02:26.810> was<00:02:26.990> very<00:02:27.200> friendly<00:02:27.470> with<00:02:27.830> that<00:02:28.070> but

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
ubuntu was very friendly with that but
