00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.700 
goals is incredible but you have to take
this<00:00:16.590> out<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.340> mine<00:00:18.090> now<00:00:18.270> because<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.690> have<00:00:18.840> game

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
this out of mine now because I have game

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.529 
this out of mine now because I have game
against<00:00:20.070> westboro<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.060> folks<00:00:21.330> on

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
against westboro and you have folks on

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.269 
against westboro and you have folks on
that<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.900> think<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.619> did<00:00:22.740> right<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.010> think

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
that I think you did right I think

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.120 
that I think you did right I think
there's<00:00:23.430> many<00:00:23.550> positives<00:00:24.090> from<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> game<00:00:24.570> so

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
there's many positives from the game so

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.220 
there's many positives from the game so
it's<00:00:26.130> just<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.519> matter<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:27.390> focusing<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.140> what

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
it's just a matter of focusing and what

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.900 
it's just a matter of focusing and what
we<00:00:28.320> did<00:00:28.470> well<00:00:28.650> obviously<00:00:29.220> addressing<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
we did well obviously addressing the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.820 
we did well obviously addressing the
things<00:00:30.170> trying<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.289> address<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.590> things<00:00:31.710> we

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
things trying to address the things we

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.880 
things trying to address the things we
didn't<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.880> well<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:34.050> am<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.469> think<00:00:34.770> in

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
didn't do do so well what am I think in

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.799 
didn't do do so well what am I think in
terms<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.309> performance<00:00:35.460> especially<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
terms of performance especially the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.020 
terms of performance especially the
first<00:00:37.020> 30<00:00:37.230> minutes<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:38.550> know<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:38.879> good

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
first 30 minutes you know it's as good

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.119 
first 30 minutes you know it's as good
as<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.270> could<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.510> hoped<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:40.070> against<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
as we could have hoped for against the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.030 
as we could have hoped for against the
good<00:00:41.219> side<00:00:41.629> I<00:00:42.629> think<00:00:43.410> that's<00:00:43.530> true<00:00:43.710> from<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
good side I think that's true from the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.970 
good side I think that's true from the
last<00:00:44.219> two<00:00:44.520> or<00:00:44.550> three<00:00:44.700> performances<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:46.800> last

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
last two or three performances the last

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.619 
last two or three performances the last
four<00:00:47.160> performance<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.730> even<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.120> know<00:00:48.239> ever

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
four performance is even you know ever

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.270 
four performance is even you know ever
turn<00:00:48.840> away<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.200> sort<00:00:49.440> them<00:00:49.530> away<00:00:49.770> follow<00:00:50.100> Matt

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
turn away and sort them away follow Matt

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.700 
turn away and sort them away follow Matt
home<00:00:50.570> we've<00:00:51.570> only<00:00:51.719> got<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.350> win<00:00:52.590> from

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
home we've only got like one win from

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.250 
home we've only got like one win from
those<00:00:52.920> four<00:00:53.160> games<00:00:53.420> but<00:00:54.420> performance<00:00:54.930> wise<00:00:55.079> we

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
those four games but performance wise we

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.049 
those four games but performance wise we
probably<00:00:55.469> deserved<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.129> little<00:00:56.219> bit<00:00:56.460> more<00:00:56.640> so

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
probably deserved a little bit more so

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.330 
probably deserved a little bit more so
not<00:00:57.629> lots<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.960> positives<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> go<00:00:58.530> forward<00:00:58.920> yeah

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
not lots of positives to go forward yeah

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
this game tomorrow I think the other

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.240 
this game tomorrow I think the other
point<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.930> made<00:03:07.110> about<00:03:07.290> playing<00:03:07.770> against

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
point you made about playing against

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.610 
point you made about playing against
teams<00:03:08.580> so<00:03:09.090> called<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.840> lesser<00:03:10.080> teams<00:03:10.380> in<00:03:10.530> the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
teams so called the lesser teams in the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.920 
teams so called the lesser teams in the
Premiership<00:03:11.330> we've<00:03:12.330> done<00:03:12.480> reasonably<00:03:12.840> well

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
Premiership we've done reasonably well

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.449 
Premiership we've done reasonably well
in<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.260> two<00:03:13.410> games<00:03:13.620> we've<00:03:13.800> right<00:03:14.340> they've

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
in the two games we've right they've

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.970 
in the two games we've right they've
been<00:03:14.580> at<00:03:14.670> home<00:03:14.850> but<00:03:15.450> we<00:03:15.570> beat<00:03:15.780> knowledge<00:03:16.140> we

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
been at home but we beat knowledge we

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.190 
been at home but we beat knowledge we
beat<00:03:17.190> Fulham<00:03:17.580> so<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.690> gives<00:03:18.840> us<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.989> little

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
beat Fulham so that gives us a little

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.780 
beat Fulham so that gives us a little
bit<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.530> impetus<00:03:19.920> going<00:03:20.160> into<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.430> game<00:03:20.519> in

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
bit of impetus going into this game in

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.229 
bit of impetus going into this game in
that<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:21.000> can<00:03:21.239> beat<00:03:21.570> those<00:03:21.750> in<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.110> around<00:03:22.320> us

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
that we can beat those in and around us

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.300 
that we can beat those in and around us
so<00:03:24.239> as<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.450> say<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.900> keep<00:03:25.350> repeating<00:03:25.500> mr.<00:03:25.860> it's

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
so as I say I keep repeating mr. it's

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.740 
so as I say I keep repeating mr. it's
about<00:03:26.489> treating<00:03:26.880> each<00:03:27.090> game<00:03:27.300> as<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:27.540> comes

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
about treating each game as it comes

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.930 
about treating each game as it comes
it's<00:03:27.930> about<00:03:28.140> having<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.440> focus<00:03:28.650> tomorrow<00:03:29.040> go<00:03:29.820> in

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
it's about having a focus tomorrow go in

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.970 
it's about having a focus tomorrow go in
there<00:03:30.150> in<00:03:30.360> there<00:03:30.570> having<00:03:30.750> some<00:03:31.019> belief<00:03:31.260> that

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
there in there having some belief that
