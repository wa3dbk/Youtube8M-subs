important<00:02:28.120> basic<00:02:28.240> in<00:02:28.720> hardstyle<00:02:29.260> shuffling

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
important basic in hardstyle shuffling

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.610 
important basic in hardstyle shuffling
is<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.790> running<00:02:31.090> man<00:02:31.240> yes<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.290> thing<00:02:32.440> that

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
is the running man yes the thing that

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.990 
is the running man yes the thing that
makes<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:32.920> look<00:02:33.130> like<00:02:33.340> you're<00:02:33.820> gliding

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
makes you look like you're gliding

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000 
makes you look like you're gliding
across<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.570> floor<00:02:34.810> when<00:02:35.290> you're<00:02:35.530> really<00:02:35.800> nine

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
across the floor when you're really nine

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.660 
across the floor when you're really nine
and<00:02:36.340> it's<00:02:36.730> all<00:02:36.880> illusion<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.630> yeah<00:02:38.560> but<00:02:39.520> I

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
and it's all illusion and yeah but I

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.730 
and it's all illusion and yeah but I
want<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:39.970> take<00:02:40.120> this<00:02:40.240> time<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.570> implant<00:02:41.470> this

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
want to take this time to implant this

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.650 
want to take this time to implant this
into<00:02:42.160> your<00:02:42.280> head<00:02:42.490> because<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:43.030> lot<00:02:43.240> of<00:02:43.360> people

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
into your head because a lot of people

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.040 
into your head because a lot of people
think<00:02:43.960> this<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.650> serious<00:02:45.130> matter<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:46.050> it's

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
think this is a serious matter and it's

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.900 
think this is a serious matter and it's
not<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.650> make<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.980> running<00:02:48.160> man<00:02:48.400> look<00:02:48.700> like

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
not to make the running man look like

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.330 
not to make the running man look like
you're<00:02:49.090> gliding<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:50.140> does<00:02:50.320> not<00:02:50.560> require<00:02:51.040> you

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
you're gliding it does not require you

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.630 
you're gliding it does not require you
having<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:52.420> know<00:02:52.570> super<00:02:53.470> light<00:02:53.620> shoes<00:02:53.920> the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
having you know super light shoes the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.910 
having you know super light shoes the
ground<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.480> surface<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:56.230> you're<00:02:56.380> on<00:02:56.560> does

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
ground the surface that you're on does

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.130 
ground the surface that you're on does
not<00:02:56.950> matter<00:02:57.460> it's<00:02:58.090> just<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.510> technique<00:02:58.960> and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
not matter it's just the technique and

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.290
