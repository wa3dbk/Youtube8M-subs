00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
there's all liquid crankbaits that sort

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.090 
there's all liquid crankbaits that sort
of<00:01:13.960> thing<00:01:14.140> we've<00:01:14.290> just<00:01:14.470> got<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.620> contouring

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
of thing we've just got a contouring

there<00:01:16.900> along<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:17.680> edge<00:01:17.950> there<00:01:18.220> so<00:01:18.280> we're<00:01:18.550> just

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
there along the edge there so we're just

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.850 
there along the edge there so we're just
going<00:01:18.790> to<00:01:18.850> hop<00:01:18.970> it<00:01:19.150> down<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.510> bank<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:20.770> a

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
going to hop it down the bank just a

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.470 
going to hop it down the bank just a
little<00:01:21.070> series<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.520> hops<00:01:21.820> nothing<00:01:22.240> too

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480
