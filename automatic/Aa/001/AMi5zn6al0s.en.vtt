Ranger<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.210> danger<00:00:30.510> Ranger<00:00:30.830> so<00:00:31.830> next<00:00:32.340> up<00:00:34.730> I

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.770 

got<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.870> prediction<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:47.149> as<00:00:48.149> long<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
got a prediction here as long as the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.299 
got a prediction here as long as the
fuel<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.350> up<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> carb<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:52.129> think<00:00:53.129> this

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
fuel is up to the carb I think this

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.729 
fuel is up to the carb I think this
one's<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.760> fire<00:00:54.000> right<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:57.469> also<00:00:58.469> have

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
one's going to fire right up I also have

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.080 
one's going to fire right up I also have
another<00:00:58.949> prediction<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.030> be

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
another prediction it's going to be

00:01:00.090 --> 00:03:43.770 
another prediction it's going to be
smoky<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.690> hell

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:04:02.190 

oh<00:03:57.959> good<00:03:58.959> enough<00:03:59.230> good<00:04:00.190> enough<00:04:00.360> I<00:04:01.360> got<00:04:01.959> two

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
oh good enough good enough I got two

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.750 
oh good enough good enough I got two
year<00:04:02.440> old<00:04:02.620> gasps<00:04:02.890> and<00:04:03.220> there's<00:04:03.340> only<00:04:03.459> probably

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
year old gasps and there's only probably

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.190 
year old gasps and there's only probably
a<00:04:03.940> gallon<00:04:04.330> or<00:04:04.390> two<00:04:04.569> in<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.780> bottom<00:04:05.050> of<00:04:05.140> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
a gallon or two in the bottom of the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.630 
a gallon or two in the bottom of the
tank<00:04:05.380> so<00:04:05.620> I'm<00:04:05.680> not<00:04:05.830> going<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.100> push<00:04:06.250> this<00:04:06.430> one

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
tank so I'm not going to push this one

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.360 
tank so I'm not going to push this one
too<00:04:06.819> hard<00:04:07.050> Intel<00:04:08.050> once<00:04:08.380> again<00:04:08.650> this<00:04:09.069> summer

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
too hard Intel once again this summer

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.540 
too hard Intel once again this summer
and<00:04:10.020> I<00:04:11.020> think<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.560> found<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.890> motor<00:04:12.069> for<00:04:12.430> it

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
and I think I found the motor for it

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.420 
and I think I found the motor for it
since<00:04:13.300> this<00:04:13.510> one<00:04:13.750> is<00:04:13.959> just<00:04:14.410> tired<00:04:15.010> as<00:04:15.280> all

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
since this one is just tired as all

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.009 
since this one is just tired as all
get-out<00:04:15.700> but<00:04:18.030> that'll<00:04:19.030> happen<00:04:19.180> at<00:04:19.630> a<00:04:19.780> later

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
get-out but that'll happen at a later

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:32.189 
get-out but that'll happen at a later
date

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.210 

breaking<00:04:32.949> the<00:04:33.100> law<00:04:33.280> breaking<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:34.090> law
