00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:05.468
 As other Zeon fighters are excellent, there isn't much that comes into play. 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.300
 It's not a charge organization, so I'll go get C. 

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:36.998
 I am wary of the right enemy reaction. 

00:00:39.568 --> 00:00:43.568
 Having checked the sniper, I will approach the wall. 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.990
 I left it to return because I pulled it. 

00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:56.423
 I'm going to stop because Blue on the warehouse is rampaging. 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.079
 It is hard to aim at the enemy who does not look at the back at all. 

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:06.333
 We will place in the left and right movement range. 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.820
 The only hand left for the enemy is emergency avoidance. Aim for the destination from a look. 

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:29.792
 I saw a mass-produced gun cannon, so I went to the aim. 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:44.889
 I was surprised to see this. The reserved rod is for combos. 

00:01:48.786 --> 00:01:52.786
 Rub the jump with a barrage with a barrage. 

00:01:58.424 --> 00:02:02.424
 For now, we left. 

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:09.225
 You've been following one machine. I will take the distance while using the terrain. 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.739
 It looks like a striker. Since allies also came, I try not to be destroyed. 

00:02:24.692 --> 00:02:28.692
 I was going to get around from this side and aim for a surprise attack. I was aware of the enemy behind the radar range, but gave priority to movement. It is a little judgment mistake. 

00:02:29.697 --> 00:02:33.697
 Luckily, the enemy BR on the back is out of luck, so I attack the enemy just before. 

00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:49.878
 Repair E and save E. 

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:21.896
 I will wait for a respawn because three of my allies have fallen. 

00:03:26.363 --> 00:03:30.363
 There is no enemy nearby, so repair it again. 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:42.369
 It is determined that repair will be continued until the ally's HP decreases. 

00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:55.926
 You are going to siege here. I will run away with my full power. 

00:03:59.793 --> 00:04:03.793
 Cancel the boost's rigidity in lower ranks, shift the position to earn distance, and slightly increase the avoidance rate. 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.209
 It is dangerous because allies boil to E. I will go for support. 

00:04:18.644 --> 00:04:22.644
 Intercept the striker who has climbed this thing. 

00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:30.121
 Surprise the enemy who is targeting E's ally. 

00:04:31.574 --> 00:04:35.574
 If you shoot at the fastest on the Fighting&gt; Reserved rod, it will be decided except emergency evasion and tackle. 

00:04:43.928 --> 00:04:47.928
 I'm going to chase after the previous striker is surrounded by my friends. 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.800
 Since the nearby enemy was annihilated, I am looking into the distance. 

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:01.547
 It is judged impossible because the third support is too far. I'll repair it for the next time. 

00:05:14.938 --> 00:05:18.938
 It was good to go because the base was close, but I give priority to the return time. 

00:05:33.593 --> 00:05:37.593
 Visualize mass-produced gun cannons. It wraps around. 

00:05:42.825 --> 00:05:46.825
 It wraps around via C from this side. 

00:05:57.325 --> 00:06:01.325
 I jumped to a building near the base, so I am surprised from here. 

00:06:21.693 --> 00:06:25.693
 It is an advantage that the heat rod can be aimed even if there is a step. It is usable in such a situation. 

00:06:26.263 --> 00:06:30.263
 It was a situation where it was possible to reduce if I cut with Gatling, but because I did not want to stop the legs so much, I made a compromise with N-class. 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.420
 I planned to get up and wait again. 

00:06:43.422 --> 00:06:47.422
 I tried to delay too much to try again and I was interrupted by the tackle. Failure (; w 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.730
 Because it is a millimeter, it is processed by gatling. 

00:07:07.164 --> 00:07:11.164
 I will repair a little. Even in this short time, you can recover equivalent to Enhanced Frame 5 (1200). 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:28.139
 I saw a decreasing blue, so let's check with Gatling. 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.580
 Because there was an enemy that came out on the back, to intercept. 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.210
 Jump rubbed because it is dangerous to be bombarded. 

00:07:51.364 --> 00:07:54.364
 We aim at mass production type cancer cannon which has been respawn. I was planning to leave it for a second grade. 

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:59.469
 Fighting Cancel Extend the dash, change the position, and cut other enemy lines. 

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:06.099
 I think it is important not to aim at Gatling in the middle distance and no darkness, and to devote to surprise as well as an ordinary fighting machine.
