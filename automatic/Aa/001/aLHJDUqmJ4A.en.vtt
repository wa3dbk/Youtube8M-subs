egg comes out up it goes into the paint
area<00:01:19.640> now<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:20.909> doing<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.840> novel<00:01:22.530> so

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
area now I'm doing this in the novel so

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.690 
area now I'm doing this in the novel so
you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.490> see<00:01:23.850> watch<00:01:24.750> carefully

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:36.070 

wanna<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.810> egg<00:01:30.020> was<00:01:30.320> painted<00:01:34.540> now<00:01:35.540> I<00:01:35.570> push

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
wanna the egg was painted now I push

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.700 
wanna the egg was painted now I push
this

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
this

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.150 
this
the<00:01:37.370> egg<00:01:37.610> falls<00:01:38.030> into<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.780> chest<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:43.100> is

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
the egg falls into the chest this is

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.020 
the egg falls into the chest this is
where<00:01:43.730> all<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.450> Easter<00:01:44.960> eggs<00:01:44.990> are<00:01:45.440> kept<00:01:46.030> so

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
where all the Easter eggs are kept so

00:01:47.030 --> 00:02:36.050 
where all the Easter eggs are kept so
let's<00:01:47.420> try<00:01:47.750> again

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.570 

so<00:02:37.060> let's<00:02:37.450> look<00:02:37.780> at<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.140> redstone<00:02:38.800> there's

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
so let's look at the redstone there's

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.450 
so let's look at the redstone there's
lots<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.180> different<00:02:40.780> combinations<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.830> so

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
lots of different combinations and so

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.780 
lots of different combinations and so
this<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.120> quite<00:02:43.450> complex<00:02:44.160> first<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.370> all<00:02:45.550> it

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
this is quite complex first of all it

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.770 
this is quite complex first of all it
sorts<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.540> colors<00:02:46.990> of<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.950> dye<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:49.270> for

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
sorts the colors of the dye so for

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.430 
sorts the colors of the dye so for
example<00:02:50.560> if<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:51.100> put<00:02:51.400> blue<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.270> green<00:02:52.720> in<00:02:52.750> you

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
example if I put blue and green in you

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.220 
example if I put blue and green in you
can<00:02:53.710> see<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.400> redstone<00:02:54.910> block<00:02:55.270> is<00:02:55.660> down

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
can see that the redstone block is down

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.660 
can see that the redstone block is down
on<00:02:56.680> green<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.610> blue<00:02:57.850> line<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.980> checks<00:03:00.430> all

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
on green and blue line this checks all

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.710 
on green and blue line this checks all
the<00:03:00.730> different<00:03:01.510> combinations<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:03.420> works<00:03:04.420> out

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
the different combinations and works out

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.860 
the different combinations and works out
which<00:03:05.140> eggs<00:03:05.500> are<00:03:05.740> possible<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:07.180> guys<00:03:07.420> have<00:03:07.810> a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
which eggs are possible so guys have a
