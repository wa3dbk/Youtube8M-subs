another High Definition broadcast I just
wanted<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.120> show<00:00:03.270> you<00:00:03.300> guys<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:03.840> multiple

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
wanted to show you guys this multiple

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.619 
wanted to show you guys this multiple
targeting<00:00:05.040> video<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.460> that<00:00:06.299> means<00:00:06.450> that's

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
targeting video and that means that's

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.179 
targeting video and that means that's
going<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.930> be<00:00:06.990> multiple<00:00:07.290> targets<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.710> I'm

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
going to be multiple targets and I'm

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.400 
going to be multiple targets and I'm
using<00:00:08.400> an<00:00:08.550> AoE<00:00:08.849> attack<00:00:09.090> why<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.050> might<00:00:10.380> ask

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
using an AoE attack why you might ask

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.650 
using an AoE attack why you might ask
because<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.340> targeting<00:00:11.820> system<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.509> in

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
because the targeting system that is in

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.340 
because the targeting system that is in
diablo<00:00:13.049> 3<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.559> using<00:00:14.519> huge<00:00:14.790> messes<00:00:15.059> messes<00:00:15.960> and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
diablo 3 is using huge messes messes and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.310 
diablo 3 is using huge messes messes and
is<00:00:16.680> uh<00:00:17.210> it's<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.300> little<00:00:18.510> bit<00:00:18.600> too<00:00:18.930> sticky<00:00:19.199> for

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
is uh it's a little bit too sticky for

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.019 
is uh it's a little bit too sticky for
me<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.890> meaning<00:00:20.100> there<00:00:20.400> they're<00:00:20.699> following

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
me the meaning there they're following

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.900 
me the meaning there they're following
the<00:00:21.150> units<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.779> little<00:00:21.960> bit<00:00:22.050> too<00:00:22.140> much<00:00:22.320> and

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
the units a little bit too much and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.060 
the units a little bit too much and
compensating<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.090> users<00:00:24.890> inability<00:00:25.890> to

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
compensating for the users inability to

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.419 
compensating for the users inability to
target<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.670> little<00:00:27.060> bit<00:00:27.150> too<00:00:27.240> much<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.470> think

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
target a little bit too much so I think

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.950 
target a little bit too much so I think
it's<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.640> little<00:00:29.730> bit<00:00:29.880> geared<00:00:30.179> towards<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.630> new

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
it's a little bit geared towards the new

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.600 
it's a little bit geared towards the new
players<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.590> don't<00:00:31.679> really<00:00:31.920> know<00:00:32.040> what

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
players that don't really know what

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.310 
players that don't really know what
they're<00:00:32.759> doing<00:00:33.090> when<00:00:33.750> they're<00:00:33.870> targeting

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
they're doing when they're targeting

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.139 
they're doing when they're targeting
their<00:00:34.890> units<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.510> I<00:00:36.510> feel<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.739> should<00:00:37.920> be

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
their units and I feel like it should be

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.240 
their units and I feel like it should be
more<00:00:39.149> geared<00:00:39.600> towards<00:00:40.050> players<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.710> can

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
more geared towards players that can

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.650 
more geared towards players that can
actually<00:00:41.430> target<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.000> units<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.420> don't<00:00:42.570> know

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
actually target the units I don't know

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.040 
actually target the units I don't know
you<00:00:43.469> guys<00:00:43.620> tell<00:00:43.890> me<00:00:43.920> what<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.280> think<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:45.510> think

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
you guys tell me what you think I think

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.660 
you guys tell me what you think I think
it's<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.440> little<00:00:46.680> bit<00:00:46.800> ridiculous<00:00:47.190> that

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it's just a little bit ridiculous that

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.049 
it's just a little bit ridiculous that
you<00:00:48.300> know<00:00:48.750> people<00:00:48.989> are<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.829> targeting<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
you know people are just targeting the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.170 
you know people are just targeting the
units<00:00:51.360> without<00:00:51.539> even<00:00:51.960> trying<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:53.699> just

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
units without even trying and it's just

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.430 
units without even trying and it's just
if<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.539> got<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.719> got<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:54.989> accurate<00:00:55.110> when

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
if you got you got to be accurate when

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.569 
if you got you got to be accurate when
you<00:00:55.530> want<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> target<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.190> know<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.460> like

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
you want to target you know it's like

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.580 
you want to target you know it's like
shooting<00:00:56.730> good<00:00:57.059> if<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.629> want<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.109> accurate

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
shooting good if you want to be accurate

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.860 
shooting good if you want to be accurate
you're<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> kill<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> person<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.719> if

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
you're going to kill the person and if

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.660 
you're going to kill the person and if

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
you suck at shooting a gun then you're

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.310 
you suck at shooting a gun then you're
not<00:01:02.730> going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> calibrate<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:04.400> we<00:01:05.400> go<00:01:05.519> guys<00:01:05.670> um

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
not going to calibrate so we go guys um

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.950 
i'm going to show you exactly how
inaccurate<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.000> be<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.450> still<00:01:09.689> target

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
inaccurate you can be and still target

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.640 
inaccurate you can be and still target
the<00:01:10.020> person<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.479> here<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.570> are<00:01:12.659> guys<00:01:12.840> alright

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
the person so here we are guys alright

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.130 
the person so here we are guys alright
so<00:01:14.130> right<00:01:14.430> there<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.090> killed<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.509> bunch<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.810> units

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
so right there I killed a bunch of units

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.320 
so right there I killed a bunch of units
but<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.439> was<00:01:16.650> targeting<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> bottom<00:01:18.060> left

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
but I was targeting to the bottom left

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.179 
but I was targeting to the bottom left
and<00:01:18.600> why<00:01:19.140> did<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.409> kill<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> bunch<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.890> units

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
and why did I kill a bunch of units

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.330 
and why did I kill a bunch of units
because<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.150> mesh<00:01:21.390> was<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.780> large<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.340> it

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
because the mesh was so large it it

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.820 
because the mesh was so large it it
actually<00:01:23.700> targeted<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> person's<00:01:24.960> dead

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
mask in no it didn't go into the center

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.589 
mask in no it didn't go into the center
of<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.709> mass<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.129> went<00:02:41.280> for<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.609> unit<00:02:42.030> that

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
of the mass it went for the unit that

was in the front that might stinky
targeting<00:02:44.639> targeted<00:02:45.269> instead<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:47.010> here<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.250> is

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340

again center of the mass no it went for

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.069 
again center of the mass no it went for
this<00:02:52.409> target<00:02:52.950> this<00:02:53.489> guy<00:02:54.090> right<00:02:54.420> here<00:02:54.480> that

so<00:03:36.599> yeah<00:03:36.900> there<00:03:37.500> needs<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.799> be<00:03:37.909> some<00:03:38.909> kind<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.299> a

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
so yeah there needs to be some kind of a

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.969 
so yeah there needs to be some kind of a
option<00:03:39.840> where<00:03:40.229> you<00:03:40.260> can<00:03:40.319> turn<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.560> sticky

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
option where you can turn that sticky

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.129 
option where you can turn that sticky
targeting<00:03:41.340> off<00:03:41.489> because<00:03:42.209> check<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:42.989> out

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
targeting off because check this out

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.839 
targeting off because check this out
guys<00:03:43.169> one<00:03:43.680> more<00:03:43.769> time<00:03:43.979> if<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.519> want<00:03:44.729> to<00:03:44.790> go

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
guys one more time if I want to go

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.819 
guys one more time if I want to go
center<00:03:45.120> mass<00:03:45.299> that<00:03:46.079> didn't<00:03:46.290> go<00:03:46.379> center<00:03:46.680> mass

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
center mass that didn't go center mass

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.520 
center mass that didn't go center mass
that<00:03:47.489> went<00:03:47.729> for<00:03:47.909> this<00:03:48.150> specific<00:03:48.959> skeleton

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
that went for this specific skeleton

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.689 
that went for this specific skeleton
that<00:03:49.620> I'm<00:03:49.739> highlight<00:03:50.010> over<00:03:50.159> right<00:03:50.340> here<00:03:50.519> and

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
that I'm highlight over right here and

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:55.250 
that I'm highlight over right here and
it<00:03:51.299> missed<00:03:51.989> him<00:03:52.139> even<00:03:52.489> so<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.639> need<00:03:53.879> to<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.260> you

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
it missed him even so you need to be you

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.050 
it missed him even so you need to be you
need<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.530> be<00:03:55.680> very<00:03:56.129> careful<00:03:56.549> when<00:03:56.940> you're

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
need to be very careful when you're

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.960 
need to be very careful when you're
placing<00:03:57.299> your<00:03:57.659> AO<00:03:57.840> ease<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.319> go<00:03:59.129> for<00:03:59.400> because

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
placing your AO ease and go for because

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.729 
placing your AO ease and go for because
it's<00:04:00.120> going<00:04:00.239> to<00:04:00.299> be<00:04:00.359> so<00:04:00.479> hard<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.720> target<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:01.650> a

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
it's going to be so hard to target in a

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.879 
it's going to be so hard to target in a
center<00:04:01.979> mast<00:04:02.190> go<00:04:02.699> for<00:04:02.989> an<00:04:03.989> enemy<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.349> is<00:04:04.530> in

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
center mast go for an enemy that is in

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.089 
center mast go for an enemy that is in
close<00:04:05.900> proximity<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.199> center<00:04:07.409> mass<00:04:07.590> like

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
close proximity to the center mass like

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.339 
close proximity to the center mass like
say<00:04:08.159> if<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.060> wanted<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:09.359> target<00:04:09.720> center<00:04:10.109> mass

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
say if I wanted to target center mass

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.289 
say if I wanted to target center mass
here<00:04:10.739> I<00:04:10.859> would<00:04:11.220> probably<00:04:11.340> go<00:04:11.609> for<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:11.879> guy<00:04:12.180> in

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
here I would probably go for the guy in

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.400 
here I would probably go for the guy in
the<00:04:12.359> middle

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
the middle

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.610 
the middle
and<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.770> would<00:04:13.920> go<00:04:14.040> in<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.730> center<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.180> way

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
and it would go in the center that way

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.960 
and it would go in the center that way
the<00:04:16.620> guy<00:04:16.769> in<00:04:16.920> the<00:04:17.010> front<00:04:17.220> middle<00:04:17.459> front<00:04:17.790> middle

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
the guy in the front middle front middle

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.030 
the guy in the front middle front middle
like<00:04:18.480> if<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:18.840> wanted<00:04:19.050> to<00:04:19.140> target<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.739> center<00:04:20.010> of

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
like if I wanted to target the center of

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.560 
like if I wanted to target the center of
this<00:04:20.190> mess<00:04:20.430> right<00:04:20.610> here<00:04:20.670> I<00:04:21.000> probably<00:04:21.390> go<00:04:21.450> for

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
this mess right here I probably go for

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.760 
this mess right here I probably go for
this<00:04:21.690> guy<00:04:22.400> let's<00:04:23.400> do<00:04:23.520> it<00:04:23.550> i'm<00:04:23.640> saying<00:04:23.850> guys<00:04:24.770> so

this guy let's do it i'm saying guys so
it's<00:04:26.730> going<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:26.970> be<00:04:27.030> really<00:04:27.210> hard<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.510> target

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
it's going to be really hard to target

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.800 
it's going to be really hard to target
like<00:04:27.990> center<00:04:28.290> mass<00:04:28.470> with<00:04:28.950> AOE<00:04:29.280> targets<00:04:29.730> with<00:04:30.720> i

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
like center mass with AOE targets with i

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.720 
like center mass with AOE targets with i
always<00:04:31.140> skills<00:04:31.410> guys<00:04:31.650> this<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.370> what<00:04:32.520> i'm

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
you guys the sticky to targeting system

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.730 
you guys the sticky to targeting system
a<00:04:37.860> little<00:04:37.920> bit<00:04:38.430> failing<00:04:38.850> for<00:04:39.120> me<00:04:39.270> right<00:04:39.510> now

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
a little bit failing for me right now

a little bit failing for me right now
and<00:04:40.740> it's<00:04:41.400> going<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.700> be<00:04:42.000> very<00:04:42.030> hard<00:04:42.420> to<00:04:42.480> target

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
and it's going to be very hard to target

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.600 
and it's going to be very hard to target
like<00:04:42.960> a<00:04:42.990> center<00:04:43.290> see<00:04:43.560> that<00:04:43.740> i<00:04:43.920> was<00:04:44.280> off<00:04:44.430> to<00:04:44.580> the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
like a center see that i was off to the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.460 
like a center see that i was off to the
right<00:04:44.910> side<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.450> it<00:04:45.600> went<00:04:45.780> for<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.080> skeleton

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
right side and it went for the skeleton

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.200 
right side and it went for the skeleton
in<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.950> middle<00:04:47.220> because<00:04:47.490> i<00:04:47.700> was<00:04:47.820> highlighted

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
in the middle because i was highlighted

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.030 
in the middle because i was highlighted
over<00:04:48.330> him<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:48.660> where<00:04:49.290> did<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:49.470> go<00:04:49.590> for<00:04:49.830> in<00:04:49.920> the

over him and where did it go for in the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.680 
over him and where did it go for in the
skeleton<00:04:50.400> in<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.790> very<00:04:51.000> center<00:04:51.450> of<00:04:51.480> that

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
skeleton in the very center of that
