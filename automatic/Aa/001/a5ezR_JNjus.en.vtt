00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.849 
straight sets I was a tough match and in
Malachi<00:01:51.259> think<00:01:51.609> just<00:01:52.609> once<00:01:52.819> but<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.689> long<00:01:54.649> time

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
Malachi think just once but a long time

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.309 
Malachi think just once but a long time
ago<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.600> there<00:01:56.600> are<00:01:56.659> completely<00:01:57.079> different

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
ago so there are completely different

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.630 
ago so there are completely different
players<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:59.950> what<00:02:00.950> if<00:02:01.069> I'm<00:02:01.219> playing<00:02:01.399> Nick
