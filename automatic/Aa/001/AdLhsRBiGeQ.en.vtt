of fact I think it's probably doing the
same<00:01:17.610> thing<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:17.909> let<00:01:18.030> me<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:18.270> through<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
same thing so let me going through a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.539 
same thing so let me going through a
kind<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.200> real<00:01:19.590> time<00:01:19.890> what<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
kind of just real time what you

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.149 
kind of just real time what you
basically<00:01:20.909> oh<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:22.110> see<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.650> kind<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.950> weird

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
basically oh you see it's kind of weird

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.469

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
for some reason but let me see if it'll

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.530 
for some reason but let me see if it'll
install<00:01:28.829> cuz<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.189> tried<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.640> do<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> quick

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
install cuz I tried to do it a quick

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
install cuz I tried to do it a quick
install<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.170> then<00:01:31.290> it'll<00:01:31.470> bring<00:01:31.619> me<00:01:31.740> back<00:01:31.920> ok

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
install and then it'll bring me back ok

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.569 
install and then it'll bring me back ok
so<00:01:32.549> it'll<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.720> me<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.740> some<00:01:35.310> what<00:01:35.490> it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
so it'll do that for me and some what it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.510 
so it'll do that for me and some what it
