00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.460
 good today I'm a place that 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.250
 explain how to tame this 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:13.090
 mascot this mascot is called tooth 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.040
 blood or in English bluetooth is a 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.869
 normal turtle can not be tamed 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.119
 any kind of hunter but it 's from 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.279
 unique look for the skills that 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.869
 have the turtles is the shield of 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.390
 shell that reduces all the damage that 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.750
 receive the turtle 50% for 12 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.369
 seconds has a minute of cool down and 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.050
 This is in the thicket of 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.210
 fat in pandaria and like all 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.620
 panda mascots arias more invisible 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.979
 moving on a route that then 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.720
 I will teach I was leaving a trail of 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:42.159
 traces there where it happens that 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.769
 I will also show the traces for 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:46.180
 that you know how they are and the only thing 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.970
 you have to do where you think it's going 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.710
 to happen is to throw a flare and 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.540
 you will discover it you put the mark of 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.949
 domestic her hunter is that neither turns 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.460
 to hit or nothing, this is the last 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.440
 pet that remains of me for one 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.049
 from the area of the continent of Padaria 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.330
 for teaching you then I'll start I'll do 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:06.729
 a few old lobbies because there are 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.920
 Many people ask me for lobbies 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.600
 although I always recommend going up 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.110
 maximum level and then worry about the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.850
 pet 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.909
 to nothing 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.680
 what I put here is the footprint and the 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.689
 trace so that you see pass the mouse 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.560
 above and you will see the name of 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.299
 muddy footprints 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.420
 very well because almost the entire route 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.790
 it's sand and the sand is brown 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.100
 clarita in the traces are very dark to 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.610
 the problems that happens too many 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.750
 sometimes by water and in the water you do not see 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.409
 simply as soon as it's a bit 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.770
 deep you can not see anything 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.350
 here I put the tour to all the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.720
 line is the route that makes 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.280
 the blue areas are where most often 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.530
 find people if you want to go 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.060
 jumping from site to site looking for 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.190
 see what it is if you find the trail 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.320
 and the green zone is where there's easy to 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.409
 depending on the missions you have 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.459
 or you have not done you will see the traces or 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.800
 no or that area is to avoid it because if 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.680
 you have the dominance slopes you will see it 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.580
 or notice they will avoid in the green zone and 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.500
 is already 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.930
 it takes to make the whole journey of a 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.440
 point to another 40 minutes and when it arrives 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.450
 at the end he turns around and goes again 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.380
 until the beginning good and here I put the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.660
 moment where I get it 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.640
 in the meeting it costs me that I have 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.690
 come to the thicket until I've 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.510
 domesticated 15 minutes and apart I have 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.220
 recorded that if the beginning of the video 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.390
 traces of entertaining following 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.640
 a while for you to see it nothing I know what 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.760
 if you are jumping from the blue area 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.700
 blue will cost you that 10-15 minutes if 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.220
 is the turtle to nothing but that the video 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.550
 serve you like it and tomorrow more until 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.550
 morning
