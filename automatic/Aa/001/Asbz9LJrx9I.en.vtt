00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.950
 one pull up liked the staff and if 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:14.700
 in the case of the boto it went from one piece to another 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.990
 she has there is that is unique to a 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.150
 laconic to here and there only opens 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.789
 break the strings come into force this 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.990
 to enter here in the chair to fit 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.160
 in cinnamon 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:35.520
 I do so in accordance with 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:52.079
 need to never think that the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:55.170
 paste goes under the legs this in 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.199
 according to this part that 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:04.110
 applying conforms to one that is one 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:07.650
 tetra has no movement a movement 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.580
 not from this movement, ie the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.770
 arms 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.920
 this we go who has to be one 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.420
 technician can do this and not let 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.250
 arms that so far Capuava and comes 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.470
 here's the command that she has the most 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.470
 a football manual announced in this 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.939
 morning it because I eg 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.130
 could do 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.140
 We expect to use that 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.140
 battery also has the tongue at your side 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.570
 but this is a task that was created 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:09.410
 This is very safe now if I do not 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:20.090
 have that more fixed raise your arms 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:22.490
 for that market down with button 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.110
 on the embassy door but what 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:49.190
 He was comfortable with my family. 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:53.480
 What house is this concern for? 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.060
 is that I now raise the arm who has 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.880
 that having this person take this security 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.940
 have brought them a tetra they did not have 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.940
 income 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.230
 Miguel only came in on weekends. 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.860
 so here do not have much practice will 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.560
 to the other, and now the table already 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:26.739
 try silver that makes us good because 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.739
 only the works are dishes 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.640
 we have to be careful size the device 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.680
 alone i make a current move 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.790
 champion in its slow because of the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:48.620
 gravity or what I do I do this 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:56.720
 so no size when here Sunday already 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:59.959
 It's when the baby is down now. 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.860
 advantage is exactly the thing as the 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.400
 obstetricians 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.960
 I have some moves with you but 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.490
 Who could not make history? 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.050
 liked who would not now picked it up for 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.820
 voice and implement 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:21.510
 who can not do this is a case 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:31.410
 more difficult though its own concept 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:35.970
 of Iraq that is already in lots call 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.670
 slopes fit perfectly into the 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:46.770
 walk alone she'll find it 's a 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:50.310
 bit boring only once and now just pull me 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.460
 I remain fixed here and now go to 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.460
 jail 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:05.160
 is very important this part occurs if 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.740
 You do not have that for me his car police are 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.940
 very important that this one has succeeded 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:21.540
 adapt and stay does not reach the arms 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:25.530
 The rest is a time when I got into the 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.420
 room and when I do works 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.580
 I 'm thinking through a gutter that's the 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.490
 that there is a load with the lowest 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.730
 It's a face up there with these with this 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.650
 structure employed in the pipeline and we with 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.420
 command we 're going to have to be 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.120
 a straight trough always straight 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.820
 so let's go directly here with 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.090
 a suite if there are four of us go 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.060
 directly to sony has fit the avaÃ­ 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.310
 It's the volatile scoreboard but it does not have a 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.740
 house on the second day 3 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.800
 these two do this function are 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.650
 laptops with sponsorship for the event 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.680
 It's really just out to sea for a 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.230
 another the marquise in the same bed marks I 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.060
 accurate in portfolios leads because it is 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.060
 more tact looks at the points
