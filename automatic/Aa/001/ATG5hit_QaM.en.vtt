 obedient and good I think that yes you have a quite positive dialogue 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.480
 but I also see 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.940
 that you're way above her and ketamine control 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.150
 you consider yourself a mother threw on protective 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.550
 in fact a gap between 10 and after not having done this concluded 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.290
 I think my intestines in synthesis so difficult and so difficult 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.380
 the cost these entities 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.620

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.940
 one thing is the really something that is given by the doors 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.930
 said new lion after the event 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.590
 In a month it's a world in crisis, it was bad and maybe Alonso is what you 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.430
 feel 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.430
 with more than 60 companies after seven days 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.170
 that is 3 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.420
 things other behaviors of yours that we can do 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.420
 this mind 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.810
 that there is an overprotection and in it to see if we can continue then it 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.430
 would avoid and we can exchange them for another one of better ones for whose greater patent 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.680
 independence 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.009
 we have seen that so many bold situations is difficult that 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.080
 some complicated 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.979
 today even natural like that as we have seen when they hear 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.770
 is a boy asks the time or talks to someone 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.830
 down the street effectively 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.430
 for that this stick that savo natural that also 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.710
 disappointing 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.110
 we have seen that also 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.070
 by the way my house a more childish behavior a duel that will be 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.450
 his property 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.620
 for example since you do not even have to go to the cinema in the note 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.340
 and if you want 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.360
 you have to bring wealth 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.360
 and come and do not leave him alone with friends 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.249
 It's a bus redoubt 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.249
 myth that this year is going to ride a bus 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.739
 lanÃºs knows very calm and that santander hus 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.679
 we can say that it was not because the support of a car 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:22.720
 so that the function as paris 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.019
 is to try 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.110
 that they can fend for themselves and do those things that they have 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.950
 ravages to be autonomous so Spain strassera a 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:36.329
 she must find a woman dependent on a submissive woman for relapses uncover 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.739
 the team doing things for herself 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.900
 another thing that I see the control over your intimate concise method 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.259
 look at your mobile 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:49.759
 this road at a party since there are things that they have the right to do 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:50.699
 row 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.919
 thousands of people and that the consequences of all this was because 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.409
 part of its dependence 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.099
 per hundred and that can not not because you must have your own autonomy 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.009
 what to me may seem more sad that is that you can stop 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.529
 quilmes 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.069
 that is, he caught one the things 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.629
 although they seem to be judged by you 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.929
 or it will do 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:16.059
 about protecting you is to say as a Francoist guy that is going to 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.159
 worry then in the end it drives you away and you get excited 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.299
 although other things belong 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.299
 if they could happen 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:31.519
 but no longer with common bad intention and I do it but what I love my daughter 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.479
 I do it for you so he pulled the crossbow and not opposition 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:38.839
 passenger but she has to learn to 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:43.009
 to save myself and disasters circumstances of my function with which to wait for 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.219
 come on if lan where just one passing added 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.910
 during these years 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.029
 so look at the second part 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.489
 because your past you will be like ovarian cloth of tears so that 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.359
 there is peace 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.330
 but you can also make it avoid other special circumstances candela 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.539
 but we have to see at what point 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.729
 this happens to every thing but a lot of skill with which it has happened with its 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:04.969
 classmates 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.139
 with things from the teachers 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.789
 when it rained opinion couple because it happens the same thing that is another subject efe 

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:14.789
 this work some points of the city center 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:18.969
 workshops that what you have done has your account that you can do things 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.479
 and if we can let me think the doors 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.479
 zambrano supposedly for what 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.559
 but at every age 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.059
 which is adequate 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:32.580
 I know that some classic suit did not but neither answered 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.580
 I think this relationship that Scottish you is extraordinary 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.560
 I think that the improvement was much higher in order to buy the first 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.199
 16 months of life propicien you can follow these geoscience guidelines so things 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:46.810
 well 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.160
 well something of the day quite positive 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.779
 both for Paul as well as for 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:56.199
 thank you very much god ahead on the street I do not promise anything detected from 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.189
 at least the most important thing you can progress from applying these 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:02.090
 small things according to points out that it is also going to come 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.090
 min 1 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.999
 as well as snow pulses among teenagers if you want to go to the movies with 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.850
 his friends 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.699
 how would he act 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.789
 Some Chinese would let him go because he is small 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.189
 2 I would bring you to bring me to avoid any danger 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.339
 3 I would let him go so he could learn endorsements for himself 

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.759
 the correct answer is number three 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.809
 I would not let it go so that I learned it appears by itself 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.389
 it's painful but my son is going through a difficult situation 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.120
 but they have to mature 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.020
 and we the tattoos as parents is to teach them what is expected to achieve their 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.029
 own autonomy 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:45.629
 as our parents did with us 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:49.039
 we have to be vigilant to see what things can be done at each age 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.139
 will go dollars 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.270
 small responsibilities that you may never have 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.560
 and especially prepared so that they can face all these situations 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.159
 without you 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.849
 and that they can fend for themselves 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.570
 if you like and uzquiza of the course of your children 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.139
 what is the proper way 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:07.759
 look at your mobile 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.479
 2 talk 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.770
 interrogate or spy 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.770
 the correct answer is number 2 we have to dialogue 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:20.179
 our children and our daughters 100 right super simple we can not 

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:21.909
 know everything about them 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:24.069
 in fact if we want to do something else 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.020
 we should ask him experience in the countess 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.139
 first counting things on this path was exposed feelings and then for 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.319
 that they hope to be counting on theirs 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.509
 and to prevent the appointment from happening in overprotection 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:41.999
 let them do things that ask you to be appropriate at the age did not fail these 

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.860
 miners 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.939
 fresh datamax chords carefully with this clear color 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.660
 harness participants of the decisions of the house so that they can feel that 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:51.330
 the concello 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.009
 very good something important 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:56.919
 and shares the joys but also the getafe and the pain so that 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.289
 also learn to face this situation is that not 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:01.330
 finally he did 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.150
 is done because he is in a situation 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.460
 You already know how to approach you can always go to a school of
