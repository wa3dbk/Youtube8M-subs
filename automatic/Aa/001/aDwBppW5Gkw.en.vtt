00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.370

 super and all loved a and clip and 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.959
 a clip is the most important thing to 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:49.940
 you need to get a SIM card tray 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:52.930

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.790

 Well, here our iphone is almost 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.420

 so for so long the inclusions are eaten but 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.330
 for some reason this 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:32.970
 but since that's ok 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:39.860
