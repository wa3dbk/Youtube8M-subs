enough<00:05:09.660> color<00:05:09.960> in<00:05:10.230> the<00:05:10.350> back<00:05:10.560> so<00:05:10.890> I<00:05:11.100> noticed

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
enough color in the back so I noticed

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.250 
enough color in the back so I noticed
that<00:05:12.000> in<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.270> back<00:05:12.450> it's<00:05:12.720> a<00:05:12.840> little<00:05:12.870> bit

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
that in the back it's a little bit

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.830 
that in the back it's a little bit
darker<00:05:13.710> in<00:05:13.860> some<00:05:14.190> areas<00:05:14.670> but<00:05:14.940> pretty<00:05:15.630> much

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
darker in some areas but pretty much

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
darker in some areas but pretty much
this<00:05:16.080> is<00:05:16.140> it<00:05:16.590> and<00:05:16.980> so<00:05:17.010> I<00:05:17.880> think<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:18.300> did<00:05:18.540> notice<00:05:18.870> I

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
this is it and so I think I did notice I

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.950 
this is it and so I think I did notice I
changed<00:05:20.310> I'm<00:05:21.120> I'm<00:05:21.810> using<00:05:22.170> brown<00:05:23.660> hair<00:05:24.660> pins

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
changed I'm I'm using brown hair pins

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.850 
changed I'm I'm using brown hair pins
now<00:05:25.320> because<00:05:25.980> the<00:05:26.700> brown<00:05:27.140> the<00:05:28.140> brown<00:05:28.320> looks

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
now because the brown the brown looks

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.690 
now because the brown the brown looks
better<00:05:29.130> than<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.670> black<00:05:30.050> so<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.430> guess<00:05:32.430> I'll<00:05:32.670> be

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
better than the black so I guess I'll be

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.270 
better than the black so I guess I'll be
investing<00:05:33.480> in<00:05:33.630> some<00:05:34.880> brown<00:05:36.020> which<00:05:37.020> come<00:05:37.320> side

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
investing in some brown which come side

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.040 
investing in some brown which come side
combs<00:05:38.700> and<00:05:39.000> all<00:05:39.180> of<00:05:39.300> that<00:05:39.450> to<00:05:39.600> go<00:05:39.720> with<00:05:39.750> that

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
combs and all of that to go with that

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.220 
combs and all of that to go with that
but<00:05:40.770> this<00:05:40.980> is<00:05:41.250> the<00:05:41.490> same<00:05:41.790> flat<00:05:42.540> twist<00:05:42.900> when<00:05:43.200> I

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
but this is the same flat twist when I

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.960 
but this is the same flat twist when I
got<00:05:43.560> to<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:43.890> show<00:05:44.100> today<00:05:44.310> I<00:05:44.490> just<00:05:46.970> untwisting
