00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
like a tripod stand and then extend it

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.670 
like a tripod stand and then extend it
just<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> take<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.969> image<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.630> how<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.350> device

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
actually works is it uses Bluetooth

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.869 
actually works is it uses Bluetooth
connection<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.290> there's<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> capture<00:00:41.550> key<00:00:41.730> on

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
connection so there's a capture key on

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.030 
connection so there's a capture key on
the<00:00:42.059> handle<00:00:42.570> bar<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> product<00:00:43.469> itself<00:00:43.770> so

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the handle bar of the product itself so

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.350

photo you simply press it once and then

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.889

family with only your face and so I can

get<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.510> quote<00:00:51.750> perfect<00:00:52.289> selfie<00:00:52.800> image<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.699> it

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
get the quote perfect selfie image so it

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.459 
get the quote perfect selfie image so it
seems<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.120> bit<00:00:54.270> comical<00:00:54.660> something<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.260> this

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
seems a bit comical something like this

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.200 
seems a bit comical something like this
but<00:00:55.800> there's<00:00:56.190> actually<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.550> market<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.120> this

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
but there's actually a market for this

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.029 
but there's actually a market for this
believer<00:00:57.480> or<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.109> something<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:58.890> this

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
believer or not and something like this

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.889 
believer or not and something like this
is<00:00:59.219> priced<00:00:59.520> at<00:00:59.670> around<00:00:59.760> 20<00:01:00.239> dollars<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.660> so

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
is priced at around 20 dollars or so

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.569 
is priced at around 20 dollars or so
which<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.379> guess<00:01:01.469> reasonable<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
which is I guess reasonable for a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.080

LED indicator tells you when the product
is<00:03:39.959> being<00:03:40.109> turned<00:03:40.349> on<00:03:40.500> or<00:03:40.769> being<00:03:41.040> turned<00:03:41.310> off

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
is being turned on or being turned off

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.360 
is being turned on or being turned off
the<00:03:42.419> Assumption<00:03:42.870> part<00:03:43.109> of<00:03:43.199> the<00:03:43.290> actual<00:03:43.620> selfie

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
the Assumption part of the actual selfie

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.159 
the Assumption part of the actual selfie
stick<00:03:44.639> itself<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.180> crafted<00:03:45.569> out<00:03:45.629> of<00:03:45.720> metal<00:03:45.930> so

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
stick itself is crafted out of metal so

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.020 
stick itself is crafted out of metal so
it's<00:03:46.379> actually<00:03:46.650> pretty<00:03:46.799> strong<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.940> can

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
it's actually pretty strong and it can

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.580 
it's actually pretty strong and it can
actually<00:03:48.299> get<00:03:48.449> too<00:03:48.569> ridiculously<00:03:49.349> long

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
actually get too ridiculously long

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.289 
actually get too ridiculously long
lengths<00:03:49.919> so<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.280> can<00:03:50.579> actually<00:03:50.819> extend<00:03:51.090> this

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
lengths so I can actually extend this

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.119 
lengths so I can actually extend this
it's<00:03:51.479> like<00:03:51.569> a<00:03:51.599> telescope<00:03:52.169> I<00:03:52.409> can<00:03:52.889> get<00:03:53.040> it

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
it's like a telescope I can get it

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.360 
it's like a telescope I can get it
longer<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.760> then<00:03:54.479> longer<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.319> just<00:03:55.370> longer

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
longer and then longer and just longer

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.000 
longer and then longer and just longer
and<00:03:56.879> every<00:03:57.569> single<00:03:57.870> part<00:03:58.049> just<00:03:58.260> continues<00:03:58.979> to

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
and every single part just continues to

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.979 
and every single part just continues to
extend<00:03:59.370> outwards<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.299> basically<00:04:00.599> you<00:04:00.780> have

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
extend outwards and basically you have

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.080 
extend outwards and basically you have
something<00:04:01.680> that's<00:04:01.739> almost<00:04:02.099> a<00:04:02.280> meter<00:04:02.519> long<00:04:02.669> I

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
something that's almost a meter long I

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.030 
something that's almost a meter long I
think<00:04:03.449> even<00:04:03.659> longer<00:04:03.989> than<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.290> meter<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:04.889> it's

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
think even longer than a meter so it's

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.559 
think even longer than a meter so it's
something<00:04:05.189> that<00:04:05.310> just<00:04:05.489> goes<00:04:05.669> longer<00:04:06.359> and

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
something that just goes longer and

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.330 
something that just goes longer and
longer<00:04:06.689> and<00:04:06.959> longer<00:04:07.019> so<00:04:07.470> if<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.979> want<00:04:08.129> to<00:04:08.189> take

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
longer and longer so if you want to take

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.460 
longer and longer so if you want to take
a<00:04:08.370> selfie<00:04:08.579> this<00:04:08.849> can<00:04:09.000> get<00:04:09.150> pretty<00:04:09.209> long<00:04:10.169> and

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
a selfie this can get pretty long and

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.420 
a selfie this can get pretty long and
you<00:04:10.530> can<00:04:10.650> actually<00:04:10.799> get<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.099> pretty

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
you can actually get a pretty

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.219 
you can actually get a pretty
comfortable<00:04:11.909> field<00:04:12.359> of<00:04:12.479> view<00:04:12.720> depending<00:04:13.109> on

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
comfortable field of view depending on

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.619 
comfortable field of view depending on
your<00:04:13.409> phone<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.859> so<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.459> can<00:04:14.609> use<00:04:14.759> a<00:04:15.030> both<00:04:15.449> the

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
your phone and so you can use a both the

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.300 
your phone and so you can use a both the
back<00:04:15.870> camera<00:04:16.109> or<00:04:16.409> the<00:04:16.590> front<00:04:16.799> camera<00:04:17.009> for

back camera or the front camera for
taking<00:04:17.549> your<00:04:17.639> self-portraits<00:04:18.329> use<00:04:18.539> of<00:04:18.720> this

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
taking your self-portraits use of this

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.930 
taking your self-portraits use of this
particular<00:04:19.530> device<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.950> afterwards<00:04:20.700> it's

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
particular device and afterwards it's

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.600 
particular device and afterwards it's
simply<00:04:21.840> attached<00:04:22.469> back<00:04:22.740> for<00:04:22.979> easy<00:04:23.159> carrying

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
simply attached back for easy carrying

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.520 
simply attached back for easy carrying
with<00:04:24.029> you<00:04:24.210> when

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
with you when

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.770 
with you when
traveling<00:04:25.040> so<00:04:25.490> as<00:04:25.760> far<00:04:25.940> as<00:04:26.000> design<00:04:26.180> goes<00:04:26.600> is

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
traveling so as far as design goes is

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.670 
traveling so as far as design goes is
actually<00:04:27.080> pretty<00:04:27.230> good

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
actually pretty good

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.470 
actually pretty good
now<00:04:27.830> one<00:04:28.100> disadvantage<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:28.820> this<00:04:29.000> device<00:04:29.270> is

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
now one disadvantage of this device is

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.850 
now one disadvantage of this device is
that<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.720> hinge<00:04:29.960> here<00:04:30.170> is<00:04:30.260> actually<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.590> little

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
that the hinge here is actually a little

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.220 
that the hinge here is actually a little
bit<00:04:30.980> weak<00:04:31.280> it<00:04:32.150> seems<00:04:32.510> to<00:04:32.660> move<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:32.960> little<00:04:33.110> bit

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
bit weak it seems to move a little bit

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.780 
bit weak it seems to move a little bit
too<00:04:33.380> much<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:33.950> over<00:04:34.220> time<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.460> think<00:04:34.580> it's

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
too much and over time I think it's

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.610 
too much and over time I think it's
going<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:34.940> wear<00:04:35.150> down<00:04:35.330> even<00:04:35.630> more<00:04:35.660> so<00:04:36.380> it

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
going to wear down even more so it

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.990 
going to wear down even more so it
doesn't<00:04:36.830> really<00:04:36.919> stick<00:04:37.070> in<00:04:37.400> place<00:04:37.580> too

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
doesn't really stick in place too

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.659 
doesn't really stick in place too
strongly<00:04:38.419> which<00:04:38.810> might<00:04:38.990> be<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.139> issue<00:04:40.130> over

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
strongly which might be a issue over

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.640 
strongly which might be a issue over
time<00:04:40.940> because<00:04:41.720> of<00:04:41.810> course<00:04:42.050> if<00:04:42.260> this<00:04:42.350> kind<00:04:42.530> of

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
time because of course if this kind of

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.870 
time because of course if this kind of
thing<00:04:42.710> kind<00:04:42.950> of<00:04:43.010> wobbles<00:04:43.430> back<00:04:43.610> and<00:04:43.669> forth

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
thing kind of wobbles back and forth

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.280 
thing kind of wobbles back and forth
that's<00:04:44.330> not<00:04:44.480> going<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.690> be<00:04:44.780> good<00:04:44.930> for<00:04:45.110> your

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
that's not going to be good for your

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.800 
that's not going to be good for your
camera<00:04:45.680> or<00:04:45.919> for<00:04:46.070> your<00:04:46.190> phone<00:04:46.370> but<00:04:47.240> overall<00:04:47.510> it

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
camera or for your phone but overall it

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.120 
camera or for your phone but overall it
seems<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.139> be<00:04:48.230> pretty<00:04:48.350> strong<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:48.980> pretty

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
seems to be pretty strong and pretty

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.000 
seems to be pretty strong and pretty
sturdy<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:49.760> again<00:04:50.120> we<00:04:50.300> simply<00:04:50.630> attach<00:04:51.010> the

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
sturdy and again we simply attach the

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.760 
sturdy and again we simply attach the
adapter<00:04:52.220> tape<00:04:52.669> over<00:04:52.790> here<00:04:53.440> using<00:04:54.440> these

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
adapter tape over here using these

afterwards<00:04:57.350> we<00:04:57.530> would<00:04:57.620> just<00:04:57.800> attach<00:04:58.040> that<00:04:58.070> I

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
afterwards we would just attach that I

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.640 
afterwards we would just attach that I
connected<00:04:58.850> my<00:04:58.910> samsung<00:04:59.480> galaxy<00:04:59.990> phone<00:05:00.380> on

connected my samsung galaxy phone on

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.260 
connected my samsung galaxy phone on
here<00:05:00.950> you<00:05:01.100> can<00:05:01.220> see<00:05:01.400> that<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:02.000> device<00:05:02.240> is

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
here you can see that the device is

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.760 
here you can see that the device is
starting<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.720> flash<00:05:02.960> which<00:05:03.290> shows<00:05:03.500> that<00:05:03.530> it's

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
starting to flash which shows that it's

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.140 
starting to flash which shows that it's
trying<00:05:03.980> to<00:05:04.070> find<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.610> connect<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.000> the

trying to find and connect to the
Bluetooth<00:05:05.510> signal<00:05:05.900> use<00:05:06.500> this<00:05:06.620> bluetooth<00:05:06.980> 3.0

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
Bluetooth signal use this bluetooth 3.0

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.280 
Bluetooth signal use this bluetooth 3.0
for<00:05:07.760> a<00:05:07.790> pretty<00:05:08.030> energy-efficient<00:05:08.870> connection

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
for a pretty energy-efficient connection

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.630 
for a pretty energy-efficient connection
you<00:05:09.440> can<00:05:09.560> see<00:05:09.680> we<00:05:09.830> have<00:05:10.040> it<00:05:10.160> here<00:05:10.310> called<00:05:10.610> the

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
you can see we have it here called the

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.060 
you can see we have it here called the
bluetooth<00:05:11.030> 3.0<00:05:11.510> shutter<00:05:11.870> we<00:05:12.560> simply<00:05:12.860> tap<00:05:13.040> on

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
bluetooth 3.0 shutter we simply tap on

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.790 
bluetooth 3.0 shutter we simply tap on
that<00:05:13.340> to<00:05:13.490> pair<00:05:13.760> it<00:05:13.850> and<00:05:14.320> it<00:05:15.320> pairs<00:05:15.590> pretty

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
that to pair it and it pairs pretty

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.110 
that to pair it and it pairs pretty
quickly<00:05:16.010> you<00:05:16.220> can<00:05:16.310> see<00:05:16.460> that<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:16.669> light<00:05:16.880> will

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
quickly you can see that the light will

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.030 
quickly you can see that the light will
then<00:05:17.270> turn<00:05:17.479> off<00:05:17.720> and<00:05:18.050> tell<00:05:18.200> it<00:05:18.350> tells<00:05:18.770> us<00:05:18.950> of

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
then turn off and tell it tells us of

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.430 
then turn off and tell it tells us of
where<00:05:19.190> it<00:05:19.310> successfully<00:05:20.000> paired<00:05:20.320> onto<00:05:21.320> the

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
where it successfully paired onto the

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.500 
where it successfully paired onto the
camera<00:05:21.890> so<00:05:22.370> afterwards<00:05:22.729> we<00:05:22.970> can<00:05:23.090> simply<00:05:23.360> go

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
camera so afterwards we can simply go

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.780 
camera so afterwards we can simply go
ahead<00:05:23.780> and<00:05:24.020> launch<00:05:24.260> the<00:05:24.530> camera<00:05:24.860> application

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
ahead and launch the camera application

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.730 
ahead and launch the camera application
and<00:05:26.000> you<00:05:26.870> can<00:05:26.990> use<00:05:27.169> again<00:05:27.530> both<00:05:27.710> the

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
and you can use again both the

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.440 
and you can use again both the
front-facing<00:05:28.250> camera<00:05:28.640> or<00:05:28.729> the<00:05:28.820> back<00:05:29.030> facing

according<00:05:32.030> to<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.270> ankle<00:05:32.540> that<00:05:32.570> you<00:05:32.720> really

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
according to the ankle that you really

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.930 
according to the ankle that you really
want<00:05:33.140> to<00:05:33.200> capture<00:05:33.410> or<00:05:33.830> field<00:05:34.160> field<00:05:34.610> of<00:05:34.729> view

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
want to capture or field field of view

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.000 
want to capture or field field of view
and<00:05:35.120> then<00:05:35.540> you<00:05:35.630> simply<00:05:35.780> press<00:05:36.169> the<00:05:36.410> snap<00:05:36.740> key

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
and then you simply press the snap key

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.590 
and then you simply press the snap key
so<00:05:37.340> I'm<00:05:37.610> going<00:05:37.880> to<00:05:37.910> capture<00:05:38.270> some<00:05:38.390> of<00:05:38.419> these

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
so I'm going to capture some of these

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.360 
so I'm going to capture some of these
headphones<00:05:38.780> for<00:05:39.140> example<00:05:39.560> I'm<00:05:40.190> going<00:05:40.250> to

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
headphones for example I'm going to

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.029 
headphones for example I'm going to
press<00:05:40.610> on<00:05:40.820> the<00:05:41.030> snap<00:05:41.360> to<00:05:41.539> you<00:05:41.630> over<00:05:41.780> here<00:05:42.039> it's

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
press on the snap to you over here it's

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.710 
press on the snap to you over here it's
going<00:05:43.220> to<00:05:43.280> autofocus<00:05:44.030> and<00:05:44.210> then<00:05:44.330> take<00:05:44.570> the

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
going to autofocus and then take the

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.510 
going to autofocus and then take the
image<00:05:44.990> for<00:05:45.260> me<00:05:45.350> so<00:05:45.830> it<00:05:45.979> actually<00:05:46.100> is<00:05:46.310> a<00:05:46.370> pretty

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
image for me so it actually is a pretty

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.580 
image for me so it actually is a pretty
interesting<00:05:46.910> design<00:05:47.720> actually<00:05:48.200> works<00:05:48.410> fairly

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
interesting design actually works fairly

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.620 
interesting design actually works fairly
well<00:05:48.919> and<00:05:49.280> when<00:05:49.550> we<00:05:49.640> tested<00:05:49.940> it<00:05:50.090> with<00:05:50.180> multiple

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
well and when we tested it with multiple

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.810 
well and when we tested it with multiple
devices<00:05:50.930> on<00:05:51.380> multiple<00:05:52.190> phones<00:05:52.430> for<00:05:52.700> that

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
devices on multiple phones for that

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.909 
devices on multiple phones for that
matter<00:05:53.030> from<00:05:53.479> our<00:05:53.840> Samsung<00:05:54.229> Galaxy<00:05:54.680> device

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
here to the LG G flex 2 HTC products we

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.659 
here to the LG G flex 2 HTC products we
didn't<00:05:58.100> have<00:05:58.220> any<00:05:58.370> issues<00:05:58.490> with

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
didn't have any issues with

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.270 
didn't have any issues with
compatibility<00:05:59.600> and<00:05:59.780> each<00:06:00.200> time<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:00.890> product

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
compatibility and each time the product

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.580 
compatibility and each time the product
was<00:06:01.430> recognized<00:06:01.970> and<00:06:02.750> the<00:06:02.990> camera<00:06:03.380> shutter

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
was recognized and the camera shutter

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.040 
was recognized and the camera shutter
key<00:06:03.830> focused<00:06:04.490> first<00:06:04.820> before<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.479> image<00:06:05.840> was

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
key focused first before the image was

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.380 
key focused first before the image was
actually<00:06:06.380> taken<00:06:06.740> so<00:06:07.190> the<00:06:07.550> actual<00:06:07.940> results<00:06:08.300> of

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
actually taken so the actual results of

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.540 
actually taken so the actual results of
the<00:06:08.479> images<00:06:08.870> is<00:06:09.110> actually<00:06:09.410> quite<00:06:09.590> good<00:06:09.860> I<00:06:10.130> have

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
the images is actually quite good I have

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.920 
the images is actually quite good I have
to<00:06:10.610> say<00:06:10.729> that<00:06:10.970> even<00:06:11.000> though<00:06:11.240> it<00:06:11.390> sounds<00:06:11.570> kind

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
to say that even though it sounds kind

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.930 
to say that even though it sounds kind
of<00:06:11.960> impractical<00:06:12.620> when<00:06:13.340> testing<00:06:13.700> it<00:06:13.789> out<00:06:13.880> in

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
of impractical when testing it out in

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.520 
of impractical when testing it out in
the<00:06:14.060> real<00:06:14.240> world<00:06:14.510> the<00:06:14.870> images<00:06:15.260> for<00:06:15.440> the

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
the real world the images for the

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.020 
the real world the images for the
selfies<00:06:15.860> actually<00:06:16.280> came<00:06:16.460> out<00:06:16.580> better<00:06:16.729> than

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
selfies actually came out better than

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.150 
selfies actually came out better than
expected<00:06:17.330> you<00:06:18.260> can<00:06:18.410> actually<00:06:18.560> aim<00:06:18.800> it<00:06:18.950> high

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
expected you can actually aim it high

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.830 
expected you can actually aim it high
over<00:06:19.190> your<00:06:19.490> heads<00:06:19.850> and<00:06:20.120> then<00:06:20.330> it<00:06:20.419> doesn't<00:06:20.660> seem

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
over your heads and then it doesn't seem

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.360 
over your heads and then it doesn't seem
like<00:06:20.990> you're<00:06:21.140> holding<00:06:21.320> anything<00:06:21.680> with<00:06:22.340> a

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
like you're holding anything with a

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.880 
like you're holding anything with a
friend<00:06:22.700> or<00:06:22.850> family<00:06:22.970> member<00:06:23.180> and<00:06:23.620> although<00:06:24.620> it

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
friend or family member and although it

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.890 
friend or family member and although it
you<00:06:25.220> will<00:06:25.460> get<00:06:25.580> a<00:06:25.640> few<00:06:25.820> odd<00:06:26.090> looks<00:06:26.570> when<00:06:26.810> you're

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
you will get a few odd looks when you're

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.529 
you will get a few odd looks when you're
using<00:06:27.080> it<00:06:27.260> in<00:06:27.320> public<00:06:27.560> of<00:06:27.950> course<00:06:28.390> but<00:06:29.390> the

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:29.539 
using it in public of course but the

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:31.540 
using it in public of course but the
actual<00:06:29.780> results<00:06:30.200> where<00:06:30.350> the<00:06:30.410> images<00:06:30.800> are<00:06:31.010> much

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
actual results where the images are much

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.890 
actual results where the images are much
better<00:06:31.760> than<00:06:32.000> I<00:06:32.090> guess<00:06:32.240> directly<00:06:32.659> putting

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
better than I guess directly putting

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.690 
better than I guess directly putting
your<00:06:33.020> phone<00:06:33.200> down<00:06:33.349> and<00:06:33.409> trying<00:06:33.830> to<00:06:33.979> capture<00:06:34.430> it

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
your phone down and trying to capture it

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.850 
your phone down and trying to capture it
using<00:06:34.940> your<00:06:34.970> arms<00:06:35.440> so<00:06:36.440> it's<00:06:36.530> a<00:06:36.560> good<00:06:36.680> way<00:06:36.800> to

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
using your arms so it's a good way to

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.290 
using your arms so it's a good way to
get<00:06:37.039> an<00:06:37.190> extension

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
get an extension

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.670 
get an extension
of<00:06:38.330> course<00:06:38.539> also<00:06:38.810> use<00:06:38.960> it<00:06:39.139> for<00:06:39.169> the<00:06:39.409> rear

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
of course also use it for the rear

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.469 
of course also use it for the rear
camera<00:06:40.099> and<00:06:40.250> to<00:06:40.370> capture<00:06:40.699> far<00:06:41.000> away<00:06:41.180> shots

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
camera and to capture far away shots

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.600 
camera and to capture far away shots
perhaps<00:06:42.319> if<00:06:42.470> you're<00:06:42.590> in<00:06:42.650> a<00:06:42.710> stadium<00:06:42.949> or<00:06:43.340> trying

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
perhaps if you're in a stadium or trying

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.100 
perhaps if you're in a stadium or trying
to<00:06:43.639> reach<00:06:43.970> or<00:06:44.270> capture<00:06:44.690> something<00:06:44.870> that's

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
to reach or capture something that's

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.990 
to reach or capture something that's
difficult<00:06:45.349> to<00:06:45.650> capture<00:06:45.830> this<00:06:46.460> is<00:06:46.580> a<00:06:46.610> good<00:06:46.849> way

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
difficult to capture this is a good way

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.339 
difficult to capture this is a good way
to<00:06:47.060> go<00:06:47.330> and<00:06:47.569> do<00:06:47.990> that

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:48.349 
to go and do that

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:49.960 
to go and do that
so<00:06:48.620> overall<00:06:48.889> the<00:06:49.009> process<00:06:49.340> is<00:06:49.460> fast<00:06:49.699> it's

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
so overall the process is fast it's

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.330 
so overall the process is fast it's
efficient<00:06:50.810> it<00:06:51.139> actually<00:06:51.319> works<00:06:51.680> exactly<00:06:52.099> as

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
efficient it actually works exactly as

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.070 
efficient it actually works exactly as
advertised<00:06:53.060> the<00:06:53.539> day<00:06:53.690> I<00:06:53.720> was<00:06:53.960> actually

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
advertised the day I was actually

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.930 
advertised the day I was actually
pleasantly<00:06:54.500> surprised<00:06:55.250> with<00:06:55.669> this

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
pleasantly surprised with this

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.420 
pleasantly surprised with this
particular<00:06:56.479> selfie<00:06:56.930> pole<00:06:57.199> I<00:06:57.409> thought<00:06:58.129> I<00:06:58.159> was

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
particular selfie pole I thought I was

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.010 
particular selfie pole I thought I was
going<00:06:58.610> to<00:06:58.699> not<00:06:59.030> really<00:06:59.240> like<00:06:59.389> it<00:06:59.599> I<00:06:59.720> was<00:06:59.870> going

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
going to not really like it I was going

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.629 
going to not really like it I was going
to<00:07:00.080> laugh<00:07:00.229> at<00:07:00.409> it<00:07:00.620> scorn<00:07:01.039> at<00:07:01.190> it<00:07:01.310> and<00:07:01.520> that

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 
to laugh at it scorn at it and that

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:03.879 
to laugh at it scorn at it and that
would<00:07:01.759> be<00:07:01.909> that<00:07:02.090> but<00:07:02.659> actually<00:07:02.810> the<00:07:03.229> usability

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:03.889 
would be that but actually the usability

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:06.100 
would be that but actually the usability
factor<00:07:04.430> is<00:07:04.580> actually<00:07:05.000> pretty<00:07:05.180> high<00:07:05.419> and<00:07:05.780> the
