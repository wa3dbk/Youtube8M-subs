right now is about 52 degrees here and
I'm<00:02:36.350> now<00:02:36.799> measuring<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.340> temperature<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.970> a

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
I'm now measuring the temperature of a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.500 
I'm now measuring the temperature of a
cold<00:02:38.510> muffler<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.410> we're<00:02:39.830> right<00:02:40.190> around

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
cold muffler and we're right around

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.020 
cold muffler and we're right around
about<00:02:41.510> eighty<00:02:41.780> degrees<00:02:42.230> or<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:42.650> I'll<00:02:43.610> be<00:02:43.730> using

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
about eighty degrees or so I'll be using

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.539 
about eighty degrees or so I'll be using
this<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.480> take<00:02:45.110> all<00:02:45.260> my<00:02:45.380> measurements<00:02:45.890> if<00:02:46.430> you

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
this to take all my measurements if you

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.360 
this to take all my measurements if you
come<00:02:46.730> back<00:02:46.850> here<00:02:47.239> on<00:02:47.569> this<00:02:47.750> side<00:02:48.049> okay

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
come back here on this side okay

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.300 
come back here on this side okay
I'll<00:02:49.580> take<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> shot<00:02:50.000> inside<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.590> bed<00:02:51.769> box<00:02:52.040> and

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
I'll take a shot inside the bed box and

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.370 
I'll take a shot inside the bed box and
right<00:02:52.430> now<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.670> inside<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.150> bed<00:02:53.269> box<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.660> 53

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
right now the inside the bed box is 53

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.620 
right now the inside the bed box is 53
degrees<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.310> I've<00:02:55.640> also<00:02:55.850> got<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.150> secondary

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
degrees and I've also got a secondary

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.690 
degrees and I've also got a secondary
thermometer<00:02:57.230> inside<00:02:57.650> there<00:02:57.920> if<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.489> take<00:02:58.640> a

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
thermometer inside there if you take a

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.370 
thermometer inside there if you take a
look<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.180> that's<00:02:59.359> just<00:02:59.630> one<00:02:59.870> that<00:02:59.989> I've<00:03:00.079> taped

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
look and that's just one that I've taped

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.280 
look and that's just one that I've taped
up<00:03:00.590> there<00:03:00.829> to<00:03:01.700> measure<00:03:01.880> so<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.420> have<00:03:02.690> some<00:03:03.109> real

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
up there to measure so I have some real

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.620 
up there to measure so I have some real
accurate<00:03:03.769> measurements<00:03:04.250> on<00:03:04.430> on<00:03:04.820> what<00:03:05.510> the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
accurate measurements on on what the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.180 
accurate measurements on on what the
temperatures<00:03:06.019> are<00:03:06.140> going<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.290> be<00:03:06.350> so<00:03:07.040> right

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
temperatures are going to be so right

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.440 
temperatures are going to be so right
now<00:03:07.340> everything<00:03:07.519> is<00:03:07.760> cold<00:03:08.000> I'm<00:03:08.209> going<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.390> go

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
now everything is cold I'm going to go

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.580 
now everything is cold I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.690> go<00:03:08.750> out<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:08.989> run<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.320> for<00:03:09.500> about

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
ahead and go out and run this for about

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.460 
ahead and go out and run this for about
20<00:03:09.980> minutes<00:03:10.130> get<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.489> up<00:03:10.609> to<00:03:10.730> temperature<00:03:10.760> and

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
20 minutes get it up to temperature and

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.630 
20 minutes get it up to temperature and
come<00:03:12.470> back<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:13.070> we'll<00:03:13.340> take<00:03:13.489> our

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
come back and we'll take our

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.920 
come back and we'll take our
measurements<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.299> then<00:03:14.390> I'll<00:03:14.540> solve<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
measurements and then I'll solve the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.300 
measurements and then I'll solve the
heat<00:03:15.049> shield<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.620> see<00:03:15.769> if<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.010> makes<00:03:16.160> any

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
heat shield and see if it makes any

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.060 
heat shield and see if it makes any
difference<00:03:16.579> I<00:03:17.200> just<00:03:18.200> finished<00:03:18.470> my<00:03:18.590> run<00:03:18.829> and

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
difference I just finished my run and

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.550 
difference I just finished my run and
I'm<00:03:19.130> measuring<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.579> temperature<00:03:20.209> of<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.840> of

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
I'm measuring the temperature of the of

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.380 
I'm measuring the temperature of the of
the<00:03:22.280> muffler<00:03:23.090> here<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:23.600> we're<00:03:23.720> at<00:03:24.049> about<00:03:24.260> 275

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
the muffler here and we're at about 275

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.240 
the muffler here and we're at about 275
it's<00:03:26.390> cooling<00:03:26.660> down<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.930> little<00:03:27.170> bit<00:03:27.380> had<00:03:27.980> five

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
it's cooling down a little bit had five

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.830 
it's cooling down a little bit had five
bars<00:03:28.579> on<00:03:28.940> my<00:03:29.200> on<00:03:30.200> my<00:03:30.700> display<00:03:31.700> panel<00:03:32.269> there<00:03:32.450> and

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
bars on my on my display panel there and

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.289 
bars on my on my display panel there and
so<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.290> muffler<00:03:33.620> is<00:03:33.680> nice<00:03:33.859> and<00:03:34.069> hot<00:03:34.220> right<00:03:34.519> now

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
so the muffler is nice and hot right now

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.490 
so the muffler is nice and hot right now
I<00:03:35.329> think<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.810> temperature<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.260> we're

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
I think the temperature that we're

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.550 
I think the temperature that we're
having<00:03:36.650> outside<00:03:37.280> is<00:03:37.640> too<00:03:37.880> cool<00:03:38.150> because<00:03:38.560> we

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
having outside is too cool because we

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.680 
having outside is too cool because we
measure<00:03:39.799> inside<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.340> box<00:03:40.579> it<00:03:40.910> has<00:03:40.940> gone<00:03:41.329> up<00:03:41.359> a

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
measure inside the box it has gone up a

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.990 
measure inside the box it has gone up a
little<00:03:42.049> bit<00:03:42.230> but<00:03:42.739> let<00:03:43.430> me<00:03:43.519> get<00:03:43.670> this<00:03:43.819> on

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
little bit but let me get this on

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.180 
little bit but let me get this on
Fahrenheit<00:03:44.660> but<00:03:45.260> we're<00:03:45.380> only<00:03:45.500> at<00:03:45.680> about<00:03:45.889> 80

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
Fahrenheit but we're only at about 80

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.860 
Fahrenheit but we're only at about 80
well<00:03:47.530> anywhere<00:03:48.530> from<00:03:49.209> about<00:03:50.209> 90<00:03:50.660> there

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
well anywhere from about 90 there

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.629 
well anywhere from about 90 there
there's<00:03:51.260> about<00:03:51.350> 95<00:03:51.859> is<00:03:52.069> about<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.310> hottest

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
there's about 95 is about the hottest

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.360 
there's about 95 is about the hottest
spot<00:03:52.880> in<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.120> box<00:03:53.510> right<00:03:53.780> now<00:03:53.959> so<00:03:54.769> it's<00:03:55.280> not

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
spot in that box right now so it's not

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.390 
spot in that box right now so it's not
very<00:03:55.730> hot<00:03:56.030> in<00:03:56.209> there<00:03:56.500> even<00:03:57.500> not<00:03:57.709> hot<00:03:57.890> enough<00:03:57.920> to

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
very hot in there even not hot enough to

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.520 
very hot in there even not hot enough to
measure<00:03:58.760> on<00:03:59.030> my<00:03:59.480> thermometer<00:03:59.840> that<00:04:00.260> starts

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
measure on my thermometer that starts

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.110 
measure on my thermometer that starts
off<00:04:00.709> at<00:04:00.860> a<00:04:00.950> hundred<00:04:01.129> degrees

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
off at a hundred degrees

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.550 
off at a hundred degrees
but<00:04:02.480> we're<00:04:02.629> gonna<00:04:02.720> go<00:04:02.900> ahead<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.170> install<00:04:03.440> the

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
but we're gonna go ahead and install the

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.949 
but we're gonna go ahead and install the
heat<00:04:03.709> shield<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:04.310> see<00:04:04.459> if<00:04:04.549> we<00:04:04.700> get<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.120> drop<00:04:05.750> in

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
heat shield and see if we get a drop in

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.100 
heat shield and see if we get a drop in
temperature<00:04:06.409> of<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.120> box<00:04:08.390> here<00:04:08.750> from

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
temperature of the of the box here from

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.380 
temperature of the of the box here from
that<00:04:09.290> 95<00:04:09.890> degrees<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.430> we<00:04:10.549> just<00:04:10.819> indicated

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
that 95 degrees that we just indicated

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.690 
that 95 degrees that we just indicated
so<00:04:11.989> we'll<00:04:12.110> go<00:04:12.230> ahead<00:04:12.319> and<00:04:12.440> install<00:04:12.950> that<00:04:12.980> I'm

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
so we'll go ahead and install that I'm

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.550 
so we'll go ahead and install that I'm
gonna<00:04:13.849> run<00:04:14.090> again<00:04:14.390> and<00:04:14.720> we'll<00:04:15.200> see<00:04:15.409> where

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
gonna run again and we'll see where

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:37.560 
gonna run again and we'll see where
we're<00:04:15.680> at<00:04:33.190> here<00:04:34.930> there<00:04:35.930> we<00:04:36.020> go<00:04:36.169> five<00:04:36.740> degrees

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
we're at here there we go five degrees

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:54.340 
we're at here there we go five degrees
right<00:04:38.570> there<00:04:49.330> okay<00:04:50.360> this<00:04:50.780> is<00:04:51.760> again<00:04:53.229> 200<00:04:54.229> oh

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
right there okay this is again 200 oh

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.790 
right there okay this is again 200 oh
well<00:04:54.710> over<00:04:54.949> 200<00:04:55.630> here

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
well over 200 here

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.170 
well over 200 here
275<00:04:58.360> depending<00:04:59.360> on<00:04:59.419> where<00:04:59.600> I<00:04:59.630> aim<00:05:00.139> it<00:05:00.169> exactly

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
275 depending on where I aim it exactly

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:10.120 
275 depending on where I aim it exactly
it's<00:05:02.180> gonna<00:05:02.300> depend<00:05:02.990> on<00:05:03.260> what<00:05:03.320> that<00:05:08.919> hot<00:05:09.919> this

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
it's gonna depend on what that hot this

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.070 
it's gonna depend on what that hot this
is<00:05:10.310> getting<00:05:11.950> okay<00:05:13.539> there<00:05:14.539> we<00:05:14.630> go

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
is getting okay there we go

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.339 
is getting okay there we go
and<00:05:15.770> right<00:05:16.370> here<00:05:16.639> on<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.940> heat<00:05:17.120> shield<00:05:17.349> I'm

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
and right here on the heat shield I'm

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:25.180 
and right here on the heat shield I'm
getting<00:05:18.889> about<00:05:19.010> I<00:05:19.720> saw<00:05:20.720> flashes<00:05:21.200> of<00:05:21.289> 120<00:05:24.190> so

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
getting about I saw flashes of 120 so

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.750 
getting about I saw flashes of 120 so
the<00:05:25.280> heat<00:05:25.430> shield<00:05:25.729> is<00:05:25.880> heating<00:05:26.180> up<00:05:27.610> but<00:05:28.610> I'm

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
the heat shield is heating up but I'm

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.879 
the heat shield is heating up but I'm
not<00:05:28.880> getting<00:05:29.060> a<00:05:29.300> whole<00:05:29.479> lot<00:05:29.539> of<00:05:29.840> change<00:05:30.289> in

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
not getting a whole lot of change in

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.409 
not getting a whole lot of change in
temperature<00:05:31.580> in<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.180> Box<00:05:32.419> just<00:05:33.250> depends<00:05:34.250> on

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
temperature in the Box just depends on

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.210 
temperature in the Box just depends on
exactly<00:05:35.419> where<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:35.990> aim<00:05:36.289> this<00:05:36.590> so<00:05:37.099> the

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
exactly where I aim this so the

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.589 
exactly where I aim this so the
temperature<00:05:37.520> in<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.669> box<00:05:37.910> isn't<00:05:38.120> dropping

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
temperature in the box isn't dropping

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:39.700 
temperature in the box isn't dropping
because<00:05:38.690> I<00:05:38.780> don't<00:05:38.960> think<00:05:39.139> it's<00:05:39.289> hot<00:05:39.470> enough

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
because I don't think it's hot enough

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.409 
because I don't think it's hot enough
outside<00:05:40.330> to<00:05:41.330> really<00:05:42.699> get<00:05:43.699> a<00:05:43.729> good<00:05:43.940> indication

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
outside to really get a good indication

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.469 
outside to really get a good indication
on<00:05:44.870> this<00:05:45.199> testing<00:05:45.760> there's<00:05:46.760> such<00:05:46.970> a<00:05:47.000> cool<00:05:47.270> day

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
on this testing there's such a cool day

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.420 
on this testing there's such a cool day
out<00:05:47.750> I<00:05:48.050> think<00:05:48.470> this<00:05:48.620> testing<00:05:48.949> will<00:05:49.039> go<00:05:49.190> a<00:05:49.220> lot

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
out I think this testing will go a lot

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.750 
out I think this testing will go a lot
better<00:05:49.729> if<00:05:49.940> we<00:05:50.289> check<00:05:51.289> it<00:05:51.500> when<00:05:52.490> the<00:05:52.610> weather

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
better if we check it when the weather

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.830 
better if we check it when the weather
is<00:05:53.090> above<00:05:53.570> 75<00:05:54.110> degrees<00:05:54.560> which<00:05:55.520> right<00:05:56.000> now<00:05:56.030> it's

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
is above 75 degrees which right now it's

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.159 
is above 75 degrees which right now it's
not<00:05:56.960> predicted<00:05:57.470> to<00:05:57.560> be<00:05:57.710> any<00:05:58.070> hotter<00:05:58.400> than<00:05:59.169> 61

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
not predicted to be any hotter than 61

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.279 
not predicted to be any hotter than 61
today<00:06:00.669> so<00:06:01.669> I'll<00:06:01.789> try<00:06:01.970> this<00:06:02.030> testing<00:06:02.630> again<00:06:02.930> has

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
today so I'll try this testing again has

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:05.560 
today so I'll try this testing again has
some<00:06:03.320> at<00:06:03.770> a<00:06:03.800> later<00:06:04.070> date<00:06:04.340> when<00:06:04.789> you<00:06:05.060> get<00:06:05.330> got

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
some at a later date when you get got

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.770 
some at a later date when you get got
more<00:06:06.370> conclusive<00:06:07.370> evidence<00:06:07.490> that<00:06:08.180> the<00:06:08.630> heat

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
more conclusive evidence that the heat

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.779 
more conclusive evidence that the heat
shield<00:06:09.050> is<00:06:09.199> working<00:06:09.650> and<00:06:09.919> doing<00:06:10.400> what<00:06:10.669> it's

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
shield is working and doing what it's

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:13.419 
shield is working and doing what it's
supposed<00:06:11.030> to<00:06:11.120> be<00:06:11.240> doing
