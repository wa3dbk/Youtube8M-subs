00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.330 
pretty sure this chemistry is closer
maybe<00:01:30.509> 100<00:01:30.930> semper<00:01:31.229> FX<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:32.070> pretty<00:01:32.189> sure

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
maybe 100 semper FX so I'm pretty sure

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.069 
maybe 100 semper FX so I'm pretty sure
this<00:01:32.700> team<00:01:32.880> would<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.420> foal<00:01:33.600> chemistry

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
this team would get the foal chemistry

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.330 
this team would get the foal chemistry
but<00:01:34.259> then<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.500> ill<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:34.799> 10<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> don't<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.250> what

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
but then if ill get 10 I don't know what

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.249 
but then if ill get 10 I don't know what
10<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.640> all<00:01:35.759> about<00:01:36.000> some<00:01:36.509> stupid<00:01:36.689> oil<00:01:36.990> tea<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
10 is all about some stupid oil tea I

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.390 
10 is all about some stupid oil tea I
haven't<00:01:37.470> quite<00:01:37.590> looked<00:01:37.770> into<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.070> enough

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
haven't quite looked into that enough

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.730 
haven't quite looked into that enough
yet<00:01:38.640> which<00:01:39.119> goes<00:01:39.240> 80<00:01:39.420> paces<00:01:39.720> got<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> high<00:01:40.439> work

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
yet which goes 80 paces got a high work

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.990 
yet which goes 80 paces got a high work
rate<00:01:40.770> which<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.340> little<00:01:41.520> bit<00:01:41.640> annoying<00:01:41.850> but

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
rate which is a little bit annoying but

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.190 
rate which is a little bit annoying but
me<00:01:42.150> over<00:01:42.299> two<00:01:42.360> defenders<00:01:42.720> don't<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.079> high

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
me over two defenders don't have high

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.950 
me over two defenders don't have high
work<00:01:43.409> rate<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.619> don't<00:01:43.799> think<00:01:44.040> that's<00:01:44.610> pretty

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
work rate so don't think that's pretty

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.210 
work rate so don't think that's pretty
good<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:46.530> Ramos<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.040> side

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
