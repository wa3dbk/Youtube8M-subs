you<00:02:25.290> just<00:02:25.739> open<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.430> like<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.269> can

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
you just open it like that and you can

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.290 
you just open it like that and you can
take<00:02:27.870> them<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.290> or<00:02:28.470> off<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.879> just<00:02:30.060> close

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
take them on or off and to just close

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.759 
take them on or off and to just close
them<00:02:30.510> together<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:30.989> just<00:02:31.019> kind<00:02:31.379> of<00:02:31.440> smash

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
them together you just kind of smash

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.259 
them together you just kind of smash
them<00:02:32.069> together<00:02:32.340> but<00:02:32.640> make<00:02:32.819> sure<00:02:32.849> that<00:02:33.090> they're

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
them together but make sure that they're

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.780 
them together but make sure that they're
really<00:02:33.569> secure<00:02:34.519> so<00:02:35.519> now<00:02:35.640> we<00:02:36.599> are<00:02:36.870> going<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.790> put

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
really secure so now we are going to put

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.470 
really secure so now we are going to put
all<00:02:39.000> these<00:02:39.180> strands<00:02:39.660> together<00:02:40.050> in<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:40.980> so

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.290 

I'm<00:02:45.480> going<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.020> take<00:02:46.320> each<00:02:46.590> hoop<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.670> open<00:02:48.150> it

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
I'm going to take each hoop and open it

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.910 
I'm going to take each hoop and open it
and<00:02:48.480> attach<00:02:49.230> all<00:02:49.530> these<00:02:49.830> five<00:02:50.070> strands<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.860> I'm

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
and attach all these five strands so I'm

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.530 
and attach all these five strands so I'm
taking<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.370> open<00:02:56.520> hoop<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:57.030> open<00:02:57.330> with<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
taking the open hoop I open with the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.740 
taking the open hoop I open with the
pliers<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.380> I'm<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.490> going<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.880> slide<00:03:00.270> this

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
pliers and I'm just going to slide this

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:13.750 
pliers and I'm just going to slide this
on<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:03.740> keep<00:03:04.740> sliding<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.430> rest<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.940> them<00:03:06.120> on

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.520 

so<00:03:14.209> once<00:03:14.360> we<00:03:14.510> have<00:03:14.629> all<00:03:14.810> of<00:03:14.840> them<00:03:15.110> on<00:03:15.140> there<00:03:15.440> I'm

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
so once we have all of them on there I'm

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.229 
so once we have all of them on there I'm
gonna<00:03:15.650> close<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:20.300> loop

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
gonna close the loop

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:30.880 
gonna close the loop
we<00:03:22.659> want<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.900> close<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.260> extra<00:03:23.739> guide

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.210 

okay<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:32.600> is<00:03:32.780> nice<00:03:32.960> and<00:03:33.170> closed<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.920> has

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
okay so this is nice and closed and has

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.860 
okay so this is nice and closed and has
all<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:35.000> strands<00:03:36.400> now<00:03:38.650> we<00:03:39.650> can<00:03:40.750> we're<00:03:41.750> going

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
all the strands now we can we're going

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.559 
all the strands now we can we're going
to<00:03:41.959> take<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.650> bracelet<00:03:43.270> we're<00:03:44.270> going<00:03:44.480> to

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
to take the bracelet we're going to

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:52.680 
to take the bracelet we're going to
string<00:03:45.050> this<00:03:45.680> on<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.280> you're<00:03:46.370> gonna<00:03:46.459> go<00:03:46.670> under

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.270 

and<00:03:53.690> just<00:03:54.290> put<00:03:54.530> that<00:03:54.620> on<00:03:54.680> you'll<00:03:54.980> figure<00:03:55.130> out

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
and just put that on you'll figure out

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.430 
and just put that on you'll figure out
the<00:03:55.459> placement<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.030> little<00:03:56.270> bit<00:03:56.390> later<00:03:56.600> and<00:03:59.440> so

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
the placement a little bit later and so

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.540 
the placement a little bit later and so
all<00:04:00.709> of<00:04:00.920> these<00:04:03.400> need<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.760> attach<00:04:05.480> to<00:04:06.550> this

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
all of these need to attach to this

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.350 
all of these need to attach to this
little<00:04:09.190> this<00:04:10.190> part<00:04:10.580> right<00:04:10.760> here<00:04:11.590> so<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:13.360> guess

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
little this part right here so I guess

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.780 
little this part right here so I guess
we<00:04:14.540> could<00:04:14.660> have<00:04:14.720> left<00:04:14.930> this<00:04:15.140> open<00:04:15.380> but<00:04:15.860> we'll

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
we could have left this open but we'll

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.680 
we could have left this open but we'll
open<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.299> up<00:04:17.480> again<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:21.230> big<00:04:21.859> enough<00:04:22.100> to<00:04:22.690> so

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
open this up again and big enough to so

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.090 
open this up again and big enough to so
that<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:23.960> fits<00:04:24.169> over<00:04:24.380> this

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.240 

so<00:04:30.790> that's<00:04:30.970> in<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.950> again<00:04:32.950> you're<00:04:33.160> gonna

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
so that's in and again you're gonna

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.070 
so that's in and again you're gonna
close<00:04:34.240> this<00:04:34.690> shut<00:04:35.440> really<00:04:36.190> good<00:04:36.660> so<00:04:37.660> that<00:04:37.870> it

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
close this shut really good so that it

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.600 
close this shut really good so that it
doesn't<00:04:38.380> go<00:04:38.500> anywhere<00:04:38.830> especially<00:04:39.460> when

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
doesn't go anywhere especially when

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:50.010 
doesn't go anywhere especially when
you're<00:04:39.730> wearing<00:04:39.880> it

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.890 

so<00:04:51.020> that's<00:04:51.199> attached<00:04:51.590> on<00:04:52.009> there<00:04:52.539> and<00:04:53.539> this<00:04:53.660> is

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
so that's attached on there and this is

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.830 
so that's attached on there and this is
going<00:04:54.229> I<00:04:54.500> measured<00:04:55.280> these<00:04:55.910> two<00:04:56.240> equal<00:04:56.659> the

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
going I measured these two equal the

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.920 
going I measured these two equal the
length<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.349> this<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:58.180> these<00:04:59.180> I'm<00:04:59.569> going<00:04:59.810> to

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
length of this and these I'm going to

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.260 
length of this and these I'm going to
attach<00:05:00.139> on<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.470> this<00:05:00.830> hoop<00:05:01.159> and<00:05:01.370> then<00:05:01.909> attach

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
attach on to this hoop and then attach

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.439 
attach on to this hoop and then attach
to<00:05:02.750> one<00:05:03.110> of<00:05:03.440> these<00:05:04.129> holes<00:05:04.870> so<00:05:07.030> but<00:05:08.030> before<00:05:08.150> I<00:05:08.389> do

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
to one of these holes so but before I do

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.330 
to one of these holes so but before I do
that<00:05:08.569> I'm<00:05:08.780> going<00:05:08.900> to<00:05:08.960> take<00:05:09.259> also<00:05:09.500> a<00:05:09.740> silver

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
that I'm going to take also a silver

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.200 
that I'm going to take also a silver
chain<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:12.669> put<00:05:13.669> this<00:05:13.879> on<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.930> other<00:05:14.960> side<00:05:15.740> of

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
chain and put this on the other side of

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.420 
chain and put this on the other side of
the<00:05:17.210> watch<00:05:17.710> so<00:05:18.710> this<00:05:18.979> one's<00:05:19.159> a<00:05:19.220> little<00:05:19.250> bit

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
the watch so this one's a little bit

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.460 
the watch so this one's a little bit
trickier<00:05:19.970> because<00:05:20.240> it<00:05:20.780> is<00:05:20.930> thicker<00:05:22.300> but<00:05:23.470> this

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
trickier because it is thicker but this

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:35.529 
trickier because it is thicker but this
is<00:05:24.650> open<00:05:27.310> we're<00:05:28.310> gonna<00:05:28.460> sit<00:05:28.880> that<00:05:29.090> on<00:05:33.699> and<00:05:34.699> the

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
is open we're gonna sit that on and the

is open we're gonna sit that on and the
pliers<00:05:35.900> are<00:05:36.409> going<00:05:36.710> to<00:05:37.039> close<00:05:37.400> that<00:05:37.430> shut<00:05:40.330> okay

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
pliers are going to close that shut okay
