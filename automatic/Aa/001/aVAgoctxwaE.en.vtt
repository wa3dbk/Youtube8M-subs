 marcelo and piqué are just some of the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.700
 current stars of the panorama 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.020
 football players who have participated in the 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.939
 international youth soccer tournament 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.369
 mitch and that with the passage of time 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.689
 have consecrated as peron figures and that 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.220
 It also welcomes players who have made 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.169
 history in their clubs like that my 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.329
 race in liverpool and frank against 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.099
 LEDs in the sports of Coruña 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.600
 two players have visited this year 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.579
 different fields of the Costa Brava 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.770
 exercising as parents and watching in 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.840
 action to his sons james freighter and nico 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.550
 gonzález who play in the alevín del 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.390
 liverpool and the children of barcelona 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.390
 respectively 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:10.659
 scientists say they can only 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.180
 be manufactured and that the fans of a country 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.909
 false of grace experience I think it's a 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.289
 magnificent tournament I already had the 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.899
 opportunity to be here now 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.750
 also two years because he also told me 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.270
 that participated here being being alevín 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.210
 and now I again going Infantino 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.009
 and following not only the kid but 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.440
 also a little bit the whole tournament for me 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.100
 I think it's something spectacular that they had 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.520
 got 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.729
 so many teams from all over the world 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.409
 and I think a unique experience for 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.170
 all these kids that come here the 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.479
 I do not think it should be anything 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.330
 easy to organize all this and in addition 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.119
 coming so many teams and I say no 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.880
 many times to tournaments that I go out there 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.340
 what envy so healthy because 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.100
 good 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.520
 see how everything works 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.579
 what are they doing and well I did not have 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.709
 never the chance to play something 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.750
 similar to this and I think it's a 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.019
 unique experience for all these 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.019
 kids
