 a galera enjoying the video there 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.990
 to speak of the echo way of the zanim jaconÃ© a 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.120
 A lot of people ask about a button that 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.080

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.110
 another reason that good is just there 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.110
 selected 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.190
 photo method had recruited so no 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.790
 has 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.960
 the session being able to see that in the 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.730
 well-off xv is seeing that 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.880
 has 13 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.640
 the triangle and the left side of 8786 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.630
 3131 black little light made of three 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.490
 marbles 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.800
 that means it's the way she's bike 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:07.470
 economic is already a consumer group 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:09.450
 good thing is that neither the uno uno has launched a one 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:15.630
 economy flex I do not know the demand there 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:18.060
 by car but it 's not just my friend give a 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.930
 little more slowly scaring 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.400
 velocity 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.600
 Now I do not know if there's room here for 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.760
 show you guys but I give a 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.560
 accelerated now disappeared for example have 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.210
 eight in eight thousand and 500 rpm assumed it 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.670
 is consuming more gasoline 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.010
 if I take a quick turn if I had it 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.890
 40 is in economical mode and is a 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.900
 fast bitch he he leaves the world 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:45.050
 that is spending more than 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:48.620
 that's just a way you can talk 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.620
 now I'll give a way 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.519
 that rise here right? 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.140
 there went into economic mode seeing 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.970
 that they are accelerating that they are 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.420
 climb or take your hand 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.670
 it accelerated again and went out and sometimes 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.810
 to the whole plan here it a whole plan 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.430
 not keep in the environmental and 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.820
 economic 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.489
 So that's it folks it 's not a thing that 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.620
 you select to select the mode 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.900
 subtle way to increase the number of 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.790
 horses do not do any of this 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.290
 It's just a tt test to help consume 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.530
 less gasoline if this is your 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:33.350
 goal that is difficult for those who for one 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.730
 ninja but sometimes the guy wants a 300 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.160
 in money bought 300 do not want to buy 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.320
 and it is to buy India but he will use it in 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.730
 day to day at work does not catch on 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.580
 corridor because to get corridor for me 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.460
 It is already blurred antenna changes right 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.169
