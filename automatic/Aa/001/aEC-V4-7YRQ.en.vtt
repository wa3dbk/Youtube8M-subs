00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.679
 Today I'll show you how to get one 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.519
 Avocado prepared for consumption 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.410
 avocado also called butter fruit 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.480
 an insanely high fat content up to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.850
 30 percent and above all things 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.320
 includes this fruit several times 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.970
 unsaturated fatty acids 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.480
 that is very much for our body 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.590
 important above all things the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.869
 omega-3 fatty acids if you have a fruit 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.309
 looking for the omega-3 fatty acids it has 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.850
 the avocado the avocado consists of 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.059
 a creamy bodied pulp and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.410
 a hard inedible kernel and how 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.730
 we can get this out of the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.730
 fruit I show you now 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.680
 actually relatively easy we put the 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.079
 put avocado on our cutting board 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.020
 the knife and go slowly without 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.649
 pressure into the fruit until we reach the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:05.040
 resistance of the core then note 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:11.159
 let's cut it all around without 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:14.720
 pressure so that we arrive here again 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.450
 where we started 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.520
 Now we open the avocado we 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.659
 See our take a hand and over 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.450
 a rotary motion we lift a fruit 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.060
 side from summer a fruit side without 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.880
 cores and one with swept core 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.409
 do me something with something 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.210
 I 've got the lemon juice 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.549
 that's just prepared 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.180
 because it makes the fruit easy 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.850
 not brown will be during our fruit 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.700
 now lies here and on the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.219
 further preparation is waiting for you 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.729
 but at the core, the tree is still in it 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.119
 rausholen 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.890
 I see many people or cooks that 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.110
 Of course they can take care of themselves 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.210
 grab avocado half in a hand 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.490
 had the big sharp knife 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.319
 here once 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.319
 that you should like to do for beginners 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.760
 I do not recommend that it could be 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.500
 that he not only hits the core and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.819
 the avocado shares but also the same 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.500
 Your finger with the sÃ¤belt is completely 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.930
 unusable for further progress 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.670
 the court that is we lay the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.650
 avocado just on the ground on the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.180
 on board on the floor put the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:36.099
 knife and chop it once so that 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.780
 hang it up nicely and remove it now 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:45.959
 we turn the core over a rotary motion and 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.959
 Get him out of the avocado well 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:54.540
 we also do the side nice again 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.920
 Grease 1 1 to train 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.660
 Now we have the opportunity 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.680
 peel off there are many that 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.700
 catch with a mistake of 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.819
 flesh here from the bowl nice 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.380
 There are also here to remove 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.239
 possibility just a spoon to 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:16.180
 assume to be cleaner outside long 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:20.230
 to drive here this flesh 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.220
 to pick up the shell in the shell 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.840
 nothing will be complete anymore 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.389
 and can now do that too 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.130
 press or cut small and for the 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:35.670
 further processing of a prescription 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:38.709
 Use if your omega-3 new body 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:44.630
 actually want to record because 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:47.260
 omega-3 needs her vocal here in the 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.260
 ready
