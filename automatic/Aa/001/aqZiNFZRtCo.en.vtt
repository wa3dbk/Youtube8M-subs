00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
one area coaches that were very very

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.870 
one area coaches that were very very
concerned<00:01:32.810> with<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:33.620> playing<00:01:34.250> in<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.610> system

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
concerned with in playing in this system

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.780 
concerned with in playing in this system
is<00:01:35.270> obviously<00:01:36.200> in<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.740> wide<00:01:36.979> areas<00:01:37.520> on<00:01:37.700> the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
is obviously in the wide areas on the

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.330 
is obviously in the wide areas on the
flanks<00:01:38.210> with<00:01:38.930> three<00:01:39.470> central<00:01:40.040> players

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
flanks with three central players

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.810 
flanks with three central players
numerically<00:01:41.270> will<00:01:41.990> match<00:01:42.260> up<00:01:42.670> regardless<00:01:43.670> of

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
numerically will match up regardless of

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.180 
numerically will match up regardless of
what<00:01:43.970> they<00:01:44.120> play<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:45.020> reason<00:01:45.470> I<00:01:45.560> like<00:01:45.860> this

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
what they play the reason I like this

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.490 
what they play the reason I like this
for<00:01:46.460> us<00:01:46.640> is<00:01:46.940> if<00:01:47.510> they<00:01:47.630> play<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:47.869> five<00:01:48.229> man

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
for us is if they play a five man

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.219 
for us is if they play a five man
midfield<00:01:49.070> with<00:01:49.250> three<00:01:49.610> in<00:01:49.880> we're<00:01:50.690> matched<00:01:50.930> up

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
midfield with three in we're matched up

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.440 
midfield with three in we're matched up
if<00:01:51.470> they<00:01:52.070> play<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.310> four<00:01:52.610> man<00:01:52.820> midfield<00:01:53.299> with

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
if they play a four man midfield with

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.990 
if they play a four man midfield with
two<00:01:53.750> in<00:01:53.990> we've<00:01:54.619> got<00:01:54.650> numerical<00:01:55.400> advantage<00:01:55.880> in

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
two in we've got numerical advantage in

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.670 
two in we've got numerical advantage in
the<00:01:56.360> middle<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.720> park<00:01:56.990> which<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:57.380> what<00:01:57.530> we
