00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.690
 already a second december but I have 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.069
 Yes, I announced that 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.540
 advent calendar together with someone 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.690
 do it together with others 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.460
 philipp of pine trees that is a layer of 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.320
 Do the odd days as I said 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.859
 so on I am 24.6 and so on 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.470
 and today it's the first time 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.970
 that I'm doing an advent video like 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.460
 promised there is a tutorial and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.810
 Although today of a comic figure to it 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:35.790
 but more, and I hope so 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:37.200
 I like you think you have that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.760
 video title already read i show you 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.260
 today how to draw greg heffley for 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.520
 all of them that is not sachs right now 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.559
 protagonist from the books and movies 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.090
 By the way, greg's diary is one 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.410
 Giant recommendation of me is mega 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.239
 funny yes and then I would say 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.340
 We start with everything you need 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.320
 a sheet of paper and a black pen 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.940
 if you wanted to sign with pencil 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.890
 of course , a pencil but me 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.620
 Guess everyone has something there and then 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.809
 Just start so greg has two 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.500
 simple black dots as eyes so in 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.270
 approximately 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.070
 then you have to think in which 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.390
 direction break but should look 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.770
 look in that direction then 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.270
 you must have the nose and the left 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.200
 Eye draw should be in this direction 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.150
 you already have her nose and that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.549
 right eye draw equal decisions 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.450
 Just let me know that he is 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:23.670
 here to the left looks so there we had 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.439
 here the nose and now finally comes 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.490
 the hardest part is the head 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.200
 that is in the original namely one 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.579
 perfect circle but you have to 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.439
 of course also say that the original 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.060
 Draftsman, if I fall grad unfortunately the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.740
 name not one but i will use it and in 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.390
 the infobox write the whole thing again 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.560
 digitally edit that can 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.759
 of course not on the paper 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.450
 possible but I'll just give it now 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.740
 my best 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.960
 He does not draw the circle 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.340
 completely through but here between 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.720
 nose and forehead there is the values 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.340
 Mr whose name I do not know right now 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.159
 do not think of the circle 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.140
 Let's see if that sees 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.710
 Okay, that does not really look like it 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.259
 a circle but you know what meant 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.210
 is what's next next 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.729
 that's opposite your nose so 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.039
 here a place just draws here 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.390
 such a round ear quite simply there must 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.010
 Of course you also think like greg 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.450
 be straight on it should it should be: 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.310
 happy his gave him a fat 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.349
 grin reader is not in a good mood and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.970
 gave him a fat grin 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.200
 I'll decide for that now 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.430
 to give him a smile because it is 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.150
 yes soon there is no Christmas 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.069
 reason to mourn so easy here once 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.019
 a big grin then comes naturally 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.989
 still the characteristic hairstyle of 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.730
 Greg has been around for three years 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.799
 one is in this direction as a 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.610
 a bit the middle what others in the 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.739
 other direction 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.180
 who already finished in the head of greg then 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.220
 it continues with the body of the 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.930
 actually completely parallel 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.620
 curved lines exist when you 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.329
 that can say that 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.890
 So I'll understand what I mean 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.110
 so mean so here in the middle 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.030
 the moon could approach the body 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.910
 about that here is now the sleeveless 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.079
 from his t-shirt and you see that 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.060
 I mean with these parallel 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.519
 curved lines here this line 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.120
 parallel to the and the belly is there 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:13.700
 in turn, in about the same way 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:19.310
 the same is true with the arm yes 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:21.620
 let's say up here about then 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.299
 Greg like most comic characters four 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.790
 So that's a thing 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.319
 This is tradition in comics 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.269
 because four fingers are just enough 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.760
 to show everything a comic figure 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.889
 must be able to show forefinger needs 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.690
 you in the middle finger and ring finger too 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.180
 even a little bit funny looks so 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.849
 an animal ex but the fifth finger is 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.319
 actually a bit 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:50.470
 superfluous thumb 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:52.220
 and here are the other three fingers 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.690
 very simple 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.090
 then of course that shows me 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.319
 t-shirt to end that is about until 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.470
 the end of his thumb and the pants the 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.200
 also runs in this 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.430
 let's say about here from the curve 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.130
 middle finger on 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.210
 He usually wears short pants so that 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.550
 she is one leg 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:17.350
 Here is the second one and then what 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.180
 Happened that the direction 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.560
 is changed so to speak so then 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.150
 it is no longer in this curve 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.170
 but looks exactly in the other greg 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.410
 Overall, like one 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:34.650
 mirrored cez so here begins 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:39.640
 in one leg has quite long legs like that 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:42.780
 he also wears socks and here it is 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.780
 second leg 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.200
 Of course, then still missing the shoes 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.980
 they are not exactly at greg 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.390
 so complicated there are no 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.760
 shoelaces or something like that sign 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.830
 just have to circle here 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.190
 say I'm not a circle are 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.110
 yes but say yes and yes that would not have 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.640
 ornate or so and they are 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.070
 just so big that they themselves 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:10.150
 can hold on it so quite small 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.650
 held so then in the original comic has 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.930
 greg mostly a black pants 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.380
 that's why you 'll be here for a while 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.380
 out 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:22.129
 punktum 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:42.449
 only the leg here and I would 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.370
 say greg is already finished 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.900
 Everything you can do then is 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.520
 that we might give them a little bit 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.199
 Decorated because if he just to 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.229
 School could go to him for my sake 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:57.800
 a backpack just draw here like this 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:06:00.210
 a strappy and a round backpack 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.729
 that could also be because of me 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.180
 so it is one thinks so 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.770
 at least in the original comics i 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.590
 always say comics is not really 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.139
 conventional humor was synonymous texts in 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.169
 the books are but it has so 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.110
 little comics bit better 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.909
 illustrated as other books 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:26.069
 maybe that's how it is 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:27.029
 secret of success I would say that is 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.159
 it already 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:31.560
 So greg is really pretty simple 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:33.750
 This method can be a comic people 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.099
 of course a bit at the moment too 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.060
 if you change someone else 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:37.740
 you just want to draw one 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.860
 other hairstyle on it a bit different 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.389
 eyebrows faces 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.919
 Have a look at Crack's brother 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.750
 actually just exactly as only called 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.639
 that in the long pants has eyebrows 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.339
 and city ​​these three years so here 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.589
 five single hairs so you can 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:53.789
 vary as you like 

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:58.080
 but in all cases forget of course 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:07:00.029
 not and now your signature and me 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.080
 I would say that's it, I hope so 

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:02.849
 helped 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.639
 if so send me a mail 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:07.169
 Pictures of yours just try on 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:08.699
 facebook twitter instagram somewhere 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:10.199
 I would be happy to see if that is included 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:11.310
 you worked and I would say 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:13.729
 See you next time 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.729
 shines
