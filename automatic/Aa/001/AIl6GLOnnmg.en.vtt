00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:17.019
 Ah yes 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.239
 hi to all and fabien for the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.890
 presentation of a pretty safe fun glitch 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.320
 that the litigation black ops 2 so that 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.880
 only works in private part and 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.890
 it only works with the 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.850
 teleporte english unfortunately but 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.199
 you'll see it's still a 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.360
 glitch that can be worth it 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.480
 so to achieve this glitch you will have to 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.300
 simply instructed the teleports 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.660
 english and have classes so no 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.120
 all 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.559
 without a main weapon it is important because 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.879
 otherwise the glitch will not work so 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.909
 I will introduce you to several glitch 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.970
 so at first glitch only with the 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.530
 c4 so without any weapon without any 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.390
 asset but it's not mandatory you 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.250
 can put other assets 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.620
 equipment and its traces it does not affect 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.270
 nothing on the glitch so once 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.470
 it's done starting the game you 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.340
 you put in a team if you are 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.170
 so is there that mercenary militia or 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.240
 hesbaye here so that one to forget and 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.950
 in fact that you do you ask the c4 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.500
 that you have in your class and you 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.280
 the side you are going to die then but 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.479
 thanks to the TV porting beach you go 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.979
 reappear in the same place as 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.149
 the place where you died so as soon as 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.479
 you reappear give yourself a shot 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.850
 of heart 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.350
 you saw that it's the cut way 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.869
 counter strike of which you hold your 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.640
 knife like on counter as on 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.380
 Counter strike is frankly very 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.100
 very fun to realize so it's really 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.780
 not hard 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.670
 certainly it only works in 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.630
 private party it's a shame that 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.859
 will work online that's it 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.149
 frankly great since I 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.979
 find that personally it's my 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.359
 opinion it makes a lot better like that 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.399
 so it works the same for 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.229
 ballistic knives 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.570
 you place your c4 you leave it 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.310
 you will die you reappear at 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.840
 same place and give you a shot of 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.579
 heart and you will see that you hold 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.899
 so your quest counter-strike so 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.280
 it's a bit buggy when you 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.750
 it's natural that it can not be 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.020
 perfect since the game is not 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.000
 planned to precisely hold his knife 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.620
 like that and you see that in fact the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.140
 change from normal knife 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.250
 that's when you did not shoot a 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.950
 hitting with your knife 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.930
 ballistic and well you see the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.190
 knife is the blade so you see them 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.450
 two and that's really enough 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.370
 weird it's really very nice gay 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.260
 so you've seen examples of everything 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.730
 which is possible for the moment while 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.900
 what was discovered a congratulations 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.569
 to mister thomas in passing 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.299
 with this glitch so again here again 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.980
 another variant with a weapon and its 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.530
 knife two points once you 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.659
 next to you will die 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.760
 reappear you recruit and you 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.680
 hold the same knife again except 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.939
 that the particularity the security you have 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.980
 seen just now when you shoot 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.450
 with your ballistic knife you see 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.370
 both blades and well there you can 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.510
 shoot with tears and as you go 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.069
 that you are going to shoot so 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.840
 personally I aimed to do 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.459
 to appear tears then when I was aiming 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.750
 not she did not show up well you 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.579
 see that you are holding your knife and 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.470
 your crooked weapon so that's 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.209
 frankly enough what the fuck and that's 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.299
 still very nice to do so 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.790
 ditto for the assault shield so the 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.200
 assault shield it's pretty special 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.030
 you will immediately see why 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.950
 so every time I show you that I 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.540
 I'm years old when I throw the party 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.299
 I change equipped to put myself in 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.709
 mercenary I put my c4 and the cut 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.639
 so here this time I will not you 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.510
 I'm going to give a shield 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.639
 on this one 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.629
 so I will die as soon as their 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.489
 devices give a stab 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.629
 I again hold my knife so 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.700
 counter strike anyway at every 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.780
 sometimes it will be the same except for the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.620
 last method that will be found at the 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.819
 end of the video but I will 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.099
 explain it as I do you 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.150
 currently for this method so if 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.560
 once you have your cost in 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.690
 does you see that when you try 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.730
 to lay your shield your knife 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.379
 trembling so leave you heroin 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.269
 do you support being able to ask your 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.470
 shield happened at a time when 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.849
 you will arrive at a place where this 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.250
 that you can not put the shield 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.109
 you publish so who should normand 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.699
 flashing red and well will appear 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.290
 on your hand and it will blink in 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.909
 red then you can let go of 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.739
 even herin button never you can not 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.419
 set of shields well it's going to hold the 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.819
 shield from across and when you that 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.530
 when you leave by depardon is 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.479
 well the shield get in the way 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.039
 in the other direction it is frank enough 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.840
 what the fuck pay attention to 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.539
 against when you put the shield on 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.460
 well ground the shield and the knife 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.560
 cancel out the glitch is thus over 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.449
 and the last method so that's 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.650
 to have a lightning strike so you take 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:28.979
 the class or what you do not have 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.599
 weapon 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.979
 so the class only with a 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.199
 equipment any equipment 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.300
 this time if you get a 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.130
 lightning so the simplest it is 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.690
 to use both flags with the 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.129
 teleports king leach and when you 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.779
 have started the lightning strike on you 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.639
 you keep the equipment in your 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:45.839
 hand until the lightning kills you and 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.729
 when you will reappear your 

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:49.319
 knives will tremble so here are the 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.669
 enemies I hope these little glitch 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.899
 you will like me I find at 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.769
 very soon for future videos 

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:54.769
 go in everyone
