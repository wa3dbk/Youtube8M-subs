own

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.220 
own
you<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.180> usually<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.539> most<00:00:54.840> cost

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you know that's usually the most cost

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.750 
you know that's usually the most cost
effective<00:00:55.350> way<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.010> also<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> best<00:00:56.610> way<00:00:56.670> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
effective way and also the best way to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.920 
effective way and also the best way to
ensure<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.120> you're<00:00:57.300> getting<00:00:57.329> things<00:00:57.780> that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
ensure that you're getting things that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.689 
ensure that you're getting things that
actually<00:00:58.079> work<00:00:58.440> instead<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.829> prop<00:00:59.190> blends<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
actually work instead of prop blends and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.400 
actually work instead of prop blends and
all<00:00:59.760> these<00:00:59.850> other<00:01:00.030> things<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> typically

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
all these other things so I typically

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.229 
all these other things so I typically
recommend<00:01:01.649> beta<00:01:02.160> alanine<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.850> begs<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
recommend beta alanine but that begs the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.060 
recommend beta alanine but that begs the
question<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.140> actually<00:01:04.559> necessary

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
question is it actually necessary

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.310 
question is it actually necessary
pre-workout<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.240> answer<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.900> no

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
pre-workout and the answer to that is no

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.170 
pre-workout and the answer to that is no
quite<00:01:07.680> honestly<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:08.970> might<00:01:09.150> be

a<00:02:57.970> response<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.600> this<00:02:58.690> where<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.020> makes<00:02:59.200> them

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
a response to this where it makes them

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.320 
a response to this where it makes them
extremely<00:02:59.980> uncomfortable<00:03:00.520> and<00:03:00.940> they<00:03:01.060> can't

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
extremely uncomfortable and they can't

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.910 
extremely uncomfortable and they can't
take<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.780> because<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.260> detracts<00:03:02.530> from<00:03:02.620> their

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920

workout they start freaking out they
feel<00:03:04.570> weird<00:03:04.810> they<00:03:05.380> don't<00:03:05.560> want<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.830> lift<00:03:06.040> like

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
feel weird they don't want to lift like

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.220 
feel weird they don't want to lift like
that<00:03:06.310> while<00:03:06.790> others<00:03:07.210> like<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:07.810> feeling

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
that while others like that feeling

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.630 
that while others like that feeling
because<00:03:08.440> again<00:03:08.800> they<00:03:09.100> feel<00:03:09.310> like<00:03:09.460> it's

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
because again they feel like it's

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.640 
because again they feel like it's
working<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.420> from<00:03:10.750> my<00:03:10.870> standpoint<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.530> way

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
working and from my standpoint the way

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.930 
working and from my standpoint the way
that<00:03:11.800> I<00:03:11.830> look<00:03:12.040> at<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.310> knowing<00:03:12.580> that<00:03:12.850> I'm

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
that I look at it knowing that I'm

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.100 
that I look at it knowing that I'm
taking<00:03:13.239> something<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.780> going<00:03:13.959> to

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
taking something that is going to

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.660 
taking something that is going to
eventually<00:03:14.440> show<00:03:14.650> me<00:03:14.920> some<00:03:15.070> benefit<00:03:15.430> in<00:03:15.550> the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
eventually show me some benefit in the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.850 
eventually show me some benefit in the
long<00:03:15.700> run<00:03:16.120> is<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:17.020> reason<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.560> like<00:03:17.739> to

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
long run is the reason that I like to

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.680 
long run is the reason that I like to
take<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.040> pre-workout<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:18.730> because<00:03:19.420> it's<00:03:19.570> just

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
take a pre-workout and because it's just

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.210 
take a pre-workout and because it's just
more<00:03:19.870> convenient<00:03:20.290> if<00:03:20.560> I'm<00:03:20.709> taking<00:03:21.070> other

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
more convenient if I'm taking other

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.760 
more convenient if I'm taking other
things<00:03:21.550> which<00:03:22.300> I'll<00:03:22.480> do<00:03:22.630> videos<00:03:22.989> on<00:03:23.170> as<00:03:23.440> well

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
things which I'll do videos on as well

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.710 
things which I'll do videos on as well
it's<00:03:24.160> easier<00:03:24.790> for<00:03:24.850> me<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.120> just<00:03:25.209> add<00:03:25.450> it<00:03:25.600> in

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
it's easier for me to just add it in

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.600 
it's easier for me to just add it in
that<00:03:25.870> otherwise<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.709> typically<00:03:27.280> have<00:03:27.489> the

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
that otherwise I typically have the

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.310 
that otherwise I typically have the
tendency<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.030> forget<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.630> do<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.900> later<00:03:29.110> in<00:03:29.290> the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
tendency to forget to do it later in the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.650 
tendency to forget to do it later in the
day<00:03:29.410> so<00:03:29.800> I<00:03:29.950> try<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.250> take<00:03:30.489> any<00:03:30.700> supplements<00:03:31.330> I

again you'll find it in most pre
workouts<00:03:47.920> regardless<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.610> if<00:03:48.730> it's

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
workouts regardless of if it's

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.030 
workouts regardless of if it's
store-bought<00:03:49.269> or<00:03:49.690> not<00:03:50.019> most<00:03:50.500> people<00:03:50.800> will<00:03:50.890> add

it in and it's an easy way for you to

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.750 
it in and it's an easy way for you to
add<00:03:53.350> on<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.590> label<00:03:53.890> that<00:03:54.010> again<00:03:54.280> it'll<00:03:54.610> help

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
add on the label that again it'll help

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.820 
add on the label that again it'll help
increase<00:03:55.239> muscular<00:03:56.110> endurance<00:03:56.230> reduce

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
increase muscular endurance reduce

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.440 
increase muscular endurance reduce
fatigue<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.550> strengthen<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.090> power<00:03:58.209> output

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
fatigue and strengthen the power output

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.000 
fatigue and strengthen the power output
overall<00:03:58.930> so<00:03:59.290> it's<00:03:59.440> kind<00:03:59.560> of<00:03:59.590> one<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.769> those<00:03:59.830> hot

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
overall so it's kind of one of those hot

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.890 
overall so it's kind of one of those hot
topics<00:04:00.400> as<00:04:00.519> well<00:04:00.640> hope<00:04:01.269> that<00:04:01.450> clears<00:04:01.720> some

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
suggest beta-alanine just know again no

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.229 
suggest beta-alanine just know again no
acute<00:04:05.709> effects<00:04:05.980> necessarily<00:04:06.700> but<00:04:07.030> the
