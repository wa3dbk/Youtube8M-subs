00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.580
 I'm removing it for a while now 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:18.910
 with o 2 sensor 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:21.100
 Are sparkling ii sensor N Do we not east 2 has sensor came in After the cab 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.170
 Amount of gasoline 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.910
 When 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:31.390
 Amount of air inhaled 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.390
 Ttea explosion in the combustion chamber cylinder 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:40.010
 Punishment explosion disposal 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.260
 It detects the concentration of oxygen in the lungs to go 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.420
 If it is thin 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.679
 The engine causing the abnormal combustion 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.460
 It also causes damage to break 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.500
 If you see the cost 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.430
 I would say that it is a cab 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.430
 Output does not appear 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.010
 That the power of love engine itself that the vehicle speed is not growth is not out 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.570
 Oiso 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.760
 The numbers are also 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.740
 Data on the cake to pick the best spot 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.710
 It wasn't old 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:23.280
 In the old days, come back with that pit road fully open 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:28.710
 Back by inertia to Toko you have a mechanic to turn off the engine in the pit road before 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.250
 That the Tteyuu get a look at the burning of the mechanical mini plug is at the time 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.250
 fuel 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.890
 The point is 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.540
 If you want to check the concentration of fuel, it will be burned to plum 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.700
 So now 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.200
 This whole data is 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.799
 It is tightly engineers After this area 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.970
 If it is lower than this area 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.950
 There is no power past 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.549
 have ended 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.549
 I am also thick 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.700
 Anta can be 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.380
 It means that in all areas, powershell does not 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.350
 It means that you can understand it instantly 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.940
 This yeah to heaven 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.930
 Black-month dake out there 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.370
 It may be something 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.630
 As for this, the full swing range of 4000 ana 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.080
 At 7,000 to 7,200 rpm 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:29.020
 The most thinly de 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.880
 It 's thin out before and after 7200 revolutions, regardless of how reliable it is. 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.410
 Say 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.730
 Played the 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:40.460
 There is such an engine destruction 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.770
 I thought that the first check so as not to thin workshop care 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.130
 that is 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.610
 7000 in the course at each corner 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:54.940
 Instantly I hope you were Awaru Toko to climb 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:59.490
 Can you get engine damage after all in 7 games ? 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.490
 I like the best fuel efficiency there 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.080
 It will be open after tomorrow 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.390
 How much at maximum rotation 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.390
 check chopsticks Zheng of, or rather has become q fuel consumption 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:22.069
 Well Well and also Well recommended person's general user um 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:26.079
 Open after breaking the engine 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.079
 Join it with an item of 100,000 yen 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.880
 me 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.530
 I can be put on 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.340
 + Went high Now this kind of is what 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.340
 Border print
