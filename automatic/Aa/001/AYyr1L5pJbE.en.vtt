00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.540
 I think it's pretty good when it comes to 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.090
 have a little help in some 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.630
 games that are pretty pretty 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.329
 difficult in some situations 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.200
 and that almost oblige people to pay for 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.200
 have a little coin 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.570

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:23.920
 deactivate with us we want but 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:26.439
 this is not a big deal, it's not a hack of 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.739
 coins is not always a hack of a 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:33.519
