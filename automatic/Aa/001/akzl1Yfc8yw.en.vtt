 The Special Brand Dilemma 

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.866
 Thank you again for letting me come here today. 

00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:21.085
 IS. Yeah, that's great. 

00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:22.329
 Did you bring the thing? 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:24.617
 I got it. It's right here. 

00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:26.267
 Okay, you can deliver. 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.973
 Aah ... I can play too, right? 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.040
 Very well then. 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.723
 Who is ready to win the Russian roulette brand? 

00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:40.919
 Finally! 

00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:43.517
 The pronunciation is Russian "roulette". 

00:00:43.688 --> 00:00:47.479
 I'm pretty sure he's French and I ... I do not care. 

00:00:47.823 --> 00:00:49.531
 What is Russian roulette anyway? 

00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:51.930
 I'm not entirely sure. 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.794
 I got the idea after reading an article about your parents! 

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.567
 And if they were good at it, I bet you are too! 

00:00:57.567 --> 00:00:59.134
 Wow, really? 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.259
 Okay, I'll try! 

00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:04.423
 Girls, maybe we should do something else. 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.382
 This seems dangerous and ... we do not even know how to play this game. 

00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:13.009
 I mean, not even if you've written the rules or something. 

00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:16.551
 It says here to put the bullet in the gun ... 

00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:17.989
 and rotate ... 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.203
 and point to your head and ... 

00:01:21.484 --> 00:01:22.369
 Press!! 

00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:24.918
 I do not think it's working. 

00:01:25.112 --> 00:01:27.198
 You're doing it wrong! Let me try! 

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:29.314
 I think the instructions are "broken". 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.685
 IS! Right! You probably broke the gun! 

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:33.934
 I did not break it! 

00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:36.230
 I just never did it before. 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:37.906
 Can I have it once? 

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:39.829
 Clear. Go ahead! 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.945
 It's a lost cause, since someone broke the gun. 

00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:45.097
 No. I did not break it! 

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.654
 Yeah, it broke! 

00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:47.872
 Try it, Twist. 

00:01:48.312 --> 00:01:49.022
 Try again. 

00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:50.677
 Ten-try again! 

00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:53.659
 Here it is! You broke! 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.665
 Okay, stop! I really do not think we should do this! 

00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:58.177
 It's ok! Wow! 

00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:00.982
 Twist. Let Sweetie Belle try it once. 

00:02:00.982 --> 00:02:03.326
 What? No. Wait a minute! Not-! 

00:02:09.372 --> 00:02:10.660
 Did you get your special brand? 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.196
 Aah ... try again ?! 

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:24.024
