the jeep compass gets a thorough
redesigned<00:00:08.490> for<00:00:08.670> 2011<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.870> looks<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.139> lot

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.470 
redesigned for 2011 and it looks a lot
like<00:00:10.530> it's<00:00:10.740> Big<00:00:10.920> Brother<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.670> Grand<00:00:11.940> Cherokee

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
but more importantly than that it can

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.700 
but more importantly than that it can
act<00:00:14.849> like<00:00:15.089> its<00:00:15.360> big<00:00:15.570> brother<00:00:15.599> too<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.560> can

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
take this thing off road just about

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.390

raise the car up by an inch so what it's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.869 
raise the car up by an inch so what it's
done<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.190> taking<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.460> car<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.789> was

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
done is it's taking a car that was

done is it's taking a car that was
pretty<00:01:03.090> capable<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.600> its<00:01:03.719> forms<00:01:03.989> before<00:01:04.530> but

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
pretty capable in its forms before but

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.260 
pretty capable in its forms before but
now<00:01:05.040> let's<00:01:05.189> giving<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> look<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.909> match<00:01:06.090> it

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
now let's giving it the look to match it

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.000 
now let's giving it the look to match it
as<00:01:06.360> well<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> bit<00:01:06.750> more<00:01:06.900> ground<00:01:07.049> clearance<00:01:07.229> -<00:01:07.590> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
as well a bit more ground clearance - to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.649 
as well a bit more ground clearance - to
do<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> little<00:01:08.340> bit<00:01:08.520> more<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.939> what<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.420> think

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
do a little bit more and what I think

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.030 
do a little bit more and what I think
people<00:01:09.930> will<00:01:10.020> find<00:01:10.049> when<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.470> drive<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.920> is

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
people will find when they drive it is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.399 
people will find when they drive it is
it<00:01:11.640> may<00:01:11.820> look<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> little<00:01:12.689> vehicle

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
it may look just like a little vehicle

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.980 
it may look just like a little vehicle
but<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.280> very<00:01:14.520> capable<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.240> mean<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.509> it's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
but it's very capable I mean it's it's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.600 
but it's very capable I mean it's it's
it<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:16.770> everything<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.490> would

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
it can do everything that you would

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.950 
it can do everything that you would
expect<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.060> vehicle<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.869> this

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
expect this vehicle to do and in this

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.560 
expect this vehicle to do and in this
segment<00:01:19.140> there's<00:01:19.470> nothing<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:19.950> compare

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
segment there's nothing that can compare

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.330 
segment there's nothing that can compare
beyond<00:01:21.570> its<00:01:21.780> mountain<00:01:22.140> goat<00:01:22.320> capability<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
beyond its mountain goat capability the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.460 
beyond its mountain goat capability the
compass<00:01:23.759> gets<00:01:23.970> many<00:01:24.240> other<00:01:24.509> upgrades<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
compass gets many other upgrades the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.560 
compass gets many other upgrades the
most<00:01:25.680> obvious<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.640> its<00:01:26.939> new<00:01:27.090> front<00:01:27.390> end

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
most obvious one is its new front end

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.270 
most obvious one is its new front end
which<00:01:27.930> makes<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.380> look<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> baby<00:01:29.009> grand

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280

not<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> bad<00:01:36.630> thing

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049

so<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.020> powertrain<00:01:49.409> we've<00:01:49.710> got<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
so on the powertrain we've got the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.760 
so on the powertrain we've got the
2-liter<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> 2.4<00:01:51.659> liter<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.590> get<00:01:52.680> up

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
2-liter in the 2.4 liter you can get up

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.380 
2-liter in the 2.4 liter you can get up
to<00:01:52.829> 29<00:01:53.220> miles<00:01:53.460> per<00:01:53.640> gallon<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.060> properly

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
to 29 miles per gallon it's properly

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.590 
to 29 miles per gallon it's properly
equipped<00:01:54.840> we've<00:01:55.590> done<00:01:55.740> some<00:01:55.920> improvements<00:01:56.460> in

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
equipped we've done some improvements in

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.109 
equipped we've done some improvements in
in<00:01:57.600> fuel<00:01:58.020> economy<00:01:58.110> up<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:59.189> 2<00:01:59.369> miles<00:01:59.579> per<00:01:59.820> gallon

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
in fuel economy up to 2 miles per gallon

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.789 
in fuel economy up to 2 miles per gallon
on<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.390> highway<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.869> some<00:02:01.079> packages<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
on the highway and some packages and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.109 
on the highway and some packages and
we've<00:02:02.189> done<00:02:02.340> some<00:02:02.490> improvements<00:02:03.030> in

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
we've done some improvements in

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.209 
we've done some improvements in
performance<00:02:03.479> as<00:02:03.990> well<00:02:04.170> we've<00:02:04.350> seen<00:02:04.530> about<00:02:04.799> a

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
performance as well we've seen about a

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.190 
performance as well we've seen about a
half<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.729> second<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.270> 3/4<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> second

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
half a second to 3/4 a second

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.630 
half a second to 3/4 a second
improvement<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:08.129> by<00:02:08.250> doing<00:02:08.369> some

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
improvement just by doing some

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.070 
improvement just by doing some
refinement<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.390> calibration<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.020> the

refinement in the calibration of the

2011 model is all-around better than

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.680 
2011 model is all-around better than
last<00:02:17.890> year's<00:02:18.220> version<00:02:18.460> but<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.120> still<00:02:19.420> needs

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
last year's version but it still needs

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.870 
last year's version but it still needs
work<00:02:19.990> if<00:02:20.410> nothing<00:02:20.920> else<00:02:21.070> though<00:02:21.310> it's<00:02:21.700> at
