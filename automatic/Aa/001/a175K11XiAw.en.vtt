be fairly strong at clearing waves under

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.729 
be fairly strong at clearing waves under
towers<00:00:47.660> therefore<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.870> would<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> have

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
towers therefore I would like to have

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.650 
towers therefore I would like to have
these<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.250> backup<00:00:50.730> from<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.149> mini<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.539> is

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
these as backup from a mini of this is

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.850 
these as backup from a mini of this is
interesting<00:00:54.079> but<00:00:55.079> we'll<00:00:55.260> see<00:00:55.379> how<00:00:55.410> aggressive

him in the farm apartment just got to

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.590 
him in the farm apartment just got to
make<00:04:29.960> things<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.290> little<00:04:30.380> more<00:04:31.570> dangerous<00:04:32.570> for
