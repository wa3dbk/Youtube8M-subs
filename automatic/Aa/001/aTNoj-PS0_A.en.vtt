00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
cheek we're going to do rather than make

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.390

the<00:01:55.050> roof<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.740> going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> cheat<00:01:56.130> slightly

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
the roof I'm going to cheat slightly

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:05.300 
the roof I'm going to cheat slightly
I've<00:01:56.729> got<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.940> cata<00:01:57.180> cheese<00:01:57.899> one<00:01:58.890> is<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:04.350> salt

I've got the cata cheese one is so salt

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.419 
I've got the cata cheese one is so salt
pepper<00:02:06.050> and<00:02:07.050> then<00:02:07.320> John<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.130> can<00:02:08.250> beat<00:02:08.399> that

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
pepper and then John you can beat that

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.740 
pepper and then John you can beat that
up<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.850> think<00:02:09.090> through<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> wooden<00:02:09.660> spoon

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
up I think through the wooden spoon

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.370 
up I think through the wooden spoon
leave<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:11.330> now<00:02:12.330> our<00:02:12.540> veggies<00:02:12.870> started

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
sweating off you can add in 50 loads of

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.740 
sweating off you can add in 50 loads of
red<00:02:17.190> wine<00:02:19.040> reduce<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.190> down<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.760> some<00:02:21.360> red

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
red wine reduce that down and some red

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.500 
red wine reduce that down and some red
wine<00:02:21.780> wave<00:02:22.560> reduces<00:02:22.980> down<00:02:23.190> yeah<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.209> real

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
wine wave reduces down yeah it's a real

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.500 
wine wave reduces down yeah it's a real
richness<00:02:24.720> school<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.330> weird

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
richness school is and this is the weird

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.229 
richness school is and this is the weird
one<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.989> only<00:02:28.650> found<00:02:28.860> out<00:02:29.010> about<00:02:29.070> recently<00:02:29.700> but

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
one I only found out about recently but

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.949 
one I only found out about recently but
traditionally<00:02:30.810> they<00:02:31.140> had<00:02:31.320> milk<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:32.489> polonaise

order need to meet nothing and that mean

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.789 
order need to meet nothing and that mean
that<00:02:45.030> meets<00:02:45.360> definite<00:02:46.260> it's<00:02:46.380> something<00:02:46.650> quite

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
that meets definite it's something quite

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.300 
that meets definite it's something quite
disturbing<00:02:47.540> it's<00:02:48.540> just<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.840> sleeve<00:02:49.380> but<00:02:49.890> so

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
disturbing it's just the sleeve but so

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.060 
disturbing it's just the sleeve but so
mix<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.579> one<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:50.850> now<00:02:51.799> again<00:02:52.799> something

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
potentially Brown the meat I'm not gonna

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.330 
potentially Brown the meat I'm not gonna
bother<00:02:54.780> with<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.079> we're<00:02:55.410> going<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.650> slightly

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
bother with that we're going to slightly

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.509 
bother with that we're going to slightly
cheat<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.120> did<00:02:57.329> not<00:02:57.480> tomato<00:02:57.900> juice

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
doesn't browser and cook it yeah doesn't

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.740 
doesn't browser and cook it yeah doesn't
browning<00:03:02.160> cook<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.549> yeah<00:03:03.180> but<00:03:03.450> something

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
browning cook it yeah but something

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.060 
browning cook it yeah but something
Brown<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.140> before<00:03:04.350> we<00:03:04.410> had<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.620> too<00:03:04.829> much<00:03:04.920> more

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
Brown it before we had it too much more

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.620 
Brown it before we had it too much more
liquid<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:05.549> almost<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.820> frog<00:03:06.150> half<00:03:06.329> right

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
liquid so it's almost a frog half right

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.870 
liquid so it's almost a frog half right
okay<00:03:07.079> for<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.530> we're<00:03:07.680> not<00:03:07.739> gonna<00:03:07.860> bother<00:03:08.010> so

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
okay for that we're not gonna bother so

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.430 
okay for that we're not gonna bother so
then<00:03:09.360> it's<00:03:09.570> not<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.810> bring<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.049> whole<00:03:10.230> thing

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
then it's not to bring the whole thing

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.500 
then it's not to bring the whole thing
up<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.650> simmer<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.250> cook<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.730> for<00:03:11.850> at<00:03:12.150> least

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
up to a simmer and cook it for at least

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.060 
up to a simmer and cook it for at least
a<00:03:12.750> couple<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:13.019> hours<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.500> longer<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.950> better

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
a couple of hours the longer the better

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.400 
a couple of hours the longer the better
in<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.250> very<00:03:14.400> slow<00:03:14.760> heat<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.269> then<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.170> end<00:03:16.290> up

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
in a very slow heat and then you end up

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.910 
in a very slow heat and then you end up
with<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:17.190> one<00:03:17.640> we<00:03:18.239> made<00:03:18.390> earlier<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:19.799> get

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
with this one we made earlier so you get

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.520 
with this one we made earlier so you get
a<00:03:19.950> really<00:03:20.220> rich<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.600> all<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.019> or<00:03:22.200> nothing

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
a really rich so all of this or nothing

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.440 
a really rich so all of this or nothing
we<00:03:22.890> will<00:03:23.070> have<00:03:23.160> this<00:03:23.220> one<00:03:23.340> later<00:03:23.489> not<00:03:24.420> even

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
we will have this one later not even

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.180 
we will have this one later not even
going<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.780> use<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.140> but<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.500> one<00:03:25.799> is<00:03:25.950> where

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
going to use it but this one is where

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.259 
going to use it but this one is where
we're<00:03:26.280> going<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.459> do<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.730> show<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:26.970> how<00:03:27.209> to

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
we're going to do to show you how to

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.690 
we're going to do to show you how to
design<00:03:27.630> your<00:03:27.810> bit<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:28.829> leave<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.430> just<00:03:29.549> a

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
design your bit so leave that just a

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.230 
design your bit so leave that just a
simmer

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
simmer

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.680 
simmer
and<00:03:30.900> now<00:03:31.080> start<00:03:31.470> layering<00:03:31.740> up<00:03:32.040> our<00:03:32.250> lasagna<00:03:32.690> so

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
and now start layering up our lasagna so

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.450 
and now start layering up our lasagna so
essentially<00:03:34.170> that's<00:03:34.410> your<00:03:34.680> polonaise<00:03:35.160> mix

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
essentially that's your polonaise mix

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.250 
essentially that's your polonaise mix
and<00:03:35.940> we<00:03:36.060> use<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.360> polonaise<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:37.020> make<00:03:37.170> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
and we use the polonaise to make the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.140 
and we use the polonaise to make the
lasagna<00:03:37.380> dish<00:03:37.800> there's<00:03:38.670> anything<00:03:38.850> going
