00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
alright here's my 95 probe GT trying to

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.619

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
goes in because it drains the battery

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.360 

and<00:01:52.570> stopped<00:01:53.080> but<00:01:53.440> it'll<00:01:53.620> probably<00:01:53.860> start

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
and stopped but it'll probably start

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.370 
and stopped but it'll probably start
again<00:01:56.940> when<00:01:57.940> I<00:01:57.970> walk<00:01:58.240> by<00:01:58.480> it<00:01:58.540> when<00:01:58.960> I<00:01:59.020> get<00:01:59.080> home

again when I walk by it when I get home
from<00:01:59.410> school<00:01:59.860> I<00:01:59.890> can<00:02:00.130> sometimes<00:02:00.580> hear<00:02:00.760> doing

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
from school I can sometimes hear doing

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.240 
from school I can sometimes hear doing
it<00:02:01.300> so<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:01.570> just<00:02:01.600> does<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.020> does<00:02:02.680> it<00:02:02.710> until<00:02:03.160> it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
is I mean I guess I could just go into

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.060 
is I mean I guess I could just go into
the<00:02:06.520> dash<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:06.970> plug<00:02:07.210> random<00:02:07.510> stuff<00:02:07.810> but<00:02:08.080> see

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070
