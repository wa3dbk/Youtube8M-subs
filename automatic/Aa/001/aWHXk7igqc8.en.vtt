00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:07.109
 This is one of the ideas that are made. 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.860
 already long enough here it is already on us 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:15.179
 month as a standing waiting in the wings but the hands 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.140
 until you get there, then look very meaningful 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.920
 simple that is just done under 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.189
 continuously shaped column and meaning in 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.910
 that she worked continuously 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.310
 on the board 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.500
 that is, heating on induction duxone to 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.489
 let's say this is a powerful three and a half 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:41.850
 kilowatt so it stands on 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:46.460
 capacity means drain out of that capacity so 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:55.260
 if you see there is no a liter of fluid and 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:57.090
 air bard points means bard 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.710
 merges right here 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.809
 Steam escapes from here then it's under 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.150
 manometer for example under the thermometer here's another 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.430
 one more fitting under the thermometer 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.540
 it means the column itself is installed here 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.830
 then this means this engine is 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.830
 there is this casting 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.580
 it means the primary fill hole 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:34.500
 water then who will eat on 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:36.450
 romance bards here stands stock and down below 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.439
 blades blades 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.380
 so it's a dc motor 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:47.520
 mean meaning is to create 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.549
 additional rotation of fluid for 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.670
 to burn as little as possible but 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.080
 It planned until the sugar mash 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:00.670
 experiment here but 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:03.240
 In general, this layout is designed for testing. 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.510
 for on trial on flour 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.690
 so they drove away on the water 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:15.190
 not when it was still brewed then cut 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.490
 this pot is really very 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.350
 large fluid movement by these 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.160
 small blades especially fluid 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.080
 there is very little 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.700
 that is why there is hope that even 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:33.100
 high power at 3 kilo watts 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.640
 looking to play along will not be strictly speaking 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.430
 this is a guess since inclusion 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.360
 really the inclusion was not yet this thing 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.360
 just hands do not reach
