00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
front post this is from the barrel so

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.500 
front post this is from the barrel so
this<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.410> going<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.890> distort<00:02:32.310> your<00:02:32.970> sight

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510

target<00:02:35.989> Intel<00:02:36.989> with<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.380> kind<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.310> know

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
target Intel with that kind of you know

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.580 
target Intel with that kind of you know
aiming<00:02:38.819> system<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.870> have<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.170> be<00:02:40.290> aware<00:02:40.530> of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
aiming system so you have to be aware of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.900 
aiming system so you have to be aware of
it<00:02:40.890> when<00:02:41.069> you're<00:02:41.190> shooting<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.579> a<00:02:41.640> cold

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
weather because of the waves had that

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.229 
weather because of the waves had that
hot<00:02:44.730> air<00:02:44.940> goes<00:02:45.840> around<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.410> front<00:02:46.860> post

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
hot air goes around that front post

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.580 
hot air goes around that front post
that's<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.690> know<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.840> gotta<00:02:49.110> be<00:02:49.290> kind<00:02:49.530> of

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
that's a you know you gotta be kind of

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.190 
that's a you know you gotta be kind of
ready<00:02:49.799> for<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.310> it's<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:51.060> better<00:02:51.420> idea<00:02:51.720> to

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
ready for it and it's a better idea to

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.430 
ready for it and it's a better idea to
have<00:02:52.590> maybe<00:02:52.829> little<00:02:53.250> breaks<00:02:53.930> before<00:02:54.930> he<00:02:55.260> know

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
have maybe little breaks before he know

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.979 
have maybe little breaks before he know
the<00:02:55.590> shots<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.280> let<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.940> heat<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.660> kind<00:02:57.900> of

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
the shots and let that heat to kind of

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.259 
the shots and let that heat to kind of
disappear<00:02:58.530> because<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.549> can<00:02:59.760> distort<00:03:00.150> your

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
disappear because it can distort your

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.420 
disappear because it can distort your
sight<00:03:00.660> picture<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.440> made<00:03:01.709> some<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> few

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
sight picture and I made some a few

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.640 
sight picture and I made some a few
misses<00:03:02.849> which<00:03:03.269> they<00:03:03.510> should<00:03:03.720> be<00:03:03.750> hits<00:03:04.079> but<00:03:04.620> I

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
misses which they should be hits but I

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.410 
misses which they should be hits but I
