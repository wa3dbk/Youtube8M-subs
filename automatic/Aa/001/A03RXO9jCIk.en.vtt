00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.679
 it's always important to be good 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.599
 know the biological needs of 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.549
 different species of fish and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.310
 to have the right speed according to their 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.990
 and the species sought to locate the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.439
 ideal comfort zone and the good 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.570
 speed 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.470
 a new system for fishing for 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.940
 drags the falling ex 4d will facilitate 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.320
 the task it includes an acl screen with 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.649
 large format numeric characters 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.390
 a probe with auto security cable 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.140
 detachable on the ball and a 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.260
 transducer it is simply enough 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.629
 go down the probe x 4 pts and that is 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.879
 equipped with an integrated pressure sensor 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.670
 kenzy glossy the true depth of 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.289
 the probe another ultra-precise sensor 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.430
 records the changes of 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.739
 temperature a small and 10 that turns 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.989
 according to the velocity of the displacement of water 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.049
 gives real trolling speed to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.330
 ball the life of batteries to 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.150
 inside the probe and about 100 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.430
 hours in normal conditions while 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.500
 near the ball the probe sends out 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.900
 very precise temperature data 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.450
 speed and depth by 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.990
 telemetry this wireless system is very 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.150
 reliable 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.729
 there is no interruption of the signal this 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.799
 up to 200 7 miles are very 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.540
 aerodynamic offers little resistance to 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.290
 the water pressure they change not the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.970
 cable trajectory wait eagle this 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.650
 allows to always be in the zone of 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.710
 comfort of the desired species 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.490
 the ideal temperature and the thermocline 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.960
 is located very quickly and for 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.960
 their we always have the right speed of 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.479
 trend is the true depth 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.470
 this technology can work with 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.150
 All brands of reger dan 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.130
 salmonids are active from what they 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.070
 evolve at their preferred temperature 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.530
 during the heat wave they will look for 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.479
 these comfort zones especially if the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.399
 food is plentiful not far from 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.539
 their lands 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.880
 other factors influence the 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.000
 position of salmonids the direction of 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.310
 winds the ph of water the stability of the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.890
 thermocline and the part per million 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.320
 of dissolved oxygen trout and salmon 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.750
 generally prefer temperatures 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.700
 higher than the nails and this 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.590
 parking often above the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.350
 thermocline once gab and of 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.780
 branches under the thermocline 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.040
 bait fish also had their tent 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.300
 and a killer work 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.070
 unfortunately for them the big ones 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.230
 predator looks for the same temperature 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.010
 when they are in hunting season 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.390
 so it's a matter of comfort 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.489
 keep these data they are very 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.260
 valuable for predicting migration 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.260
 in the next season
