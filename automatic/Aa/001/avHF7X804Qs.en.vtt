00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.310 
saw in that picture it exploded on me so
the<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.170> co2<00:00:31.650> pressure<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.910> much<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:34.080> it

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the the co2 pressure was so much that it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.760 
the the co2 pressure was so much that it
popped<00:00:34.620> open<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.370> bun<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.629> bung<00:00:36.930> fell<00:00:37.379> on<00:00:37.650> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
popped open the bun the bung fell on the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.160 
popped open the bun the bung fell on the
floor<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.879> airlock<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.840> saw<00:00:40.140> that

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
floor with the airlock and you saw that

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.860 
floor with the airlock and you saw that
big<00:00:40.590> mess<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.220> try<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.059> put<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> airlock<00:00:42.690> back

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
big mess I try to put the airlock back

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.530 
big mess I try to put the airlock back
on<00:00:43.050> again<00:00:43.199> unfortunately<00:00:43.470> but<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:45.270> popped

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
on again unfortunately but it popped

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.720 
on again unfortunately but it popped
again<00:00:45.930> after<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.560> cleaned<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.100> i<00:00:47.280> sanitized

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
again after I cleaned it up i sanitized

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.400 
again after I cleaned it up i sanitized
it<00:00:47.940> put<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.180> back<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.660> pop<00:00:48.840> right<00:00:48.989> back<00:00:49.200> off

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
it put it back on the pop right back off

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.620 
it put it back on the pop right back off
again<00:00:49.560> so<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.640> fermenting<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.270> crazy

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
again so it's fermenting like crazy

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.960 
again so it's fermenting like crazy
which<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.170> good<00:00:52.410> ding<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.550> means<00:00:53.760> that's

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
which is good ding so that means that's

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.660 
which is good ding so that means that's
going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.420> hopefully<00:00:55.170> high<00:00:55.739> alcohol

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
going to be hopefully high alcohol

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.560 
going to be hopefully high alcohol
volume<00:00:57.180> beer<00:00:57.590> but<00:00:59.000> unfortunately<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.210> couldn't

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
volume beer but unfortunately I couldn't

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.180 
volume beer but unfortunately I couldn't
leave<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.620> did<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:02.070> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
leave it like that so what I did is I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.329 
leave it like that so what I did is I
made<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:03.110> modification<00:01:04.110> which<00:01:05.070> just

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
made a little modification which just

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.340 
made a little modification which just
seems<00:01:05.550> to<00:01:05.759> be<00:01:05.910> working<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.509> I<00:01:07.020> took<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
seems to be working so I took the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.109 
seems to be working so I took the
airlock<00:01:07.770> off<00:01:08.040> as<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.060> I

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
airlock off as you can see and I

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.200 
airlock off as you can see and I
attached<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.990> hose<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.979> there's<00:01:11.940> another

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
attached a hose and there's another

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
attached a hose and there's another
bucket<00:01:12.509> of<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:13.380> my<00:01:13.500> first<00:01:13.740> batch<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.399> is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
bucket of that's my first batch this is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.270 
bucket of that's my first batch this is
my<00:01:14.640> second<00:01:15.060> batch<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> haven't<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.070> hose

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
my second batch so I haven't the hose

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.210 
my second batch so I haven't the hose
going<00:01:17.760> around<00:01:18.180> I'm<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.930> using<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> put

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
going around I'm just using that to put

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.330 
going around I'm just using that to put
it<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.400> top<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> there<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:22.020> hose<00:01:22.290> goes

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
it on top of there and the hose goes

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.850 
it on top of there and the hose goes
down<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.960> guys<00:01:25.140> probably<00:01:25.409> might

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
down and you guys probably might

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.740 
down and you guys probably might
recognize<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.640> from<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.970> challenge<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.659> my

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
recognize this from a challenge for my

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.330 
recognize this from a challenge for my
beer<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.110> milk<00:01:28.409> challenge<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.040> didn't<00:01:29.250> have

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
beer and milk challenge I didn't have

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.370 
beer and milk challenge I didn't have
anything<00:01:29.549> else<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.990> going<00:01:31.200> into

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
anything else but I have it going into

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.410 
anything else but I have it going into
this<00:01:32.540> gallon<00:01:33.540> jaw<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> did<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.390> put

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
this gallon jaw and what I did is I put

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.080 
this gallon jaw and what I did is I put
some<00:01:36.720> sanitizer<00:01:36.930> solution<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:38.000> put<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
some sanitizer solution in there put the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.940 
some sanitizer solution in there put the
hose<00:01:39.299> inside<00:01:39.840> there<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:41.540> it's<00:01:42.799> bubbling<00:01:43.799> up

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
hose inside there and it's bubbling up

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.249 
hose inside there and it's bubbling up
pretty<00:01:44.159> good<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.360> could<00:01:45.540> Nikki<00:01:45.840> hear<00:01:46.080> that

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
pretty good so it could Nikki hear that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.620 
pretty good so it could Nikki hear that
you<00:01:47.130> know<00:01:47.159> that's<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> see<00:01:47.970> that's<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.420> gas

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you know that's the see that's the gas

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.130 
you know that's the see that's the gas
the<00:01:49.229> carbon<00:01:49.590> dioxide<00:01:49.710> coming<00:01:50.430> out<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.930> cob

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the carbon dioxide coming out of the cob

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.460 
the carbon dioxide coming out of the cob
way<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.270> working<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:57.210> I'm<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.290> let

way so it's working so I'm going to let
this<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:59.430> its<00:01:59.640> thing<00:01:59.759> let<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> yeast<00:02:00.689> finish

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
this do its thing let the yeast finish

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.999 
this do its thing let the yeast finish
well<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.689> know<00:02:03.780> basically<00:02:04.200> doing<00:02:04.560> its<00:02:04.710> job

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
well you know basically doing its job

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.150 
well you know basically doing its job
and<00:02:05.400> creating<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.869> wort<00:02:07.200> into<00:02:07.380> beer<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
and creating the wort into beer and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.830 
and creating the wort into beer and
converting<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.000> sugars<00:02:09.360> into<00:02:09.540> alcohol<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:10.560> i

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
converting the sugars into alcohol and i

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.870 
converting the sugars into alcohol and i
sanitized<00:02:12.840> everything<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:13.860> everything<00:02:14.640> was

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
sanitized everything so everything was

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.920 
sanitized everything so everything was
sanitized<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.600> put<00:02:15.750> back<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:18.390> we'll<00:02:18.900> see

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
sanitized and put back on so we'll see

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.410 
sanitized and put back on so we'll see
how<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.350> goes
