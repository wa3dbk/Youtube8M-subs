00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.779
 new video a top 5 about music 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.940
 of video games, I should clarify 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.040
 that the top 5 is only to carry a 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.440
 counting of the games that I will show 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.930
 Personally, I love them all 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.270
 equally and that is to say that number one 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.489
 it will not be the best or the 5 or the worst 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.620
 as I said it's just to keep a count 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.059
 well just let me introduce you to my 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.190
 assistants to start all 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.100
 and I'm the good chap mario, let's go 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.449
 with you to start with the good video 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.750
 without further ado 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.269
 let's start number one here we have the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.460
 saga of super mario bros since from 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.650
 his beginnings his music was something that 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.140
 characterized their games since all 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.240
 those who played super mario bros 1 did not 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.610
 they will deny that it is impossible to forget their 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.920
 famous tune and likewise every time 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.659
 that they give us a new delivery without a doubt 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.150
 we'll know we'll have some music 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.370
 to remember said game since its 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.770
 music has been great and memorable since 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.840
 his 8-bit music until arriving today 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.380
 in day to the orchestra songs 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.380
 the galaxy 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.750
 number 2 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.520
 here we have my saga ie efe 0 already 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.200
 that since the appearance of his first 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.630
 title in super nintendo 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.880
 his music was very catchy and suitable for 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.210
 those careers and then later in their 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.500
 following deliveries showed us 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.229
 incredible music with electric guitar 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.110
 to give its character to the clues and 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.030
 travel at high speed which is 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.220
 they adapted incredibly in each 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.440
 circuit and then they make us great 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.080
 have that kind of rock music and 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.160
 electronic that's why he deserved to appear 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.160
 this saga in the video 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.390
 number 3 here is the saga of 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.090
 megaman both the normal saga and the x 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.580
 since since he appeared in london with 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.890
 his deliveries from 1 to 6 his music 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.080
 It was great at each level of the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.570
 battles against the bosses one of the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.120
 final levels of doctor willy and 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.270
 also in its enabling and playstation 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.370
 one with his saga x his music were also 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.560
 very good and suitable for each level 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.480
 signs and also because I believe that 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.970
 they are very dear and remembered by the 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.370
 megaman fans but I'm sure 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.670
 that especially remember more than 8 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.670
 bits 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.680
 number 4 here we have the metroid saga 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.810
 since he was one of the first 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.810
 games with a slightly gloomy atmosphere and 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.420
 mysterious and then the music went very well 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.120
 adapted for the first games and if 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.040
 Maybe some of them have not been 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.380
 done great music or not so 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.840
 remembered as the agenda because I think that 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.540
 where the music shone was undoubtedly in 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.569
 metroid prime as good at least 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.610
 we remember the music very well 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.630
 of levels like pedra drift 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.630
 the level of snow 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.780
 the music of much more caverns 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.890
 ah 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.980
 and especially the music of fight against 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.980
 the space pirates 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.820
 but no 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.610
 and then because of that saga we put 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.919
 metroid in this count number 5 by 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.229
 Last, obviously, I could not miss 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.689
 in our count this saga and if I 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.879
 I mean the saga of the legend 2 have 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:59.189
 since anyone who has played 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:01.050
 some game of zelda I'm sure that it 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:03.569
 the main theme of the 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.699
 this saga and then to the fans of this 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.099
 game will no doubt know what 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.229
 I speak that their music are great and very 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.939
 well used at each level but on 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.280
 everything and they will not let me lie 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:16.080
 the vast majority of us adore the music that 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.240
 we generate with the ocarina of time 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.639
 both in ocarina of time and in the 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.650
 majora's mask or also the music that 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.110
 we do with the wind waker and I think 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.719
 some will also love it 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.710
 the howls of the twilight princess good 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.930
 either way 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.940
 lincoln his games is one of the sagas 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.419
 with most memorable music of all 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.419
 time 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.580
 ah 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.890
 well I think music is a factor 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.140
 very important in each video game for 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.080
 that this is great as well as history 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.480
 playability graphics etcetera good 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.580
 beach cut and something else they want to add 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.610
 good nothing more than to thank them 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.190
 to watch the video anyway if they want it 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.250
 share what your favorite music is 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.710
 some video game and well also if it's from 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.440
 Thank you for subscribing , thank you 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.790

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.790
 say goodbye to you soon
