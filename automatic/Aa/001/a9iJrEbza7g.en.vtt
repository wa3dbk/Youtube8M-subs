absolute<00:00:23.100> bargain<00:00:23.340> for<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.880> components<00:00:24.330> that

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
absolute bargain for the components that

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.890 
absolute bargain for the components that
it<00:00:24.510> comes<00:00:24.689> with<00:00:25.430> the<00:00:26.430> frame<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:27.480> practically

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
it comes with the frame is practically

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.530 
it comes with the frame is practically
free<00:00:28.820> that<00:00:29.820> being<00:00:30.390> with<00:00:30.599> even<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> rear<00:00:31.349> shock

so<00:00:33.540> I'll<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.750> go<00:00:33.870> over<00:00:34.020> some<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
so I'll just go over some of the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.459 
so I'll just go over some of the
components<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.219> my<00:00:35.760> thoughts<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.899> say<00:00:37.170> if

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
components and my thoughts and say if

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.090 
components and my thoughts and say if
you<00:00:37.620> guys<00:00:37.739> are<00:00:37.980> considering<00:00:38.430> buying<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:40.100> so

you guys are considering buying one so
we'll<00:00:41.550> start<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> top<00:00:42.300> we've<00:00:42.719> got<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
we'll start up the top we've got the the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.020 
we'll start up the top we've got the the
core<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> CD<00:00:44.910> handlebars<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.750> stem<00:00:46.789> the<00:00:47.789> bars

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
core a CD handlebars and stem the bars

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.290 
core a CD handlebars and stem the bars
are<00:00:48.329> 800<00:00:48.899> mill<00:00:49.050> wide<00:00:49.969> I'm<00:00:50.969> probably<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.270> little

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
are 800 mill wide I'm probably a little

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.020 
are 800 mill wide I'm probably a little
bit<00:00:51.629> too<00:00:51.780> wide<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.530> I'll<00:00:52.980> eventually<00:00:53.670> play

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
bit too wide but I'll eventually play

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.990 
bit too wide but I'll eventually play
around<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.420> shorten<00:00:55.050> them<00:00:55.170> probably<00:00:55.590> by<00:00:56.000> 20

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
around and shorten them probably by 20

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.020 
around and shorten them probably by 20
or<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.270> emile<00:00:58.460> but<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.489> haven't<00:00:59.640> clipped<00:00:59.879> any

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
or so emile but I haven't clipped any

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.430 
or so emile but I haven't clipped any
trees<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> rides<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.780> I've<00:01:00.930> done<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.410> far

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.510 
bottoms out harsh if you do bottom it
out<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.770> can<00:02:37.890> put<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.100> little<00:02:38.280> bit<00:02:38.400> more

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
out you can put a little bit more

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.640 
out you can put a little bit more
pressure<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:39.030> there<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.510> tweak<00:02:40.200> up<00:02:40.410> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
pressure in there and tweak up the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.790 
pressure in there and tweak up the
bottom<00:02:41.220> out<00:02:41.340> control<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.080> soften<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.410> bottom

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
bottom out control to soften that bottom

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.490 
bottom out control to soften that bottom
out<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.100> little<00:02:44.280> bit<00:02:44.780> you've<00:02:45.780> got<00:02:45.930> your<00:02:46.020> preload

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
out a little bit you've got your preload

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.420 
out a little bit you've got your preload
setting<00:02:47.459> here<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.930> should<00:02:49.770> only<00:02:49.860> go<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.160> max

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
setting here so you should only go a max

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.560 
setting here so you should only go a max
of<00:02:50.580> two<00:02:50.820> turns<00:02:51.830> say<00:02:52.830> if<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.160> have<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.670> get<00:02:54.540> a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
of two turns say if you have to get a

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.380 
of two turns say if you have to get a
heavier<00:02:54.900> spring<00:02:55.610> you'll<00:02:56.610> have<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.910> obviously

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
heavier spring you'll have to obviously

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.979 
heavier spring you'll have to obviously
swap<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.870> whole<00:02:57.989> spring<00:02:58.320> out<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:59.640> recently<00:03:00.630> did

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
swap the whole spring out I recently did

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.840 
swap the whole spring out I recently did
that<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.770> be<00:03:01.890> honest<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.310> was<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.459> pain<00:03:02.730> in

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
that and to be honest it was a pain in

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.370 
that and to be honest it was a pain in
the<00:03:02.940> butt<00:03:03.150> with<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:03.750> frame<00:03:04.110> design<00:03:06.380> just

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
the butt with this frame design just

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.140 
the butt with this frame design just
because<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.070> nature<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.850> how<00:03:09.090> the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
because of the nature of how the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.600 
because of the nature of how the
suspension<00:03:09.780> works<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:11.040> was<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.190> bit<00:03:11.400> difficult

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
suspension works it was a bit difficult

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.539 
suspension works it was a bit difficult
to<00:03:11.970> get<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.300> shock<00:03:12.510> out<00:03:13.040> but<00:03:14.040> once<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.310> got<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
to get the shock out but once I got the

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.890 
to get the shock out but once I got the
shock<00:03:14.760> out<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.269> was<00:03:15.390> obviously<00:03:15.720> pretty

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
shock out and it was obviously pretty

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.990 
shock out and it was obviously pretty
straightforward<00:03:16.620> from<00:03:16.769> there<00:03:17.040> it's<00:03:17.610> up<00:03:17.760> to

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
straightforward from there it's up to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.300 
straightforward from there it's up to
people<00:03:18.180> just<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.959> compress<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.799> shock<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.160> put

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
people just to compress the shock to put

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.890 
people just to compress the shock to put
it<00:03:20.430> back<00:03:20.580> in<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.890> I<00:03:22.890> put<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.600> 400-pound<00:03:24.600> spring

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
it back in so I put a 400-pound spring

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.420 
it back in so I put a 400-pound spring
in<00:03:25.049> which<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:27.350> good<00:03:28.350> for<00:03:28.560> about<00:03:28.769> 90<00:03:29.070> kilo

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
in which is good for about 90 kilo

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.190 
in which is good for about 90 kilo
weight<00:03:29.640> range<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.730> yeah<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.420> far<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.959> haven't

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
weight range and yeah so far I haven't

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.020 
weight range and yeah so far I haven't
actually<00:03:34.440> been<00:03:34.769> on<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.040> proper<00:03:35.489> ride<00:03:35.700> with<00:03:35.940> it

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
actually been on a proper ride with it

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.570 
actually been on a proper ride with it
yet<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.239> only<00:03:36.330> did<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.019> other<00:03:37.170> day<00:03:37.580> but

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
yet I only did it just the other day but

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.310 
yet I only did it just the other day but
I'll<00:03:39.180> let<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:39.420> know<00:03:39.450> how<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:39.840> goes<00:03:40.049> when<00:03:40.290> I

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
I'll let you know how that goes when I

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.650 
I'll let you know how that goes when I
get<00:03:40.500> around<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.830> it<00:03:42.380> yeah<00:03:43.380> so<00:03:43.620> we<00:03:43.739> have<00:03:44.660> the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
get around to it yeah so we have the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.470 
get around to it yeah so we have the
wheels<00:03:46.170> we've<00:03:46.590> got<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:47.060> Maverick<00:03:48.060> D<00:03:48.239> max

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
wheels we've got the Maverick D max

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.350 
wheels we've got the Maverick D max
Ultimates<00:03:49.340> that's<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.459> hub<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:50.940> rim

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
Ultimates that's the hub and the rim

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.539 
Ultimates that's the hub and the rim
itself<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:53.160> far<00:03:53.430> they've<00:03:53.610> been<00:03:53.640> great<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.299> mean

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
itself so far they've been great I mean

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.000 
itself so far they've been great I mean
they've<00:03:56.549> spin<00:03:57.390> really<00:03:57.600> well<00:03:57.870> I've<00:03:58.680> got

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
they've spin really well I've got

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.729 
they've spin really well I've got
Mavericks<00:03:59.730> on<00:03:59.910> this<00:04:00.090> on<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.810> polygon<00:04:01.230> ax<00:04:01.590> I

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
Mavericks on this on the polygon ax I

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.190 
Mavericks on this on the polygon ax I
have<00:04:01.890> over<00:04:02.160> here<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.580> I've<00:04:03.540> had<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.870> for

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
have over here and I've had that for

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.250 
have over here and I've had that for
about<00:04:04.230> eight<00:04:05.190> months<00:04:05.340> now<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.989> cannot

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
about eight months now and I cannot

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.710 
about eight months now and I cannot
fault<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.950> hubs<00:04:08.160> in<00:04:08.340> them<00:04:08.519> they<00:04:08.910> still<00:04:09.209> spin

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
fault the hubs in them they still spin

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.490 
fault the hubs in them they still spin
smoothly

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
smoothly

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.840 
smoothly
no<00:04:10.770> dramas<00:04:11.220> at<00:04:11.340> all<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:13.470> I<00:04:13.830> really<00:04:14.730> recommend

no dramas at all so I really recommend

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.229 
no dramas at all so I really recommend
these<00:04:15.330> these<00:04:16.049> wheels<00:04:16.549> they're<00:04:17.549> on<00:04:17.670> a<00:04:17.700> lot<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:18.030> a

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
these these wheels they're on a lot of a

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.270 
these these wheels they're on a lot of a
lot<00:04:18.900> of<00:04:18.930> people's<00:04:19.320> bikes<00:04:19.590> you'll<00:04:19.890> see<00:04:20.070> in<00:04:20.220> a

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
lot of people's bikes you'll see in a

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.099 
lot of people's bikes you'll see in a
lot<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.459> videos<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:20.880> stuff<00:04:21.450> like<00:04:21.600> that<00:04:21.840> but

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
lot of videos and stuff like that but

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.380 
lot of videos and stuff like that but
yeah<00:04:22.470> they<00:04:22.650> are<00:04:22.770> great<00:04:23.010> wheels<00:04:23.220> they're<00:04:24.180> also

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
yeah they are great wheels they're also

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.950 
yeah they are great wheels they're also
tubeless<00:04:25.020> set<00:04:25.380> up<00:04:25.580> this<00:04:26.580> bike<00:04:26.820> comes<00:04:27.060> set<00:04:27.840> up

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
tubeless set up this bike comes set up

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.710 
tubeless set up this bike comes set up
with<00:04:28.140> tubeless<00:04:28.800> tires<00:04:29.070> as<00:04:29.340> well<00:04:29.510> so<00:04:30.510> you<00:04:30.570> don't

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
with tubeless tires as well so you don't

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.940 
with tubeless tires as well so you don't
have<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:30.990> fiddle<00:04:31.140> around<00:04:31.260> if<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.680> ever<00:04:31.800> do

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
have to fiddle around if you ever do

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.430 
have to fiddle around if you ever do
want<00:04:31.980> to<00:04:32.190> convert<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.430> cheerless<00:04:34.490> yeah<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:36.440> the

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
want to convert to cheerless yeah so the

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.880 
want to convert to cheerless yeah so the
brakes<00:04:37.740> got<00:04:38.700> 203<00:04:39.630> millimeter<00:04:40.080> rotors<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:40.680> think

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
brakes got 203 millimeter rotors I think

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.090 
brakes got 203 millimeter rotors I think
they<00:04:40.980> are<00:04:41.160> on<00:04:41.190> front<00:04:41.700> and<00:04:41.820> back<00:04:42.980> probably<00:04:43.980> a

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
they are on front and back probably a

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.370 
they are on front and back probably a
little<00:04:44.190> bit<00:04:44.340> excessive<00:04:44.610> for<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.090> back<00:04:45.300> but<00:04:45.630> it

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
little bit excessive for the back but it

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.200 
little bit excessive for the back but it
won't<00:04:46.650> hurt<00:04:46.800> like<00:04:47.040> really<00:04:47.400> in<00:04:47.730> terms<00:04:47.910> of

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
won't hurt like really in terms of

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.450 
won't hurt like really in terms of
unless<00:04:48.510> year<00:04:48.810> World<00:04:49.590> Cup<00:04:49.830> level<00:04:50.040> you<00:04:50.280> might

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
unless year World Cup level you might

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.550 
unless year World Cup level you might
put<00:04:50.850> a<00:04:50.880> slightly<00:04:51.180> smaller<00:04:51.450> one<00:04:51.720> on<00:04:51.870> there<00:04:52.080> just

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
put a slightly smaller one on there just

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
put a slightly smaller one on there just
for<00:04:52.770> weight<00:04:52.980> savings<00:04:53.490> but<00:04:54.230> just<00:04:55.230> a<00:04:55.320> general

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
for weight savings but just a general

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.440 
for weight savings but just a general
assuming<00:04:56.580> you're<00:04:56.700> not<00:04:56.730> gonna<00:04:56.940> worry<00:04:57.210> too<00:04:57.419> much

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
assuming you're not gonna worry too much

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.230 
assuming you're not gonna worry too much
about<00:04:57.630> that<00:04:58.580> now<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.820> seats<00:05:00.120> also<00:05:00.540> a<00:05:00.570> core<00:05:00.930> and

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
about that now the seats also a core and

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.930 
about that now the seats also a core and
you've<00:05:03.240> got<00:05:03.419> an<00:05:03.510> MRP<00:05:03.840> chain<00:05:04.380> guide<00:05:04.820> we've<00:05:05.820> also

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
you've got an MRP chain guide we've also

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.240 
you've got an MRP chain guide we've also
got<00:05:06.270> some<00:05:06.540> chain<00:05:07.169> stay<00:05:07.380> protectors<00:05:07.890> just<00:05:08.190> to

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
got some chain stay protectors just to

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.010 
got some chain stay protectors just to
protect<00:05:08.520> your<00:05:08.640> frame<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.910> little<00:05:09.240> bit<00:05:09.419> you've

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
protect your frame a little bit you've

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.080 
protect your frame a little bit you've
got<00:05:10.169> a<00:05:10.200> little<00:05:10.410> carbon<00:05:10.740> fiber<00:05:11.010> mud<00:05:11.280> guard<00:05:12.350> and

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
got a little carbon fiber mud guard and

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.560 
got a little carbon fiber mud guard and
yeah<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.510> think<00:05:15.750> that's<00:05:15.900> about<00:05:15.990> it<00:05:16.140> really

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
yeah I think that's about it really

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.300 
yeah I think that's about it really
you've<00:05:18.570> got<00:05:18.780> some<00:05:18.990> fork<00:05:19.320> bumpers<00:05:19.650> here<00:05:19.979> to

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
you've got some fork bumpers here to

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.540 
you've got some fork bumpers here to
stop<00:05:20.610> you<00:05:20.790> from<00:05:22.040> bumping<00:05:23.040> the<00:05:23.130> forks<00:05:23.400> on<00:05:23.520> the

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
stop you from bumping the forks on the

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.159 
stop you from bumping the forks on the
frame<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:25.729> the<00:05:26.729> tires<00:05:26.970> are<00:05:27.180> muddy<00:05:27.780> mary's

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
frame and the tires are muddy mary's

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.810 
frame and the tires are muddy mary's
2.35<00:05:30.440> and<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:31.770> think<00:05:32.040> that<00:05:32.250> just<00:05:32.460> about<00:05:32.580> covers

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
2.35 and I think that just about covers

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.560 
2.35 and I think that just about covers
it<00:05:35.479> so<00:05:36.479> yeah<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:36.870> reckon<00:05:37.200> it<00:05:37.290> was<00:05:37.380> a<00:05:37.410> great<00:05:37.680> boy<00:05:37.890> I

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
it so yeah I reckon it was a great boy I

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.930 
it so yeah I reckon it was a great boy I
mean<00:05:39.570> I<00:05:39.690> priced<00:05:40.020> up<00:05:40.229> all<00:05:40.380> the<00:05:40.500> parts<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.100> it

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
mean I priced up all the parts and it

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.710 
mean I priced up all the parts and it
ended<00:05:42.150> up<00:05:42.270> coming<00:05:42.510> to<00:05:42.690> a<00:05:43.140> hell<00:05:43.979> of<00:05:44.010> a<00:05:44.190> lot<00:05:44.370> more

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
ended up coming to a hell of a lot more

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.500 
ended up coming to a hell of a lot more
money<00:05:47.840> without<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.020> frame<00:05:49.229> so<00:05:50.030> in<00:05:51.030> the<00:05:51.210> end<00:05:51.360> I

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
money without the frame so in the end I

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.320 
money without the frame so in the end I
think<00:05:51.570> I've<00:05:51.810> got<00:05:51.960> a<00:05:51.990> pretty<00:05:52.410> good<00:05:52.530> deal<00:05:53.330> plus

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
think I've got a pretty good deal plus

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.590 
think I've got a pretty good deal plus
the<00:05:54.479> frame<00:05:54.690> has<00:05:54.900> a<00:05:54.930> five<00:05:55.169> year<00:05:55.410> warranty<00:05:56.600> the

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
the frame has a five year warranty the

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.450 
the frame has a five year warranty the
welds<00:05:57.930> are<00:05:58.020> a<00:05:58.050> little<00:05:58.229> bit<00:05:58.410> ugly<00:05:58.740> but<00:05:59.130> they

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
welds are a little bit ugly but they

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.150 
welds are a little bit ugly but they
look<00:06:00.300> solid<00:06:00.720> I<00:06:00.900> mean<00:06:01.290> I<00:06:01.500> don't<00:06:01.650> think<00:06:02.010> you'll

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
look solid I mean I don't think you'll

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.290 
look solid I mean I don't think you'll
have<00:06:02.190> too<00:06:02.490> much<00:06:02.580> of<00:06:02.760> a<00:06:02.850> problem<00:06:03.120> with<00:06:03.210> that

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
have too much of a problem with that

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.969 
have too much of a problem with that
breaking<00:06:03.720> any<00:06:03.840> time<00:06:04.080> soon<00:06:04.350> unless<00:06:04.620> you're

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
breaking any time soon unless you're

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.920 
breaking any time soon unless you're
throwing<00:06:05.640> it<00:06:05.820> into<00:06:05.970> rock<00:06:06.210> gardens<00:06:06.690> and

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
throwing it into rock gardens and

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.550 
throwing it into rock gardens and
crashing<00:06:08.690> but<00:06:09.690> that'll<00:06:09.930> happen<00:06:10.050> to<00:06:10.290> probably

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
crashing but that'll happen to probably

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.020 
crashing but that'll happen to probably
any<00:06:10.740> bike<00:06:11.750> now<00:06:12.750> I<00:06:12.810> also<00:06:13.110> got<00:06:13.380> the<00:06:13.500> polygon<00:06:14.030> ax

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
any bike now I also got the polygon ax

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.060 
any bike now I also got the polygon ax

I've<00:06:48.670> been<00:06:48.790> pretty<00:06:48.970> wrapped<00:06:49.240> with<00:06:49.360> this<00:06:49.480> boy

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
I've been pretty wrapped with this boy

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.710 
I've been pretty wrapped with this boy
but<00:06:50.950> I've<00:06:51.070> sort<00:06:51.220> of<00:06:51.310> been<00:06:51.460> more<00:06:51.670> inclined<00:06:52.480> to

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
but I've sort of been more inclined to

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.110 
but I've sort of been more inclined to
do<00:06:52.870> downhill<00:06:53.380> stuff<00:06:53.680> so<00:06:54.010> that<00:06:54.820> was<00:06:54.940> why<00:06:55.090> I

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
do downhill stuff so that was why I

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.110 
do downhill stuff so that was why I
upgraded<00:06:55.800> now<00:06:56.800> but<00:06:57.130> the<00:06:57.310> choice<00:06:57.550> of<00:06:57.760> what<00:06:58.090> I

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
upgraded now but the choice of what I

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.850 
upgraded now but the choice of what I
want<00:06:58.300> to<00:06:58.390> ride<00:06:58.540> whether<00:06:58.810> I<00:06:58.900> want<00:06:59.110> to<00:06:59.140> go<00:06:59.200> do

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
want to ride whether I want to go do

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.780
