very common problem that I see when

very common problem that I see when
people<00:00:07.259> start<00:00:07.799> their<00:00:07.830> efforts<00:00:08.309> on<00:00:08.460> weight

what<00:00:25.109> seems<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.470> happen<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.130> when<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:26.430> are

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
what seems to happen is that when we are

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.099 
what seems to happen is that when we are
concerned<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.090> conscious<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:27.990> are

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
concerned in conscious of what we are

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.080 
concerned in conscious of what we are
eating<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:29.310> focusing<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:29.970> not

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
getting in any bad foods we

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.060 
getting in any bad foods we
overcompensate<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.329> many<00:00:33.840> times<00:00:34.140> cut<00:00:34.800> too

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
overcompensate and many times cut too

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.400 
overcompensate and many times cut too
much<00:00:35.280> or<00:00:35.700> pick<00:00:36.360> too<00:00:36.540> many<00:00:36.630> foods<00:00:36.960> they're<00:00:37.230> low

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
much or pick too many foods they're low

much or pick too many foods they're low
in<00:00:37.559> calories<00:00:38.120> when<00:00:39.120> our<00:00:39.239> calories<00:00:39.719> dropped

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
in calories when our calories dropped

in calories when our calories dropped
too<00:00:40.230> low<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.370> actually<00:00:41.610> see<00:00:41.879> very<00:00:42.149> good

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
too low you can actually see very good

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.110 
too low you can actually see very good
weight<00:00:42.570> loss<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> short<00:00:43.950> time<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
weight loss for a short time this

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.029 
weight loss for a short time this
happens<00:00:45.570> obviously<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> sheer

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
happens obviously just for the sheer

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.799 
happens obviously just for the sheer
reason<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.850> stopped<00:00:48.149> eating<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.629> much

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
reason that we stopped eating so much

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.410 
reason that we stopped eating so much
but<00:00:49.559> after<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:50.039> little<00:00:50.190> while<00:00:50.309> our<00:00:50.910> body<00:00:51.270> starts

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
but after a little while our body starts

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.350 
but after a little while our body starts
to<00:00:51.719> catch<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:53.070> realizes<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.969> aren't

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
to catch on it realizes you aren't

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
to catch on it realizes you aren't
giving<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.809> enough<00:00:55.110> nourishment<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.340> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
giving it enough nourishment so it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.189 
giving it enough nourishment so it
decides<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.239> needs<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.510> hold<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.079> that

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
decides that it needs to hold on to that

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.099 
decides that it needs to hold on to that
extra<00:00:58.530> fat<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:59.010> energy<00:00:59.670> reserves<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.840> all<00:01:00.899> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
extra fat as energy reserves for all it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.009 
extra fat as energy reserves for all it
knows<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.590> famine<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.100> coming<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:03.480> basically

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
knows a famine is coming so basically

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.170 
knows a famine is coming so basically
two<00:01:04.739> very<00:01:05.010> bad<00:01:05.220> things<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.729> begin<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.030> happen

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
two very bad things can begin to happen

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.320 
two very bad things can begin to happen
for<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.350> your<00:01:07.920> metabolism<00:01:08.729> will<00:01:09.000> start<00:01:09.210> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
for one your metabolism will start to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.840 
for one your metabolism will start to
slow<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.470> bad<00:01:10.830> obviously<00:01:11.369> because<00:01:11.670> now

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
slow this is bad obviously because now

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.700 
slow this is bad obviously because now
we<00:01:11.909> just<00:01:12.360> aren't<00:01:12.540> burning<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:13.049> many<00:01:13.200> calories

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
we just aren't burning as many calories

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
we just aren't burning as many calories
which<00:01:14.520> means<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.180> even<00:01:15.509> harder

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
which means it's going to be even harder

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.920 
which means it's going to be even harder
to<00:01:16.229> lose<00:01:16.380> weight<00:01:17.030> second<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.180> possibly<00:01:18.330> worse

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
to lose weight second and possibly worse

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.140 
to lose weight second and possibly worse
your<00:01:19.770> body<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> start<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.939> break

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
your body is going to start to break

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.749 
your body is going to start to break
down<00:01:21.360> muscle<00:01:21.570> tissue<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:22.259> energy<00:01:22.610> it<00:01:23.610> has

down muscle tissue for energy it has

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.490 
down muscle tissue for energy it has
already<00:01:24.060> realized<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.810> aren't<00:01:25.110> giving<00:01:25.380> it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
already realized you aren't giving it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.100 
already realized you aren't giving it
enough<00:01:25.740> food<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.220> since<00:01:26.970> fat<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.540> far<00:01:27.960> more

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
enough food and since fat is far more

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.050 
enough food and since fat is far more
difficult<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> break<00:01:28.890> down<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.520> muscle<00:01:29.939> and

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
difficult to break down that muscle and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.840 
difficult to break down that muscle and
carbohydrates<00:01:30.780> your<00:01:31.439> body<00:01:31.799> now<00:01:32.100> turns<00:01:32.460> itself

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
carbohydrates your body now turns itself

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.210 
carbohydrates your body now turns itself
against<00:01:33.630> its<00:01:33.780> own<00:01:33.930> muscle<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.590> begins<00:01:35.100> to

against its own muscle and begins to

break that down for energy that

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.370 
break that down for energy that
compounds<00:01:38.790> our<00:01:38.939> slow<00:01:39.150> metabolism<00:01:39.810> even<00:01:40.200> more

compounds our slow metabolism even more

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.649 
compounds our slow metabolism even more
because<00:01:41.159> muscles<00:01:41.700> are<00:01:41.850> pretty<00:01:42.299> much<00:01:42.479> the
