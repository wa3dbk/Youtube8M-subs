00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.680
 the end of the video part 3 I missed one 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.270
 moment how to connect the shoulder seams 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.080
 sleeves so this moment I and 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.449
 dedicate this extra part and here 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.529
 we tied the two parts front and back 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.740
 sleeves 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.349
 and on the one hand we tied here 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.809
 such rows are air and 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.380
 single crochet bars such arc 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.010
 and in the second part we tied only the arc 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.079
 from the air and single crochet we 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:50.750
 we will tie now and at the same time 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:54.440
 join one part of the other here we are 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.440
 we are in the corner 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:02.309
 1 1 parts of the sleeve here this loop 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.030
 Now immediately sell in the same 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.150
 corner 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:12.000
 the second part we do it like this 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.340
 way we pull the loop pull out 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.220
 thread so that we do not have big 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.170
 distances and further along the chain is just 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.650
 knit each loop on the pillar 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.200
 without nakida here is the first connection 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.200
 happened to us 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.890
 finish one arc turn smoothly 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.890
 on the other as usual to our dawns 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:53.840
 reach the middle of this chain of 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:02:02.600
 air it will be five pillars without 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:06.710
 nakida tied crochet in 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:13.640
 the middle is the same other 2 sides 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:20.300
 sleeves here is a place with us and pull out 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:24.110
 loop here and then just 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.170
 keep on tying the next four 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.260
 and tighten a little bit so that we do not 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.239
 there was a distance between the front and the back 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.190
 part in the side fighting in the shoulder seam and 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.330
 we knit 4 remaining columns without 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:45.620
 nakida move to the next arc 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:48.430
 again five single crochets 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.430
 knit 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.099
 take off 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:01.379
 hook strings pass over 5 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:05.239
 is obtained over the fifth column without 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:10.200
 nakida is just the tip of the arc 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:15.440
 we sew and knit the second part of the sleeve 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.440
 the remaining four columns are without crochets and 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:24.019
 so it turns out to the point where we 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:27.110
 neckline starts 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:30.739
 it turns out so beautiful 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.739
 key shevchik 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.620
 and so for example in my little bills 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.150
 I tied my half here 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.180
 it turns out this arc 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:46.400
 first arc 2 arc 3 arc connected and 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.850
 next I will leave room for the neck 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:54.260
 that is, here we are just columns without 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:59.150
 nakida we knit these chains of the arc 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:03.440
 and counting from the other side of the other 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:10.580
 sleeves the same number of these arcs 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:14.000
 which we will join where we 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:19.040
 just neck we knit just 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:25.910
 single crochet bars 9 bars above 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:30.530
 every arc and again reached that place 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:37.520
 where you already need to connect do not do this 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:41.590
 the same operation loop through and knit 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.590
 further to the middle of the next arc 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.330
 count rovnenko to you 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.880
 shoulder seams were the same 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.190
 to the neck with one and the other 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:59.320
 sleeves from one sleeve to another sleeve 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:06.470
 here is the second key shevchik turned out and 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:08.690
 it remains to tie each sleeve as 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.390
