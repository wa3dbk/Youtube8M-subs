00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:12.250
 next time we make a leap of 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.250
 ports what I could door is a shank 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.560
 bittersweet 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.989
 hamburg and to complete it he is 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.239
 caramelized with much the same 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.530

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.440
 you here in detail 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.870
 I asked for a piece of the shank and we're going 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.150
 having in addition a form well makes public 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.670
 problem of this recipe the following 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.810
 Revenue is not for those who have what is presse 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.340
 my case 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.930
 we will correct this 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.660
 oven recipe 120 degrees for six 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.060
 at eight o'clock do not want to wait all this 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.389
 makes in the pressure cooker one hour one 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.190
 hour and fifteen is not the same result 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.040
 but it will get very close 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.680
 if you do not have all this time guys 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.079
 both here and I have a piece of ham 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.810
 I asked the butcher to take off that cape. 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.609
 fat here document that people 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.310
 will temper this profile with some 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.510
 spices reminding you that everything you 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.390
 were already here 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.459
 there is nothing different here or in the 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.110
 description of the video is easier for 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.629
 You of what I keep talking about 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.780
 amount while I record it here for you 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:25.959
 so come on they will get a 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.540
 they will know a chair down we will go 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.610
 make an onion walk in this 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.980
 chair with a little water and 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.760
 then we will have this profile of the 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:42.629
 two sides require foil and for 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.629
 the oven and let the little animal arrive 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.920
 Good, what have I done here? 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:16.320
 The next I will have and then I 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.669
 I played more or less 400 350 400 ml of 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.789
 chicken broth 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.100
 You play in the chairs. Do not play on top. 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:26.070
 because otherwise the whole time will go 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.280
 drain and now we will close one 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.190
 aluminum foil if you can 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.889
 a chicken bottom in your house 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.440
 Great if you can not use those on the tablet 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.690
 It has no problem and then covers 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.169
 with foil and it goes into the oven 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.669
 and leave there resting for six a 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.590
 eight hours and forgetting that the 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.130
 temperature we will do it in 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.410
 very low temperature 120 and 130 degrees 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.750
 that's why he'll cook well 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.260
 slowly beauty 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.120
 I'm going to put in the oven and go to the pool. 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.000
 I'm going to the gym and I'm going to take a nap. 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.949

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.349
