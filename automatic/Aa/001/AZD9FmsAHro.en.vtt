then he's going to tear that up that
wasn't<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:00.360> good<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.869> thought<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.290> was<00:02:01.409> going

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
wasn't as good as I thought it was going

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.179 
wasn't as good as I thought it was going
to<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.430> we'll<00:02:02.579> take<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.119> thing<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:04.189> that

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
to be so we'll take this thing and that

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.819 
to be so we'll take this thing and that
really<00:02:05.399> tears<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.030> up<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.360> well<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.409> idea

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
really tears it up as well and the idea

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.330 
really tears it up as well and the idea
is<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.700> see<00:02:08.970> John<00:02:09.629> Hicks

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
is you can see John Hicks

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.759 
is you can see John Hicks
his<00:02:10.580> green<00:02:11.300> is<00:02:11.540> getting<00:02:11.870> depleted<00:02:12.260> which<00:02:12.560> is

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
his green is getting depleted which is

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.100 
his green is getting depleted which is
good<00:02:13.220> meaning<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.180> i'm<00:02:14.390> taking<00:02:14.810> out<00:02:14.930> his

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
good meaning that i'm taking out his

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.780 
good meaning that i'm taking out his
crystals<00:02:15.709> because<00:02:16.010> that's<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.370> way<00:02:16.400> i'm

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
crystals because that's the way i'm

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.000 
crystals because that's the way i'm
going<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.030> win<00:02:17.290> down<00:02:18.290> here<00:02:18.650> on<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.890> bottom

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
going to win down here on the bottom

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.210 
going to win down here on the bottom

this game plays now let's head out of
here<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.680> see<00:02:49.160> if<00:02:49.190> we<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.519> find<00:02:49.730> another

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
here and see if we can find another

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.199 
here and see if we can find another
dwarven<00:02:50.810> match<00:02:51.079> I<00:02:51.470> got<00:02:51.739> one<00:02:52.010> down<00:02:52.400> here<00:02:52.760> going

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
dwarven match I got one down here going

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.550 
dwarven match I got one down here going
with<00:02:53.780> another<00:02:54.200> person<00:02:55.930> they<00:02:56.930> are<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.319> good

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
with another person they are the good

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.940 
with another person they are the good
counsel<00:02:58.160> or<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.610> council<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.180> i<00:02:59.329> am<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.780> Dwarfs

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.890 

so<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.310> variety<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:04.970> characters<00:03:05.629> is

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
so that the variety of characters is

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.800 
so that the variety of characters is
evenly<00:03:06.379> matched<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:07.160> guys<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.810> robot

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
evenly matched the guys that robot

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.660 
evenly matched the guys that robot
entertainment<00:03:09.410> have<00:03:09.500> done<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.650> fantastic<00:03:09.980> job

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
entertainment have done a fantastic job

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.129 
entertainment have done a fantastic job
of<00:03:11.090> making<00:03:11.750> this<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:13.180> so<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:14.269> can't<00:03:14.540> heal<00:03:14.870> him

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
of making this so so you can't heal him

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.259 
of making this so so you can't heal him
right<00:03:15.380> away<00:03:15.530> but<00:03:16.340> she<00:03:16.609> can<00:03:16.970> oh<00:03:18.790> no<00:03:19.790> she<00:03:19.850> can't

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
right away but she can oh no she can't

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.740 
right away but she can oh no she can't
she<00:03:21.190> she<00:03:22.190> crushed<00:03:22.549> him<00:03:22.730> but<00:03:23.359> this<00:03:23.540> is

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
she she crushed him but this is

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.520 
she she crushed him but this is
effective<00:03:24.319> because<00:03:27.579> can't<00:03:28.579> work<00:03:28.819> not<00:03:29.569> good<00:03:29.930> so

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
effective because can't work not good so

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.900 
effective because can't work not good so
I<00:03:30.560> have<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.889> come<00:03:31.040> up<00:03:31.069> with<00:03:31.220> another<00:03:31.609> solution

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
I have to come up with another solution

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.539 
I have to come up with another solution
which<00:03:32.870> is<00:03:32.900> pull<00:03:33.290> out<00:03:33.319> another<00:03:33.530> shotgun<00:03:34.040> guy

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
which is pull out another shotgun guy

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:40.390 
which is pull out another shotgun guy
and<00:03:35.290> walking<00:03:36.290> down<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:39.079> explosives<00:03:39.769> part

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
and walking down so the explosives part

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.789 
and walking down so the explosives part
