00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.870
 when I look at my students I see beings 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.880
 humans full of possibilities 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.190
 I often wonder how far I will be 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.370
 able to answer them to be there for 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.019
 them to extract the best of them I know 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.050
 that I will not always be able to cover 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.939
 your expectations I try to find the 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.600
 balance between your needs and 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.180
 I evaluate my ability 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.210
 today has not been an easy day maybe 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.910
 tomorrow either it is not or maybe if it is 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.370
 curious but maybe that 's the best thing about 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.800
 my work I never know that I'm going to 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.719
 find 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.390
 I would like to be prepared to face 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.250
 the new to adapt to change to 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.460
 time that things change and feel 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.760
 well pleased proud of myself of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.760
 my effort 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.720
 21st century knowledge society 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.260
 diverse society 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.570
 even the various 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.659
 new ideas 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.640
 new challenge 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.960
 new editions 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.960
 you are prepared 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.780
 coaching is a philosophy that is 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.220
 able to transform contexts 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.990
 precisely because we work from the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.190
 own people in the educational case 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.810
 from the students themselves 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.910
 that's why coaching what it means 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.460
 it's precisely working from the other 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.500
 not work from the instruction or from 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.390
 the theoretical framework of the teacher 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.550
 we work with the resources that the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.800
 student takes to class and what we try 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.170
 is really build that same framework 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.820
 theoretical but through that process 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.560
 constructive and experiential that makes the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.390
 student in the classroom we do not 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.010
 we actually see actions we do not see 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.020
 things that are being done with our 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.090
 students what we see is what is not 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.890
 what we see is what we stop 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.960
 do we really are 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.450
 seeing the gaps we are seeing the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.210
 possibilities and in that is the work of 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.910
 coach convert possibilities into deeds 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.920
 and in actions this makes it difficult 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.720
 more classes because they are not uniform 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.580
 but at the same time it becomes 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.619
 much more experiential is much more 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.720
 experience them and in fact they are much more 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.820
 effective than normal contexts 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.680
 where you work more instruction than 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.500
 the pedagogical concepts of the experience 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.150
 or of one's own expression 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.250
 at the level of educational coaching is a 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.600
 really very powerful tool for 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.190
 that the benefits of coaching in 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.870
 reality are many on the one hand from the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.460
 student's point of view better 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.250
 results better performance more 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.260
 satisfaction and second in the case of 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.240
 teachers and other educational agents 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.370
 first because they are seeing that they have 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.500
 more impact with those with their own 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.209
 work and second because in the end they are 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.070
 giving back to society something that the 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.750
 society also expects from them and is a 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.580
 change in the students themselves with 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.080
 more critical mentalities and with 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.790
 goals even much more 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.010
 professionals that we can of any 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.050
 way to have better results in 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.910
 efficiency efficiency welfare and 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.900
 happiness of our society these are 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.900
 the results of coaching 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.730
 you ask me about my good experience 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.590
 Well, I think that each one of us has 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.380
 your own way to be a better 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.720
 professional be teacher director 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.580
 counselor I think we all want 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.000
 get the best results from 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.560
 ourselves of our students are 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.260
 the good results what encourages us 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.900
 in this way the coaching for me has 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.239
 been the answer the best tool 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.000
 but coaching is for everyone is 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.360
 powerful simple provides techniques 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.980
 that are learned and applied quickly 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.220
 You would be really surprised at the 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.340
 results about 3 1 2 3 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:50.680
