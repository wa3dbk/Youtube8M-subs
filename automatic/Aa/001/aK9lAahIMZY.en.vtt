we are going to discuss general Paz
now<00:00:06.960> gyro<00:00:07.410> pods<00:00:07.740> are<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.630> absolute<00:00:09.630> best<00:00:10.410> way

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
now gyro pods are the absolute best way

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.570 
now gyro pods are the absolute best way
to<00:00:11.099> navigate<00:00:11.820> through<00:00:12.179> space<00:00:12.660> by<00:00:12.990> far<00:00:13.320> now<00:00:14.250> I'm

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
to navigate through space by far now I'm

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.939 
to navigate through space by far now I'm
going<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.120> be<00:00:15.240> showing<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.660> showing<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.680> my

personal favorite or at least how I
prefer<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:20.100> navigate<00:00:20.550> space<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.210> let's<00:00:21.810> go

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
prefer to navigate space so let's go

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.980 
prefer to navigate space so let's go
ahead<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.080> get<00:00:22.260> started<00:00:23.420> first<00:00:24.420> thing<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:24.900> are

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
ahead and get started first thing we are

ahead and get started first thing we are
going<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:26.430> were<00:00:26.609> going<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.970> need<00:00:27.150> a

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
going to do is we were going to need a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.580 
going to do is we were going to need a
prop<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:28.500> our<00:00:28.830> gyropod<00:00:30.170> because<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.410> some

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
prop for our gyropod because for some

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530 
prop for our gyropod because for some
reason<00:00:31.619> mine<00:00:32.099> isn't<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.579> default<00:00:32.969> prop<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
reason mine isn't the default prop and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.020 
reason mine isn't the default prop and
whatnot<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.079> need<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> make<00:00:34.500> one

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
whatnot so I need to make one

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.240 
whatnot so I need to make one
now<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> gyropod<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:37.950> under

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
now the gyropod is not going to be under

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.940 
now the gyropod is not going to be under
custom<00:00:38.760> add-on<00:00:38.910> framework<00:00:39.540> or<00:00:40.079> Stargate<00:00:40.800> or

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.610 

gyro<00:00:57.989> pod<00:00:58.260> advanced<00:00:59.300> we're<00:01:00.300> gonna<00:01:00.420> spawn<00:01:00.840> this

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
gyro pod advanced we're gonna spawn this

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.509 
gyro pod advanced we're gonna spawn this
as<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.390> right<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.769> model<00:01:05.100> has

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
as you can see right the model has

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.570 
as you can see right the model has
already<00:01:05.790> said<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.470> what<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.680> want<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.159> is

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
already said and what you want to do is

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.120 
already said and what you want to do is
you<00:01:08.850> want<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> make<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.869> gyropod<00:01:10.560> at<00:01:10.950> your

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you want to make your gyropod at your

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.030 
you want to make your gyropod at your
center<00:01:11.520> mass<00:01:11.760> if<00:01:12.270> possible<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:13.920> we're

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
center mass if possible so what we're

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.499 
center mass if possible so what we're
gonna<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.640> we're<00:01:14.790> gonna<00:01:14.850> put<00:01:15.150> our<00:01:15.240> djaro

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
gonna do is we're gonna put our djaro

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.770 
gonna do is we're gonna put our djaro
pod<00:01:15.810> right<00:01:19.640> center<00:01:20.640> mass<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> best<00:01:21.570> is

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
pod right center mass is the best is

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.920 
pod right center mass is the best is
probably<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.740> best<00:01:23.040> place<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.310> put<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.850> now<00:01:24.570> as

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
probably the best place to put it now as

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.929 
probably the best place to put it now as
you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.799> don't<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.250> any<00:01:26.400> resources

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
you can see I don't have any resources

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.910 
you can see I don't have any resources
in<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.509> ship<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.680> covering

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
in the ship because I'm not covering

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.310 
in the ship because I'm not covering
resources<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:29.790> now<00:01:29.850> Oh<00:01:30.150> what<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.110> want<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
resources right now Oh what we want to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.910 
resources right now Oh what we want to
do<00:01:31.640> there<00:01:32.640> spaceman<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.500> what<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> want<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> do

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.700 
do there spaceman if what you want to do
is<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.939> best<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.900> weld

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
is it's best to weld

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.490 
is it's best to weld
every<00:01:38.579> ship<00:01:38.880> piece<00:01:39.180> even<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.200> like

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
every ship piece even if it's not like

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.249 
every ship piece even if it's not like
one<00:01:40.799> piece<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> ship<00:01:42.060> here<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.479> weld

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:53.020 
will need an equal ship comparison
equals<00:02:50.680> constant<00:02:51.680> value<00:02:52.250> will<00:02:52.519> need<00:02:52.700> two

sitting<00:03:12.470> in<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.829> seat<00:03:13.129> is<00:03:14.709> equal<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.889> zero

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.740 

that'll<00:03:20.540> make<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.900> 1<00:03:22.329> and<00:03:23.329> we<00:03:23.449> want<00:03:23.660> to

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
that'll make that a 1 and we want to

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.839 
that'll make that a 1 and we want to
link<00:03:23.930> freeze<00:03:25.449> ship<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:28.010> way<00:03:28.220> whenever<00:03:28.489> we

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
link freeze ship that way whenever we

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.319 
link freeze ship that way whenever we
get<00:03:29.120> out<00:03:29.389> of<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:30.049> seat<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:31.159> ship<00:03:31.489> will<00:03:32.030> not

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
get out of the seat the ship will not

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.920 
get out of the seat the ship will not
move<00:03:32.810> which<00:03:33.440> is<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:33.620> good<00:03:33.859> thing

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
move which is a good thing

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.080 
move which is a good thing
so<00:03:35.930> we've<00:03:36.079> got<00:03:36.260> that<00:03:36.500> taken<00:03:36.709> care<00:03:36.919> of<00:03:37.129> now<00:03:38.000> we

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
so we've got that taken care of now we

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:46.140 
so we've got that taken care of now we
just<00:03:38.329> need<00:03:38.419> to<00:03:38.690> link<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:40.010> functions

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
Mouse one Mouse to you for weapons but I

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.210 
Mouse one Mouse to you for weapons but I
really<00:04:18.729> don't<00:04:18.820> we<00:04:18.970> use<00:04:19.090> weapons<00:04:19.979> so<00:04:20.979> we'll

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
really don't we use weapons so we'll

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.350 
really don't we use weapons so we'll
just<00:04:21.340> leave<00:04:21.489> it<00:04:21.549> at<00:04:21.729> that<00:04:21.759> and<00:04:23.250> turned<00:04:24.360> keep

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
just leave it at that and turned keep

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.779 
just leave it at that and turned keep
this<00:04:25.509> in<00:04:25.690> mind<00:04:25.870> it's<00:04:26.169> not<00:04:26.470> move<00:04:27.190> left

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
this in mind it's not move left

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.860 
this in mind it's not move left
that's<00:04:28.030> like<00:04:28.270> strafing<00:04:28.900> you<00:04:29.560> want<00:04:29.740> y'all

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
that's like strafing you want y'all

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.930 
that's like strafing you want y'all
y'all<00:04:31.870> left<00:04:32.259> and<00:04:32.620> y'all<00:04:32.949> right<00:04:33.190> for<00:04:33.520> turns<00:04:33.729> out

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
y'all left and y'all right for turns out

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:41.610 
y'all left and y'all right for turns out
yes<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:34.930> were<00:04:39.509> and<00:04:40.509> we<00:04:40.750> want<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.169> keep<00:04:41.410> our

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
yes you were and we want to keep our

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.270 
yes you were and we want to keep our
shit<00:04:41.889> level<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.889> way<00:04:47.889> it<00:04:48.009> stays

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
shit level so that way it stays

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.850 
shit level so that way it stays
perfectly<00:04:48.849> straight<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.630> flat<00:04:49.990> we'll<00:04:50.680> just

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
perfectly straight and flat we'll just

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.820 
perfectly straight and flat we'll just
link<00:04:51.130> that<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.580> an<00:04:51.820> active<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:52.930> whenever<00:04:53.169> it

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
link that to an active so whenever it

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.420 
link that to an active so whenever it
were<00:04:54.039> in<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.729> seat<00:04:55.030> that<00:04:55.060> will<00:04:55.360> equal<00:04:55.660> to<00:04:55.810> one

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.990 

and<00:05:00.430> I<00:05:00.550> think<00:05:01.169> that's<00:05:02.169> about<00:05:02.620> it<00:05:02.949> so<00:05:03.820> you're

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
and I think that's about it so you're

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.360 
and I think that's about it so you're
ready<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.300> hop<00:05:04.599> in<00:05:04.810> your<00:05:04.900> seat<00:05:05.250> turns<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:06.460> on

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:17.880 

whoops<00:05:10.180> that<00:05:13.230> was<00:05:14.230> my<00:05:14.440> bad<00:05:14.710> I<00:05:16.050> have<00:05:17.050> a<00:05:17.110> retard

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
whoops that was my bad I have a retard

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:28.650 
whoops that was my bad I have a retard
I<00:05:17.920> don't<00:05:18.580> weld<00:05:18.760> the<00:05:18.880> seat<00:05:20.070> tools<00:05:21.960> well<00:05:27.660> you

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
I don't weld the seat tools well you

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.930 
I don't weld the seat tools well you
know<00:05:28.720> that's<00:05:29.620> a<00:05:30.010> little<00:05:30.250> slow

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
know that's a little slow

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.090 
know that's a little slow
check<00:05:31.870> elevation<00:05:32.560> that<00:05:33.370> works<00:05:34.620> forward<00:05:35.620> back

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
check elevation that works forward back

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:43.610 
check elevation that works forward back
that<00:05:36.880> works<00:05:37.650> let's<00:05:38.790> it's<00:05:39.790> unlink<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:42.510> the

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
that works let's it's unlink the the

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.440 
that works let's it's unlink the the
yeah<00:05:47.310> actually<00:05:48.310> we're<00:05:48.610> turning<00:05:48.910> a<00:05:48.970> little<00:05:49.060> too

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
yeah actually we're turning a little too

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.830 
yeah actually we're turning a little too
slow<00:05:50.130> let's<00:05:51.130> change<00:05:51.520> that<00:05:51.790> value<00:05:52.090> let's<00:05:52.630> make

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
slow let's change that value let's make

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.340 
slow let's change that value let's make
it<00:05:52.870> the<00:05:53.850> y'all<00:05:54.850> multiplier<00:05:55.480> how<00:05:55.780> quickly<00:05:56.140> turn

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
it the y'all multiplier how quickly turn

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.300 
it the y'all multiplier how quickly turn
let's<00:05:56.650> make<00:05:56.830> that<00:05:56.980> two<00:05:58.740> so<00:05:59.740> we'll<00:05:59.830> change<00:06:00.070> our

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
let's make that two so we'll change our

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.880 
let's make that two so we'll change our
constant<00:06:00.820> value

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
constant value

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.390 
constant value
you<00:06:02.890> know<00:06:03.010> multiplier<00:06:03.670> let's<00:06:04.210> wrap<00:06:04.510> it<00:06:04.540> to

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
you know multiplier let's wrap it to

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.470 
you know multiplier let's wrap it to
make<00:06:06.400> it<00:06:06.520> turn<00:06:06.700> faster

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
make it turn faster

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.570 
make it turn faster
I<00:06:07.510> don't<00:06:07.810> stretch<00:06:07.990> for<00:06:08.140> me<00:06:08.250> that's<00:06:09.250> a<00:06:09.400> little

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
I don't stretch for me that's a little

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.820 
I don't stretch for me that's a little
better

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.749 

well<00:06:12.520> that's<00:06:13.530> about<00:06:14.530> it<00:06:14.770> for<00:06:15.039> controlling<00:06:15.580> a

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 
well that's about it for controlling a

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:19.950 
well that's about it for controlling a
ship<00:06:16.060> with<00:06:16.750> a<00:06:16.979> gyropod<00:06:17.979> so<00:06:18.750> you'd<00:06:19.750> all<00:06:19.930> just
