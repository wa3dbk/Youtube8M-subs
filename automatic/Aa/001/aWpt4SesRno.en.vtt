00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.520
 see 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.779
 starting from the depths of the ocean and ending 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.120
 airspace 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.860
 we don't know much about our planet very much 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.990
 many mysteries still remain not 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.460

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.150
 flattery listen carefully on your 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.029

 no it's true or min 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.450
 this incident occurred in 1971 with 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.610
 one of the residents of a small town 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.770
 sandy in northern oregon a 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.140
 who according to his wife was fond of 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.690
 hunting season hunting he got out of his 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.310
 home and drove the nearest forest so 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.190
 it happened that the weather was terrible 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.460
 it was raining hard and strong wind 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.140
 but it did not stop him 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.570
 ignored all requests of his wife 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.479
 stay at home anyway having gone to 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.800
 the forest began to hunt as he himself said everything 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.080
 went bad enough 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.330
 not a single game could be seen around though 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.940
 when i got to the place the rain and wind 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.590
 verse or a few hours reeling 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.840
 in the hunting zone he is unexpected for himself 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.600
 comes across a small settlement 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.040
 if you can call it that consisting of 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.899
 several artificially created 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.570
 shelters to his own surprise in these 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.640
 there were absolutely no shelters even though 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.960
 things would be in place and such 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.720
 the feeling that they were recently someone 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.700
 enjoyed he concluded that this 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.740
 abandoned tourists shelters which 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.890
 most likely hiding from bad weather 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.899
 and have already gone after continuing your hunting day 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.310
 he never left his head 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.229
 abandoned settlement 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.600
 he is like a hunt man 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.399
 noticed a lot of small details and everything to him 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.159
 that time it seemed that someone was behind him 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.770
 watches him say all the time like him 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.229
 continued withdrawal of the forest if it is noticed 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.300
 strange human figures but through 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.270
 some time after looking he understood 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.520
 that it is just a branch or course 1 by the end 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.470
 hunting day when he returned 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.210
 in the city he could not with anything 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.310
 confuse the power of this people 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.780
 but all attempts to reach them in return 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.240
 he only got silence 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.860
 occasionally as he spoke he heard hryvnia 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.210
 who gave up behind him 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.160
 but frantically turning it nobody 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.020
 dell and when he looked at it again 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.230
 a place where a couple of seconds ago he 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.010
 I saw a man of him the same was not him 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.290
 gripped by horror 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.480
 all nerves he returned home but not 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.099
 became nothing to tell his wife because 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.019
 I was sure that this is all the fruits of it 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.489
 imagination 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.189
 a few months later he was laid 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.170
 psychological hospital with a diagnosis 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.819
 madness and persecution mania there 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.290
 he was surrendered by his friends who 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.170
 worried about the mental state 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.030
 of their friend they reported that he 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.950
 told them the whole story with the abandoned 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.109
 settlement and what happened to 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.540
 after that they told him that 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.970
 last months after the event in the forest he 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.549
 seen more and closer these same strange 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.680
 figures of people he claimed that they his 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.220
 pursued also he added that 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.650
 never seen their faces 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.870
 gradually he became obsessed he painted 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.510
 your whole house with pictures of people who 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.700
 he did not paint the face almost every day 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.400
 wrote for a moment the leaves of the word they 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.040
 here they are behind me they want me to 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.959
 a year later he passed away from the heart 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.579
 psychological attack on hospital 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.739
 according to the doctors almost every night and not 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.849
 heard from the chamber where that person was lying 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.829
 terrible screams 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.239
 but when they came to calm 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.000
 sick they noticed that he and 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.780
 sketched all the walls with no faces 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.180
 they are no faces they are already here and other 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.650
 similar inscriptions 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.540
 some time this story is perceived 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.579
 seriously and a group of volunteers became 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.359
 look for that mysterious settlement from where 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.310
 it all started 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.930
 repeating exactly the route of this hunter 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.870
 they found nothing 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.879
 even traces of the fact that there was some kind 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.739
 parking is such a story 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.870
 I tried to eliminate everything does not matter 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.379
 additions and left only the main 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.379
 the essence 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.450
 there are several versions of what happened the most 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.830
 popular I'll tell you now 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.290
 people without faces are hermits with 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.300
 disfigured persons most likely due 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.370
 living conditions or wild animals 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.500
 It is also assumed that these people with 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.180
 congenital pathology when the skin 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.910
 completely covers the front 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.280
 human most likely this is exactly what 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.560
 meant crazy calling them without 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.100
 persons namely that their face was impossible 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.510
 to identify 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.060
 creatures that chased the hunter 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.580
 it is nothing but aliens delivered 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.710
 on our planet and the chairs loves 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.000
 ufologists and people who believe you are alien 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.250
 Human Origins 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.230
 according to their version they were messengers 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.030
 extraterrestrial civilizations who wanted 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.430
 pass some information to this 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.590
 man but his mind could not stand 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.710
 summer and secretly what did they want to say 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.850
 he stayed with him forever 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.920
 the latest versions are what were 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.020
 grouping and maybe just a gang 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.000
 pranksters who pulled on their faces 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.340
 tight masks frightened the local 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.180
 driving one of the residents to insanity 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.180
 this town 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.280

 were like crazy stuff 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.710

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:30.440
