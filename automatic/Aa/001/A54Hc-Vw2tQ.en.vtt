00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.910
 Hello friends, as you can see 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.609
 more rain and I keep shooting 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.310
 tutorials on tanks and 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.770
 I will tell you this real life 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.820
 how to brighten up a town this is such a street from 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.579
 which make armor 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.960
 it's made from aspects of the metal 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:35.000
 aspect of exchange and astrid magic 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:42.220
 said where aspects are contained here so 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.220
 which is what we think and get cool or there too 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.520
 be counted over here came 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.470
 there before the base metals drain the raw 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.610
 the magical energy result is obtained 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.500
 stronger metal 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.720
 than iron ability to take yet 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.230
 charm beyond the fact that iron I would 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.230
 held capable here in principle 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.160
 here are the cogs and look there again 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.160
 volume ix 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.000
 armor can be made there 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.790
 and I can find on the usual table 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:27.730
 but he is done in 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.730
 there are already all the pony guests there 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.870
 what aspects to body glory 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:37.320
 and you get something we have threads al 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.770
 this is masterful you use in order 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.430
 to explore further the next 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.220
 recipe 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:50.110
 and next time to study is for us 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:57.630
 made magic blocks and this 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.630
 head towards cobble a little iron 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.810
 magic 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.590
 tree and 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:17.349
 our news, our leaves nothing to 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:20.200
 try now do it enough all 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:27.220
 we did we learned magical 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:30.760
 building block what is it all 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.470
 together so you found a way to drain and 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.569
 stone strength with elasticity that could 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.010
 I want to fly block rather resistant 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:42.880
 almost one wear here so he 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.660
 crafting it so from kenwood block kane 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.220
 T-shirts too and if you are shown like everything 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.400
 do but here I think not very 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.140
 understandable so let's explain 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:02.970
 so start we need to fill the boiler 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.970
 water made 4 there at the flower 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.349
 so for one 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.349
 we need eight metal and 4 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:22.340
 fine so let's just now 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.379
 we need 4 things to craft 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:30.830
 this is for this on ps4 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:32.239
 iron throw and 16 giving it a ball 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.580
 whichever you choose i chose 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.069
 water they give two 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.130
 magical two for two logical aspects 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:44.709
 we only need 4 for one 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.709
 we only need 16 to throw here 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.260
 take a magic wand 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:59.060
 poke show and we got 4 town 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.030
 they are four volumes of ingots we shall be laid there 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.549
 wand back 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:09.590
 we put like this and now we need 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:12.560
 an ordinary stone is a stone and now we 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.140
 we need to make these eight blocks to us 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.750
 enough to do with them 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.090
 Of course you can build like this 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.449
 all there home tyunit still do but 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.250
 in general, they are not intended for this 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.250
 want gold building blocks they 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.360
 accustomed here for this set like this 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:36.410
 four blocks take in hands to red 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.750
 cloak as always not so hands take your hands 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:44.630
 magic wand at work right 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:48.889
 click here that's fine us 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.449
 it turned out just there he crumbled it 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.310
 whatever here we did right click 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.300
 click on the sting on it and we open 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.650
 interface 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.849
 here we can wand services for wand 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.130
 we will need this in the future for 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:04.720
 research halimov and the next one 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.120
 study 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.139
 I call him transition because she 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.760
 standing here in this place and she 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.160
 include all so many aspects of different 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.010
 and I think in this place many 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.810
 stuck don't know what to shove there like 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.669
 would that get the original stage 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.470
 development in that craft you come in 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.729
 average 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.419
 years you need to study this transition 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:34.699
 just the points will teach you first 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:37.940
 aspect of the clock time the clock is not so smoky 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:45.050
 and then you need a mossy cobble that 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:51.010
 she has a mutation aspect so great 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.010
 now you need a spectrum of water and magic 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:05.990
 great then you need knowledge so and my 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.990
 this 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:19.129
 fire itself yes sure horse then you 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:27.629
 happiness will be 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:31.409
 and I'm here again I remembered the feathers yet 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:36.569
 need in the air and ordinary land what 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:41.789
 they are an aspect of earth earth and we 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:43.650
 we get a unified theory there moment field you 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:45.419
 maybe started something here on this one 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:50.180
 moment she is out of your 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:50.180
 setting she setting
