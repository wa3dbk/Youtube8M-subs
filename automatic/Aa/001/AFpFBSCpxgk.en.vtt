 [Music] 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.099
 Dakar 2015 Argentina Bolivia Chile 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.750
 we continue with the development of everything 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.399
 that was the stage a very stage 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.309
 particularly today we insist because 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.500
 the trucks had different roads 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.660
 on the one hand the cars on the other and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.059
 motorcycles and quadricycles on the other but 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 Now we are talking about trucks 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.930
 and the fight between the beds that follows 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.700
 being roughly closed really without 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.850
 team orders so we like to see them 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.850
 run 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.869

 Crops or destroy your company 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.840
 I like it 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:27.440
 Two reasons 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.440
 it would be slow 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.089
 [Music] 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.140
 as well 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.530
 here 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.030
 the truck category then is the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.770
 number 503 the category trucks that 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.860
 we refer that Tuesday are still 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.660
 being the leader in the escort is almost not 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.420
 I saw the third nor tail is what I was doing 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.300
 reference to Mauritius is to say the fight 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.180
 closed between the beds the members 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.910
 of the same type difference that stretches 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.950
 12 minutes 41 from the first to the third 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.470
 that is, a great variety among them 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.620
 incredible because he who has made a 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.600
 great scardino comeback that had had 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.550
 problems at the beginning and that 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.620
 undoubtedly afterwards he made a couple of 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.900
 spectacular stages now the distance 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.720
 between martín and carchi is not just 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.120
 five minutes and fraction the fight 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.880
 direct for the first position and as 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.890
 raúl mentioned it the third Nikolaev 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.470
 he also enters frankly in that battle 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.790
 with 12 minutes and fraction in the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.950
 difference between the three 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.680
 it's really tiny but to stand out 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.650
 the work of carchi nov is incredible what 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.330
 that is pushing with respect to andrés 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.520
 germany his brother 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.290
 the third camera navigator that already 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.630
 you saw it and we made a note in 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.670
 direct from Iquique at the beginning of 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.400
 this program we are going to show it also 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.020
 first that is in position 28 in the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.720
 very interesting general classification 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.240
 after what he said they had 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.970
 arrived last but apart from it 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.310
 now in this story also form 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.510
 part of what happened in that fateful 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.510
 stage of the day before 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.279
 [Music] 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.200
 these are the images generated by the 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.330
 dakar where 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.560
 we see these stories justly 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.580
 of those who 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.260
 suffer extreme hardness test the 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.599
 traps roads look what 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.330
 this happened with the German brothers 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.770
 no longer camera 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.570
 disappointment we would do very well 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.570
 let's hope someone comes 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.360
 We do not know how to get them out but we do not have 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.379
 assistance so we defend that 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.379
 someone pull 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:25.269
 [Music] 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.949
 we already told that this incident for 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.350
 siblings was produced after dodging 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.500
 to a navigator 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.200
 [Music] 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.940
 had crossed to ask for help to 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.520
 avoid an accident they preferred to stay 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.870
 well with the really tremendous truck and 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.820
 more images the fight is these 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.220
 protagonists is clear and they point it out 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.650
 the pilots all the time are two 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.470
 very different races one for the 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.240
 official teams for teams that 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.090
 they come for the victory they have 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.460
 sponsors that have another type of 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.550
 objectives and other support 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.500
 fundamentally the other great career is 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.820
 for all the adventurers those who 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:20.150
 maintain and preserve that spirit of 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:23.720
 Dakar is the adventure of the challenge 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.940
 in suffering in sacrifice that should not 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.940
 be so because after having 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.190
 situations so complicated the first 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.140
 what they do is think about how they are organized 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.440
 to run the next dakar in 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:40.490
 definitive is a matter of masochism 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.250
 with adventure try to beat the 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.910
 dakar in any way and from any 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.300
 shape 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.480
 that 's how the Mongolian pilot was going to 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.480
 tie off 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.289
 the last classified in the category of 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.289
 motorcycles 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:05.300
 and that extreme dose of adrenaline 

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:05.300
 he returns the following year 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.470
 watch the schedule now 3 and 20 m 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.340
 well in the middle

 the bike was wearing it definitely 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.370
 I did not want to see 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.389
 because it's interesting from the point of 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.030
 view of those who plan and program 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:15.470
 and produce the television this 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:20.260
 realization that we show you 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:22.600
 is that they also leave 12 cameramen 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.730
 situations that occur good 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.760
 look after six hours and ten 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.760
 minutes 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.080
 the last one is classified today is 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.510
 after this stage if you are going to treat the 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.520
 Mongolian pilot is to applaud is 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.030
 incredible we set the pause the 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:53.939
