00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
then it's gonna be floppy at the part

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.020 
then it's gonna be floppy at the part
that<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.560> didn't<00:01:48.800> get<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:49.789> have<00:01:49.940> to

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
think this can be a you know good

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.950 
think this can be a you know good
two-handed<00:01:58.190> I<00:01:58.429> mean<00:01:59.240> like<00:01:59.360> have<00:01:59.509> two<00:01:59.720> people

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
one to hold this up or whatever or you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.910 
one to hold this up or whatever or you
can<00:02:02.149> use<00:02:02.270> various<00:02:02.569> weights<00:02:03.200> around<00:02:03.649> your

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
can use various weights around your

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.800 
can use various weights around your
house<00:02:05.049> to<00:02:06.049> help<00:02:06.880> keep<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.060> in<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.269> position<00:02:08.539> that

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
house to help keep it in a position that

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.300 
house to help keep it in a position that
is<00:02:08.989> easier<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.530> work<00:02:10.340> on<00:02:14.650> even<00:02:15.650> weights<00:02:16.040> such

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
is easier to work on even weights such

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.410 
is easier to work on even weights such
as<00:02:16.549> um<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:18.230> know<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.560> can<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.340> soup<00:02:20.030> or

as um you know a can of soup or
something<00:02:21.019> can<00:02:21.890> be<00:02:22.010> useful<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.900> I'm<00:02:23.989> getting

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
something can be useful so I'm getting

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
in between as many of the layers as I

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.020 
in between as many of the layers as I
can<00:02:26.299> see<00:02:29.739> getting<00:02:30.739> all<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.280> way<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.910> the

with<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.209> kit<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:53.220> one<00:03:54.220> another<00:03:54.760> thing<00:03:55.000> if<00:03:55.780> I

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
with the kit and one another thing if I

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.530 
with the kit and one another thing if I
got<00:03:56.140> any<00:03:56.379> moisture<00:03:56.829> on<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.700> outside<00:03:57.730> of<00:03:58.360> this

got any moisture on the outside of this

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:06.330 
got any moisture on the outside of this
I<00:03:58.980> could<00:03:59.980> protect<00:04:00.489> it<00:04:00.640> again<00:04:01.299> with<00:04:01.510> this<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:06.220> he

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
I could protect it again with this so he

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.380 
I could protect it again with this so he
just<00:04:06.930> boards<00:04:07.930> using<00:04:08.379> the<00:04:08.560> Bulldog<00:04:09.010> clip

okay and then as you can see the board

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:06.080 
okay and then as you can see the board
is<00:04:58.560> exposed<00:05:01.520> along<00:05:02.520> this<00:05:02.759> edge<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:05.090> included

Japanese<00:05:09.509> tissue<00:05:09.719> that<00:05:10.650> I'm<00:05:10.860> going<00:05:11.159> to<00:05:11.279> use<00:05:12.379> to

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:13.379 
Japanese tissue that I'm going to use to

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.290 
Japanese tissue that I'm going to use to
apply<00:05:13.650> and<00:05:13.860> I've<00:05:13.949> torn<00:05:14.520> a<00:05:14.639> little<00:05:14.849> tiny<00:05:15.029> piece

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
apply and I've torn a little tiny piece

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:24.459 
apply and I've torn a little tiny piece
off<00:05:15.569> you<00:05:16.349> see<00:05:16.680> that<00:05:17.449> and<00:05:18.449> I'm<00:05:19.110> pasting<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:20.009> out

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.170 

before<00:05:25.469> you<00:05:25.650> do<00:05:25.770> that<00:05:25.919> you<00:05:26.099> could<00:05:26.310> trim<00:05:26.909> the

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
before you do that you could trim the

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.379 
before you do that you could trim the
fuzzy<00:05:27.479> edges<00:05:27.750> of<00:05:28.050> this<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:31.400> just<00:05:32.400> going<00:05:33.180> like

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
fuzzy edges of this and just going like

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:34.550 
fuzzy edges of this and just going like
that<00:05:33.569> it<00:05:33.689> just<00:05:33.719> makes<00:05:33.990> it<00:05:34.050> a<00:05:34.139> little<00:05:34.319> cleaner

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
that it just makes it a little cleaner

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:42.959 
that it just makes it a little cleaner
of<00:05:34.919> an<00:05:35.340> edge

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.159 

but<00:05:43.599> it<00:05:43.869> can<00:05:44.139> be<00:05:44.319> fuzzy<00:05:44.559> it's<00:05:44.949> no<00:05:45.159> big<00:05:45.339> deal<00:05:46.169> it

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
but it can be fuzzy it's no big deal it

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.699 
but it can be fuzzy it's no big deal it
should<00:05:47.469> be<00:05:47.619> as<00:05:47.919> wide<00:05:48.549> as<00:05:48.759> the<00:05:48.789> board<00:05:49.709> just

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:50.709 
should be as wide as the board just

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:56.879 
should be as wide as the board just
about<00:05:50.919> just<00:05:51.189> a<00:05:51.279> little<00:05:51.309> bit<00:05:51.699> over<00:05:55.679> so<00:05:56.679> that's

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
about just a little bit over so that's

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:04.829 
about just a little bit over so that's
that's<00:05:57.369> on<00:05:57.729> there<00:05:58.799> and<00:06:00.779> using<00:06:01.779> a<00:06:02.789> bit<00:06:03.789> of<00:06:03.969> wax

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:04.839 
that's on there and using a bit of wax

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:08.579 
that's on there and using a bit of wax
paper<00:06:05.049> I'm<00:06:05.889> going<00:06:06.699> to<00:06:06.819> just<00:06:07.229> rub<00:06:08.229> it<00:06:08.259> down<00:06:08.559> a

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:08.589 
paper I'm going to just rub it down a

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:24.420 
paper I'm going to just rub it down a
little<00:06:08.829> more

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.150 

and<00:06:24.820> I'm<00:06:25.300> gonna<00:06:25.419> go<00:06:25.600> ahead<00:06:25.660> and<00:06:25.780> blow<00:06:26.470> this<00:06:26.680> dry

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
and I'm gonna go ahead and blow this dry

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.840 
and I'm gonna go ahead and blow this dry
and<00:06:27.520> this<00:06:28.360> is<00:06:28.509> it<00:06:28.919> the<00:06:29.919> completed<00:06:30.460> corner

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
and this is it the completed corner

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.920 
and this is it the completed corner
after<00:06:31.419> it's<00:06:31.630> been<00:06:32.400> strengthened<00:06:33.449> and<00:06:35.130> then

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
after it's been strengthened and then

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.930 
after it's been strengthened and then
adding<00:06:37.930> that<00:06:37.960> tissue<00:06:38.410> paper<00:06:38.710> there<00:06:38.979> that's<00:06:39.820> it

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
adding that tissue paper there that's it

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.350 
adding that tissue paper there that's it
I<00:06:40.120> hope<00:06:40.600> you<00:06:40.780> enjoyed<00:06:41.020> the<00:06:41.229> video
