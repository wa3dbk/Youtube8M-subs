this is my solution to my feet never
being<00:02:00.719> cold<00:02:00.960> again<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.469> these<00:02:02.399> are<00:02:02.579> well

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
being cold again and these are well

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.450 
being cold again and these are well
worth<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.149> investment<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.899> think<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.409> paid<00:02:04.649> 180

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
worth the investment I think I paid 180

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.089 
worth the investment I think I paid 180
for<00:02:05.759> them<00:02:05.880> um<00:02:06.200> not<00:02:07.200> too<00:02:07.380> much<00:02:07.590> more<00:02:07.799> than<00:02:07.979> what

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
for them um not too much more than what

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.529 
for them um not too much more than what
you<00:02:08.340> what<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.670> would<00:02:08.759> pay<00:02:08.970> for<00:02:09.209> your<00:02:09.300> typical

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
you what you would pay for your typical

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.020 
you what you would pay for your typical
Nikes<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.560> know<00:02:10.709> everyday<00:02:11.310> shoes<00:02:11.730> or

what-have-you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.910 
what-have-you
in<00:02:12.840> my<00:02:13.260> opinion

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
in my opinion

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.699 
in my opinion
a<00:02:13.950> couple<00:02:14.400> more<00:02:14.520> bucks<00:02:14.760> probably<00:02:15.530> but<00:02:16.530> um

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
a couple more bucks probably but um

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.770 
a couple more bucks probably but um
these<00:02:17.459> things<00:02:17.730> are<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:18.030> awesome<00:02:18.239> they're<00:02:18.750> a

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
these things are just awesome they're a

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.740 
these things are just awesome they're a
little<00:02:19.020> bulky<00:02:19.410> they're<00:02:19.800> kind<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.130> heavy<00:02:20.310> I

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
little bulky they're kind of heavy I

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.940 
little bulky they're kind of heavy I
don't<00:02:21.750> know<00:02:21.900> how<00:02:22.080> much<00:02:22.200> they<00:02:22.410> weigh<00:02:22.590> probably

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
don't know how much they weigh probably

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.860 
don't know how much they weigh probably
around<00:02:23.040> 4<00:02:23.610> pounds<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.090> guess<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.300> don't<00:02:24.690> know

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870

around 4 pounds I guess I don't know
that's<00:02:25.560> uh<00:02:25.830> that's<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.370> my<00:02:26.940> guess<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.959> they

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
that's uh that's just my guess but they

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.080 
that's uh that's just my guess but they
are<00:02:28.230> kind<00:02:29.069> of<00:02:29.160> heavy<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:29.520> I'd<00:02:29.880> rather

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090

sacrifice carrying something heavy and

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.050 
sacrifice carrying something heavy and

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
not having a cold foot I'd rather have

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.270 
not having a cold foot I'd rather have
