major or a minor pentatonic depending on
your<00:00:21.480> perspective<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:22.350> they're

already<00:00:25.859> hopefully<00:00:27.019> you<00:00:28.019> should<00:00:28.199> probably

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
already hopefully you should probably

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.220 
already hopefully you should probably
you'll<00:00:28.529> be<00:00:28.619> able<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.800> play<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:30.230> pentatonic

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
you'll be able to play a pentatonic

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.319 
you'll be able to play a pentatonic
scale<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.890> E<00:00:31.949> minor<00:00:32.130> pentatonic<00:00:32.430> scale<00:00:32.880> all

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
scale and E minor pentatonic scale all

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.490 
scale and E minor pentatonic scale all
over<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.600> place<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:33.989> most<00:00:34.200> you'd<00:00:34.380> be

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
over the place but most you'd be

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.410 
over the place but most you'd be
familiar<00:00:34.649> with<00:00:34.950> at<00:00:35.130> least<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.430> first<00:00:41.420> which

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
familiar with at least the first which

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.990 
familiar with at least the first which
most<00:00:43.140> people<00:00:43.290> already<00:00:43.890> know<00:00:44.100> me<00:00:44.340> playing<00:00:44.850> out

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
most people already know me playing out

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000 
most people already know me playing out
here<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> 10th<00:00:45.660> power<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.350> operate<00:00:49.010> these

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
here on the 10th power to operate these

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.680 
here on the 10th power to operate these
sort<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> box<00:00:50.460> patterns<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.570> cool

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
sort of box patterns one of the cool

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.000 
sort of box patterns one of the cool
things<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.110> these<00:00:52.350> box<00:00:52.590> patterns<00:00:52.920> you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
things is that these box patterns you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.100 
things is that these box patterns you
can<00:00:53.100> actually<00:00:53.250> easily<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.210> voicings

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
can actually easily see the voicings

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.529 
can actually easily see the voicings
basically<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.640> go<00:00:57.059> down<00:00:57.270> across

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
basically if you just go down across

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.849 
basically if you just go down across
Fritz<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.140> then<00:00:58.800> you've<00:00:58.920> got<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.219> court<00:01:00.289> but<00:01:01.289> if

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
Fritz and then you've got a court but if

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.260 
Fritz and then you've got a court but if
you<00:01:02.010> don't<00:01:02.190> know<00:01:02.280> them<00:01:02.399> already<00:01:02.550> maybe<00:01:03.000> good

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
you don't know them already maybe good

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.460 
you don't know them already maybe good
idea<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> check<00:01:03.660> them<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> net<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
idea to check them up on the net and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.500 
idea to check them up on the net and
find<00:01:05.460> them<00:01:05.580> out<00:01:05.700> somewhere<00:01:06.030> else<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.360> don't

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
find them out somewhere else I don't

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.060 
find them out somewhere else I don't
have<00:01:06.659> time<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.229> go<00:01:07.380> across<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.799> hole<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
have time to go across the hole in it

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.020 
have time to go across the hole in it
but<00:01:08.280> let's<00:01:08.490> um<00:01:08.760> let's<00:01:09.080> just<00:01:10.080> work<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.530> them

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
but let's um let's just work on them

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.840 
but let's um let's just work on them
just<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> actual<00:01:12.420> voicings<00:01:12.840> themselves

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
just on the actual voicings themselves

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.270 
just on the actual voicings themselves
ok<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> first<00:01:15.299> voicing<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.140> my<00:01:16.560> some<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.159> my

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
to our final back to the beginning again

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.529 
to our final back to the beginning again
which<00:04:30.340> is<00:04:30.520> just<00:04:32.699> so<00:04:33.699> to<00:04:33.759> hear<00:04:34.000> them<00:04:34.150> all<00:04:34.240> going

so they sound quite nice for new so I'm
just<00:05:01.380> playing<00:05:01.590> top<00:05:01.830> four<00:05:02.040> strings<00:05:02.130> here<00:05:02.490> just

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
just playing top four strings here just

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.270 
just playing top four strings here just
because<00:05:02.820> it<00:05:03.290> it<00:05:04.290> makes<00:05:04.470> it<00:05:04.620> be<00:05:04.770> easier<00:05:05.040> play

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
because it it makes it be easier play

because it it makes it be easier play
and<00:05:05.310> shift<00:05:06.120> around<00:05:06.360> but<00:05:08.060> good<00:05:09.060> to<00:05:09.150> know<00:05:09.270> this

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
and shift around but good to know this

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.740 
and shift around but good to know this
stuff<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:09.900> it<00:05:10.500> basically<00:05:11.340> any<00:05:11.820> situation

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
stuff and it basically any situation

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.790 
stuff and it basically any situation
where<00:05:12.930> you<00:05:13.050> think<00:05:13.410> you<00:05:13.500> could<00:05:13.620> use<00:05:13.680> a

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
where you think you could use a

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.890 
where you think you could use a
pentatonic<00:05:14.160> scale<00:05:14.550> you<00:05:14.820> could<00:05:15.000> use<00:05:15.150> some<00:05:15.810> of

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
pentatonic scale you could use some of

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.700 
pentatonic scale you could use some of
these<00:05:15.990> ports<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:16.590> it<00:05:17.340> sounds<00:05:17.610> ready<00:05:17.910> ah<00:05:18.710> and

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
these ports and it sounds ready ah and

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.310 
these ports and it sounds ready ah and
if<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.220> are<00:05:20.520> familiar<00:05:21.030> with<00:05:21.270> one<00:05:21.990> of<00:05:22.110> my<00:05:22.200> other

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
if you are familiar with one of my other

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.190 
if you are familiar with one of my other
posts<00:05:22.740> which<00:05:22.890> talked<00:05:23.130> about<00:05:24.200> pentatonic

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
posts which talked about pentatonic

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.190 
posts which talked about pentatonic
chords<00:05:25.560> and<00:05:25.830> doing<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.850> loony<00:05:27.480> Bruce<00:05:27.750> harmonic

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
chords and doing a loony Bruce harmonic

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.400 
chords and doing a loony Bruce harmonic
thing<00:05:28.350> you<00:05:28.560> can<00:05:28.740> see<00:05:28.920> that<00:05:29.100> all<00:05:29.280> of<00:05:29.430> this

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:40.950 

same<00:05:33.410> shapes<00:05:33.770> will<00:05:34.400> give<00:05:34.790> you<00:05:34.970> very<00:05:35.690> pretty

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.660 

hmm<00:05:41.960> you<00:05:42.290> can<00:05:42.470> basically<00:05:42.650> we<00:05:43.220> voiced<00:05:43.490> them

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
hmm you can basically we voiced them

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.720 
hmm you can basically we voiced them
again<00:05:44.170> using<00:05:45.170> this<00:05:46.010> little<00:05:46.310> harmonics

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
again using this little harmonics

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.750 
again using this little harmonics
technique<00:05:47.090> so<00:05:47.780> you<00:05:47.870> can<00:05:48.050> get<00:05:48.220> any<00:05:49.220> in<00:05:49.430> version

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
technique so you can get any in version

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.030 
technique so you can get any in version
of<00:05:49.910> a<00:05:50.030> heart<00:05:50.210> of<00:05:50.390> a<00:05:50.570> pentatonic<00:05:50.840> scale<00:05:51.230> minor

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
of a heart of a pentatonic scale minor

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.330 
of a heart of a pentatonic scale minor
or<00:05:52.220> major<00:05:53.350> catch<00:05:54.350> you<00:05:54.470> later<00:05:54.620> check<00:05:55.130> out<00:05:55.220> my
