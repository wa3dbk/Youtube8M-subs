00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130

I felt like every single person watching
me<00:02:25.910> criticizing<00:02:26.840> how<00:02:27.170> poorly<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.739> was<00:02:27.860> doing

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
everything and everything about me and I

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.699 
everything and everything about me and I
just<00:02:32.150> forced<00:02:32.750> myself<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.110> keep<00:02:33.290> going<00:02:33.620> because

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
just forced myself to keep going because

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.380 
just forced myself to keep going because
I<00:02:33.950> knew<00:02:34.100> that's<00:02:34.310> where<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.519> needed<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.820> be<00:02:34.940> and

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
I knew that's where I needed to be and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.930 
I knew that's where I needed to be and
you<00:02:36.320> get<00:02:36.650> lost<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.040> your<00:02:37.070> playlist<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:37.850> you

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
you get lost in your playlist and you

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.900 
you get lost in your playlist and you
get<00:02:38.090> lost<00:02:38.329> in<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:39.620> exercise<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.370> eventually

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
get lost in the exercise and eventually

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.060 
get lost in the exercise and eventually
you<00:02:41.660> stop<00:02:41.930> caring<00:02:42.230> what<00:02:42.560> people<00:02:42.680> are<00:02:43.040> thinking

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
you stop caring what people are thinking

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.860 
you stop caring what people are thinking
I<00:02:43.669> wonder<00:02:44.090> if<00:02:44.269> this<00:02:44.389> is<00:02:44.570> what

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
I wonder if this is what

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.289 
I wonder if this is what
Cole<00:02:45.019> pic<00:02:45.379> probably<00:02:45.920> not<00:02:46.069> but<00:02:46.340> she<00:02:46.610> became

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
Cole pic probably not but she became

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.080 
Cole pic probably not but she became
like<00:02:47.540> quite<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:47.959> exercise<00:02:48.560> person<00:02:49.099> and<00:02:49.909> she

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
like quite the exercise person and she

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.780 
like quite the exercise person and she
used<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.540> aid<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.019> gym<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:52.010> find<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.730> very

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
used to aid the gym so I find it very

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.160 
used to aid the gym so I find it very
interesting<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.360> think<00:02:53.420> about<00:02:54.129> anyway<00:02:55.959> so<00:02:56.959> for

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
interesting to think about anyway so for

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.110 
interesting to think about anyway so for
me<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.530> was<00:02:57.650> going<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.129> the<00:02:58.250> gym<00:02:58.430> forcing

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
me it was going to the gym forcing

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.080 
me it was going to the gym forcing
myself<00:02:59.239> out<00:02:59.629> of<00:02:59.690> that<00:03:00.159> fear<00:03:01.159> space<00:03:01.730> and

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
myself out of that fear space and

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.509 
myself out of that fear space and
getting<00:03:02.659> into<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.989> gym<00:03:03.230> how<00:03:03.799> I<00:03:03.829> grown<00:03:04.310> from

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
getting into the gym how I grown from

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.039 
getting into the gym how I grown from
the<00:03:04.610> experience<00:03:05.090> now<00:03:05.329> I<00:03:05.360> really<00:03:05.780> don't<00:03:05.959> care

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
the experience now I really don't care

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.860 
the experience now I really don't care
what<00:03:06.349> people<00:03:06.620> think<00:03:06.769> I<00:03:07.069> don't<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:08.269> it's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
what people think I don't and it's

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.630 
what people think I don't and it's
taking<00:03:09.200> me<00:03:09.319> couple<00:03:09.709> years<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:10.190> really<00:03:10.340> get<00:03:10.519> to

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
taking me couple years to really get to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.420 
taking me couple years to really get to
that<00:03:10.730> point<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.440> physically<00:03:12.440> not<00:03:12.739> caring<00:03:13.220> but

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
that point of physically not caring but

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.250 
that point of physically not caring but
losing<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.090> weight<00:03:14.239> becoming<00:03:14.750> more<00:03:14.870> athletic

still learning if you know phase but

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.059 
still learning if you know phase but
when<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:28.940> get<00:03:29.120> over<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.510> fact<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:30.049> you<00:03:30.859> feel

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
when you get over the fact that you feel

when you get over the fact that you feel
uncomfortable<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:33.019> then<00:03:33.200> realized<00:03:33.709> that

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
uncomfortable you then realized that

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.460 
uncomfortable you then realized that
most<00:03:34.159> of<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.400> people<00:03:34.430> don't<00:03:34.670> care<00:03:35.260> it's<00:03:36.260> all

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
most of the people don't care it's all

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.430 
most of the people don't care it's all
in<00:03:36.590> our<00:03:36.680> heads<00:03:37.239> so<00:03:38.239> once<00:03:38.659> i<00:03:38.810> was<00:03:38.930> able<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.290> break

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
in our heads so once i was able to break

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.530 
in our heads so once i was able to break
through<00:03:39.620> that<00:03:39.680> that's<00:03:40.370> what<00:03:40.609> it<00:03:40.640> was<00:03:40.849> and<00:03:41.150> i

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
through that that's what it was and i

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.449 
through that that's what it was and i
hope<00:03:42.019> that<00:03:42.079> that<00:03:42.409> a<00:03:42.650> lot<00:03:42.920> of<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:43.159> can<00:03:43.310> relate

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
hope that that a lot of you can relate

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.000 
hope that that a lot of you can relate
to<00:03:43.609> that<00:03:43.790> because<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.840> is<00:03:44.930> so<00:03:45.290> much<00:03:45.530> about<00:03:45.829> our

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
to that because it is so much about our

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.680 
to that because it is so much about our
brains<00:03:46.280> we<00:03:47.060> get<00:03:47.239> lost<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:48.069> our<00:03:49.329> worries<00:03:50.329> and

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
brains we get lost in our worries and

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.900 
brains we get lost in our worries and
plagued<00:03:51.019> with<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.590> unknown<00:03:51.889> and<00:03:52.519> fears

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910
