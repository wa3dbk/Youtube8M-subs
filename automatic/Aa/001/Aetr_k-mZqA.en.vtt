00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.890
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.170
 a canal 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:19.579
 Today I show you an almost perfect 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:24.230
 system and this system will be in two 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:26.029
 parts divided because is the first one 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.189
 purchase system and the second, too 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:33.800
 sometimes extra buying system and both together 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:36.019
 give an almost perfect system so here 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.170
 was to say let's take two title 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:43.570
 rhine always two blocks if we with the 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.250
 Make 31 right here also 30 blocks 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.489
 if I say iron or 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.890
 Goldrain Throw then nothing happens 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:56.890
 this only happens when looking at the pictures 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.600
 we'll show you a few times 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.030
 There really nothing happens 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.210
 really only stays in the funnel here 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.880
 I did that one by one 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:12.340
 exactly the same principle and here that 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.320
 with gold as the whole thing works 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.680
 I'll show you right next to it 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:23.410
 again if you need first a 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.410
 three blocks deep hole or 3 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.759
 three blocks high hole and this had to 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.900
 be three times four blocks wide again 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.560
 after that you need any 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:40.190
 block 1 redstone a council on block one 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:46.659
 rescue torch a redstone peter 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:50.869
 funnel with to the computer spencer and 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.200
 a chest after that places the tour 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.700
 here 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.759
 that does not matter in which direction 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:05.560
 which shows then you place two here 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:08.050
 funnel here two blocks because one there 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.150
 and here one 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.910
 then come here and here by 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.290
 a mystery 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.290
 then the whole looks here so 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:26.070
 then there is a web here and here 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.040
 of torches and then here again 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.310
 This torch is an advice on the block on it 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.310
 coming 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.190
 then come here and once in this 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:44.050
 direction a rap song peter then here 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.690
 a puzzle corporate to the blog and on it 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.739
 redstone again that prevents 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.500
 that if you later rhine Park here 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.410
 here in the lower that's not 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.580
 is inveigled into the coffer 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.200
 because we want that because of mistakes 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.400
 is quite important otherwise that works 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:10.840
 Not all you can do here 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:17.440
 build something like this or here again 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:20.220
 the dispenser can tell if it's her 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.220
 should not work now 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:31.860
 By the way, you are the first to be this one 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:34.150
 in the system yes informed by me 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.600
 because I have not betrayed anyone 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.350
 that works here and then comes 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.390
 that's how yen so here in retz 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.110
 and petra this direction shows a 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.760
 redstone computer in this direction 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.390
 By the way, this must also be switched on 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.660
 his 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.660
 and then here again around red sox 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.440
 then you fill this dispenser with 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.640
 Whatever you want me to have 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.210
 grabbed now just normal 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.210
 Sunday 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:17.109
 and then you have down here 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:23.970
 and grabs four in the bottom funnel 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.970
 Bettelheim should have had me 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.680
 and then you have it in with what 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.700
 you wanted to pay because I am now 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.820
 just unbeatable easy coal 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.820
 purely 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:44.889
 yes right here 63 must be in it if 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:48.130
 I can not do it all you could 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:51.790
 to do that again and again 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:55.230
 The system is ready, I will 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.230
 now again for you to test 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.190
 everything works here I would still you 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.960
 times recommend a ladder draufzusetzen 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.580
 then you can not cut in on 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.560
 grab and then I'll show you now 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.490
 very short like that here 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.620
 then it will look like 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:22.160
 because I'm balmy right now 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:28.260
 my face should promise karen 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:30.050
 sala hunting right three coal but 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.930
 three times gold 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:39.060
 then you get sand three times 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:43.740
 and with these three times sand zack zack 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:46.770
 Zack gets her a bow that 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.300
 actually a perfect system because 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.320
 when I only go in once 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.320
 pack does not happen until three times 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.360
 if I happen twice rheinpark 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.990
 also nothing means you really need 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.360
 three times sand and in my opinion is 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.560
 the perfect system that one on the 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.290
 ps3 ps4 xbox ears or xbox 360 whole 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.090
 easy to copy and if you can 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.520
 want to know how the second purchase system 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:18.540
 even works then turns on 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.160
 next video over and looks too 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.200
 again with france wife at me 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.790
 This first buying system has shown 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.280
 and then I would say 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.280
 see you in the next video 3
