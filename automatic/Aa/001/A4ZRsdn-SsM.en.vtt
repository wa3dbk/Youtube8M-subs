00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
which from what I understand is pretty

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.590 
which from what I understand is pretty
damn<00:04:19.269> strong<00:04:19.949> and<00:04:20.949> I'm<00:04:21.699> actually<00:04:21.880> on<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.210> quest

damn strong and I'm actually on a quest

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.129 
damn strong and I'm actually on a quest
to<00:04:22.750> around<00:04:23.290> 40<00:04:23.770> that's<00:04:24.550> my<00:04:24.699> goal<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.180> once<00:04:26.050> I

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
to around 40 that's my goal and once I

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.469 
to around 40 that's my goal and once I
make<00:04:26.290> it<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.470> round<00:04:26.650> 40<00:04:27.010> them<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.760> goal<00:04:27.970> will<00:04:28.449> be

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
make it to round 40 them a goal will be

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.620 
make it to round 40 them a goal will be
45<00:04:29.199> then<00:04:29.500> once<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:29.860> hit<00:04:29.949> their<00:04:30.160> do<00:04:30.880> 50<00:04:31.210> it's

45 then once you hit their do 50 it's

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.379 
45 then once you hit their do 50 it's
going<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:31.900> keep<00:04:32.790> stepping<00:04:33.790> it<00:04:33.850> up<00:04:33.910> and<00:04:34.090> see<00:04:34.270> how

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
going to keep stepping it up and see how

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.540 
going to keep stepping it up and see how
it<00:04:34.479> goes<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:34.660> know<00:04:34.930> but<00:04:35.770> basically<00:04:36.160> before<00:04:36.520> i

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
it goes you know but basically before i

it goes you know but basically before i
teleport<00:04:37.060> my<00:04:37.210> strategy<00:04:37.570> right<00:04:37.600> now<00:04:37.750> is<00:04:37.900> to

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
teleport my strategy right now is to

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.340 
teleport my strategy right now is to
hold<00:04:39.760> out<00:04:39.970> as<00:04:40.180> long<00:04:40.210> as<00:04:40.389> possible<00:04:40.660> whether<00:04:41.199> it

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
hold out as long as possible whether it

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.590 
hold out as long as possible whether it
involves<00:04:41.590> during<00:04:42.520> one<00:04:42.760> or<00:04:42.910> two<00:04:43.090> monkey<00:04:43.389> bombs

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
involves during one or two monkey bombs

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.740 
involves during one or two monkey bombs
and<00:04:44.460> round<00:04:45.460> 18<00:04:45.850> saw<00:04:46.090> where<00:04:46.240> you<00:04:46.270> really<00:04:46.600> don't

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
and round 18 saw where you really don't

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.200 
and round 18 saw where you really don't
have<00:04:46.930> to<00:04:46.990> do<00:04:47.290> it<00:04:47.500> but<00:04:48.370> it<00:04:48.520> does<00:04:48.669> up<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:48.970> little

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
have to do it but it does up a little

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.730 
have to do it but it does up a little
bit<00:04:49.330> I<00:04:49.479> don't<00:04:49.720> know<00:04:49.930> if<00:04:50.050> I'd<00:04:50.139> waste<00:04:50.350> a<00:04:50.470> monkey

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
bit I don't know if I'd waste a monkey

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.200 
bit I don't know if I'd waste a monkey
bone<00:04:50.919> but<00:04:51.190> you<00:04:51.430> know<00:04:51.550> wasting<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:51.910> couple<00:04:52.150> of

definitely<00:05:02.790> and<00:05:03.790> now<00:05:04.510> we're<00:05:04.810> thinking<00:05:05.110> here

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
definitely and now we're thinking here

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.710 
definitely and now we're thinking here

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
am trading them in for having machine

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.529 
am trading them in for having machine
gun<00:05:11.160> and<00:05:12.160> I'm<00:05:12.880> going<00:05:13.030> to<00:05:13.060> use<00:05:13.180> this<00:05:13.270> having
