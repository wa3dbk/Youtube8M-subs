maybe they have enough doing I don't
know<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.790> think<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.269> go<00:00:09.420> there<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:09.750> do<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:10.050> we

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
know I think we go there we do it we

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.959 
know I think we go there we do it we
won't<00:00:10.410> take<00:00:10.860> out<00:00:11.099> from<00:00:11.280> Blackburn<00:00:11.639> when<00:00:11.820> and

won't take out from Blackburn when and
well<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.300> think<00:00:12.360> you're<00:00:13.230> always<00:00:13.410> lose<00:00:13.769> games

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
I think cops are always do that so I

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.570 
I think cops are always do that so I
thought<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:16.949> them<00:00:17.070> was<00:00:17.130> against<00:00:17.460> their

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
thought one of them was against their
