it<00:00:00.089> was<00:00:00.299> a<00:00:00.329> normal<00:00:00.719> flight<00:00:01.230> day<00:00:01.580> we're<00:00:02.580> going

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
it was a normal flight day we're going

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.519 
it was a normal flight day we're going
out<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.240> reap<00:00:03.389> lunch<00:00:03.629> currency<00:00:04.110> for<00:00:04.259> landing

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
out to reap lunch currency for landing

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:05.960 
out to reap lunch currency for landing
at<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.680> ship<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.160> evening<00:00:05.490> there<00:00:05.850> was

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
at the ship of the evening there was

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.470 
at the ship of the evening there was
nothing<00:00:06.359> crazy<00:00:07.350> about<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:09.290> took<00:00:10.290> off<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:11.480> as

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
nothing crazy about it I took off and as

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.049 
nothing crazy about it I took off and as
I<00:00:12.750> was<00:00:12.929> climbing<00:00:13.320> away<00:00:13.590> from<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.070> deck<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.639> put

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
I was climbing away from the deck I put

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.730 
I was climbing away from the deck I put
my<00:00:15.179> gear<00:00:15.389> up<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.780> realized<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.260> had<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> gear

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
my gear up I realized I had a gear

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.010 
my gear up I realized I had a gear
malfunction<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:18.090> immediately<00:00:18.330> pulled<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
malfunction so I immediately pulled the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.570 
malfunction so I immediately pulled the
power<00:00:19.199> back<00:00:19.470> slowed<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> aircraft<00:00:20.220> down<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.550> I

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
power back slowed the aircraft down so I

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.310 
power back slowed the aircraft down so I
wouldn't<00:00:20.730> over<00:00:21.060> speed<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.480> landing<00:00:21.840> gear<00:00:22.020> and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
wouldn't over speed the landing gear and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.609 
wouldn't over speed the landing gear and
then<00:00:23.240> went<00:00:24.240> just<00:00:24.480> above<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.019> ship<00:00:25.080> at<00:00:25.410> about

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
then went just above the ship at about

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.250 
then went just above the ship at about
2,000<00:00:26.130> feet<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.460> started<00:00:26.849> talking<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
2,000 feet and started talking to

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.099 
2,000 feet and started talking to
paddles<00:00:28.260> who<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:29.029> another<00:00:30.029> jet<00:00:30.300> pilot<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
paddles who is another jet pilot in the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.020 
paddles who is another jet pilot in the
tower<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.470> controls<00:00:32.430> us<00:00:32.550> when<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.790> land

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
tower that controls us when we land

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.220 
tower that controls us when we land
they're<00:00:33.239> also<00:00:33.360> up<00:00:33.630> there<00:00:33.840> if<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
they're also up there if we have a

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.670 
they're also up there if we have a
problem<00:00:34.590> they<00:00:35.520> have<00:00:35.700> their<00:00:36.420> book<00:00:36.690> reader<00:00:36.960> they

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
problem they have their book reader they

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.350 
problem they have their book reader they
help<00:00:37.860> us<00:00:37.980> walk<00:00:38.160> through<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> situation<00:00:38.610> since

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
help us walk through the situation since

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.450 
help us walk through the situation since
we're<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> single<00:00:39.870> piloted<00:00:40.350> aircraft<00:00:40.559> well

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
we're a single piloted aircraft well

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.889 
we're a single piloted aircraft well
while<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.820> flew<00:00:42.090> by<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.270> ship

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
while I flew by the ship

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.440 
while I flew by the ship
I<00:00:42.930> did<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> approach<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.340> 300<00:00:44.789> feet<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.120> he<00:00:45.270> could

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
I did a approach at 300 feet so he could

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.630 
I did a approach at 300 feet so he could
see<00:00:45.719> my<00:00:45.899> landing<00:00:46.260> gear<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.559> give<00:00:47.280> me<00:00:47.430> an<00:00:47.520> idea

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
see my landing gear and give me an idea

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.490 
see my landing gear and give me an idea
of<00:00:47.820> what<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.149> going<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.750> determined<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
of what was going on and determined that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.470 
of what was going on and determined that
my<00:00:49.649> nose<00:00:49.800> gear<00:00:49.980> did<00:00:50.160> not<00:00:50.309> come<00:00:50.489> back<00:00:50.610> down<00:00:50.850> at

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
my nose gear did not come back down at

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.000 
my nose gear did not come back down at
this<00:00:51.690> point<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.079> time<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.530> figure<00:00:52.680> out<00:00:52.800> how

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
this point it is time to figure out how

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.189 
this point it is time to figure out how
do<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.190> get<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.760> jet<00:00:54.000> back<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> deck<00:00:54.690> safely

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
do I get the jet back on the deck safely

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.380 
do I get the jet back on the deck safely
with<00:00:55.980> only<00:00:56.160> three<00:00:56.430> landing<00:00:56.730> gear<00:00:56.940> so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
with only three landing gear so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.849 
with only three landing gear so
eventually<00:00:57.750> major<00:00:58.170> Murphy<00:00:58.320> came<00:00:58.559> over<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
eventually major Murphy came over the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.380 
eventually major Murphy came over the
radio<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.160> told<00:00:59.430> me<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> ship<00:00:59.969> had<00:01:00.210> this

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
radio and told me that the ship had this

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.420 
radio and told me that the ship had this
amazing<00:01:00.840> invention<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.160> was<00:01:02.250> like

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
amazing invention that was like

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.640 
amazing invention that was like
basically<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.969> stool<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.660> was<00:01:04.350> built

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
basically a stool that was built

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.250 
basically a stool that was built
specifically<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.760> reason<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:07.049> ship

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
specifically for this reason the ship

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.190 
specifically for this reason the ship
has<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> lighting<00:01:08.040> system<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.900> what<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.020> call

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
has a lighting system on what we call

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.870 
has a lighting system on what we call
spot<00:01:10.470> 7<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.760> use<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.689> land<00:01:12.960> at<00:01:13.710> an<00:01:14.520> exact

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
spot 7 that we use to land at an exact

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.760 
spot 7 that we use to land at an exact
spot<00:01:15.030> every<00:01:15.420> time

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
spot every time

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.350 
spot every time
so<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.009> difference<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.790> landing<00:01:18.180> was

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
so the difference with this landing was

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.990 
so the difference with this landing was
that<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> was<00:01:18.750> gonna<00:01:18.869> step<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.350> down<00:01:19.580> 50<00:01:20.580> 40<00:01:20.970> 30

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that I was gonna step it down 50 40 30

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.929 
that I was gonna step it down 50 40 30
20<00:01:21.360> feet<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.799> make<00:01:22.950> sure<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.100> was<00:01:23.340> aligned<00:01:23.640> and

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
20 feet to make sure I was aligned and

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.090 
20 feet to make sure I was aligned and
stabilized<00:01:24.509> before<00:01:24.930> major<00:01:25.350> Murphy<00:01:25.619> would

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
stabilized before major Murphy would

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.920 
stabilized before major Murphy would
clear<00:01:26.340> me<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> lay<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.759> 220<00:01:27.180> feet<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.600> it's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
clear me to lay in 220 feet so that it's

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.649 
clear me to lay in 220 feet so that it's
had<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> best<00:01:28.799> chance<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.189> actually<00:01:29.640> put<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
had the best chance to actually put the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.940 
had the best chance to actually put the
nose<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.770> stool<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.420> I<00:01:33.420> come<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.829> at

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
nose on the stool so I come in and at

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.620 
nose on the stool so I come in and at
this<00:01:35.100> point<00:01:35.340> I've<00:01:35.670> kind<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.939> forgotten<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.509> I

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
this point I've kind of forgotten that I

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.539 
this point I've kind of forgotten that I
don't<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> nose<00:01:37.590> gear<00:01:37.829> I'm<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.220> focused

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
don't have a nose gear I'm just focused

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.219 
don't have a nose gear I'm just focused
on<00:01:38.640> landing<00:01:38.970> that's<00:01:39.180> what<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> decided<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.049> had

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
on landing that's what I decided I had

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.069 
on landing that's what I decided I had
to<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:41.460> I'm<00:01:41.759> at<00:01:41.909> 20<00:01:42.240> feet<00:01:42.420> stabilized<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.049> I

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
they dropped more than I expected but at

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.780 
they dropped more than I expected but at
that<00:02:03.869> point<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.320> was<00:02:05.310> along<00:02:05.490> for<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.759> ride

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
feeling it balanced like it did on the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.920 
feeling it balanced like it did on the
videotape

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
videotape

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.470

and<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.900> was<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.260> but<00:02:14.650> then<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.040> had<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.370> sit

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
and that was it but then I had to sit

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.870 
and that was it but then I had to sit
there<00:02:15.730> for<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:15.940> minute<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.730> remember<00:02:18.730> how<00:02:18.820> to

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
there for a minute and remember how to

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.670 
there for a minute and remember how to
turn<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.330> shut<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.900> jet<00:02:20.080> off<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.500> everything

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
it was pretty big relief I didn't

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.870 
it was pretty big relief I didn't
realize<00:02:23.740> how<00:02:23.860> much<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.160> was<00:02:24.250> shaking<00:02:24.670> till<00:02:24.820> I

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
realize how much I was shaking till I

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.330 
realize how much I was shaking till I
got<00:02:25.060> out<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.480> aircraft
