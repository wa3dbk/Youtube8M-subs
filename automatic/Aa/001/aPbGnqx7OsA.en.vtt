now<00:03:14.790> one<00:03:15.000> last<00:03:15.210> eggplant<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.140> included<00:03:16.740> is

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
now one last eggplant that I included is

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.370 
now one last eggplant that I included is
actually<00:03:17.280> an<00:03:17.370> ornamental<00:03:18.150> plant<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.780> it's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
actually an ornamental plant and it's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.490 
actually an ornamental plant and it's
used<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:19.890> Japanese<00:03:20.160> floral<00:03:20.880> arrangements<00:03:21.540> but

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
used in Japanese floral arrangements but

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.040 
used in Japanese floral arrangements but
you<00:03:22.620> can<00:03:22.830> see<00:03:23.070> here<00:03:23.550> this<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.330> black<00:03:24.660> stem

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
you can see here this is the black stem

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.470 
you can see here this is the black stem
and<00:03:25.800> you<00:03:25.920> can<00:03:26.070> see<00:03:26.280> it's<00:03:26.520> been<00:03:26.730> devastated<00:03:27.390> by

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
and you can see it's been devastated by

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.560 
and you can see it's been devastated by
insects<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.230> without<00:03:28.530> knowing<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.190> actually

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
insects so without knowing it I actually

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.300 
insects so without knowing it I actually
planted<00:03:30.570> something<00:03:30.960> of<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.140> trap<00:03:31.500> crop<00:03:31.890> in<00:03:32.070> here

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
planted something of a trap crop in here

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.370 
planted something of a trap crop in here
because<00:03:32.460> the<00:03:32.730> insects<00:03:33.270> were<00:03:33.840> highly

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
because the insects were highly

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.590 
because the insects were highly
attracted<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.220> these<00:03:35.340> black<00:03:35.670> stem<00:03:35.970> eggplants

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
attracted to these black stem eggplants

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.020 
attracted to these black stem eggplants
and<00:03:37.290> didn't<00:03:37.800> move<00:03:37.920> on<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.400> other<00:03:38.550> plants

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
and didn't move on to the other plants

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.930 
and didn't move on to the other plants
and<00:03:39.150> as<00:03:39.330> much<00:03:40.050> so<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:40.980> guess<00:03:41.400> I've<00:03:41.610> we<00:03:41.760> got<00:03:41.910> a

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
and as much so I guess I've we got a

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.900 
and as much so I guess I've we got a
good<00:03:42.180> benefit<00:03:42.690> out<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:43.020> that<00:03:43.550> but<00:03:44.550> what<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.730> was

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
good benefit out of that but what I was

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.440 
good benefit out of that but what I was
really<00:03:44.940> after<00:03:45.450> was<00:03:46.730> using<00:03:47.730> these<00:03:47.880> beautiful

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
really after was using these beautiful

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.660 
really after was using these beautiful
black<00:03:48.630> stems<00:03:49.110> for<00:03:49.470> ornamental<00:03:49.830> arrangements

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
black stems for ornamental arrangements

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.790 
black stems for ornamental arrangements
so<00:03:51.060> even<00:03:51.420> with<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.750> leaf<00:03:51.930> damaged<00:03:52.470> we<00:03:52.650> could

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
so even with the leaf damaged we could

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.550 
so even with the leaf damaged we could
just<00:03:52.950> come<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.250> here<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.080> prune<00:03:55.080> off<00:03:55.260> those

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
just come in here and prune off those

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.530 
just come in here and prune off those
leaves<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:58.250> highlight<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.490> nice<00:03:59.700> dark<00:04:00.090> stem

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
leaves to highlight that nice dark stem

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.870 
leaves to highlight that nice dark stem
maybe<00:04:01.260> trim<00:04:01.590> off<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.920> top<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.190> little<00:04:02.370> bit<00:04:02.520> and

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
maybe trim off the top a little bit and

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.030 
maybe trim off the top a little bit and
we<00:04:03.450> have<00:04:03.480> these<00:04:03.750> nice<00:04:03.960> bright<00:04:04.320> red<00:04:04.500> fruits<00:04:04.860> and

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
we have these nice bright red fruits and

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.710 
we have these nice bright red fruits and
you<00:04:05.100> can<00:04:05.280> see<00:04:05.490> how<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.820> would<00:04:05.970> be<00:04:06.000> used<00:04:06.450> and

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
you can see how that would be used and

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.190 
you can see how that would be used and
look<00:04:07.350> very<00:04:07.560> elegant<00:04:08.100> in<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.520> vase<00:04:08.780> well<00:04:09.780> this<00:04:10.050> is
