alexis<00:01:21.509> didn't<00:01:21.840> play<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.110> Sunday<00:01:22.530> he<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.310> he

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
alexis didn't play on Sunday he and he

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.980 
alexis didn't play on Sunday he and he
still<00:01:23.700> didn't<00:01:23.939> look<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:24.299> today<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
still didn't look right today and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.020 
still didn't look right today and
probably<00:01:25.140> I'd<00:01:25.619> say<00:01:25.680> maybe<00:01:26.369> they<00:01:26.580> risked<00:01:26.909> him

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
probably I'd say maybe they risked him

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.819

I<00:01:54.479> think<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:55.500> that's<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.829> more<00:01:56.159> likely<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
I think that that's like more likely and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.100 
I think that that's like more likely and
I<00:01:56.729> think<00:01:56.880> media<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.360> press<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.840> will<00:01:57.990> get

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
I think media if we press on will get

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.139 
I think media if we press on will get
