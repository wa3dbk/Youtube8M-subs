they<00:00:37.510> find<00:00:37.809> out<00:00:37.989> but<00:00:38.290> as<00:00:38.410> much<00:00:38.650> how<00:00:39.070> they've

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
they find out but as much how they've

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:57.460 
they find out but as much how they've
matched<00:00:39.520> up<00:00:39.760> with<00:00:39.850> the<00:00:39.910> program<00:00:40.059> and<00:00:40.360> they<00:00:40.449> get

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.340 

I<00:00:57.760> will<00:00:58.760> say<00:00:59.030> that<00:00:59.330> every<00:00:59.720> year<00:00:59.930> we<00:01:00.110> try<00:01:00.260> to

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
I will say that every year we try to

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.020 
I will say that every year we try to
deliver<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.980> match<00:01:01.160> envelopes<00:01:01.760> in<00:01:01.940> a

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
deliver the match envelopes in a

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.750 
deliver the match envelopes in a
different<00:01:02.390> manner<00:01:02.530> this<00:01:03.530> idea<00:01:04.010> came<00:01:04.309> from<00:01:04.580> one

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
different manner this idea came from one

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.400 
different manner this idea came from one
of<00:01:04.880> the<00:01:05.000> current<00:01:05.210> fourth-year<00:01:05.840> students<00:01:06.320> who

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
of the current fourth-year students who

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.810 
of the current fourth-year students who
I<00:01:06.470> think<00:01:06.770> they<00:01:06.920> know<00:01:07.070> who<00:01:07.220> they<00:01:07.370> are

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
I think they know who they are

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.680 
I think they know who they are
last<00:01:08.390> year<00:01:09.020> someone<00:01:09.770> suggested<00:01:10.730> that<00:01:11.120> we<00:01:11.510> do

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
last year someone suggested that we do

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.870 
last year someone suggested that we do
pinatas<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.810> idea<00:01:15.260> of<00:01:15.440> 50<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.250> with<00:01:16.460> 50

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
pinatas the idea of 50 of you with 50

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.320 
pinatas the idea of 50 of you with 50
bats<00:01:17.090> did<00:01:17.450> not<00:01:17.660> seem<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:18.110> be<00:01:18.230> a<00:01:18.260> good<00:01:18.440> idea<00:01:19.330> so

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
bats did not seem to be a good idea so

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.720 
bats did not seem to be a good idea so
what<00:01:20.660> we<00:01:20.810> did<00:01:21.050> we<00:01:21.590> actually<00:01:22.070> looked<00:01:22.580> into

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
what we did we actually looked into

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.290 
what we did we actually looked into
pull-string<00:01:23.330> pinatas<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:25.190> idea<00:01:25.790> morphed

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
pull-string pinatas and the idea morphed

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.469 
pull-string pinatas and the idea morphed
into<00:01:26.570> what<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:27.200> see<00:01:27.230> here<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:28.010> to<00:01:28.910> design<00:01:29.240> it

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
into what you see here so to design it

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.990 
into what you see here so to design it
when<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:29.900> pull<00:01:30.170> it<00:01:30.350> your<00:01:31.130> results<00:01:31.670> will<00:01:31.850> be

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
when you pull it your results will be

00:01:32.000 --> 00:02:26.080 
when you pull it your results will be
inside

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.890 

applause<00:02:26.840> for<00:02:27.200> everybody<00:02:27.470> we<00:02:27.920> were<00:02:28.040> stuck

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.959 

you
