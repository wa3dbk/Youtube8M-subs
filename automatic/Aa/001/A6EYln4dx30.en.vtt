sorry want me to do so don't bug us all

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.089 
sorry want me to do so don't bug us all
you're<00:00:13.170> doing<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.559> you're<00:00:13.590> going<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.830> stir

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
you're doing is you're going to stir

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.799 
you're doing is you're going to stir
with<00:00:14.340> these<00:00:14.519> two<00:00:14.730> spoons<00:00:15.090> and<00:00:15.269> make<00:00:15.420> sure<00:00:15.629> that

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
with these two spoons and make sure that

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.320 
with these two spoons and make sure that
nothing<00:00:15.990> drips<00:00:16.950> on<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.250> already<00:00:17.520> down

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
nothing drips on you already down

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.749 
nothing drips on you already down
inhaler<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.529> steam<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.250> very<00:00:20.460> complex

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
inhaler and the steam is very complex

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.609 
inhaler and the steam is very complex
wait<00:00:21.750> am<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:21.960> supposed<00:00:22.169> to<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:22.590> this

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
wait am I just supposed to be like this

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.560 
wait am I just supposed to be like this
yeah<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:23.460> there<00:00:23.669> again<00:00:24.180> step<00:00:24.450> a<00:00:24.480> little

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
yeah like there again step a little

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.300 
yeah like there again step a little
closer<00:00:24.960> just<00:00:25.349> don't<00:00:25.529> make<00:00:25.800> sure<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.070> don't

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
closer just don't make sure you don't

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.380 
closer just don't make sure you don't
cool<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.789> bull<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.269> right<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.650> do

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
cool of the bull all right and we do

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.450 
cool of the bull all right and we do
thurs<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:30.779> simple<00:00:31.289> science<00:00:31.619> class<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.070> ever

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
thurs one simple science class so ever

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.970 
thurs one simple science class so ever
it's<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.420> kind<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.629> hard<00:00:33.690> culminating<00:00:34.440> lab

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
it's just kind of hard culminating lab

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.130 
it's just kind of hard culminating lab
and<00:00:35.510> throughout<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.720> we<00:00:36.839> talked<00:00:37.050> about

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and throughout it we talked about

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.660 
and throughout it we talked about
crystallization<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.280> if<00:00:38.489> things

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
crystallization and if things

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.340 
crystallization and if things
crystallized<00:00:39.269> fast<00:00:39.570> they<00:00:39.839> form<00:00:40.080> small

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
crystallized fast they form small

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.990 
crystallized fast they form small
crystals<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> ice<00:00:41.460> cream<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.850> much

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
crystals so the ice cream is much

00:00:42.000 --> 00:01:07.270 
crystals so the ice cream is much
smoother

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.990 

I<00:01:08.500> mean<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:09.590> can't

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.290 

liquid<00:01:12.840> nitrogen<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:14.000> colder<00:01:15.000> or<00:01:15.030> at

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
liquid nitrogen this one is colder or at

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.590 
liquid nitrogen this one is colder or at
least<00:01:15.600> minus<00:01:16.080> 321<00:01:16.860> Fahrenheit<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.360> pour

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
least minus 321 Fahrenheit and you pour

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.480 
least minus 321 Fahrenheit and you pour
it<00:01:18.720> very<00:01:19.170> slowly<00:01:19.530> right<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.040> there<00:01:20.190> cause<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it very slowly right in there cause it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.980 
it very slowly right in there cause it
immediately<00:01:20.790> boils<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.570> comes<00:01:21.780> into

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
immediately boils as it comes into

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.790 
immediately boils as it comes into
contact<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.650> room-temperature

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
contact with the room-temperature

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.040 
contact with the room-temperature
ingredients<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.880> that's<00:01:24.479> why<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.660> get<00:01:24.870> all

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
ingredients and that's why you get all

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.280 
ingredients and that's why you get all
the<00:01:25.229> well<00:01:26.070> minus<00:01:26.310> 321<00:01:27.240> Fahrenheit<00:01:27.780> nitrogen

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the well minus 321 Fahrenheit nitrogen

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.730 
the well minus 321 Fahrenheit nitrogen

vapor or gas coming up that freezes all

the humidity from the air that's why you
