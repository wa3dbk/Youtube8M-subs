00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.230
 Hi everyone! All right, the farmhouse said. 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.389
 lucas and this time I wanted to bring a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.660
 new game here the channel team 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.869
 good the name of joaquim viegas de do el 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.619
 but it is better known as a finger in Brazil 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.730
 and he is the following is a gift of action in 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.099
 third person 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.029
 ie the tps and today in third person 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.099
 and it's totally free it does not have cash 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.320
 there is nothing good 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.190
 it was developed by the mother has 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.899
 different, but now I think the 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.950
 sÃ©rgio are being negotiated by air 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.410
 games mon 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.469
 I downloaded the game there so I think 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.899
 I have shown through it 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.840
 is the following now the background gameplay 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.010
 I 'm choosing the rooms 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.710
 It took me a while to choose which 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.829
 I was in a forest and I have to 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.809
 inform in advance that I only ask 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.420
 this kind of game is going to be my hair 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.489
 several times and it will also be cool 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.670
 but is negative or below below 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.970
 an attack I also want to explain the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.960
 because of both video on the channel and I do not 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.930
 it's me and Alan 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.390
 good to be seen on the channel because the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.090
 people were a little discouraged is not 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.460
 order to record since you could not record 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.500
 nothing that's decent for you 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.270
 now I'm in the mood to write 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.060
 recording this video here and hopefully 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.979
 You like the game below and he 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.479
 because I honestly played half an hour 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:43.470
 and I addicted the game, it's very good, it's crazy 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.759
 that is so you are a scenario that is 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.280
 happening in your country happening a 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.310
 revolution has the republic and the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.570
 League then you cut the next or 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.020
 with the dream of joining the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.049
 Republic the empire or else 113 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.899
 alone when putting together a plan you know 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.939
 Good, I 'm not different in our 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.039
 different in the game so I do not know all the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:12.060
 modes that have but until now the modes that 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.660
 I thought it was an internet 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.730
 while the team and the classic kills kills 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.430
 well this classic has had times 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.180
 that good conquers evil depends and also 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.270
 has one in that game has a screen is half a 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.709
 a design to leave with the staff of the 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.650
 hotel is more for this you have to select 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:35.250
 the staff has to select the channel 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.380
 Because I played with Victor takes 67 and I 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.380
 I could not with your life for a minute. 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.750
 now on this map I played a lot 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.600
 months 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.920
 I think it's just that the game has more 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.420
 nothing whatever the medium of relatives and 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.970
 not always she can in the corners 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.840
 the taag begins the sword fight a 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.900
 shooting 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.819
 I found it very cool, but I did not say 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.890
 Nothing because I'm terrible. 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.230
 I tried to use it but I can not stay 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.810
 locked up and getting old priest was going to stay 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.099
 pressing a directional button at 1 with the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.640
 automatic 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.620
 Good, I guess that's just the link. 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.930
 game download is in the description of the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.930
 video is download link to download via 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.799
 a download link for air games 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.569
 I will leave part of the game and you will have 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.370
 to register in the area to do 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.760
 download the game but it's something very easy 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.340
 to tame the game took less than 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.630
 one hour ago download here 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.250
 internet two megas 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.040
 I think so it's not too heavy 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.930
 and also there as I'm playing with the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.030
 graphics at most everything in one 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:53.370
 Ray and I was in a quiet 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.350
 then it is good this was just another video 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.600
 quick to show this game to you I 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.880
 I hope you enjoy it because I 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:06.510
 luck and I do not know if anyone already knows more 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:08.280
 I did not know and I'll finish the 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.290
 video I liked it 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.989
 If you liked the video of the game too 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.440
 also please if you want because 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.720
 This makes me very happy to finish. 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.340
 If you are watching a video of china 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.150
 For the first time, the 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.610
 channel 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.110
 you will like to say that we make the 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.789
 people are kind of crazy 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.110
 there are no ones who do not kill themselves in the videos 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.509
 to manifest 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.509
 But finally, it's ending, bye
