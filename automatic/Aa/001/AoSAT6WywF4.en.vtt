I dug out some clay in front it's full
of<00:00:27.380> big<00:00:28.380> chunks<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.890> stone

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:38.950 

I've<00:00:34.039> saved<00:00:34.340> it<00:00:37.180> reduce<00:00:38.180> it<00:00:38.329> down<00:00:38.390> to<00:00:38.540> a<00:00:38.719> nice

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
I've saved it reduce it down to a nice

I've saved it reduce it down to a nice
fine<00:00:39.969> powder

so what I want to do is originally
painted<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:47.900> on<00:00:48.050> two

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.729 

just<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.160> test<00:00:53.790> piece<00:00:54.080> that's<00:00:55.080> just<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> basic

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
just a test piece that's just the basic

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.049 
just a test piece that's just the basic
glaze<00:00:55.950> and<00:00:57.470> it<00:00:58.470> came<00:00:58.680> out<00:00:58.860> quite<00:00:59.040> nicely<00:00:59.309> it's

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
glaze and it came out quite nicely it's

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.369 
glaze and it came out quite nicely it's
adhered<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> body<00:01:02.840> started<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.870> melt<00:01:04.229> but

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
adhered to the body started to melt but

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.590 
adhered to the body started to melt but
it's<00:01:04.559> still<00:01:04.769> very<00:01:04.830> matte<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:06.060> what<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> need<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
it's still very matte so what I need to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.960 
it's still very matte so what I need to
do<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:06.960> need<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.470> lower<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> melting<00:01:08.460> point

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
do is I need to lower the melting point

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.210 
do is I need to lower the melting point
to<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.680> by<00:01:10.680> adding<00:01:10.830> potassium<00:01:12.560> potash<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:14.070> it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
to this by adding potassium potash to it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.190 
to this by adding potassium potash to it
and<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> best<00:01:14.670> one<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> us<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.600> easiest<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and the best one of us in easiest and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.280 
and the best one of us in easiest and
cheapest<00:01:16.560> forms<00:01:16.800> of<00:01:16.920> potash<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.600> wood<00:01:18.600> ash<00:01:18.810> so

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
cheapest forms of potash is wood ash so

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.190 
cheapest forms of potash is wood ash so
i've<00:01:19.410> sipped<00:01:19.710> some<00:01:19.830> more<00:01:20.160> -<00:01:21.710> fire<00:01:24.080> for<00:01:25.080> those

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
i've sipped some more - fire for those

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.100 
i've sipped some more - fire for those
of<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:26.570> tell<00:01:27.570> me<00:01:27.660> off<00:01:27.780> about<00:01:27.930> not<00:01:28.229> wearing

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
of you tell me off about not wearing

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
of you tell me off about not wearing
actually<00:01:31.110> use<00:01:31.289> a<00:01:31.340> respirator<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
actually use a respirator for this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.490 
actually use a respirator for this
because<00:01:33.149> this<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.539> quite<00:01:33.720> dangerous<00:01:35.660> caustic

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.469 

we're<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.560> painted<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.070> arm<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:42.060> the

one-five<00:01:45.479> Biscay<00:01:45.960> where<00:01:47.630> that's<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> target

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
one-five Biscay where that's the target

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.420 
one-five Biscay where that's the target
results<00:01:51.170> up<00:01:51.290> that<00:01:53.680> it's<00:01:54.680> almost<00:01:54.890> like<00:01:55.160> a<00:01:55.190> red

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
results up that it's almost like a red

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:05.020 
results up that it's almost like a red
earthenware<00:01:57.130> scratch<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.400> it<00:02:01.900> that's<00:02:02.900> it<00:02:04.030> push

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
earthenware scratch to it that's it push

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.910 
earthenware scratch to it that's it push
down<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.540> then<00:02:05.660> scratch<00:02:06.320> it<00:02:06.500> through<00:02:11.920> blaze

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
down and then scratch it through blaze

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:31.650 
down and then scratch it through blaze
over<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:27.260> can<00:02:27.380> see<00:02:27.620> there<00:02:29.800> sunshine

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
over that you can see there sunshine

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.500 
over that you can see there sunshine
there's<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.750> classic<00:02:33.910> s-shaped<00:02:34.910> crack<00:02:35.300> in<00:02:35.450> the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
there's a classic s-shaped crack in the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.970 
there's a classic s-shaped crack in the
bottom<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.080> doesn't<00:02:36.440> show<00:02:36.560> right<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.890> way

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
bottom of it doesn't show right the way

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.130

through<00:02:37.220> there<00:02:37.570> of<00:02:38.570> course<00:02:38.810> I've<00:02:38.959> not

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
through there of course I've not

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.570 
through there of course I've not
compressed<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.800> base<00:02:39.980> wet<00:02:40.280> enough<00:02:41.380> there's<00:02:42.380> a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
compressed the base wet enough there's a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.830 
compressed the base wet enough there's a
spy<00:02:43.580> really<00:02:43.850> crack<00:02:44.090> we're<00:02:44.300> doing<00:02:44.450> much<00:02:44.630> to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
spy really crack we're doing much to

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.320 
spy really crack we're doing much to
this<00:02:44.959> because<00:02:45.260> it's<00:02:45.440> just<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.940> test<00:02:46.940> piece<00:02:49.330> but

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
this because it's just a test piece but

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.460 
this because it's just a test piece but
that's<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.660> have<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.870> remember<00:02:51.140> when<00:02:51.410> you

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
that's you have to remember when you

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.670 
that's you have to remember when you
throw<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:53.420> turn<00:02:53.720> in<00:02:53.930> it's<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.260> compress

the bases in these are all fairly grotty
at<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.350> bomb<00:02:57.580> because<00:02:58.580> they're<00:02:58.760> only<00:02:58.940> for

and<00:03:35.489> that's<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.940> what<00:03:36.480> I'll<00:03:36.599> do<00:03:36.780> now<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.110> get<00:03:37.230> on

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
and that's it what I'll do now is get on

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.350 
and that's it what I'll do now is get on
with<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.530> glazing<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.160> some<00:03:38.370> testing<00:03:38.790> I'm

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
with the glazing to some testing I'm

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.960 
with the glazing to some testing I'm
actually<00:03:39.510> going<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.840> add<00:03:39.989> some<00:03:40.579> oxides<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:41.880> the

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
actually going to add some oxides to the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.539 
actually going to add some oxides to the
basic<00:03:42.360> slip<00:03:44.209> manganese<00:03:45.209> dioxide<00:03:45.500> copper

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
basic slip manganese dioxide copper

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:53.180 
basic slip manganese dioxide copper
oxide<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.849> iron<00:03:48.630> oxide<00:03:49.670> just<00:03:51.980> 5%<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.129> then

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
oxide and iron oxide just 5% and then

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.880 
oxide and iron oxide just 5% and then
10%<00:03:53.720> see<00:03:54.720> what<00:03:54.870> happens<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.379> it<00:03:55.410> on<00:03:55.560> all<00:03:55.739> of

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
10% see what happens to it on all of

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.729 
10% see what happens to it on all of
these<00:03:56.040> tests<00:03:56.519> here<00:03:57.110> I'm<00:03:58.110> just<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.349> little<00:03:58.560> tip

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
these tests here I'm just a little tip

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.920 
these tests here I'm just a little tip
always<00:03:58.950> remember<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.450> I<00:04:00.510> will<00:04:00.690> be<00:04:00.810> doing

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
always remember to and I will be doing

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.229 
always remember to and I will be doing
it<00:04:01.170> is<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.160> in<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.340> bottom<00:04:02.640> of<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.849> just<00:04:03.030> write

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
it is to in the bottom of it just write

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.910 
it is to in the bottom of it just write
a<00:04:03.269> number<00:04:03.690> because<00:04:03.930> as<00:04:04.230> much<00:04:04.410> as<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.680> try<00:04:04.890> and

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
a number because as much as you try and

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.960 
a number because as much as you try and
remember<00:04:05.190> what<00:04:05.430> you're<00:04:05.579> doing<00:04:05.819> it's

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
remember what you're doing it's

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.449 
remember what you're doing it's
impossible<00:04:06.569> to<00:04:06.660> remember<00:04:07.049> so<00:04:07.440> number<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
impossible to remember so number the

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.340 
impossible to remember so number the
bottoms<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.910> your<00:04:08.940> parts<00:04:09.329> make<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.750> list<00:04:10.049> and

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
bottoms of your parts make a list and

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.080 
bottoms of your parts make a list and
keep<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.440> record<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.829> it<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:14.549> when<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:14.790> take<00:04:14.970> him

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
keep a record of it so when you take him

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.300 
keep a record of it so when you take him
out<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.299> kill<00:04:15.680> you<00:04:16.680> can<00:04:16.859> room<00:04:17.010> see<00:04:17.190> what

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
out the kill you can room see what

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.199 
out the kill you can room see what
you've<00:04:17.430> done<00:04:17.459> because<00:04:17.880> there's<00:04:18.060> nothing

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
you've done because there's nothing

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.529 
you've done because there's nothing
worse<00:04:18.419> than<00:04:18.570> doing<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.500> test<00:04:19.769> on<00:04:19.889> a<00:04:19.950> piece

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
worse than doing a test on a piece

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.129 
worse than doing a test on a piece
having<00:04:21.539> it<00:04:21.630> turned<00:04:21.870> out<00:04:22.019> absolutely

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
having it turned out absolutely

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.719 
having it turned out absolutely
fantastically<00:04:22.979> and<00:04:23.100> then<00:04:23.220> not<00:04:23.370> being<00:04:23.520> able<00:04:23.610> to

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
fantastically and then not being able to

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.940 
fantastically and then not being able to
remember<00:04:23.849> a<00:04:24.060> did<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.620> done<00:04:25.620> that<00:04:25.740> one<00:04:25.919> before

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
remember a did it done that one before

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.060 
remember a did it done that one before
and<00:04:26.550> so<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:26.729> made<00:04:26.910> that<00:04:26.940> mistake<00:04:27.090> again<00:04:27.330> okay

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
and so I made that mistake again okay

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.750 
and so I made that mistake again okay
I'll<00:04:29.070> show<00:04:29.220> them<00:04:29.340> as<00:04:29.490> an<00:04:29.550> oscillator<00:04:29.750> by
