00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
it's weird because the way that we think

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.570 
it's weird because the way that we think
of<00:02:45.459> ourselves<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:46.330> so<00:02:46.750> different<00:02:47.170> from<00:02:48.070> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
of ourselves is so different from the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.310 
of ourselves is so different from the
way<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.760> other<00:02:49.120> people<00:02:49.600> perceive<00:02:49.840> us

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
way that other people perceive us

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.930 
way that other people perceive us
because<00:02:50.739> when<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:51.100> look<00:02:51.310> back<00:02:51.340> on<00:02:51.670> my<00:02:51.700> high

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
to like a whole new level if something

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.640 
to like a whole new level if something
like<00:05:04.180> that<00:05:04.240> does<00:05:04.420> happen<00:05:04.990> and<00:05:05.380> you're<00:05:05.470> being

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
like that does happen and you're being

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
high school I think that if it's getting

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.530 
high school I think that if it's getting
to<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.520> point<00:05:09.790> where<00:05:09.910> you<00:05:10.090> feel<00:05:10.120> like<00:05:10.360> it's

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
to the point where you feel like it's

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.690 
to the point where you feel like it's
distracting<00:05:11.320> you<00:05:11.440> from<00:05:11.470> going<00:05:12.100> to<00:05:12.250> school<00:05:12.370> for

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
distracting you from going to school for

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
what the purpose of going to school is

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.810 
what the purpose of going to school is
for<00:05:14.170> which<00:05:14.320> is<00:05:14.440> learning<00:05:14.680> um<00:05:15.250> you<00:05:15.490> should<00:05:15.640> go
