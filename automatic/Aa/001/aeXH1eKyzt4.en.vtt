that I am though you know I find

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.980 
that I am though you know I find
something<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.120> try<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:40.390> work<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:40.870> know

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
something and I try to work you know

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.010 
something and I try to work you know
work<00:01:41.290> on<00:01:41.440> it<00:01:41.680> forever<00:01:42.670> just<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.330> you<00:01:43.720> know<00:01:43.930> to

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
work on it forever just to you know to

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.420 
work on it forever just to you know to
figure<00:01:44.320> out<00:01:44.410> what<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.650> possibilities<00:01:45.040> are

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
figure out what the possibilities are

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.120 
figure out what the possibilities are
and<00:01:46.170> from<00:01:47.170> that<00:01:47.290> point<00:01:47.500> you<00:01:47.650> know<00:01:47.830> what<00:01:47.979> you

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
and from that point you know what you

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.710 
and from that point you know what you
develop<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.640> language<00:01:48.790> then<00:01:49.180> you<00:01:49.300> can<00:01:49.479> you

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
develop the language then you can you

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.100 
develop the language then you can you
know<00:01:49.810> take<00:01:49.900> it<00:01:50.110> wherever<00:01:50.410> you<00:01:50.500> want<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.830> go<00:01:52.110> we

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
know take it wherever you want to go we

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.810 
know take it wherever you want to go we

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.740 
then we were just experimenting so much
pushing<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.190> limits<00:02:00.580> but<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.630> know

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
pushing the limits but you know

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.180 
pushing the limits but you know
sometimes<00:02:01.960> they<00:02:02.229> were<00:02:02.290> just<00:02:02.530> train<00:02:02.770> wrecks<00:02:03.040> in

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
sometimes they were just train wrecks in

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.770 
sometimes they were just train wrecks in
front<00:02:03.400> of<00:02:03.490> audiences<00:02:06.030> my<00:02:07.030> philosophy<00:02:07.630> is

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
front of audiences my philosophy is

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.540 
front of audiences my philosophy is
always<00:02:08.200> seem<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.530> be<00:02:08.739> that<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.369> know<00:02:09.459> if

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
always seem to be that you know if

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.130 
always seem to be that you know if
you're<00:02:09.640> going<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.790> do<00:02:09.970> something<00:02:10.209> and<00:02:11.020> you're

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
you're going to do something and you're

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.780 
you're going to do something and you're
gonna<00:02:11.320> you're<00:02:11.560> gonna<00:02:11.620> spend<00:02:11.980> time<00:02:12.220> at<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.580> and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
gonna you're gonna spend time at it and

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
gonna you're gonna spend time at it and
you<00:02:12.850> should<00:02:13.030> do<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.180> well

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810
