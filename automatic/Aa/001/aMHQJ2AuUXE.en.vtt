00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.320 

as<00:03:35.050> you<00:03:35.470> see<00:03:35.710> that<00:03:36.550> he's<00:03:36.700> just<00:03:36.790> going<00:03:37.000> up<00:03:37.150> quite

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
as you see that he's just going up quite

we<00:03:41.260> inflict<00:03:41.530> heels<00:03:41.830> will<00:03:45.240> continue<00:03:46.240> frying

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
we inflict heels will continue frying

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.130 
we inflict heels will continue frying
and<00:03:47.230> it's<00:03:47.350> releasing<00:03:47.650> that<00:03:47.860> adhesive<00:03:51.810> if<00:03:52.810> that

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140

he<00:03:53.260> becomes<00:03:53.680> too<00:03:53.860> stubborn<00:03:54.190> we<00:03:54.370> highly

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
he becomes too stubborn we highly

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.820 
he becomes too stubborn we highly
suggest<00:03:54.730> hitting<00:03:55.360> again<00:03:55.690> with<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.230> heat<00:03:56.800> gun

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
suggest hitting again with the heat gun

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.160 
suggest hitting again with the heat gun
or<00:03:57.130> hair<00:03:57.250> dryer<00:03:57.460> this<00:03:58.360> will<00:03:58.570> soften<00:03:58.810> up<00:03:59.050> that

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
or hair dryer this will soften up that

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.320 
or hair dryer this will soften up that
adhesive<00:03:59.410> again<00:03:59.740> making<00:04:00.460> it<00:04:00.610> much<00:04:00.910> easier<00:04:00.970> to

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
adhesive again making it much easier to

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
the touch screen here just got to play a

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:15.140 
the touch screen here just got to play a
little<00:04:08.290> bit<00:04:08.470> more<00:04:08.620> heat<00:04:08.830> in<00:04:08.920> this<00:04:09.010> corner<00:04:09.310> here

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.580 

and<00:04:15.599> now<00:04:15.780> we<00:04:15.840> should<00:04:15.959> be<00:04:16.169> able<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.470> fully

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
and now we should be able to fully

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:33.350 
and now we should be able to fully
remove<00:04:16.949> the<00:04:17.130> LCD<00:04:17.280> from<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.850> touchscreen

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.749 

and<00:04:33.509> there<00:04:34.169> we<00:04:34.289> go<00:04:34.319> there's<00:04:34.889> LCD<00:04:35.490> screens

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
and there we go there's LCD screens

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.360 
and there we go there's LCD screens
separated<00:04:36.180> from<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.389> touch<00:04:36.539> screen<00:04:36.750> here

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
separated from the touch screen here

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.890 
separated from the touch screen here
take<00:04:38.370> note<00:04:38.550> of<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.819> adhesive<00:04:39.060> hanging<00:04:39.659> on<00:04:39.720> the

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
LCD screen here that's what's holding it

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:55.930 
LCD screen here that's what's holding it
on<00:04:41.879> to<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.120> touch<00:04:42.300> screen

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.730 

if<00:04:56.510> you<00:04:56.840> were<00:04:56.960> to<00:04:57.080> remove<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:57.440> touchscreen

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.500 
if you were to remove the touchscreen
these<00:04:58.580> are<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:58.760> next<00:04:58.910> steps<00:04:59.150> that<00:04:59.300> you'd<00:04:59.390> have

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
these are the next steps that you'd have

to take you'll need to remove the
plastic<00:05:03.320> housing<00:05:04.220> here<00:05:04.670> and<00:05:04.820> wood<00:05:05.420> to<00:05:05.600> do<00:05:05.690> that

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
plastic housing here and wood to do that

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
plastic housing here and wood to do that
we're<00:05:05.930> just<00:05:05.990> gonna<00:05:06.140> use<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.350> heat<00:05:06.560> gun<00:05:06.680> or<00:05:06.740> hair

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
we're just gonna use a heat gun or hair

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.710 
we're just gonna use a heat gun or hair
dryer<00:05:06.980> again<00:05:07.370> and<00:05:07.580> just<00:05:07.940> warm<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.300> adhesive

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720

dryer again and just warm the adhesive
holding<00:05:09.140> the<00:05:09.260> touchscreen<00:05:09.560> and<00:05:09.950> now<00:05:10.070> to<00:05:10.130> this

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
holding the touchscreen and now to this

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.370 
holding the touchscreen and now to this
front<00:05:10.550> housing<00:05:10.760> you'll<00:05:11.630> be<00:05:11.750> very<00:05:11.960> careful

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
front housing you'll be very careful

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.320 
front housing you'll be very careful
here<00:05:12.500> as<00:05:12.680> that<00:05:12.890> housing<00:05:13.430> is<00:05:13.520> very<00:05:13.940> thin

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
here as that housing is very thin

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.970 
here as that housing is very thin
plastic<00:05:14.540> so<00:05:15.320> you<00:05:15.380> don't<00:05:15.530> want<00:05:15.650> to<00:05:15.710> overheat

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
plastic so you don't want to overheat

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.500 
plastic so you don't want to overheat
because<00:05:16.160> you<00:05:16.460> have<00:05:16.550> a<00:05:16.580> chance<00:05:16.760> of<00:05:16.940> melting<00:05:17.390> it

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
because you have a chance of melting it

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.380 
because you have a chance of melting it
or<00:05:18.130> making<00:05:19.130> it<00:05:19.250> very<00:05:19.430> malleable<00:05:19.730> to<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.180> point

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
or making it very malleable to the point

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.750 
or making it very malleable to the point
where<00:05:20.540> it<00:05:20.600> can<00:05:20.690> break<00:05:21.250> at<00:05:22.250> least<00:05:22.370> wanna<00:05:22.580> use

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
where it can break at least wanna use

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.520 
where it can break at least wanna use
small<00:05:23.420> amounts<00:05:23.690> of<00:05:23.750> heat<00:05:23.960> and<00:05:24.380> continue

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
small amounts of heat and continue

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.330 
small amounts of heat and continue
reheating<00:05:25.280> as<00:05:25.430> necessary<00:05:27.010> now<00:05:28.010> the<00:05:28.070> toughest

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
reheating as necessary now the toughest

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.860 
reheating as necessary now the toughest
part<00:05:28.550> about<00:05:28.580> getting<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.360> touch<00:05:29.510> screen<00:05:29.720> away

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
part about getting the touch screen away

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.810 
part about getting the touch screen away
from<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:30.170> frame<00:05:30.410> is<00:05:30.620> just<00:05:31.100> an<00:05:31.250> initial<00:05:31.400> entry

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
from the frame is just an initial entry

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.730 
from the frame is just an initial entry
point<00:05:32.060> which<00:05:32.870> can<00:05:33.140> be<00:05:33.290> a<00:05:33.320> little<00:05:33.530> bit<00:05:33.620> of<00:05:33.710> a

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
point which can be a little bit of a

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.800 
point which can be a little bit of a
pain<00:05:33.920> so<00:05:34.310> you<00:05:34.400> just<00:05:34.520> going<00:05:34.640> to<00:05:34.700> need<00:05:34.850> to<00:05:34.970> find<00:05:35.690> a

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
pain so you just going to need to find a

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.630 
pain so you just going to need to find a
way<00:05:35.930> to<00:05:35.990> leverage<00:05:36.320> your<00:05:36.650> pry<00:05:37.070> tool<00:05:37.100> underneath

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
way to leverage your pry tool underneath

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.970 
way to leverage your pry tool underneath
that<00:05:38.420> adhesive<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:39.140> the<00:05:39.710> touch<00:05:39.890> screen

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.850 

there's<00:05:45.670> also<00:05:45.790> a<00:05:46.240> few<00:05:46.840> areas<00:05:47.230> on<00:05:47.440> this<00:05:47.590> bezel

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
there's also a few areas on this bezel

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.800 
there's also a few areas on this bezel
that<00:05:48.010> very<00:05:48.550> very<00:05:48.760> thin<00:05:49.090> and<00:05:49.330> you<00:05:49.480> want<00:05:49.660> to<00:05:49.720> make

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
that very very thin and you want to make

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.180 
that very very thin and you want to make
sure<00:05:49.840> that<00:05:50.050> you<00:05:50.140> take<00:05:50.320> special<00:05:50.620> care<00:05:50.800> when

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
sure that you take special care when

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.550 
sure that you take special care when
releasing<00:05:52.180> those<00:05:52.420> areas<00:05:52.750> before<00:05:53.230> you<00:05:53.290> crack

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
releasing those areas before you crack

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:02.040 
releasing those areas before you crack
that<00:05:53.590> housing<00:05:58.410> so<00:05:59.410> we<00:05:59.530> go<00:05:59.680> releasing<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:01.050> some

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
that housing so we go releasing the some

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.100 
that housing so we go releasing the some
of<00:06:02.080> that<00:06:02.200> adhesive<00:06:03.330> we<00:06:04.330> can't<00:06:04.540> fully<00:06:04.810> remove

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
of that adhesive we can't fully remove

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:12.019 
of that adhesive we can't fully remove
the<00:06:05.200> top<00:06:05.410> yet<00:06:05.680> but<00:06:06.010> it's<00:06:06.100> getting<00:06:06.340> there

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:14.889 

on<00:06:12.539> both<00:06:12.749> the<00:06:12.869> sizes<00:06:13.079> where's<00:06:13.679> love<00:06:13.949> that<00:06:14.189> thin

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:14.899 
on both the sizes where's love that thin

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:17.509 
on both the sizes where's love that thin
frame<00:06:15.899> so<00:06:16.229> just<00:06:16.409> be<00:06:16.649> very<00:06:16.679> cautious<00:06:17.129> around

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:17.519 
frame so just be very cautious around

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:20.779 
frame so just be very cautious around
those<00:06:17.610> sides<00:06:18.379> like<00:06:19.379> I<00:06:19.439> said<00:06:19.619> we<00:06:19.829> heat<00:06:20.099> more

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
those sides like I said we heat more

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.749 
those sides like I said we heat more
often<00:06:21.179> in<00:06:21.389> this<00:06:21.539> location<00:06:21.809> because<00:06:22.579> you<00:06:23.579> don't

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
often in this location because you don't

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.639 
often in this location because you don't
want<00:06:23.879> to<00:06:23.939> overheat<00:06:24.209> that<00:06:24.479> bezel<00:06:24.899> so<00:06:25.529> let's

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:25.649 
want to overheat that bezel so let's

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:26.839 
want to overheat that bezel so let's
take<00:06:25.799> your<00:06:25.889> time<00:06:26.069> when<00:06:26.219> doing<00:06:26.459> this<00:06:26.579> as<00:06:26.789> you

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849 
take your time when doing this as you

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.399 
take your time when doing this as you
can<00:06:27.029> see<00:06:27.149> just<00:06:27.269> makes<00:06:27.389> it<00:06:27.539> so<00:06:27.779> much<00:06:27.839> easier<00:06:28.139> to

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
can see just makes it so much easier to

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.139 
can see just makes it so much easier to
slide<00:06:28.649> your<00:06:28.769> pry<00:06:28.949> tool<00:06:28.979> through<00:06:29.399> once

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:30.149 
slide your pry tool through once

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:34.519 
slide your pry tool through once
adhesive<00:06:30.629> is<00:06:30.689> properly<00:06:31.049> warmed<00:06:33.259> this<00:06:34.259> is<00:06:34.379> one

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:34.529 
adhesive is properly warmed this is one
