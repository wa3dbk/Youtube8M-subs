make<00:06:47.350> a<00:06:47.380> smartphone<00:06:48.030> this<00:06:49.030> would<00:06:49.240> be<00:06:49.270> kind<00:06:49.600> of

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
make a smartphone this would be kind of

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.450 
make a smartphone this would be kind of
what<00:06:49.810> it<00:06:49.900> would<00:06:49.990> look<00:06:50.169> like<00:06:50.229> maybe<00:06:50.680> may<00:06:50.949> have<00:06:51.430> a

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
bigger a bigger screen on it but this

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.210 
bigger a bigger screen on it but this
really<00:06:55.270> just<00:06:55.660> screams<00:06:56.020> out<00:06:56.259> that<00:06:56.470> it<00:06:56.560> wants<00:06:57.070> to
