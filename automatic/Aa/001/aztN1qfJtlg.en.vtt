00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
the important one if you think about it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.410 
the important one if you think about it
like<00:01:39.369> making<00:01:40.369> a<00:01:40.430> right<00:01:40.580> turn<00:01:40.610> really<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.210> only

like making a right turn really the only

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.350 
like making a right turn really the only
danger<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.289> have<00:01:42.610> is<00:01:43.610> pissing<00:01:44.000> people<00:01:44.119> off

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
danger you have is pissing people off

anyway it had 56 horsepower at like 4500
rpm<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:06.180> 50<00:05:07.180> foot-pounds<00:05:07.840> of<00:05:08.080> torque<00:05:08.139> at<00:05:08.909> 3500

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
rpm and 50 foot-pounds of torque at 3500

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:14.790 
rpm and 50 foot-pounds of torque at 3500
rpm<00:05:10.240> I<00:05:10.449> believe<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.789> first<00:05:12.789> of<00:05:12.939> all<00:05:13.800> street

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
rpm I believe and first of all street

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.589 
rpm I believe and first of all street
sweeper<00:05:15.069> I'll<00:05:15.879> continue<00:05:16.150> their<00:05:16.389> cheering

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
sweeper I'll continue their cheering

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.170 
sweeper I'll continue their cheering

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.330 
label
all<00:05:19.180> right<00:05:19.330> street<00:05:19.599> sweeper<00:05:19.990> is<00:05:20.860> gone

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
all right street sweeper is gone

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.559 
all right street sweeper is gone
well<00:05:21.520> not<00:05:21.789> really<00:05:21.969> but<00:05:22.180> I<00:05:22.240> closed<00:05:22.419> the<00:05:22.509> garage

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
well not really but I closed the garage

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:26.010 
well not really but I closed the garage
anyway<00:05:23.069> so<00:05:24.069> that<00:05:24.250> is<00:05:24.280> much<00:05:25.240> more<00:05:25.509> power<00:05:25.719> and

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
anyway so that is much more power and

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.080 
anyway so that is much more power and
much<00:05:26.199> more<00:05:26.379> torque<00:05:26.680> at<00:05:26.889> a<00:05:26.919> much<00:05:27.460> much<00:05:27.819> lower

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
much more torque at a much much lower

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.040 
much more torque at a much much lower
rpm<00:05:28.659> so<00:05:30.449> but<00:05:31.449> it's<00:05:31.599> completely<00:05:31.750> different

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
rpm so but it's completely different

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.050 
rpm so but it's completely different
built<00:05:32.469> engine<00:05:32.830> once<00:05:33.639> again<00:05:33.819> that<00:05:33.940> was<00:05:34.030> a

v-twin the two cylinders and this is a

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:44.189 
v-twin the two cylinders and this is a
inline<00:05:38.020> 4<00:05:38.289> with<00:05:38.440> 4<00:05:40.050> so<00:05:41.909> yes<00:05:42.909> that<00:05:43.240> is<00:05:43.419> my<00:05:43.599> little

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
inline 4 with 4 so yes that is my little

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.689
