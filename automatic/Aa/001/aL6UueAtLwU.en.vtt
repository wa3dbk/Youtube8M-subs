00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
we don't base these on 3criteria

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:58.320 
we don't base these on 3criteria
price<00:01:51.330> taste<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:54.040> nutrition<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:58.000> for<00:01:58.240> the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
price taste and nutrition so for the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.310 
price taste and nutrition so for the
insure<00:01:58.840> is<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.440> little<00:01:59.740> bit<00:01:59.830> more<00:01:59.979> calories<00:02:01.320> but

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.950 
insure is a little bit more calories but
the<00:02:02.440> boost<00:02:02.680> has<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.070> higher<00:02:03.220> protein<00:02:03.960> so

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
the boost has the higher protein so

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.560 
the boost has the higher protein so
we'll<00:02:05.110> call<00:02:05.380> that<00:02:05.409> it's<00:02:05.860> high<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:07.090> price<00:02:07.360> is

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
they ensure for me gets the 85% but the

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:14.149 
they ensure for me gets the 85% but the

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.839 
boost gets a eighty-two percent they're
very<00:06:14.400> similar<00:06:14.789> in<00:06:15.089> flavor<00:06:15.270> but<00:06:16.759> there<00:06:17.759> you

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849 
very similar in flavor but there you

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:22.129 
very similar in flavor but there you
have<00:06:18.060> it<00:06:19.999> either<00:06:20.999> what<00:06:21.330> do<00:06:21.479> well<00:06:21.689> for<00:06:22.020> your

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:24.089 
body but if you're looking for high

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:25.850 
body but if you're looking for high
protein<00:06:24.569> you<00:06:25.020> probably<00:06:25.319> want<00:06:25.529> to<00:06:25.560> go<00:06:25.680> with<00:06:25.710> a

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
protein you probably want to go with a

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.429 
protein you probably want to go with a
boost<00:06:26.069> but<00:06:26.400> for<00:06:26.580> taste<00:06:26.789> wise<00:06:26.999> I<00:06:27.349> recommend<00:06:28.349> the

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:28.439 
boost but for taste wise I recommend the

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:33.100 
boost but for taste wise I recommend the
ensure<00:06:29.599> but<00:06:30.599> like<00:06:31.560> I<00:06:31.650> said<00:06:31.710> before<00:06:31.979> chocolate

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
ensure but like I said before chocolate

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.409 
ensure but like I said before chocolate
