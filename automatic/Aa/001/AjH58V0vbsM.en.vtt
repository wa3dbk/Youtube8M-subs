this<00:00:22.789> gives<00:00:23.000> the<00:00:23.119> boat<00:00:23.330> some<00:00:23.599> great<00:00:23.929> handling

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
this gives the boat some great handling

she measured her consumption in tons

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.040 
she measured her consumption in tons
rather<00:02:34.190> than<00:02:34.340> gallons<00:02:34.670> per<00:02:34.910> hour<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:35.900> how

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
rather than gallons per hour so how

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.250 
rather than gallons per hour so how

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
frugal was the frontier economy I think

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.940 
frugal was the frontier economy I think
in<00:02:39.650> nice<00:02:39.830> speed<00:02:40.220> is<00:02:40.430> about<00:02:40.640> 20<00:02:41.120> 21<00:02:41.720> knots<00:02:42.140> that
