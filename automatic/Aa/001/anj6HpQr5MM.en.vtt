and<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.170> once<00:01:46.530> our<00:01:46.770> circuit<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.280> which<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.119> now

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and then once our circuit a which is now

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.029 
and then once our circuit a which is now
facets<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:49.380> finally<00:01:49.710> once<00:01:49.890> we've

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
facets and then finally once we've

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.499 
facets and then finally once we've
turned<00:01:50.250> off<00:01:50.429> our<00:01:50.579> boil<00:01:50.820> we're<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.299> add

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
turned off our boil we're going to add

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.810 
turned off our boil we're going to add
in<00:01:51.750> one<00:01:52.020> ounce<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.469> Simcoe<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> steep<00:01:53.399> which<00:01:53.700> is

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
in one ounce of Simcoe to steep which is

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.849 
in one ounce of Simcoe to steep which is
going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.060> provide<00:01:54.299> some<00:01:54.359> very<00:01:55.020> strong

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859 
going to provide some very strong

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:59.240 
going to provide some very strong
aromatic<00:01:56.189> flavors<00:01:57.350> with<00:01:58.350> 50<00:01:58.740> minutes<00:01:59.069> off<00:01:59.159> to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
aromatic flavors with 50 minutes off to

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.859 
aromatic flavors with 50 minutes off to
the<00:01:59.340> box<00:01:59.549> we're<00:01:59.850> gonna<00:01:59.939> add<00:02:00.179> our<00:02:00.210> Irish<00:02:00.659> moss

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
the box we're gonna add our Irish moss

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.359 
the box we're gonna add our Irish moss
to<00:02:00.929> help<00:02:01.109> with<00:02:01.259> our<00:02:01.469> protein<00:02:01.530> coagulation

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
to help with our protein coagulation

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.179 
to help with our protein coagulation
we're<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> add<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.360> teaspoon<00:02:03.569> of<00:02:03.899> this

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
we're going to add one teaspoon of this

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.639 
we're going to add one teaspoon of this
and<00:02:05.189> then<00:02:06.119> for<00:02:06.569> yeast<00:02:06.780> we're<00:02:07.289> going<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.469> use

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
and then for yeast we're going to use

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.639 
and then for yeast we're going to use
the<00:02:07.890> staff<00:02:08.129> male<00:02:08.340> sl5<00:02:09.229> which<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.379> going<00:02:10.560> to

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
the staff male sl5 which is going to

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.220 
the staff male sl5 which is going to
ferment<00:02:10.950> very<00:02:11.549> strongly<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.629> also<00:02:12.900> provide<00:02:13.200> a

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
ferment very strongly and also provide a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.190 
ferment very strongly and also provide a
nice<00:02:13.560> clean<00:02:13.890> place
