 Barrette on the same, and the first time you do

 if you are a little wrong with the post and 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.860

 hair length still can begin 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.550
 do such a hairstyle but for such 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.169

 all besides the mood of their external 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.280
 view and so look at the video how are you 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.620
 did this hairstyle to start 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.180
 combing hair and collect high 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.080
 tail in the place where it will be 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:05.130
 bow tip of the tail we get in advance and 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.000
 do not get out of the gum 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:11.110
 the beam is divided in the center into 2 halves 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.039
 transfer the tip of the hair back through 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.139
 middle of the bow 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.560
 fasten the bank studs and add 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:20.530
 a little lacquer so that it is often required 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.479
 can i touch natasha of course you 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.639
 importance don't try to untie only here 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.910
 it's not just interesting how durable 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.490
 the design turned out and neatly 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.729
 a real hair bow 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.150
 yet again 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.160
 what was the hardest thing probably get 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.800
 here is the middle to bow gently 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.870
 it’s really hard 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.960
 that you need to distribute the hair evenly 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.090
 and then fix it here. 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.729
 and notice how all this is behind 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.130
 organized the most difficult moment I you 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:52.090
 I speak as a stylist to hide this one 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.949
 strand inside 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.440
 to hide this strand inside her 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:58.060
 need to tuck on her pin and 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.729
 then already twisting how to stick 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.780
 pin in on too thanks very much 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:07.000
 good hairstyle and you to face 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.860
 Well, here's a bow of hair for sure 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.289
 can not be done with short hair 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.150
 given to entice yes no way with hair 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:13.630
 to shoulders or a little lower already 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.120
 do 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.340
 The main thing is to catch the volume if you have hair 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.990
 not very tight are you doing bank 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.460
 more compact and better to do it 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.680
 somewhere symmetrical on the side 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.840
 if you have a lot of hair and they are tight 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.970
 what natasha then do in the center as 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.919
 just this one gift option as well, and it 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.169
 asymmetrical can be done very easily 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:34.000
 just the tail that you do in the very
