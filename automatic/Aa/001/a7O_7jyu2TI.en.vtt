between<00:02:02.750> aluminium<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.409> plastic<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:06.360> it

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
between aluminium and plastic but it

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.359 
between aluminium and plastic but it
does<00:02:06.689> feel<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.049> atom<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.890> when<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.160> tap

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
does feel like atom in you when you tap

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.130 
does feel like atom in you when you tap
it<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:08.819> then<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.420> build<00:02:09.660> quality<00:02:09.840> just

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
it but then the build quality just

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.020 
it but then the build quality just
doesn't<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.649> not<00:02:10.709> there<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.340> don't<00:02:11.610> think<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
doesn't it's not there I don't think it

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.730 
doesn't it's not there I don't think it
is<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.900> here's

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
is so here's

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.390 
is so here's
the<00:02:13.830> VGA<00:02:14.580> cable<00:02:15.030> they<00:02:15.150> do<00:02:15.210> include<00:02:16.130> so<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.250> is

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
the VGA cable they do include so this is

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.390 
the VGA cable they do include so this is
VGA<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.880> VGA<00:02:18.450> does<00:02:19.110> have<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.350> VGA<00:02:19.740> port<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:20.220> the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
VGA to VGA does have a VGA port on the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.800 
VGA to VGA does have a VGA port on the
bottom<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:20.940> monitor<00:02:21.360> which<00:02:21.510> we'll<00:02:21.660> see

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
bottom in the monitor which we'll see

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.440 
bottom in the monitor which we'll see
later<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.440> then<00:02:23.070> your<00:02:23.220> V<00:02:23.340> your<00:02:23.640> VGA<00:02:24.060> will<00:02:24.300> go

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
later and then your V your VGA will go

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.110 
later and then your V your VGA will go
straight<00:02:24.750> into<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.290> good<00:02:25.440> old<00:02:25.590> PC<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.850> is

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
straight into the good old PC that is

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.550 
straight into the good old PC that is
part<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.810> bundle<00:02:28.700> so<00:02:29.700> next<00:02:30.450> finger<00:02:31.230> we're

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
part of the bundle so next finger we're

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.170 
part of the bundle so next finger we're
just<00:02:31.680> going<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.860> unbox<00:02:32.370> everything<00:02:32.970> here

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
just going to unbox everything here

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.450 
just going to unbox everything here
which<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.780> quite<00:02:34.230> well<00:02:34.470> obviously<00:02:34.680> when<00:02:35.310> you

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
which is quite well obviously when you

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.460 
which is quite well obviously when you
unbox<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:36.390> going<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.570> be<00:02:36.690> much<00:02:36.870> easier<00:02:36.900> so

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
unbox it it's going to be much easier so

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.240 
unbox it it's going to be much easier so
you<00:02:37.530> don't<00:02:37.710> care<00:02:37.890> about<00:02:37.980> what<00:02:38.190> the

see<00:05:40.710> there's<00:05:40.889> a<00:05:40.919> nice<00:05:41.069> bump<00:05:41.340> there<00:05:41.639> which<00:05:41.849> I<00:05:42.000> do

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
see there's a nice bump there which I do

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.240 
see there's a nice bump there which I do
really<00:05:42.870> really<00:05:43.050> think<00:05:43.889> they<00:05:44.039> should<00:05:44.219> have

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
really really think they should have

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.860 
really really think they should have
included<00:05:44.789> the<00:05:44.880> power<00:05:45.090> supply<00:05:45.479> in<00:05:45.659> there

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
included the power supply in there

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.019 
included the power supply in there
because<00:05:46.139> some<00:05:46.380> people<00:05:46.680> are<00:05:46.830> about<00:05:47.789> their

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
because some people are about their

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.120 
because some people are about their
space<00:05:48.330> they<00:05:48.599> need<00:05:48.840> a<00:05:49.050> lot<00:05:49.409> of<00:05:49.440> space<00:05:49.710> they<00:05:49.949> got

space they need a lot of space they got

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.700 
space they need a lot of space they got
small<00:05:50.520> apartment<00:05:51.180> small<00:05:51.960> room<00:05:52.199> they<00:05:52.440> they

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
small apartment small room they they

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.680

don't<00:05:52.860> they<00:05:53.069> can't<00:05:53.400> keep<00:05:53.759> up<00:05:54.029> with<00:05:54.060> all<00:05:54.389> these

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
don't they can't keep up with all these

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.899 
don't they can't keep up with all these
power<00:05:55.050> bricks<00:05:55.440> like<00:05:55.680> the<00:05:56.190> one<00:05:56.340> with<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.550> Xbox

contrast and everything and as you can

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:06.409 
contrast and everything and as you can
see<00:06:04.259> here<00:06:04.590> it's<00:06:04.740> very<00:06:04.979> glossy<00:06:05.340> display<00:06:06.060> this

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
see here it's very glossy display this

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.600 
see here it's very glossy display this
is<00:06:06.539> no<00:06:06.690> matte<00:06:07.020> finish<00:06:07.440> and<00:06:07.650> as<00:06:07.860> I<00:06:08.009> turned<00:06:08.340> up<00:06:08.430> my

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
is no matte finish and as I turned up my

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.120 
is no matte finish and as I turned up my
aperture<00:06:09.090> on<00:06:09.360> the<00:06:09.419> camera<00:06:10.139> you<00:06:10.319> can<00:06:10.740> see<00:06:10.949> me<00:06:11.099> so

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
aperture on the camera you can see me so

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.129 
aperture on the camera you can see me so
clearly<00:06:11.729> it's<00:06:12.000> like<00:06:12.180> looking<00:06:12.509> into<00:06:12.659> a<00:06:12.810> mirror

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
clearly it's like looking into a mirror

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.749 
clearly it's like looking into a mirror
you<00:06:13.440> can<00:06:13.680> see<00:06:13.860> everything<00:06:14.400> on<00:06:14.550> there

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
you can see everything on there

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.850 
you can see everything on there
obviously<00:06:15.630> it's<00:06:16.050> not<00:06:16.349> like<00:06:16.529> that<00:06:16.680> in<00:06:16.770> real

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
obviously it's not like that in real

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.980 
obviously it's not like that in real
life<00:06:16.919> is<00:06:17.340> but<00:06:18.029> then<00:06:18.210> it's<00:06:18.360> not<00:06:18.419> as<00:06:18.599> dark<00:06:18.840> as

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
life is but then it's not as dark as

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.600 
life is but then it's not as dark as
what<00:06:19.229> you<00:06:19.319> see<00:06:19.529> there<00:06:19.800> it's<00:06:20.039> just<00:06:20.190> tiny<00:06:20.400> bit

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
what you see there it's just tiny bit

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.029 
what you see there it's just tiny bit
