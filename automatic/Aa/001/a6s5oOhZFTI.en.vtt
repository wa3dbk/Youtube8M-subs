00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.340
 and of course 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.890
 and that all youtube friends that is 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.900
 friend of bnf not between the boy killed 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.480
 another video because here I bring you a video 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.210
 informative of the top 14 of minecraft of 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.270
 xbox 360 or playstation 3 like many 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.939
 will know the 14 has been announced of what 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.680
 I hope so long ago that 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.939
 we do not have updates and he has already 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.529
 removed images and everything and 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.239
 unfortunately, they could not be removed 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.400
 the channel but in this video shows 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.910
 explaining all the important changes 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.710
 of the to 14 and well then let's start 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.260
 and well, first things first from 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.320
 that they have been added emeralds 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.450
 what it says is a very valuable honor like that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.580
 like the diamond still if it does not get bad 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.170
 still does not have a use but but then 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.640
 it is a clear place that very valuable well 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.440
 like the diamond but that's not that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.660
 I'm if I'm not wrong it's harder to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.910
 get the first thing would be the gold itself 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.220
 already and when you have already mined it 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.170
 it would be the gold that you find in the 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.580
 mines and last the block as well as the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.560
 diamond block finished there's a 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.530
 emerald block that then to my liking 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.720
 it's very good very nice is something new 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.899
 in the game since it's green and you'll see that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.280
 we do not have anything green besides the grass 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.710
 The next thing we have in the list is 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.140
 the under chest or the chest sell us 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.840
 It serves for 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.000
 basically transport objects from the chest 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.400
 chest for example we put a chest of 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.740
 these in a mine and then we put one of 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.260
 our house then what we keep 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.610
 in this chest may also appear in 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.430
 the one from the mine for example 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.530
 we put a diamond ax in this 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.110
 chest when we go to the mine and 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.659
 let's open this chest that same one goes to 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.500
 be in the next thing we have is 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.970
 the trip wave that is like a kind of thread 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.710
 that you put on the floor and when 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.630
 you walk on it or when you stop it when 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.460
 what he does is activate 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.080
 mechanisms of redd stones and well 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.270
 you already know that by activating network mechanisms 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.250
 are you can open doors review secrets 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.320
 et cetera etcetera and then probably 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.980
 about some traps of this like me to my 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.470
 channel 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.140
 and then there are the golden apples but 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.030
 this time they are delighted before we could 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.620
 be the most golden dinners but do not love 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.570
 so I have some differences 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.980
 delighted you get more like positions 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.380
 for example run fast that you 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.180
 generates life for much longer as 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.180
 come there is the manufacturing are used 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.189
 8 gold cubes and an apple 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.530
 after this we have what would be the 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.359
 anvil the anvil serves us to repair 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.579
 tools such as the peak 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.500
 of the ax the shovel and so on and also 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.689
 we can make some changes we can not 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.000
 change the name and we can also by 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.370
 example we have a peak with efficiency and 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.590
 a peak with and we broke bility 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.329
 join those two peaks and make one 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.719
 even more efficient as shown in the 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.719
 image now 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.189
 after this we have what would be the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.930
 Flower pot is basically a pot in 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.060
 which you can come and place a 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.920
 flower serves more than all decoration not 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.930
 it's good for nothing else and it's a good 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.270
 element to have well decorated your 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.700
 home 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.560
 then we have what the walls would be 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.060
 of costs the walls of cobos are 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.980
 like the fences but you see being from 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.840
 wood are going to be pebbles and so very 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.430
 easy crafter you only need six 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.500
 pebble blocks to capture these and 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.680
 They look great to decorate and it would be your 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.450
 house your farm and so on 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.920
 after this we have what would be the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.290
 food of the food to be navigated have 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.959
 added several things like for example 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.840
 the potato the baked potato 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.510
 carrot potato poisonous potato 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.760
 carrot carrot with gold 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.230
 carrot on a stick the cake of 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.879
 pumpkin and then it just is not like 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.409
 five meals do the same to them 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.390
 all not what they do is regenerate you 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.460
 lifetime 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.900
 now with the mergers the potions do not 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.520
 we have added two but they are very 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.260
 efficient the first one is the one of 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.940
 invisibility that his name says it to you 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.130
 allows to make invisible by a quantity 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.200
 of time and the other is night vision 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.190
 that allows you to see in the dark by 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.930
 a period of time 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.030
 also an aggregate what would be the 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.190
 fourth in the black the fourth of four 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.750
 of reading is how to find out what 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.180
 I say coal in a mine but not sell 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.430
 this gives you like some types of paper 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.200
 as seen in the image and therefore those 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.330
 pieces of paper can be quartz blocks 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.560
 stairs quartz quartz slabs there 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.470
 many things you can do with the 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.630
 quartz and it is very decorative and it is 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.850
 snow white white color there is not but it 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.520
 He sees the decoration in the houses very well or 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.289
 that follow the castles and so on 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.539
 etc 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.460
 and then we have what the books would be 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.860
 delighted the enchanted books are 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.879
 like books that either can be 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.710
 read good I do not know if it is not 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.539
 updates will be able to read but 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.930
 for example if you have in a book 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:46.270
 delighted what would be efficiency 5 that 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.339
 efficiency 5 with the anvil you can 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.349
 put any pick to any shovel 

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:52.240
 to whatever it is not then those books 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.430
 delighted they serve more than anything to 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.540
 put spells specific to 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.970
 all tools 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.260
 and finally the last thing that's added 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.240
 in the update two 14 are the 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.130
 carpets are carpets such as wool 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.110
 It can be made of any dye and 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.780
 you can instead the carpets can be 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.300
 put on any surface and this 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.040
 is this highlight is not like wool that 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.920
 If you put it on the floor, take it all flat 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.590
 instead the carpets highlight how it 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.420
 will give an account in this image 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.130
 and well, gentlemen, that's basically 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.900
 what they have added to the game I'm going to 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.760
 leave the good list of the page 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.350
 where I saw it from the list of everything that 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.150
 they have added everything they have put in the 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.920
 description or if not an annotation 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.900
 which I do not think is possible but it 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.750
 they left it in the description after 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.130
 liked this video this by the way I just 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.930

 often since I do not have much 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.650
