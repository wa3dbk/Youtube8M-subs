00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.480
 I like playing, I like to play anything 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:11.759
 I clearly like playing with the accordion 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.679
 i like to play any musical genre for so many times 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:22.140
 I needed to play a popular instrument, a onion ban 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.179
 month for 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.839
 a classical accordion 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:31.349
 for the grandfather is accordionists if the left king charming the feast of 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.260
 fascinating accordion 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.800
 because you always see these 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.880
 buttons you can't figure out how to handle them 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.050
 for many accordionists, the bass discourse remains fascinating 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.390
 loose 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.380
 because a world today so slightly different from that of the bass 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.860
 traditional 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.710
 with this ready torment we have the possibility to use everyone 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.660
 tt tt of existing loose bass 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.080
 from the loose bottom that is used in western Europe but to minor thirds 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.300
 to your fort that is used in accordion whips diana 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.300
 if I could minor, however, it was in the third row 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.020
 and still of the quintet accordions are particularly lime and 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.230
 Italy still uses a lot 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.600
 the low holy paltrow in this instrument also the possibility of 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.440
 be matched in addition to the accordion hours it also contains 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.160
 to many other orchestral sounds 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.510
 and this does yes 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.259
 that is not relegated to exclusive use of music 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.859
 original of the contemporary music of music we say classic for 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.039
 accordion but backfill returns to be an excellent element a 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.990
 very important element also for you 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.039
 arrangements of different styles also in music 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 read 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:31.300
 epicuro 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.919
 I liked 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.370
 I really like the orchestra I ask you to do 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.119
 the conductor often me 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:42.409
 they found the orchestras for you too, the orchestra clearly wasn't in 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.499
 my chances offense 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:48.749
 perhaps also why I liked the accordion and I like you as a friend who 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.749
 is a tool mi 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.140
 I like this thing missing because inside it possibility to have 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.209
 numerous tools 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.469
 free course brings new emergency to the violin 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:05.459
 etc 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.459
 although all these sounds are not enough 

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:11.530
 through a very simple 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.579

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.159

 has a computer disconnect me from other keyboards 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.129

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.879
 a tool that has the Maltese 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.149
