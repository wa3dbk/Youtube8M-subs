i'm going to show you what that group

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.850 
i'm going to show you what that group
looks<00:00:38.670> like<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> racket<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.410> hand<00:00:40.710> is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
looks like so the racket the hand is

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.400 
looks like so the racket the hand is
more<00:00:41.150> on<00:00:42.150> top<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> racket<00:00:42.810> in<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.170> manner

more on top of a racket in this manner
right<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:45.800> this<00:00:46.800> will<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.130> wrong<00:00:47.570> right<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.870> if

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
right so this will be wrong right and if

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.580 
right so this will be wrong right and if
you<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.130> the<00:00:50.280> hand<00:00:50.490> way<00:00:50.790> too<00:00:50.850> much<00:00:51.600> back<00:00:52.170> here

you have the hand way too much back here
that<00:00:52.880> could<00:00:53.880> work<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:54.630> also<00:00:54.780> not<00:00:55.080> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
that could work but that's also not the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.530 
that could work but that's also not the
best<00:00:55.650> way<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.800> doing<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.040> so<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.790> right

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
best way of doing it so here right

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.870 
best way of doing it so here right
