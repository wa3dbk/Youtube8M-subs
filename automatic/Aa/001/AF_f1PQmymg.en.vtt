00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello everyone this is the first video of 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.569
 a series of videos that go up 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.910
 to the channel that is going to be like being spirit 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.389
 see how to make the cube as fast 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.710
 possible and so good if you go seeing if 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.990
 you are a beginner and you are watching the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.480
 videos that go up are going to improve 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.820
 the times a lot if you apply what I'm going 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.600
 go teaching I personally took 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.029
 around 25 seconds a little more or 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.929
 a little less depends cube and the case 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.430
 but well this what I taught to 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.200
 who what I'm going to teach in these 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.620
 videos can also be applied to me to 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.320
 anyone at any time 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.040
 but well I'm going to focus more on the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.050
 good beginners let's start now 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.090
 worth this first video is going to be 5 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.860
 atrix then this of the finger tricks 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.219
 then turn the cube solve the juice with 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.649
 the fingers not with the doll the mania that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.420
 is usually from beginners who already 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.340
 I have everyone anyone 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.960
 to start with the cubes is 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.810
 so in this way almost with the doll 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.729
 doing twists of this style that 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.240
 this way of moving the cube is pretty 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.579
 slow and you lose a lot of time 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.920
 can move like with your fingers is a lot 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.470
 faster 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.080
 and good and how is this done first 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.170
 in the way of catching the cube is like that 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.420
 I take it like this in this way 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.399
 thumbs here in the middle that do not impede 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.960
 the twists of what I 'm going to say in the 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.440
 top layer that do not get in the way but here 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.790
 in the middle 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.340
 and the middle finger here back 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.560
 here in the middle too and in this way 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.560
 you can inspect the cube rotate and 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.750
 get there without losing the position and I have 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.100
 the other fingers free to go turning 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.880
 the good cube the most useful turn with 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.330
 the fingers that is easiest is that of the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.480
 layer above the layer and as well very 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.210
 easy with your finger this index rotates in the 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.740
 top layer 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:13.220
 well he has no more at the beginning he was 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.040
 kinda weird being something like that but good with 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.620
 the practice of such can be approached 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.420
 it's faster at the beginning for good a 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.220
 bit harder too good to say that 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.560
 it depends on the cube because it is the cube of 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.600
 these of robinson or of the chinese or what 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.880
 that it is almost impossible to pull like that 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.100
 with a finger you need a doll 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.010
 before the good because it can not be applied to 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.300
 this is your case I leave you in the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.100
 description some cube that are cheap 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.140
 they rotate well and they come perfect for 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.950
 beginners that you can do is all 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.180
 be protected and well that's cheap 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.190
 I'll leave it in the description and 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.709
 you can search the internet for reviews and 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.210
 all that so that you look like 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:59.220
 how is it but to one 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:01.260
 good where will you turn the top layer 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.760
 with the index finger that easy and 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.200
 also with the left hand like that 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.450
 not exactly the same and something more subtle 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.190
 it's still turning the clothes up two 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.720
 times instead of saying well 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.860
 and those twice with the index finger is 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.620
 use two fingers 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.990
 these two fingers like this I do this way 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.720
 one turn and then the other in chain 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.720
 it's not like that one behind the other and so 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.340
 3 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:39.110
 very fast pretty easy enough 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.180
 it could also be done with the left 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.250
 but when doing 2 gb it does not matter between 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.330
 felt the way this way because of this 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:51.480
 good way the layer below that also 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.970
 in some algorithms you need 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.709
 I regionally acid with this from 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.010
 here with the ring finger and that would be like that 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.010
 in this way 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.520
 so with the left just like that 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.050
 pretty easy enough does not have much 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.850
 the truth and then later if you're 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.570
 beginner 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.700
 you will need to turn the middle lid and 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.990
 how is this done with the ring 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.930
 also what I do would be like this you see in 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.289
 instead of doing so like this 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.940
 yes a little like that the hand down and 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.270
 turn that easy 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.100
 this does not have no more and then if 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:46.750
 I want to do two turns also applied what 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.750
 same use these two fingers of studies 

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:54.849
 first the little finger and then in doubt 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:54.849
 A) Yes 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.310
 I get better with my right hand but 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.970
 well it does not matter with the left with the 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.970
 right of the water 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.970
 d 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.500
 and it's quite quite useful when it comes to 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.450
 do the algorithms then there's also 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.960
 people who make them with these two fingers 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.800
 from here with the one with the heart that 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.800
 it would be like this 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.770
 but good for one as you see here is to 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.530
 end the same thing do two turns with two 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.850
 fingers instead of with a fold is that way 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:39.180
 easy and good is not much more then 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:41.990
 practice this and chain the turns that 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.990
 you are doing 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.750
 with business by turning the layer 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.090
 right because with the doll there is no other 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.830
 well in this way and without more freedom in 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.380
 where the movements to solve the 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.190
 game to undo it of equal 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.190
 and it is already 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.849
 it does not have much more practice 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:10.680
 and the video is so good so far 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.680
 You liked it, you can like it
