 venezuela all can be in hands 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.850
 of limitations on freedom of expression

 the closing and television channels st the stps tera more what its same what 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.660

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.290
 to that great democracy that is cuba exalted the insults do not doubt if not 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.830

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.820
 that now also of albacete to wait 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.060
 I do not understand what it is that they intend to give the vote to the Chileans for the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.260
 ground of what it is that we are talking about it seems that when they are read in 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.650
 underwear and oea says 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.040
 says this man that to know the thing of less than 10 dollars or more so that 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.300
 our process must be cobbler lead once again 15 countries and to follow 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.250
 there are more voices that are part of the oea 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.770
 they are also part of the sao paulo forum 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.820
 the sao paulo forum was left after the fall of the berlin wall in 190 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.810
 6 at the request 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.250
 from castro 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.970
 i percent and driven by lula 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:56.900
 cast 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.710
 that is the core of what I am the oea 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.920
 then the decisions of the oea have no value because they are 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.249
 decisions actually adopted by the communist alliance 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:12.510
 percent and that this training and trying to export 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.120
 the revolution to all Latin America unasur that I the first p 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.139
 per cent because the luck or misfortune of dealing with people linked to 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.609
 this proposal body 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.819
 because in him, for example, in the case of the killing of 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.139
 in bolivia percent 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.159
 totally manipulated by the government of evo morals 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.260
 then it turns out that the person they designate to investigate these facts 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.559
 to his credit he takes for what is a 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:44.879
 exguerrillero montoneros argentino who has camouflaged himself now as a democrat in 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.329
 what is this institution is to say weaver and sta former terrorist then 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.779

 murders and the shootings that he carries on his back 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.339
 We are talking 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.080
 from another president of venezuela 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.960
 that has already taken the coups 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.910

 a few months to pay the country's foreign debt having the capacity to do so 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:40.529
 because it says 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:42.410
 in which that external debt 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.330
