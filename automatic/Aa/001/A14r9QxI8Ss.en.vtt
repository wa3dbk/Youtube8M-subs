the offseason conditioning and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.370 
the offseason conditioning and

range maybe an hour or two and just get

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.130 
range maybe an hour or two and just get

as<00:02:03.180> your<00:02:03.300> speed<00:02:03.510> goes<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.680> there's<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:04.860> number

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
as your speed goes so there's a number

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.500 
as your speed goes so there's a number
of<00:02:05.100> things<00:02:05.190> you<00:02:05.340> can<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.760> increase<00:02:06.330> your

speed and fish your leg strength it's

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.380 
speed and fish your leg strength it's
just<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.760> matter<00:02:08.790> of<00:02:08.970> going<00:02:09.090> out<00:02:09.240> there<00:02:09.360> and

just a matter of going out there and

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.660 
just a matter of going out there and

speed drills are a crucial part of the
program<00:02:13.560> very<00:02:14.040> important<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.430> do<00:02:14.490> your<00:02:14.520> drills

full<00:02:15.420> speed<00:02:15.720> because<00:02:16.200> that's<00:02:16.530> what<00:02:16.650> happens

in<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.010> game<00:02:17.190> there's<00:02:18.120> nothing<00:02:18.390> like<00:02:18.560> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
in the game there's nothing like the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.320 
in the game there's nothing like the
game<00:02:19.740> time<00:02:20.040> situation<00:02:20.610> where<00:02:20.850> everything<00:02:21.209> is

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
game time situation where everything is

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.760 
game time situation where everything is
lightning<00:02:21.810> fast<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.530> want<00:02:22.709> to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
lightning fast and so you want to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.250 
lightning fast and so you want to
emulate<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.430> workouts<00:02:23.790> as<00:02:23.910> well<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:25.170> get

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
emulate that and workouts as well to get

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.370 
emulate that and workouts as well to get
that<00:02:25.440> good<00:02:25.650> feel<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.130> if<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.580> do<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.380> over

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
that good feel of it if you do it over

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.540 
that good feel of it if you do it over
and<00:02:28.470> over<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.740> over<00:02:28.800> again<00:02:29.010> there's<00:02:29.340> nothing

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
and over and over again there's nothing

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.270 
and over and over again there's nothing
like<00:02:29.610> repetition<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.660> by<00:02:30.840> doing<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.200> we<00:02:32.070> come

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
like repetition so by doing that we come

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.070 
like repetition so by doing that we come
to<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.459> game<00:02:32.640> time<00:02:32.880> would<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.150> easy<00:02:33.390> summer

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
to the game time would be easy summer

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.960 
to the game time would be easy summer
