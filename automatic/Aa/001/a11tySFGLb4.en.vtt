is<00:00:46.289> because<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.450> America<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:48.690> Christians

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
is because of the America but Christians

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.889 
is because of the America but Christians
have<00:00:54.469> this<00:00:55.469> problem<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> we're<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:57.480> trying<00:00:57.719> to
