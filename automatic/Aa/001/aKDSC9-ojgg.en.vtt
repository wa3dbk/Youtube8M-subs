00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570

 many abbreviations of cv bmv yolo 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.289

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.060

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.809
 justify your stupidities 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.120

 similar to a space base and then they walk 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.850

 this in a way of something racist and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.450
 They intelligently published their photos in 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.709
