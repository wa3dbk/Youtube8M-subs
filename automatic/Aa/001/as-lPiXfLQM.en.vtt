it's<00:01:02.260> got<00:01:02.380> a<00:01:02.410> horn<00:01:02.620> this<00:01:02.740> thing's<00:01:02.860> actually

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980

really<00:01:03.430> loud<00:01:05.790> side<00:01:06.790> mirrors<00:01:07.210> on<00:01:07.420> both<00:01:07.450> sides

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.440 

and<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.740> also<00:01:11.860> comes<00:01:12.160> with<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.490> three<00:01:13.000> thousand

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
and it also comes with a three thousand

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.090 
and it also comes with a three thousand
pound<00:01:13.480> winch<00:01:15.240> Li<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.420> I<00:01:16.900> guess<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:17.950> how<00:01:18.040> you

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
pound winch Li and I guess is how you

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.500 
pound winch Li and I guess is how you
say<00:01:18.250> that<00:01:18.430> makes<00:01:18.610> this<00:01:21.120> LED<00:01:22.120> daytime<00:01:22.300> running

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
say that makes this LED daytime running

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.529 
say that makes this LED daytime running
lamps<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:23.140> can<00:01:23.290> see<00:01:23.440> there

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:27.670 

I<00:01:26.570> think<00:01:27.200> it<00:01:27.259> would<00:01:27.350> be<00:01:27.409> a<00:01:27.439> pretty<00:01:27.560> nice

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
I think it would be a pretty nice

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.100 
I think it would be a pretty nice
machine<00:01:27.920> I<00:01:28.159> like<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:28.399> so<00:01:28.520> far<00:01:28.939> power<00:01:29.840> sting

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
machine I like it so far power sting

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.529 
machine I like it so far power sting
steers<00:01:30.950> like<00:01:31.100> butter<00:01:31.369> then<00:01:32.000> require<00:01:32.329> any

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
steers like butter then require any

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:33.580 
steers like butter then require any
effort<00:01:32.630> at<00:01:32.869> all<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.079> could<00:01:33.170> drive<00:01:33.350> with<00:01:33.500> your

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
effort at all you could drive with your

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.029 
effort at all you could drive with your
pinky<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.210> then<00:01:35.649> certainly<00:01:36.649> doesn't<00:01:36.860> lack

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
pinky and then certainly doesn't lack

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.539 
pinky and then certainly doesn't lack
for<00:01:37.100> any<00:01:37.369> power<00:01:37.549> it's<00:01:37.820> gonna<00:01:37.939> be<00:01:38.090> twin<00:01:38.329> it<00:01:39.549> only

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
for any power it's gonna be twin it only

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:41.800 
for any power it's gonna be twin it only
thing<00:01:40.700> I've<00:01:40.789> noticed<00:01:40.909> really<00:01:41.179> so<00:01:41.390> far<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:41.780> I

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
thing I've noticed really so far and I

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.480 
thing I've noticed really so far and I
haven't<00:01:42.049> actually<00:01:42.200> gotten<00:01:43.159> it<00:01:43.280> out<00:01:43.340> and

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
haven't actually gotten it out and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.219 
haven't actually gotten it out and
written<00:01:43.640> it<00:01:43.729> is<00:01:43.819> just<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.090> brakes<00:01:44.329> you<00:01:45.079> do

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
written it is just the brakes you do

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.359 
written it is just the brakes you do
have<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.439> put<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.590> little<00:01:45.679> bit<00:01:45.829> of<00:01:45.890> force<00:01:46.069> on<00:01:46.220> to

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
have to put a little bit of force on to

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.309 
have to put a little bit of force on to
get<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.549> stopped<00:01:46.789> so<00:01:47.149> maybe<00:01:48.020> they<00:01:48.140> need<00:01:48.289> a

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
get it stopped so maybe they need a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.590 
get it stopped so maybe they need a
little<00:01:48.350> break<00:01:48.619> in<00:01:48.770> time<00:01:49.240> when<00:01:50.240> I'll<00:01:50.329> put<00:01:50.479> more

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
little break in time when I'll put more

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.179 
little break in time when I'll put more
vidios<00:01:50.899> up<00:01:51.079> I've<00:01:51.259> got<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.590> front<00:01:51.829> bumper<00:01:51.979> that

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
vidios up I've got the front bumper that

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.859 
vidios up I've got the front bumper that
I'm<00:01:52.310> gonna<00:01:52.429> put<00:01:52.610> on<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:53.000> then<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.210> box<00:01:53.659> there

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
I'm gonna put on and then the box there

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.620 
I'm gonna put on and then the box there
is<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.110> windshield<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.210> we'll<00:01:56.210> get<00:01:56.329> that<00:01:56.450> one

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
is the windshield so we'll get that one

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.289 
is the windshield so we'll get that one
on<00:01:56.719> and<00:01:56.869> do<00:01:56.929> another<00:01:57.079> video<00:01:57.939> all<00:01:58.939> right<00:01:59.090> so<00:01:59.240> I

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
on and do another video all right so I

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.639 
on and do another video all right so I
just<00:01:59.420> got<00:01:59.599> the<00:01:59.689> front<00:01:59.869> bumper<00:02:00.049> mounted<00:02:00.530> on
