what<00:00:11.090> I've<00:00:11.180> got<00:00:11.360> for<00:00:11.389> you<00:00:11.600> is<00:00:11.870> a<00:00:12.559> new<00:00:12.770> survival

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
what I've got for you is a new survival

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.340 
what I've got for you is a new survival
map<00:00:13.639> or<00:00:13.879> kind<00:00:14.150> of<00:00:14.210> a<00:00:14.299> game<00:00:14.450> mode<00:00:14.780> for<00:00:15.049> you<00:00:15.139> guys

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
map or kind of a game mode for you guys

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.460 
map or kind of a game mode for you guys
so<00:00:16.070> it's<00:00:16.400> similar<00:00:16.640> to<00:00:16.789> survival<00:00:17.630> island<00:00:17.780> chunk

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
so it's similar to survival island chunk

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.160 
so it's similar to survival island chunk
survival<00:00:19.190> I<00:00:19.400> know<00:00:20.119> stuff<00:00:20.330> like<00:00:20.449> that<00:00:20.600> you<00:00:21.140> know

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
survival I know stuff like that you know

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.290 
survival I know stuff like that you know
Skyblock<00:00:21.830> just<00:00:22.609> going<00:00:22.730> to<00:00:22.790> like<00:00:22.880> that<00:00:22.910> pretty

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
Skyblock just going to like that pretty

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.020 
Skyblock just going to like that pretty
much<00:00:23.510> so<00:00:24.170> it's<00:00:24.590> like<00:00:24.800> a<00:00:24.830> limited<00:00:25.400> version<00:00:25.610> of

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 
much so it's like a limited version of

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.990 
much so it's like a limited version of
normal<00:00:26.780> survival<00:00:27.080> minecraft<00:00:27.670> so<00:00:28.670> it<00:00:28.910> should

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
normal survival minecraft so it should

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.390 
normal survival minecraft so it should
not<00:00:29.090> feel<00:00:29.300> unfamiliar<00:00:29.840> with<00:00:30.260> you<00:00:30.890> know

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
not feel unfamiliar with you know

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.369 
not feel unfamiliar with you know
skyblock<00:00:32.059> or<00:00:32.329> Chung<00:00:32.599> survival<00:00:33.020> anything<00:00:33.260> like

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
skyblock or Chung survival anything like

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.760 
skyblock or Chung survival anything like
that<00:00:33.410> then<00:00:34.219> this<00:00:34.340> might<00:00:34.489> be<00:00:34.610> quite<00:00:34.789> new<00:00:35.059> to<00:00:35.090> you

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
that then this might be quite new to you

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.040 
that then this might be quite new to you
so<00:00:36.770> it's<00:00:37.039> basically<00:00:37.250> a<00:00:37.820> different<00:00:38.810> way<00:00:39.020> to

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
so it's basically a different way to

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.310 
so it's basically a different way to
play<00:00:39.800> survival<00:00:40.370> minecraft<00:00:40.840> so<00:00:41.840> as<00:00:42.079> you<00:00:42.200> can

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
play survival minecraft so as you can

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.020 
play survival minecraft so as you can
see<00:00:42.560> around<00:00:42.739> this<00:00:42.890> world<00:00:43.100> there<00:00:43.520> are<00:00:43.550> eight

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
see around this world there are eight

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.690 
see around this world there are eight
chunks<00:00:44.750> there<00:00:45.410> are<00:00:45.710> four<00:00:46.040> around<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.520> edges

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
chunks there are four around the edges

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.940 
chunks there are four around the edges
of<00:00:46.880> the<00:00:46.970> map<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.450> in<00:00:47.600> center<00:00:48.140> there<00:00:48.470> are<00:00:48.620> four

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
of the map and in center there are four

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.299 
of the map and in center there are four
so<00:00:49.820> right<00:00:50.540> in<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.720> center<00:00:51.020> here<00:00:51.050> is<00:00:51.470> a<00:00:51.500> 2<00:00:52.010> by<00:00:52.280> 2

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
so right in the center here is a 2 by 2

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.360 
so right in the center here is a 2 by 2
chunk<00:00:53.030> area<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:54.590> reason<00:00:54.860> for<00:00:54.890> this<00:00:55.130> is

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
chunk area and the reason for this is

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.970 
chunk area and the reason for this is
because<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.970> spawn<00:00:56.300> area<00:00:56.540> is<00:00:57.020> bigger<00:00:57.649> than<00:00:57.860> a

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
because the spawn area is bigger than a

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.549 
because the spawn area is bigger than a
16<00:00:58.399> by<00:00:58.579> 16<00:00:58.760> area<00:00:59.270> so<00:00:59.930> if<00:01:00.110> it<00:01:00.260> was<00:01:00.290> to<00:01:00.440> be<00:01:00.530> a

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
16 by 16 area so if it was to be a

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.650 
16 by 16 area so if it was to be a
normal<00:01:00.739> chunk<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.399> would<00:01:01.550> spawn<00:01:01.880> to<00:01:02.480> be<00:01:02.630> a

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
normal chunk you would spawn to be a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.049 
normal chunk you would spawn to be a
chance<00:01:03.020> view<00:01:03.290> spawning<00:01:03.590> in<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:03.860> void<00:01:04.059> so

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
chance view spawning in the void so

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.209 
chance view spawning in the void so
anyway<00:01:05.600> let's<00:01:06.320> get<00:01:06.439> off<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.710> technical<00:01:07.130> stuff

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:07.219 
anyway let's get off the technical stuff

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:10.300 
anyway let's get off the technical stuff
for<00:01:07.460> now<00:01:07.540> so<00:01:08.540> when<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:09.290> load<00:01:09.500> up<00:01:09.680> this<00:01:09.829> map<00:01:10.070> it

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
for now so when you load up this map it

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.800 
for now so when you load up this map it
will<00:01:10.549> be<00:01:10.670> in<00:01:10.729> survival<00:01:11.299> anything<00:01:11.630> like<00:01:11.780> that

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
will be in survival anything like that

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.779 
will be in survival anything like that
you<00:01:12.229> know<00:01:12.259> everything<00:01:12.799> I'll<00:01:12.950> be<00:01:13.039> preset<00:01:13.459> and

you know everything I'll be preset and

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.590 
you know everything I'll be preset and

biome<00:03:56.120> chunk<00:03:56.630> thingy<00:03:56.959> here<00:03:57.320> is<00:03:57.500> we've<00:03:58.280> got<00:03:58.310> a

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
biome chunk thingy here is we've got a

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.120 
biome chunk thingy here is we've got a
swamp<00:03:58.700> biome<00:03:59.030> desert<00:03:59.870> bite<00:04:00.019> sorry<00:04:00.320> jungle

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
swamp biome desert bite sorry jungle

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.500 
swamp biome desert bite sorry jungle
biome<00:04:01.600> frost<00:04:02.600> biome<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.799> desert<00:04:04.489> biome<00:04:04.790> so

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
biome frost biome and a desert biome so

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.780 
biome frost biome and a desert biome so
this<00:04:05.930> is<00:04:05.959> because<00:04:06.769> these<00:04:07.130> are<00:04:07.280> actual<00:04:07.489> biomes

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
this is because these are actual biomes

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.080 
this is because these are actual biomes
by<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.060> way<00:04:08.209> so<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.750> can<00:04:08.989> tell<00:04:09.170> by<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.410> grass

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
the edges here just because of the biome

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.880 
the edges here just because of the biome
next<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.160> it's<00:04:13.280> different<00:04:14.140> so<00:04:15.140> yeah<00:04:15.650> pretty

what you can do it does it you'll be
able<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.410> get<00:04:30.590> sandstone<00:04:31.130> let<00:04:32.000> me<00:04:32.060> turn<00:04:32.180> the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
able to get sandstone let me turn the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.150 
able to get sandstone let me turn the
mount<00:04:32.479> but<00:04:32.780> still<00:04:32.990> e-bill<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.320> get<00:04:33.440> some

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
mount but still e-bill to get some

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.890 
mount but still e-bill to get some
so<00:04:34.490> yeah<00:04:35.150> it's<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.360> little<00:04:35.420> bit<00:04:35.630> more<00:04:35.720> difficult

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
so yeah it's a little bit more difficult

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.080 
so yeah it's a little bit more difficult
than<00:04:36.350> normal<00:04:36.740> survival<00:04:37.010> minecraft<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.970> know

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
than normal survival minecraft you know

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.430 
than normal survival minecraft you know
you've<00:04:38.180> got<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.390> threat<00:04:38.660> of<00:04:38.690> falling<00:04:39.140> off<00:04:39.290> and

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
you've got the threat of falling off and

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.240 
you've got the threat of falling off and
dying<00:04:39.820> so<00:04:40.820> let's<00:04:41.630> just<00:04:41.900> simulate<00:04:42.620> that<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:43.070> if

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
dying so let's just simulate that so if

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.740 
dying so let's just simulate that so if
you<00:04:43.370> were<00:04:43.490> in<00:04:43.580> survival<00:04:43.880> and<00:04:44.240> you<00:04:44.480> were<00:04:44.570> to

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
you were in survival and you were to

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.460 
you were in survival and you were to
fall<00:04:45.110> off<00:04:45.640> you're<00:04:46.640> gonna<00:04:46.850> die<00:04:47.180> because<00:04:47.960> the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
fall off you're gonna die because the

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.460 
fall off you're gonna die because the
world<00:04:48.830> is<00:04:49.250> sixty<00:04:49.910> four<00:04:50.090> blocks<00:04:50.330> higher<00:04:50.570> so<00:04:51.440> he

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
world is sixty four blocks higher so he

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.980 
world is sixty four blocks higher so he
were<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:51.980> have<00:04:52.130> full<00:04:52.400> diamond<00:04:52.910> armor<00:04:53.270> studying

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
were to have full diamond armor studying

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.420 
were to have full diamond armor studying
on<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.200> bedrock<00:04:54.530> there<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:55.040> jump<00:04:55.250> off

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
on that bedrock there and jump off

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.790 
on that bedrock there and jump off
you're<00:04:55.970> gonna<00:04:56.060> die<00:04:56.270> no<00:04:56.630> matter<00:04:56.780> what<00:04:56.990> so<00:04:57.740> you

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
you're gonna die no matter what so you

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.990 
you're gonna die no matter what so you
know<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:58.400> is<00:04:58.900> pretty<00:04:59.900> cool<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:01.700> reason<00:05:01.910> I

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
know that is pretty cool the reason I

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000 
know that is pretty cool the reason I
did<00:05:02.150> that<00:05:02.180> is<00:05:02.510> because<00:05:02.930> I<00:05:03.230> didn't<00:05:03.410> want<00:05:03.440> you<00:05:03.800> to

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
did that is because I didn't want you to

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.220 
did that is because I didn't want you to
be<00:05:04.370> able<00:05:04.850> to<00:05:05.000> jump<00:05:05.300> off<00:05:05.510> and<00:05:05.780> you'd<00:05:05.990> be<00:05:06.080> able<00:05:06.140> to

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
be able to jump off and you'd be able to

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.140 
be able to jump off and you'd be able to
walk<00:05:06.470> around<00:05:06.710> T<00:05:07.070> and<00:05:07.220> survival<00:05:07.730> because<00:05:08.030> then

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
walk around T and survival because then

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.570 
walk around T and survival because then
you<00:05:08.240> won't<00:05:08.330> be<00:05:08.420> able<00:05:08.510> to<00:05:08.630> get<00:05:08.720> back<00:05:08.870> up<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:10.400> it's

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
you won't be able to get back up so it's

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.310 
you won't be able to get back up so it's
just<00:05:10.670> a<00:05:10.790> little<00:05:11.030> neater<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.540> have<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:11.960> chunks

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
just a little neater to have the chunks

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.890 
just a little neater to have the chunks
floating<00:05:12.500> in<00:05:12.830> mid-air<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:14.000> yeah<00:05:14.540> this<00:05:14.690> is<00:05:14.810> like

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
floating in mid-air so yeah this is like

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.810 
floating in mid-air so yeah this is like
