00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
screenshot and send it off so let's open

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.110 
screenshot and send it off so let's open
up<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.890> SCP

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.810 

now<00:01:08.690> but<00:01:09.110> then<00:01:09.230> winscp<00:01:09.590> there's<00:01:10.160> a<00:01:10.220> number<00:01:10.700> of

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
now but then winscp there's a number of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.750 
now but then winscp there's a number of
configurations<00:01:11.710> when<00:01:12.710> SCP<00:01:13.160> is<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> program

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
configurations when SCP is a program

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.260 
configurations when SCP is a program
that<00:01:14.260> connects<00:01:15.260> via<00:01:15.590> SSH<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.580> sins<00:01:16.940> files

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
that connects via SSH and sins files

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.390 
that connects via SSH and sins files
over<00:01:17.720> using<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.500> SCP<00:01:19.220> protocol<00:01:19.850> now<00:01:20.740> with<00:01:21.740> SCP

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
over using the SCP protocol now with SCP

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
over using the SCP protocol now with SCP
you'd<00:01:23.240> have<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.570> specify<00:01:23.810> your<00:01:24.440> username<00:01:25.420> host

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
you'd have to specify your username host

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.870 
you'd have to specify your username host
name<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.080> password<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.490> hostname

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
name and password so the hostname

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.690 
name and password so the hostname
username<00:01:29.320> password<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.350> then<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:31.400> can<00:01:31.580> also

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
username password and then you can also

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.550 
username password and then you can also
tell<00:01:32.000> which<00:01:32.180> protocols<00:01:32.720> your<00:01:33.080> servers

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
tell which protocols your servers

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.150 
tell which protocols your servers
configured<00:01:33.830> with<00:01:34.370> as<00:01:34.580> well<00:01:35.300> as<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.200> directory

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
configured with as well as the directory

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.470 
configured with as well as the directory
that<00:01:37.190> you're<00:01:37.460> going<00:01:37.580> to<00:01:37.670> use<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:38.120> send<00:01:38.360> this

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
that you're going to use to send this

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.570 
that you're going to use to send this
file<00:01:38.720> off<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.260> where<00:01:39.950> it's<00:01:40.100> going<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.310> end<00:01:40.370> up

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
file off and where it's going to end up

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.320 
file off and where it's going to end up
that<00:01:40.760> so<00:01:41.740> let's<00:01:42.740> go<00:01:42.920> into<00:01:42.950> session<00:01:43.730> and<00:01:43.910> let's

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
that so let's go into session and let's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.570 
that so let's go into session and let's
put<00:01:44.510> in<00:01:44.600> our<00:01:44.750> host<00:01:44.960> name<00:01:45.200> now<00:01:46.100> put<00:01:46.340> in<00:01:46.460> our

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
put in our host name now put in our

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.760 
put in our host name now put in our
username<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.240> then<00:01:48.230> we'll<00:01:48.380> put<00:01:48.410> in<00:01:48.620> our

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
username and then we'll put in our

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.300 
username and then we'll put in our
password<00:01:49.540> specify<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.600> protocol<00:01:51.130> then<00:01:52.130> go

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
password specify the protocol then go

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.120 
password specify the protocol then go

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
let's connect up to the web server and

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.310 
let's connect up to the web server and
make<00:02:28.100> sure<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.370> actually<00:02:28.489> works<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:30.200> we're

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
make sure it actually works so we're

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.140 
make sure it actually works so we're
connecting<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.950> server<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.400> it's<00:02:32.060> going

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
connecting to the server and it's going

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.090 
connecting to the server and it's going
to<00:02:32.209> give<00:02:32.330> us<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.570> directory<00:02:32.959> now<00:02:33.590> see<00:02:33.770> how<00:02:33.920> my

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
to winscp to be able to use that file

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.759 
to winscp to be able to use that file
name<00:04:00.080> to<00:04:00.890> send<00:04:01.160> it<00:04:01.310> over<00:04:01.580> to<00:04:01.610> your<00:04:02.510> web<00:04:02.690> server

see<00:04:21.350> how<00:04:21.470> it<00:04:21.560> captured<00:04:21.919> the<00:04:22.040> file<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.660> now<00:04:23.840> what

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
see how it captured the file so now what

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.350 
see how it captured the file so now what
you<00:04:24.200> can<00:04:24.320> do<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:24.919> can<00:04:24.950> hit<00:04:25.430> adjust<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.240> if

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
you can do is you can hit adjust and if

you can do is you can hit adjust and if
you<00:04:26.479> wanted<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.810> adjust<00:04:27.200> it<00:04:27.380> maybe<00:04:27.560> you<00:04:27.710> wanted

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
you wanted to adjust it maybe you wanted

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.790 
you wanted to adjust it maybe you wanted
only<00:04:28.460> that<00:04:28.729> much<00:04:28.970> of<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.390> and<00:04:29.630> maybe<00:04:29.870> only<00:04:30.050> that

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
only that much of it and maybe only that

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.279 
only that much of it and maybe only that
much<00:04:30.979> of<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.370> for<00:04:31.640> whatever<00:04:31.789> reason<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:33.140> could

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
much of it for whatever reason you could

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.500 
much of it for whatever reason you could
do<00:04:33.380> that<00:04:33.530> could<00:04:34.370> also<00:04:34.520> hit<00:04:34.729> auto<00:04:34.940> crop<00:04:35.270> which

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
do that could also hit auto crop which

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.570 
do that could also hit auto crop which
will<00:04:35.690> do<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:36.050> couple<00:04:36.530> cool<00:04:36.950> little<00:04:37.130> things<00:04:37.400> or

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
will do a couple cool little things or

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.770 
will do a couple cool little things or
you<00:04:37.610> can<00:04:37.760> hit<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.000> original<00:04:38.450> which<00:04:38.600> would

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
you can hit the original which would

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.290 
you can hit the original which would
reset<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:39.289> back<00:04:39.490> so<00:04:40.490> just<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:41.000> make<00:04:41.030> it<00:04:41.150> a

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
reset it back so just to make it a

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.550 
reset it back so just to make it a
little<00:04:41.450> different<00:04:41.870> let's<00:04:42.050> make<00:04:42.200> sure<00:04:42.229> it

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
little different let's make sure it

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.909 
little different let's make sure it
actually<00:04:42.620> cropped<00:04:43.220> it<00:04:43.430> up<00:04:43.550> some

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
actually cropped it up some

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.140 
actually cropped it up some
that<00:04:45.919> way<00:04:46.070> when<00:04:46.280> we<00:04:46.460> actually<00:04:46.790> see<00:04:46.970> the

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
that way when we actually see the

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.879 
that way when we actually see the
screenshot<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.900> could<00:04:48.050> tell<00:04:48.290> that<00:04:48.320> it's<00:04:48.680> a

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
screenshot you could tell that it's a

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.020 
screenshot you could tell that it's a
actual<00:04:49.460> screenshot<00:04:49.970> will<00:04:50.810> hit<00:04:50.960> okay<00:04:51.290> and<00:04:52.030> then

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
actual screenshot will hit okay and then

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.420 
actual screenshot will hit okay and then
now<00:04:53.210> we<00:04:53.270> can<00:04:53.570> hit<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.840> send<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.169> button<00:04:54.560> send
