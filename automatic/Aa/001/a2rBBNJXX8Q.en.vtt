 the performer export vacuum cleaner is one of the best-selling vacuum cleaners of 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.890
 the moment 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.860
 this is due to its good performance 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.189
 enter all types 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:15.379
 clean out blow air 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.870
 the large range of at eleven meters 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.340
 the expertise to be formed wind 2 the types he himself with his black type and then 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.190
 call them in the f ck 87 23 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.829
 and he uses himself to call them the fc 87 26 and thereby 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.530
 extra supplied on the turbo chest 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.580
 this is one of the newest vacuum cleaners with an energy rating and it 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.160
 energy label to explain in this video and explain poles performance 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.360
 one of these vacuum cleaners 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.350
 and in the past only looked at the purple of a vacuum cleaner the more 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.790
 page the stronger engine probably better squeeze the suction 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.350
 that is not the case at all 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.080
 and that's why you now have the label 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.570
 And then you can see how economical peres 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.570
 how exactly it performs 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.790
 the specifications and of these two times vacuum cleaners it has energy class a 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.780
 which is incredibly economical 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.210
 my stop recording on time get the score 7 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.690
 and score on hard floors he scores in b and for dust emissions 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.680
 wet here is after the much busier sport heijn 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.170
 With these scores, this vacuuming is one of the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.100
 yes a vacuum cleaner at the moment 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.310
 in this price range this vacuum cleaner has a person a length of 8 meters 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.530
 and with that the vacuum cleaner is a year of action 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.370
 eleven meters 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.500
 This vacuum cleaner has a capacity of five liters and a few engine power of 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.390
 650 watts and that these vacuum cleaners are 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.829
 two-year warranty 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.590
 and there is, however, five kilos of nice and light these vacuum cleaners make use of the er 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.340
 flew max technology 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.219
 he has a henk bah 13 filter he uses fake pieces 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.719
 telescope Germans have put themselves on the and can live 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:57.610
 what for you 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.350
 the tastiest avold 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.970
 extra long ergonomic 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.000
 shake hands 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.479
 both models have this trajectory is max through interpreter and the brown version will 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.609
 there certainly 87 26 has another extra the 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.609
 to boost turbo considerably 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:20.759
 the airflow mexx technology ensures that the bag fully unfolded 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.170
 inside the vacuum cleaner and this way it has the maximum dust absorption 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.599
 m the maximum suction power this fell off the vacuum has a telescope 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.000
 speed dial below 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.360
 seems to be the right one 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.060
 what suits you this philips has a perk set on the mouthpiece a set 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.249
 also reach the hard-to-reach places 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.959
 this vacuum cleaner the easier on and off button of course also simply with the the 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:41.890
 operate your feet 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.620
 13 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.359
 stepless operation 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:45.840
 then this position can 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.060
 that has become but bos answered the time and the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.160
 how loose on the facts and can be hard floors does that rebellion it on those 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.609
 maximum suction 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.229
 and this vacuum has 8 meter plan cords 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:00.569
 and someone who is just up 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.099
 in the revised and this also connectors you can turn 360 degree cuddy 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.899
 It will never confuse the snake and here is the indicator moment 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:13.329
 that it is a red then you need a dustbag a replacement the dustbag you replace that 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.720
 pull up the label on the front 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.689
 here are the five liter dust bag 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.349
 what is easy when the fabric bags are full of draw then this comes 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.409
 level forward that you see that it closes and that way flehite none 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.279
 dust in drunks 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:28.529
 when you changed the bag 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.320
 and behind the vacuum cleaner bag 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.990
 what about the engine a lot of revs 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.599
 yeah what a window pane you were 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.709
 we advise to know twice a year 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.299
 We advise you to change this boy so that he stays in top condition 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.580
 vacuum cleaners can always use the work s vacuum cleaner bags 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.089
 I then have the four park 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:49.550
 that is these youngsters are in the spin 4 vacuum cleaner bags 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.190
 and we just have jaap dekker that is this there are the sixteen 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.000
 vacuum cleaner bags and 2 mother filters 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.389
 and be there for it but have a text on the heretic that it is usually 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.959
 there are 4 vacuum cleaner we sink in 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.630
 the seated and a few much to win 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.520
 and a motor filter 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.069
 and gerco ross 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.229
 in brussels south, of course, just shake hands but these guys are men 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.140
 prevents bad messages 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.049
 but also about if your pants up the stairs remain a vacuum cleaner and also joris build-up 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.640
 the vacuum cleaner has three things including 2 wheels 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.000
 this year to the outside so that it is nice and stable and the middle 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.960
 Swedish news 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.550
 so that it stays nice and easy to follow if you want this vacuum cleaner compact 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.650
 being able to get rid of that is possible 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.059
 the traffic was on this gentleman 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:34.620
 you can also put road workers flat 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.620
 in this way 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:49.979
 at the same time gives mexx brush as ideal forked to perform differently for hard 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.510
 floors so that you expand the brushes it has 2 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.379
 we have reasonable 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.010
 and artists not a blissful force 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.570
 because everything is made in one piece, the recess on the 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.240
 front piece bigger piece it can lock up and in the sheet for vacuum cleaner 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.080
 out of sight 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.879
 and thanks to this brush you get a good corner 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:13.860
 if you see that the brush is completely on the outside mt 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.110
 this is the outside but you also see 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.159
 here are fidesz really all the way to the last millimeter along the pinte it 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:24.500
 Valid in part thanks to this top of the bill a mouthpiece with this vacuum also a 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.500
 good energy labels 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.440
 theo bos op ideal for vacuuming hairs 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.810
 and tests on the device 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.810
 so do you have pets at home this is really a must 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.139
 in force in its vacuum cleaner energy labels in September 2014 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.749
 and to get its energy label, it must be fuel-efficient 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:52.210
 all old vacuum cleaners are therefore no longer made 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.009
 so in the past a vacuum cleaner with 18 underpinned or even 2000 wanted something 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.860
 That is no longer necessary. All brands now have vacuum cleaners made that way 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.800
 going with a coke never should have performed better than the old models with 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.909
 2000 had 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:09.709
 thanks to these energy labels can finally be honest and real 

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:10.370
 see 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.119
 for the quality and performance rwe vacuum cleaner 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:16.539
 but the duration and the reliability of the vacuum cleaner yes that does not state on it 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.580
 label to the energy label number of points are stated 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.530
 top right see the energy class right in the middle I see the annual 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.710
 energy consumption 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.699
 and when we think we look underneath and on the top left we see how much dust it still has 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:29.490
 blows out 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.669
 top right 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.369
 it a noise level 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:34.669
 on the bottom left the fabric recording 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:35.969
 soft carry 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:39.389
 and at the bottom right the performance on her floors 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:41.619
 emmen every level of money that dad 

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:43.319
 has the best performance 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.590
 ng the worst 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.590
 he is left below and a warning sign the most one 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.369
 vacuum cleaner not suitable for carpets but for hard floors 

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.879
 and thanks to this label, vacuum cleaners can now live together in an honest way 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:55.659
 compare 

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:59.249
 an example of this is, for example, that not only the height that is there 

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:00.339
 the performance 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:01.729
 according to our own payment 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:04.800
 so if you look at the top label the difference between a and g 

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:08.869
 in a few years last electricity consumption of 6 euros yes the Finns 

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:10.249
 riders not important 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:14.569
 at the vacuum cleaner discounter, the performance in the bag is much more important 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:15.099
 spijk 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:16.599
 in particular therefore the 4 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:20.219
 if you have forgotten something about this video it does not look like the 

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:21.230
 click to dive 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.150
 or that you then world a little friends 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.539
 or there on a social media 

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:27.029
 the winning couples 

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.960
 click here 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.860
 on the ordered too 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.259
 although have a place to go you go through the page 

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:36.259
 I think then unfortunately product is in sight just on lay people 

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:38.459
 then can walk
