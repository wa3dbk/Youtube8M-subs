00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.490
 I like of new judo warmly 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.639
 Welcome to a new video on me 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.809
 pack out with something to eat but yes 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.400
 This time nothing Japanese but me 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.480
 believe it's Korean I'm mine 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.250
 not sure but i believe it is 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.289
 not before it is partly because 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.180
 Japanese supermarket in Korean 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.230
 things that would have to be here 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.340
 but if you can krupp maybe 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.800
 someone korean you 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.240
 but it would have to be Korean me 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.770
 think so is not it somewhere 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.020
 where the heer is certainly no somewhere 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.270
 I'm just good at what I found very funny 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.570
 First, it looks like ours 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.879
 german kellogg's smacks dinger 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.110
 secondly , for himself for the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.559
 climate change a stop co2 he really good 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.629
 ten down and two high oh well o2 high 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.789
 to write high is also to write 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.480
 not necessarily the solution but okay yes 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.670
 you want co2 so go action and the rest 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.070
 Unfortunately, I can not read this 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.780
 too bad and what about the funny ones 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.060
 I can eat tomatoes and vegetables 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.729
 read and what is so super cool here 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.790
 I can not read that either but that 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.810
 can for day for high I can 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.979
 read or well expensive 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.520
 okay people i would say we look 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.960
 take a look 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.829
 yes to the chronicle sulipo but how good 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:34.950
 is he the clothes and i'm up to 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:37.020
 etf moment we are until the 15th 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.930
 but what does the sixteenth tenth do ? 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.040
 In 2013 they were made there or 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.450
 what about it? 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 I want it I do not think know 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.290
 we do so in simple and the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.320
 packaging with again so aline him 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.430
 I just can not handle it 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.700
 that's how you hear that 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.030
 You can hear the aces the packaging is 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.280
 but no one can not do me any 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 eight samples oh look there you have to 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.520
 aa 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.350
 you have to you and so on we do it 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:14.600
 hole so we look in there something like that 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:18.470
 It looks a lot like that 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.750
 from as with us these kellogg's can 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.930
 us there a little bit closer 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.980
 look at only the camera can bock 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.320
 has to focus 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.720
 yes I think you can eat too 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.640
 without you dying if you do not 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:40.459
 somehow dipping milk or something 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:43.430
 therefore we can even a so bad 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.190
 vilbel sort of like the 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.590
 Kellogg's things are a bit different 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.630
 maybe a little less but im 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.989
 basically the same reason 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.930
 So really big difference 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:01.160
 I not protected yes you can stop eating 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.640
 so in between times but the 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.500
 korean variant of kellogg's when 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.910
 you will 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.040
 that's how the things eye looks almost looks 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.209
 as are a bit brighter since the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.940
 are somehow a bit darker here 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.459
 but in it my god can eat too 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.440
 so if he bockhop on one 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.709
 alternative to mixed then pick you up 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.820
 Just the jolly point of the korean 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.450
 just a bit milk or raw 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.750
 eat 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.209
 and then I can finish you too 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.570
 recommend so there are only half way 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.519
 Things so no idea if there now 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.200
 steaks do not even know how expensive that was 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.090
 maybe not that they were cheaper 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.590
 We are import, I believe that 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.040
 Imported certainly not cheaper but 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.570
 okay and your goalkeeper for the environment 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.160
 at least if you know but yes 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.660
 not what is there but the picture 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.940
 Suggests that you have something for the 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.160
 environment does not matter yes in that sense I would 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.750
 You can also say that with the 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.390
 head or simply 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.470
 let not be around for the pid and in 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.820
 I want to say that sense if you can 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.020
 but have not subscribed to the 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.030
 want to stay running what that 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.320
 Unpack now then subscribe 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.650
 and otherwise we'll see you 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.650
 next time
