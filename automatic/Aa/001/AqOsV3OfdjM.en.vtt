this<00:02:32.489> is<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.879> disco<00:02:33.359> ball<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:34.650> what<00:02:35.129> it<00:02:35.220> does<00:02:35.370> is

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
this is a disco ball and what it does is

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.979 
this is a disco ball and what it does is
it<00:02:35.609> creates<00:02:35.760> these<00:02:36.030> little<00:02:36.359> colored<00:02:36.629> pixels

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
it creates these little colored pixels

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.830 
it creates these little colored pixels
that<00:02:37.560> go<00:02:38.189> around<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.819> side<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.329> block<00:02:39.569> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
that go around the side of the block and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.110 
that go around the side of the block and
I<00:02:39.930> really<00:02:40.260> kind<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:40.980> like<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.310> idea<00:02:41.640> really<00:02:41.939> I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
I really kind of like the idea really I

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.089 
I really kind of like the idea really I
mean<00:02:42.359> the<00:02:42.780> formation<00:02:43.439> that<00:02:43.470> it's<00:02:43.769> being<00:02:43.980> done

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
mean the formation that it's being done

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.849 
mean the formation that it's being done
and<00:02:44.489> how<00:02:44.659> dynamically<00:02:45.659> they<00:02:46.019> are<00:02:46.170> generated

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
and how dynamically they are generated

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.490 
and how dynamically they are generated
makes<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.430> kind<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.819> cool<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.239> think<00:02:48.359> and<00:02:48.989> if<00:02:49.409> you

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
makes it kind of cool I think and if you

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.619 
makes it kind of cool I think and if you
have<00:02:49.650> multiple<00:02:50.220> ones<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.209> will

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
have multiple ones in it it will

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.050 
have multiple ones in it it will
actually<00:02:51.750> create<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.170> whole<00:02:52.440> stream<00:02:52.889> so<00:02:53.250> if<00:02:53.790> I

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
actually create a whole stream so if I

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.149 
actually create a whole stream so if I
get<00:02:54.120> another<00:02:54.690> disco<00:02:55.170> ball<00:02:55.379> and<00:02:55.650> place<00:02:55.859> one

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
get another disco ball and place one

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.520 
get another disco ball and place one
let's<00:02:56.849> say<00:02:57.030> here<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.840> can<00:02:58.019> see<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.409> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
let's say here you can see that the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.729 
let's say here you can see that the
amount<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.980> pixels<00:02:59.189> increases<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.540> increases

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
amount of pixels increases and increases

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.179 
amount of pixels increases and increases
and<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:02.519> will<00:03:02.670> make<00:03:02.849> it<00:03:03.060> really<00:03:03.389> quite<00:03:04.189> really

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
and it will make it really quite really

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.670 
and it will make it really quite really
quite<00:03:05.459> crazy<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.750> more<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.139> out<00:03:07.319> of<00:03:07.500> these

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
quite crazy so the more you out of these

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.890 
quite crazy so the more you out of these
the<00:03:07.980> more<00:03:08.129> crazy<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.760> blocks<00:03:09.030> will<00:03:09.269> become<00:03:09.389> in

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
the more crazy the blocks will become in

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.720 
the more crazy the blocks will become in
a<00:03:10.049> disco<00:03:10.500> environment<00:03:11.159> so<00:03:11.370> that's<00:03:11.549> pretty

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
a disco environment so that's pretty

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.119 
a disco environment so that's pretty
good<00:03:12.000> now<00:03:12.780> as<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:12.959> said<00:03:13.019> before<00:03:13.260> there<00:03:13.709> are<00:03:13.739> that

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
good now as I said before there are that

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.830 
good now as I said before there are that
dance<00:03:14.400> floor<00:03:14.579> blocks<00:03:14.939> underneath<00:03:15.299> us<00:03:15.629> right

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
dance floor blocks underneath us right

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.409 
dance floor blocks underneath us right
here<00:03:16.019> at<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.319> moment<00:03:16.500> they<00:03:16.799> are<00:03:16.829> unpowered<00:03:17.579> if

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
here at the moment they are unpowered if

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.349 
here at the moment they are unpowered if
you<00:03:18.989> put<00:03:19.199> them<00:03:19.379> in<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.590> battery<00:03:20.129> of<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.879> whole

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
you put them in a battery of a whole

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.680 
you put them in a battery of a whole
load<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.829> units<00:03:22.829> like<00:03:23.069> this<00:03:23.370> then<00:03:23.849> if<00:03:24.480> you

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
load of units like this then if you

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.289 
load of units like this then if you
power<00:03:24.959> one<00:03:25.379> block<00:03:25.680> with<00:03:26.099> redstone<00:03:26.370> all<00:03:27.060> of

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
power one block with redstone all of

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.449 
power one block with redstone all of
them<00:03:27.510> get<00:03:27.720> powered<00:03:28.169> so<00:03:28.680> that's<00:03:29.010> pretty<00:03:29.250> good

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
them get powered so that's pretty good

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.330 
them get powered so that's pretty good
and<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:30.959> would<00:03:31.349> like<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.709> mention<00:03:31.859> right<00:03:32.129> here
