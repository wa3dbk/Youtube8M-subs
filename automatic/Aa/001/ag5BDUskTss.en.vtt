00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.959
 mustard tip you will see it's 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.199
 very greedy so we start we go 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:23.600

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.010

 yet vision on it that's it 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:06.070
 important to have a color like that 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.070
 does what it needs to be the recipe 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.790
 the duck and colored on both sides 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.890

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.910
 give taste the road is okay and 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.690
 here we will add 10 shallots it is 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.030
 everything and say 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.590
 it's not a good tagine 110 spices 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.340
 okay so he add a little bit 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.920
 for example 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.920
 that's going to add cumulative 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.550
 and here we will let it simmer for 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.280
 a few minutes yeah that's fine 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.270
 simmered 10 4 5 minutes is important 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.380
 and there we added tomatoes thank you 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.150
 had as expected very simple we are going 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:01.350
 cut into cubes like that little rude 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.310
 it will take 40 minutes of cooking to you 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.070
 you do not see what the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:14.970
 level injections then we finish on 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:17.880
 add tomatoes roman little bit on 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.640
 will add a little thyme laurel 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:25.530
 in part but I want to add the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.540
 dried apricots that we did so my 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.580
 series of important turkey have macerated 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.430

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.580
 nice tablespoon mustard 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.810
 the little touch to these ski trekking 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.890
 the strength in the us who want 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:48.150
 give character to this so never 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.220
 like huawei mai - cuba - here it is 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.030
 that's what will give in everything 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.970
 character the force and at the same time 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.300
 the same is going 2 baptized are the source of 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.300
 tajine 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.150
 1500 we will eat halfway up no more 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.250
 because to tajine on these faux pas too much 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.329
 the wet we will add a small 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.799
 little salt to season tomatoes 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.340

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.889
 shudder for an hour to 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.269
 attach the tra entrusted at the time of 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.069
 serve add some notes she 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.299
