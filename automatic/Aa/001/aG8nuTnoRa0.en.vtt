night in cary obviously carried by
Stephen<00:00:34.829> King<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.880> would<00:00:36.180> be<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.989> worst

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
Stephen King that would be the worst

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.369 
Stephen King that would be the worst
ever<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:40.910> would<00:00:41.910> definitely<00:00:42.120> pick<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
ever I would definitely pick like the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.040 
ever I would definitely pick like the
prison<00:00:43.770> from<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.550> walking<00:00:44.879> dead<00:00:44.910> series<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
prison from the walking dead series and

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.020 
prison from the walking dead series and
this<00:00:46.860> councils<00:00:47.250> books<00:00:47.430> because<00:00:47.700> I've<00:00:47.820> been

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
this councils books because I've been

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.540 
this councils books because I've been
reading<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> comics<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.960> graphic<00:00:49.800> novels<00:00:50.129> or

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
reading the comics and graphic novels or

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.729 
reading the comics and graphic novels or
whatever<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.840> think<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.379> would<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.530> really

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
whatever and I think it would be really

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.229 
whatever and I think it would be really
really<00:00:52.920> cool<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.430> visit<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> prison<00:00:53.910> because

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
really cool to visit the prison because

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.510 
really cool to visit the prison because
they've<00:00:54.780> got<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> system<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.100> now<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
they've got a system going on now and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.920 
they've got a system going on now and
they<00:00:56.699> sort<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.210> how<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.449> live<00:00:57.690> there

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
they sort of know how to live there

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.840 
they sort of know how to live there
pretty<00:00:58.350> safely<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.399> would<00:00:59.520> be<00:00:59.579> cool<00:00:59.820> to

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
pretty safely and so it would be cool to

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.299 
pretty safely and so it would be cool to
experience<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.410> hop<00:01:01.949> into<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
experience that and just hop into the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.410 
experience that and just hop into the
prison<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> little<00:01:02.910> while<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.239> walk

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
prison for a little while and walk

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.270 
prison for a little while and walk
around<00:01:03.570> cousin<00:01:04.320> zombie<00:01:04.589> Athena<00:01:04.920> what's<00:01:05.100> up

obsessed with the walking dead and then

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.240 
obsessed with the walking dead and then
that<00:01:08.880> would<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.479> really<00:01:09.750> cool<00:01:09.869> done<00:01:10.290> gimme<00:01:13.250> for

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.380 
me that would be the Marberry lens that
book<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.890> difficult<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.729> finish<00:01:18.060> but

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
book was so difficult to finish but

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.850 
book was so difficult to finish but
having<00:01:18.869> Ariel<00:01:19.200> by<00:01:19.290> my<00:01:19.409> side<00:01:19.650> definitely
