 division hands-free 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.890
 to convert the actual movements of the head 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.230
 virtual movements within the 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.450
 simulator 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.670
 the motor grader simulator software 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.140
 series m is configured in an environment of 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.510
 road construction 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.010
 the training exercises 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.049
 presented in the simulator emphasize the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.829
 several different applications used 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.829
 during construction 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.389
 a verification inspection is required 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.579
 before each turn at any location 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:54.010
 the exercise machine ride on the 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.109
 motor grader simulator prepares the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.150
 operators to identify the parties of the 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.680
 machine and determine if they are in 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.599
 work conditions 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.180
 users interact with the machine 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.260
 to repair faulty parts 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.060
 or defects requiring maintenance 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.579
 the exercise of familiarization with 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.680
 control operators are presented 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.840
 control the machine and learn how to 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.159
 complete the appropriate sequences for the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.859
 machine operation 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.870
 the illustrations of each control of the 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.970
 required movement are displayed in the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.889
 screen to familiarize the user with 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.799
 each function 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.900
 in the structure operation exercise 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.150
 aligned the user learns to maintain the 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:41.889
 straight machine using only the wheels 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:44.139
 for turning the spinning exercise 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:46.269
 articulated operators need to 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.699
 to maneuver through a series 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.229
 obstacles using the joint of the 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.229
 machine and the front wheel turn 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.710
 the self-directed exercise teaches the 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.290
 user to remove the material using 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.150
 articulation and inclination of the wheel to 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.390
 position the machine for different 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.390
 situations 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.660
 the grossing and 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.520
 finisher teaches operator to use the 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.530
 wheel inclination blade and 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.570
 adequate articulation to learn 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.240
 techniques of gross leveling and 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.850
 finishing 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.310
 The Excavation Exercise see teaches the 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.890
 adequate techniques to excavate trenches in 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.470
 see including the use of various positions 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.740
 of the blade as angle inclination and 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.640
 as well as articulation 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.890
 wheel lean exercise tear 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.330
 hard the user learns to perform 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:48.640
 operations properly tearing the tough 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.550
 exercise scare stay calls for the 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:56.980
 perform the proper operation. 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:58.630
 using the scarifier increment the 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.030
 operators may carry out any 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.710
 techniques learned in the exercises
