only<00:00:04.410> have<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:06.080> fucked<00:00:07.080> up<00:00:08.030> I've<00:00:09.139> really<00:00:10.139> fucked

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
only have I fucked up I've really fucked

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.049 
only have I fucked up I've really fucked
up<00:00:11.030> so<00:00:13.040> the<00:00:14.040> screen<00:00:14.219> started<00:00:14.730> acting<00:00:15.030> funny

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
up so the screen started acting funny

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.040 
up so the screen started acting funny
and<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.839> found<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.260> if<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.699> wiggled<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:18.050> could

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
and I found that if I wiggled I could

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.519 
and I found that if I wiggled I could
get<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.410> work<00:00:20.630> so<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> figured<00:00:21.720> if<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.260> just

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
get it to work so I figured if I just

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.790 
get it to work so I figured if I just
popped<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:24.689> outside<00:00:25.050> off<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.410> might<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.710> able

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
popped the outside off I might be able

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.370 
popped the outside off I might be able
to<00:00:25.980> see<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.240> and<00:00:27.980> then<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.010> made<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.340> worse<00:00:30.380> then

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
to see it and then I made it worse then

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.440 
to see it and then I made it worse then
I<00:00:31.439> made<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.740> really<00:00:32.160> worse<00:00:33.320> then<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.350> lost<00:00:34.680> all

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
I made it really worse then I lost all

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:46.400 
I made it really worse then I lost all
the<00:00:36.450> screws<00:00:38.870> for<00:00:39.870> everybody<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.860> then<00:00:45.410> since

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.740 

at<00:02:21.329> some<00:02:21.629> point<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.019> time

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.090

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
or it did maybe it only did it once I

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.410 
or it did maybe it only did it once I
don't<00:02:31.490> know<00:02:31.640> but<00:02:32.300> anyways<00:02:33.670> see<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.790> kind<00:02:35.270> of

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
don't know but anyways see it kind of

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.370 
don't know but anyways see it kind of
lights<00:02:36.260> up<00:02:37.570> but<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.660> also<00:02:38.810> found<00:02:39.110> out<00:02:39.320> that<00:02:39.380> I

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
lights up but I also found out that I

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.080 
lights up but I also found out that I
apparently<00:02:42.380> used<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.430> magnetic<00:02:43.880> screwdriver

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
apparently used a magnetic screwdriver

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.670 
apparently used a magnetic screwdriver
on<00:02:44.480> everything<00:02:44.990> I<00:02:45.110> don't<00:02:45.290> know<00:02:45.380> if<00:02:45.470> it's<00:02:45.590> going

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
on everything I don't know if it's going

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.860 
on everything I don't know if it's going
to<00:02:45.770> make<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:45.950> difference<00:02:46.580> I<00:02:46.880> don't<00:02:47.060> know<00:02:47.600> if<00:02:47.750> it

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
to make a difference I don't know if it

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:57.940 
to make a difference I don't know if it
matters<00:02:48.020> at<00:02:48.440> this<00:02:48.590> point<00:02:50.260> probably<00:02:51.260> not<00:02:56.830> but<00:02:57.830> I

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
matters at this point probably not but I

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.410 
matters at this point probably not but I
mean<00:02:58.130> it's<00:02:58.280> flickering<00:02:58.670> it's<00:02:58.880> trying<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.270> do

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
mean it's flickering it's trying to do

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.309 
mean it's flickering it's trying to do
something

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:45.640 

yeah<00:03:06.980> there<00:03:07.430> we<00:03:07.549> go

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.400 

not<00:03:46.650> quiet<00:03:47.330> like<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.450> said<00:03:48.630> there<00:03:48.810> was<00:03:48.900> one<00:03:49.050> spot

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
not quiet like I said there was one spot

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:59.800 
not quiet like I said there was one spot
that<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.620> pushed<00:03:50.160> on<00:03:57.230> fuck<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.380> let's<00:03:59.100> see

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
that I pushed on fuck it let's see

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:13.880 
that I pushed on fuck it let's see
typing<00:04:00.810> in<00:04:00.900> my<00:04:00.930> password

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.360 

so<00:04:14.490> at<00:04:14.610> this<00:04:14.670> point<00:04:15.680> I'm<00:04:16.680> assuming<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.220> means

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
so at this point I'm assuming that means

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.760 
so at this point I'm assuming that means
I<00:04:17.579> should<00:04:17.609> just<00:04:17.940> be<00:04:18.090> able<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.329> hook<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:20.510> monitor

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
I should just be able to hook a monitor

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.080 
I should just be able to hook a monitor
keyboard<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.520> mouse<00:04:24.390> up<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.140> it<00:04:25.260> right<00:04:26.090> and

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
keyboard and a mouse up to it right and

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.180 
keyboard and a mouse up to it right and
then<00:04:27.840> just<00:04:28.080> kind<00:04:28.170> of<00:04:28.290> leave<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:28.740> on<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.040> desk

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
then just kind of leave it on the desk

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.130 
then just kind of leave it on the desk
