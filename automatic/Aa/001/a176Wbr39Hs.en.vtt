notice so the next step is a game I like
to<00:02:21.000> play<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:22.230> don't<00:02:22.800> belong<00:02:23.250> here

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
to play is you don't belong here

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
on my floor so figure out all the things

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.890 
on my floor so figure out all the things
that<00:02:31.950> don't<00:02:32.220> belong<00:02:32.640> in<00:02:32.940> your<00:02:33.060> room<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.690> just

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
get them out okay so that step was

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.660 
get them out okay so that step was
pretty<00:02:37.170> easy<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.709> didn't<00:02:38.310> film<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.489> because

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
pretty easy I didn't film it because

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.040 
pretty easy I didn't film it because
most<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.090> was<00:02:39.209> just<00:02:39.360> me<00:02:39.540> walking<00:02:39.720> out<00:02:40.019> of

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
most of it was just me walking out of

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.240 
most of it was just me walking out of
the<00:02:40.200> room<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.530> putting<00:02:40.680> things<00:02:40.950> where<00:02:41.160> they

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
the room and putting things where they

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.280 
the room and putting things where they
belonged<00:02:41.519> it<00:02:42.360> was<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> very<00:02:42.750> important<00:02:43.230> step

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
belonged it was a very important step

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.070 
belonged it was a very important step
though<00:02:43.680> because<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.370> cannot<00:02:44.840> clean<00:02:45.840> and

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
though because you cannot clean and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.050 
though because you cannot clean and
organize<00:02:46.500> your<00:02:46.530> room<00:02:46.980> when<00:02:47.489> things<00:02:47.760> don't

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
organize your room when things don't

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.479 
organize your room when things don't
belong<00:02:48.420> then<00:02:48.750> my<00:02:49.470> next<00:02:49.530> step<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.750> clothes<00:02:52.489> you

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
belong then my next step is clothes you

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.400 
belong then my next step is clothes you
don't<00:02:53.730> belong<00:02:53.940> on<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.269> floor<00:02:54.300> either<00:02:54.810> can't

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
don't belong on the floor either can't

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.479 
don't belong on the floor either can't
wear<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.800> when<00:02:55.950> you're<00:02:56.100> there

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
wear you when you're there

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.340 
wear you when you're there
can't<00:02:57.330> have<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.540> clean<00:02:57.900> when<00:02:58.110> you're<00:02:58.230> there

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
can't have you clean when you're there

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.140 
can't have you clean when you're there
so<00:02:59.090> put<00:03:00.090> away<00:03:00.239> all<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.450> clothes<00:03:01.880> like<00:03:02.880> this

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
so put away all the clothes like this

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.789 
so put away all the clothes like this
the<00:03:03.600> blowing<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.079> floor<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.440> nice<00:03:04.590> and

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
the blowing of the floor is nice and

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.440 
the blowing of the floor is nice and
clean<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:04.980> folded<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.549> have<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.820> decide<00:03:06.150> if<00:03:06.329> I'm

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
clean and folded I have to decide if I'm

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.759 
clean and folded I have to decide if I'm
going<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.660> shake<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.019> off<00:03:07.079> or<00:03:07.320> if<00:03:07.410> I'm<00:03:07.500> kind<00:03:07.709> of

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
going to shake it off or if I'm kind of

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.770 
going to shake it off or if I'm kind of
put<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.100> dirty<00:03:08.280> laundry<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:08.850> basically

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
put it in the dirty laundry so basically

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.170 
put it in the dirty laundry so basically
this<00:03:10.079> step<00:03:10.380> is<00:03:10.560> just<00:03:10.829> get<00:03:11.430> rid<00:03:11.549> of<00:03:11.610> all<00:03:11.970> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
this step is just get rid of all the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.610 
this step is just get rid of all the
clothes<00:03:12.390> whether<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.930> means<00:03:13.140> put<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.500> away

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
clothes whether that means put it away

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.030 
clothes whether that means put it away
throw<00:03:14.519> it<00:03:14.640> away<00:03:14.760> or<00:03:15.590> put<00:03:16.590> in<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.739> dirty

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
throw it away or put in the dirty

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:30.270 
throw it away or put in the dirty
laundry

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.540 

the<00:03:31.090> next<00:03:31.420> step<00:03:31.600> is<00:03:31.780> put<00:03:32.110> things<00:03:32.650> away<00:03:33.010> if

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
the next step is put things away if

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.630 
the next step is put things away if
there<00:03:34.240> is<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.390> spot<00:03:34.780> for<00:03:34.960> them<00:03:35.110> like<00:03:35.620> shoes<00:03:36.430> in

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
there is a spot for them like shoes in

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.420 
there is a spot for them like shoes in
the<00:03:36.730> closet<00:03:36.850> or<00:03:37.810> my<00:03:38.380> paintbrushes<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.160> art

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
the closet or my paintbrushes and art

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.940 
the closet or my paintbrushes and art
supplies<00:03:39.520> have<00:03:40.000> stuff<00:03:40.270> too<00:03:40.650> if<00:03:41.650> there's<00:03:41.890> a

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
supplies have stuff too if there's a

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.760 
supplies have stuff too if there's a
spot<00:03:42.340> for<00:03:42.610> it<00:03:42.760> put<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.210> in<00:03:43.420> there<00:03:43.960> this<00:03:44.410> is<00:03:44.650> the

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
spot for it put it in there this is the

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.770 
spot for it put it in there this is the
step<00:03:45.040> where<00:03:45.070> you<00:03:45.430> just<00:03:45.700> move<00:03:46.150> everything<00:03:46.600> that

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
step where you just move everything that

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.290 
step where you just move everything that
doesn't<00:03:47.260> belong<00:03:47.530> out<00:03:47.830> on<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.220> floor<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:48.790> a

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
doesn't belong out on the floor and a

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.050 
doesn't belong out on the floor and a
pile<00:03:49.510> also<00:03:50.170> that<00:03:50.440> may<00:03:50.590> mean<00:03:50.860> organizing<00:03:51.760> the

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
pile also that may mean organizing the

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.330 
pile also that may mean organizing the
giant<00:03:52.450> pile<00:03:52.660> mess<00:03:52.990> of<00:03:53.260> shoes<00:03:53.890> that<00:03:54.070> you've<00:03:54.160> got

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
giant pile mess of shoes that you've got

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.940 
giant pile mess of shoes that you've got
going<00:03:54.520> on<00:03:54.730> okay<00:03:55.270> so<00:03:55.330> we<00:03:55.600> just<00:03:55.840> did<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.140> this

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
going on okay so we just did the this

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.570 
going on okay so we just did the this
doesn't<00:03:57.370> belong<00:03:57.520> on<00:03:57.700> my<00:03:57.820> floor<00:03:58.060> part<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.980> do

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
doesn't belong on my floor part I do
