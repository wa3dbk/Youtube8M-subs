in plastic coating you can buy it in

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.190 
in plastic coating you can buy it in
every<00:01:26.729> garden<00:01:26.939> shop<00:01:28.670> ok<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.729> let's<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.840> how<00:01:31.140> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
every garden shop ok so let's see how to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.429 
every garden shop ok so let's see how to
attach<00:01:31.710> camión<00:01:32.189> toes<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.640> driftwood

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
attach camión toes to the driftwood

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.920 
attach camión toes to the driftwood
first<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:35.159> need<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.759> wrap<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.360> piece<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
first you need to wrap the piece of the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.570 
first you need to wrap the piece of the
wire<00:01:37.170> around<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.920> driftwood

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.770 

you<00:01:40.940> straighten<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.720> tips<00:01:42.580> and<00:01:43.580> you<00:01:44.180> shorten

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
you straighten the tips and you shorten

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:53.470 
you straighten the tips and you shorten
them<00:01:50.470> for<00:01:51.470> larger<00:01:51.950> patches<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.550> Clementis<00:01:53.090> you

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
them for larger patches of Clementis you

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.340 
them for larger patches of Clementis you
need<00:01:53.690> more<00:01:54.080> wire<00:01:54.640> now<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.480> wraps<00:01:56.870> the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
need more wire now that it wraps the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.090 
need more wire now that it wraps the
second<00:01:57.830> piece<00:01:58.040> of<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.400> wire<00:01:59.230> again<00:02:00.230> the<00:02:00.710> tips

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
second piece of the wire again the tips

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:14.350 
second piece of the wire again the tips
are<00:02:01.460> straightened<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.450> shortened

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.150 

after<00:02:15.360> attaching<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.960> wire<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.770> take<00:02:17.130> a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
after attaching the wire you take a

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.870 
after attaching the wire you take a
bunch<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.850> mementos<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:19.680> simply<00:02:20.280> stick

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
bunch of mementos and you simply stick

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.830 
bunch of mementos and you simply stick
the<00:02:21.180> wire<00:02:21.360> through<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.080> layer<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.530> plants

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
the wire through the layer of plants

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.900 
the wire through the layer of plants
yeah<00:02:24.840> now<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.680> can<00:02:25.920> see<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.250> better<00:02:26.400> you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
yeah now you can see the better you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.730 
yeah now you can see the better you
stick<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.450> wire<00:02:27.630> through<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.230> layer<00:02:28.500> of

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
stick the wire through the layer of

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.340 
stick the wire through the layer of
plants<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:32.370> need<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.970> bend<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.780> tips<00:02:34.110> of

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
plants and you need to bend the tips of

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.890 
plants and you need to bend the tips of
the<00:02:34.560> wire<00:02:34.710> sideways<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.880> keep<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.330> Mentos<00:02:36.720> in

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the wire sideways to keep a Mentos in

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:49.410 
the wire sideways to keep a Mentos in
