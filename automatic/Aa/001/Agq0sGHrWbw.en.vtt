00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.459
 mendoza 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.010
 this is kim jong believe and look at the 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.000
 authentic six 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.000
 the party 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.509
 what does it mean then let's go thematic of 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.650
 pool you see that it has a float and 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:23.970
 cocks 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.970
 do not dance or anything weird does not 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.119
 I did not dance because the commands of 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.900
 dance and I did 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.900
 let's see how they are 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.330
 had a point a fucking water balloon 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.660
 attention to this is a water balloon that 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.700
 good 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.700
 to see the little bomb how are 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.300
 they are also water balloons 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.300
 and the one about this 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.640
 tomato and me what good 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.970
 it's a float let's see now the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.220
 ability to 6 is worth and already the truth that 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.790
 It is nice but there we are 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.790
 all right 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.460
 well let's see the last one really 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.210
 let's see if I can throw it 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.240
 and that never the truth is that never there 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.299
 we have the ultimate 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.299
 and it is a water pump a water pump 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.049
 a giant water balloon let's go 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.049
 so I hope you liked it 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.100
 it is not a cure 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.399
 and I hope you liked lackey 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.680
 soon 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.480
 the other one was not, but he was also good 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.030
 really nice 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.310
 whenever it modifies the attacks it's a 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.650
 detail that man does not modify the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.900
 attacks 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.900
 good see you now now
