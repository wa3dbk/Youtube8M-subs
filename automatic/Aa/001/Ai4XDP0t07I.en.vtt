00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
technologies into a tree so let's go

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.560 
technologies into a tree so let's go
take<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> look<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:43.229> what<00:01:43.560> I've<00:01:43.680> come<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:44.040> with

of the stuff that I built to go on the
tree<00:01:49.020> right<00:01:49.259> now<00:01:49.439> would<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.920> look<00:01:50.009> at

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
tree right now would be to look at

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.580 
tree right now would be to look at
lighting<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.810> first<00:01:52.049> thing<00:01:52.259> we've<00:01:52.380> got

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
lighting so the first thing we've got

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.370 
lighting so the first thing we've got
here<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.640> two<00:01:53.880> meters<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.780> neopixel

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
here is is two meters of the neopixel

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.730 
here is is two meters of the neopixel
strip

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
strip

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.789 
strip
I<00:01:55.950> took<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.969> trinket<00:01:57.780> microcontroller<00:01:57.960> and

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
I took a trinket microcontroller and

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.740 
I took a trinket microcontroller and
they<00:01:58.890> give<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.130> an<00:01:59.189> idea<00:01:59.369> about<00:01:59.790> how<00:02:00.180> small

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
they give you an idea about how small

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.740 
they give you an idea about how small
these<00:02:00.960> guys<00:02:01.170> are<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:03.030> builds<00:02:03.479> right

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
these guys are that just builds right

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.640 
these guys are that just builds right
into<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> end<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
into the end of the

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.650 
into the end of the
you'll<00:02:05.100> strip<00:02:05.370> and<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.760> provides<00:02:06.150> all<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
you'll strip and that provides all the

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.100 
you'll strip and that provides all the
control<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.410> all<00:02:07.470> these<00:02:07.650> LEDs<00:02:08.450> about<00:02:09.450> 120

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
control for all these LEDs about 120

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.290 
control for all these LEDs about 120
LEDs<00:02:10.500> here<00:02:10.740> so<00:02:10.890> that's<00:02:11.070> pretty<00:02:11.430> cool<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.150> I

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
LEDs here so that's pretty cool and I

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.700 
LEDs here so that's pretty cool and I
can<00:02:12.450> plug<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.720> into<00:02:12.840> my<00:02:12.960> computer<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.560> can

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
can plug it into my computer and I can

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.800 
can plug it into my computer and I can
change<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.130> animation<00:02:14.250> all<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.880> want<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.270> even

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
change the animation all I want to even

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.570 
change the animation all I want to even
here<00:02:15.990> by<00:02:16.110> year<00:02:16.350> next<00:02:16.620> year<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.010> can<00:02:17.250> just<00:02:17.400> pull

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
here by year next year I can just pull

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.910 
here by year next year I can just pull
it<00:02:17.700> out<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:17.880> make<00:02:18.570> something<00:02:18.840> different<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.890> I

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
it out and make something different so I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.220 
it out and make something different so I
also<00:02:20.250> put<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.640> thrift<00:02:20.940> store<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.630> found<00:02:21.960> a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
also put the thrift store and I found a

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.000 
also put the thrift store and I found a
an<00:02:22.950> AC<00:02:23.190> brick<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:24.450> will<00:02:24.720> do<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.800> power

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
an AC brick that will do the power

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.530 
an AC brick that will do the power
requirements<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:26.910> need<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.240> run<00:02:27.390> these

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
requirements that I need to run these

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.170 
requirements that I need to run these
two<00:02:27.780> meters<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.680> we'll<00:02:28.830> plug<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.730> see

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
two meters so we'll plug that in and see

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.170 
two meters so we'll plug that in and see
what<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.480> get<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.370> takes<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.640> second<00:02:32.940> for<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
what we get so it takes a second for the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.170 
what we get so it takes a second for the
Arduino<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.690> boot<00:02:33.960> up<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.700> then<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.790> starts<00:02:36.120> to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
Arduino to boot up and then it starts to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.750 
Arduino to boot up and then it starts to
go<00:02:36.360> through<00:02:36.540> an<00:02:36.630> animation<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.470> all<00:02:38.370> this

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
go through an animation and all this

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.310 
go through an animation and all this
lighting<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.300> going<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.540> go<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.900> trunk<00:02:40.170> of

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
lighting is going to go in the trunk of

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.470 
lighting is going to go in the trunk of
the<00:02:40.410> tree<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.920> core<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:42.180> going<00:02:42.420> to

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the tree in the core and it's going to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.510 
the tree in the core and it's going to
kind<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.020> fade<00:02:43.260> out<00:02:43.320> so<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.100> will<00:02:44.280> provide

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
kind of fade out so this will provide

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.160 
kind of fade out so this will provide
all<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.940> light<00:02:45.090> instead<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.600> using<00:02:45.750> string

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
all the light instead of using string

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.410 
all the light instead of using string
lights<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:47.010> will<00:02:47.070> just<00:02:47.250> be<00:02:47.400> one<00:02:47.430> super-bright

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
lights it will just be one super-bright

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.780 
lights it will just be one super-bright
string<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.020> middle<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.520> it'll<00:02:50.520> be<00:02:50.640> all

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
string in the middle and it'll be all

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.570 
string in the middle and it'll be all
these<00:02:50.970> cool<00:02:51.270> different<00:02:51.480> effects<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:53.370> that's

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
these cool different effects so that's

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.680 
these cool different effects so that's
what<00:02:53.730> we're<00:02:53.850> going<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.030> do<00:02:54.090> for<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.420> main

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
what we're going to do for the main

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.770 
what we're going to do for the main
lighting<00:02:55.220> now<00:02:56.220> for<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.940> tree<00:02:57.180> topper<00:02:57.660> I

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
lighting now for the tree topper I

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.650 
lighting now for the tree topper I
decided<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.320> do<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.500> cool<00:02:58.860> star<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.209> basically<00:03:00.540> a

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
decided to do a cool star so basically a

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.840 
decided to do a cool star so basically a
3d<00:03:01.080> print<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.560> star<00:03:01.890> my<00:03:02.190> design<00:03:02.580> didn't

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
3d print of the star my design didn't

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.480 
3d print of the star my design didn't
solidedge<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.950> printed<00:03:04.950> out<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.190> my<00:03:05.280> so

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
solidedge and printed out of my so

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.570 
solidedge and printed out of my so
little<00:03:05.880> 3d<00:03:06.120> printer<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:07.680> built<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.550> I

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
little 3d printer and I built it so I

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.250 
little 3d printer and I built it so I
had<00:03:08.820> enough<00:03:09.000> room<00:03:09.120> on<00:03:09.540> these<00:03:09.690> new<00:03:09.900> pencil

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
had enough room on these new pencil

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.530 
had enough room on these new pencil
strips<00:03:10.650> now<00:03:11.340> that's<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.610> same<00:03:11.940> thing<00:03:12.269> as

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
strips now that's the same thing as

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.590 
strips now that's the same thing as
these<00:03:13.200> guys<00:03:13.530> accept<00:03:14.430> these<00:03:14.580> new<00:03:14.640> pixels<00:03:15.390> are

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
these guys accept these new pixels are

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.350 
these guys accept these new pixels are
mounted<00:03:15.930> on<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.080> PCB<00:03:16.590> like<00:03:16.980> our<00:03:17.190> ring<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:17.820> it's

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
mounted on a PCB like our ring and it's

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.509 
mounted on a PCB like our ring and it's
about<00:03:18.480> 16<00:03:19.050> mm<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.440> can<00:03:19.709> control<00:03:20.040> these<00:03:20.220> in<00:03:20.430> the

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
about 16 mm I can control these in the

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.790 
about 16 mm I can control these in the
same<00:03:20.730> way<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.600> you've<00:03:21.780> got<00:03:21.959> this<00:03:22.260> if<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.680> can

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
same way so you've got this if you can

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.290 
same way so you've got this if you can
see<00:03:23.010> on<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.190> back<00:03:23.370> I've<00:03:23.700> got<00:03:23.730> some<00:03:24.030> wires

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
see on the back I've got some wires

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.470 
see on the back I've got some wires

the tube here's my water for power and

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.320 
the tube here's my water for power and
there<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.690> my<00:03:31.110> trinket<00:03:32.040> microcontroller<00:03:32.330> so
