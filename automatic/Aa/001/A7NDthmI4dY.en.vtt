the<00:03:53.130> flashback<00:03:53.549> here<00:03:53.790> they're<00:03:54.060> much<00:03:54.660> more

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.960 

shiny<00:03:58.079> almost<00:03:58.859> I<00:03:59.010> guess<00:03:59.040> it's<00:03:59.609> not<00:03:59.730> like<00:03:59.910> a

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
shiny almost I guess it's not like a

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.190 
shiny almost I guess it's not like a
matte<00:04:00.150> finish<00:04:00.180> like<00:04:00.569> the<00:04:00.660> original<00:04:00.900> ones<00:04:01.079> were

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
matte finish like the original ones were

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.729 
matte finish like the original ones were
and<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.769> had<00:04:01.799> this<00:04:02.069> uh<00:04:03.109> kind<00:04:04.109> of<00:04:04.169> weird<00:04:04.349> border

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
and I had this uh kind of weird border

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.039 
and I had this uh kind of weird border
going<00:04:05.220> around<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.549> outside<00:04:05.810> so<00:04:06.810> they<00:04:06.930> are

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
going around the outside so they are

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.240 
going around the outside so they are
definitely<00:04:07.200> different<00:04:07.470> than<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.829> original

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
definitely different than the original

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.819 
definitely different than the original
but<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.669> lot<00:04:09.419> of<00:04:09.450> pictures<00:04:09.629> are<00:04:09.780> saying<00:04:10.169> they're

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
but a lot of pictures are saying they're

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.240
