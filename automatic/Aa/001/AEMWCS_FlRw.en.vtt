00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
hoping that Funko would get around to a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.500 
hoping that Funko would get around to a
tangled<00:00:25.920> pop<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.640> I'm<00:00:26.730> really<00:00:26.910> glad<00:00:27.090> they<00:00:27.330> did

now<00:00:27.660> they've<00:00:27.840> been<00:00:27.960> kind<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.230> pushing<00:00:28.529> their

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
now they've been kind of pushing their

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.500 
now they've been kind of pushing their
Disney<00:00:28.830> line<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.310> extra<00:00:29.699> hard<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.090> I

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
Disney line like extra hard and I

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.880 
Disney line like extra hard and I
thought<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> design<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.590> alone

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
thought just the design of this alone

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.229 
thought just the design of this alone
like<00:00:32.040> when<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.219> saw<00:00:32.340> photos<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.940> when<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.149> was

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
like when I saw photos of it when it was

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.120 
like when I saw photos of it when it was
first<00:00:33.360> announced<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.899> thought<00:00:34.290> what<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> great

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
first announced I thought what a great

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.250 
first announced I thought what a great
design<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.239> handle<00:00:36.600> her<00:00:36.750> hair<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.050> that

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
design like to handle her hair like that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.600 
design like to handle her hair like that
was<00:00:37.410> great<00:00:37.649> cuz<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.920> figured<00:00:38.190> they're<00:00:38.309> gonna<00:00:38.460> do

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
was great cuz I figured they're gonna do

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.910 
was great cuz I figured they're gonna do
the<00:00:38.760> really<00:00:38.910> long<00:00:39.500> ponytail<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.710> makes

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the really long ponytail that makes

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.080 
the really long ponytail that makes
sense<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.309> easier<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.730> make<00:00:41.879> it's

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
sense it's easier to make it's

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.299 
sense it's easier to make it's
cost-effective<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.530> go<00:00:43.649> with<00:00:43.680> all<00:00:44.100> that

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
cost-effective but to go with all that

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.860 
cost-effective but to go with all that
long<00:00:44.550> hair<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.329> handle<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.750> this

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
long hair and to handle it in this

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.600 
long hair and to handle it in this
design<00:00:46.289> where<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.620> almost<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> part<00:00:47.489> of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
design where it's almost like a part of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.040 
design where it's almost like a part of
her<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.850> stands<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.719> not<00:00:48.840> quite<00:00:49.020> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
her that stands like it's not quite a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.830 
her that stands like it's not quite a
base<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.280> know<00:00:50.570> part<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
base but it is you know part of the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.860 
base but it is you know part of the
figure<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> stand<00:00:53.000> great<00:00:54.000> great<00:00:54.719> idea

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
figure as a stand great great idea

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.709 
figure as a stand great great idea
because<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:56.460> clever<00:00:56.969> its<00:00:57.360> artistic

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
because it's it's clever its artistic

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.229 
because it's it's clever its artistic
and<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.710> functional<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.820> like<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.120> it's

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and it's functional and I like that it's

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.920 
and it's functional and I like that it's
both<00:01:01.160> so<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> closer<00:01:03.539> look<00:01:03.690> at

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
both so going in for a closer look at

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.390 
both so going in for a closer look at
this<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.680> could<00:01:04.799> see<00:01:04.920> they<00:01:05.010> did<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.189> good<00:01:05.339> job

back here at least the way it kind of

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.450 
back here at least the way it kind of
like<00:01:33.720> plops<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> ground<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.130> has<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> good

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
like plops to the ground and has a good

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
like fold to it and then the way it kind

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.219 
like fold to it and then the way it kind
of<00:01:39.590> like<00:01:41.150> twirls<00:01:42.150> then<00:01:42.299> at<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> end<00:01:42.689> all<00:01:42.960> the

really<00:03:06.359> swinging<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.260> side<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.590> that

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
really swinging to the side and that

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.289 
really swinging to the side and that
kind<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:07.950> bugged<00:03:08.099> me<00:03:08.190> but<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:08.970> one's<00:03:09.150> pretty

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
kind of bugged me but this one's pretty

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.699 
kind of bugged me but this one's pretty
good<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:10.200> not<00:03:10.290> really<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.530> problem

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
good and it's not really a problem

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.140 
good and it's not really a problem
because<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.160> hair<00:03:11.370> holds<00:03:11.670> up<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:11.940> much<00:03:12.090> that

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
because the hair holds up so much that

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.759 
because the hair holds up so much that
even<00:03:12.480> if<00:03:12.569> she<00:03:12.599> kind<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.900> skews<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.260> side<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.650> it

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
even if she kind of skews the side of it

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.530 
even if she kind of skews the side of it
it's<00:03:14.370> not<00:03:14.549> gonna<00:03:14.730> affect<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> way<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.299> figure

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540
