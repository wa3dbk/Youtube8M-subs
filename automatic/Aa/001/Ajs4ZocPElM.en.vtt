hi<00:00:01.620> I'm<00:00:01.770> Rubens<00:00:02.129> Barrichello<00:00:02.210> we<00:00:03.210> are<00:00:03.330> here<00:00:03.480> in

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
hi I'm Rubens Barrichello we are here in

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.030 
hi I'm Rubens Barrichello we are here in
Shanghai<00:00:03.810> I'm<00:00:04.170> going<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.500> take<00:00:04.620> you<00:00:04.680> for<00:00:05.009> a

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
Shanghai I'm going to take you for a

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.780 
Shanghai I'm going to take you for a
good<00:00:05.490> lap<00:00:05.670> through<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.540> circuit

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
good lap through the circuit

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.039 
good lap through the circuit
okay<00:00:09.420> here<00:00:09.690> I'm<00:00:10.040> starting<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.160> lab<00:00:11.340> it's<00:00:12.049> not

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
okay here I'm starting the lab it's not

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.990 
okay here I'm starting the lab it's not
the<00:00:13.200> longest<00:00:13.530> trade<00:00:13.770> but<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.280> get<00:00:14.520> seventh

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
the longest trade but we get seventh

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.660 
the longest trade but we get seventh
year<00:00:15.240> before<00:00:15.930> the<00:00:16.290> first<00:00:16.529> corner

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
year before the first corner

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.670 
year before the first corner
you<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.480> take<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> lot<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.020> speeding<00:00:19.470> to

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
you have to take a lot of speeding to

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.380 
you have to take a lot of speeding to
the<00:00:19.740> corner<00:00:20.130> as<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.430> can<00:00:20.610> see<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.090> go<00:00:21.360> down

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the corner as you can see you go down

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.230 
the corner as you can see you go down
two<00:00:22.140> or<00:00:22.170> three<00:00:22.470> years<00:00:22.710> where<00:00:23.100> you're<00:00:24.060> still

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
two or three years where you're still

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.430 
two or three years where you're still
carrying<00:00:24.450> a<00:00:24.600> lot<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.810> speed<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.230> then<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
carrying a lot of speed and then the

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.830 
carrying a lot of speed and then the
apex<00:00:25.800> become<00:00:26.220> quite<00:00:26.550> long<00:00:26.820> down<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.510> second

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
apex become quite long down to second

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.160 
apex become quite long down to second
gear<00:00:28.160> isolated<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.310> little<00:00:29.670> bit<00:00:29.849> then<00:00:30.360> you<00:00:30.390> slow

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
gear isolated a little bit then you slow

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.870 
gear isolated a little bit then you slow
down<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.800> left-hander<00:00:32.460> where<00:00:32.700> you

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
down for this left-hander where you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.430 
down for this left-hander where you
carry<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.480> little<00:00:33.989> bit<00:00:34.080> of<00:00:34.170> speed<00:00:36.320> through<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
carry a little bit of speed through the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.770 
carry a little bit of speed through the
gears<00:00:37.710> up<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> sixth<00:00:38.699> year<00:00:38.940> before<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.510> I'm

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
gears up to sixth year before you I'm

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.200 
gears up to sixth year before you I'm
changing<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> little<00:00:40.530> bit<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.830> the<00:00:40.949> knobs

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
changing a little bit of the knobs

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.080 
changing a little bit of the knobs
breaking<00:00:42.210> 70<00:00:43.199> meters<00:00:43.500> before<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:44.340> walk<00:00:44.879> up

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
breaking 70 meters before we walk up

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.210 
breaking 70 meters before we walk up
into<00:00:45.449> this<00:00:45.629> corner<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.440> quite<00:00:47.190> easy

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
into this corner because it's quite easy

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.610 
into this corner because it's quite easy
to<00:00:47.489> lock<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:47.970> second<00:00:48.480> year

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
to lock up second year

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.619 
to lock up second year
then<00:00:51.160> we<00:00:51.370> have<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:51.579> quite<00:00:52.329> quick<00:00:53.050> corners<00:00:53.800> into

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
then we have to quite quick corners into

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.240 
then we have to quite quick corners into
less<00:00:55.629> than<00:00:55.840> rice<00:00:56.050> left<00:00:56.500> are<00:00:56.710> done<00:00:56.920> in<00:00:57.070> the

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
less than rice left are done in the

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.540 
less than rice left are done in the
sixth<00:00:57.550> year<00:00:57.790> the<00:00:58.180> right<00:00:58.360> down<00:00:58.600> in<00:00:58.750> fifth<00:00:59.050> gear

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
sixth year the right down in fifth gear

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.340 
sixth year the right down in fifth gear
you<00:01:00.550> have<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.820> keep<00:01:00.969> the<00:01:01.149> apex<00:01:01.540> quite<00:01:02.050> tight

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
you have to keep the apex quite tight

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.590 
you have to keep the apex quite tight
because<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.219> exit<00:01:03.579> is<00:01:03.670> quite<00:01:03.910> important<00:01:04.420> here

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
because the exit is quite important here

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.070 
because the exit is quite important here
you<00:01:04.750> have<00:01:04.900> to<00:01:05.049> run<00:01:05.229> quite<00:01:05.470> wide<00:01:06.960> through<00:01:07.960> the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
you have to run quite wide through the

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.060 
you have to run quite wide through the
gears<00:01:08.320> once<00:01:08.619> more<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.190> you<00:01:09.940> break<00:01:10.149> around<00:01:11.070> 75

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
gears once more and you break around 75

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.700 
gears once more and you break around 75
meters<00:01:12.909> again<00:01:13.030> carry<00:01:13.899> a<00:01:13.960> little<00:01:14.140> bit<00:01:14.380> speed

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
meters again carry a little bit speed

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.740 
meters again carry a little bit speed
but<00:01:14.950> not<00:01:15.130> too<00:01:15.580> important<00:01:16.090> this<00:01:16.330> corner<00:01:16.720> is

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
but not too important this corner is

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.480 
but not too important this corner is
probably<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.440> best<00:01:17.649> into<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.130> circuit

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
probably the best into the circuit

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.670 
probably the best into the circuit
because<00:01:18.759> it's<00:01:18.940> a<00:01:19.149> have<00:01:19.659> different<00:01:20.140> ways<00:01:20.470> of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
because it's a have different ways of

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.859 
because it's a have different ways of
doing<00:01:21.009> it<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:21.430> you<00:01:21.670> have<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.060> just<00:01:22.660> basically

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
doing it and you have to just basically

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.990 
doing it and you have to just basically
be<00:01:23.320> on<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.560> trot<00:01:23.770> oh<00:01:23.800> whatever<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.640> car<00:01:24.850> is

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
be on the trot oh whatever the car is

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.150 
be on the trot oh whatever the car is
doing<00:01:25.179> so<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:26.320> have<00:01:26.470> to<00:01:26.619> carry<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:26.950> lot<00:01:27.130> of

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
doing so you have to carry a lot of

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.859 
doing so you have to carry a lot of
speed<00:01:27.490> there<00:01:27.759> is<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.880> lot<00:01:28.090> of<00:01:28.119> momentum<00:01:28.450> going

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
speed there is a lot of momentum going

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.200 
speed there is a lot of momentum going
some<00:01:29.470> understeer<00:01:30.070> some<00:01:30.340> overseer<00:01:30.789> but<00:01:31.000> quite

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
some understeer some overseer but quite

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.060 
some understeer some overseer but quite
an<00:01:31.330> enjoyable<00:01:31.570> corner<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.500> longest<00:01:32.860> trade

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
an enjoyable corner the longest trade

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.010 
an enjoyable corner the longest trade
off<00:01:33.220> of<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.610> circuit<00:01:34.030> breaking<00:01:34.899> at<00:01:34.990> the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
off of the circuit breaking at the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.600 
off of the circuit breaking at the
hundred<00:01:35.350> meter<00:01:35.380> it's<00:01:36.190> quite<00:01:36.399> difficult

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
hundred meter it's quite difficult

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.090 
hundred meter it's quite difficult
corner<00:01:37.119> missed<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:38.050> little<00:01:38.380> bit<00:01:38.500> of<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.710> apex

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
corner missed a little bit of the apex

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.779 
corner missed a little bit of the apex
there<00:01:39.610> was<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:40.270> wind<00:01:40.450> behind<00:01:41.460> then<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:42.580> just

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
there was the wind behind then you just

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.999 
there was the wind behind then you just
accelerate<00:01:43.300> back<00:01:43.509> again<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:43.990> take<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.590> lot<00:01:44.979> of

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
accelerate back again and take a lot of

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.340 
accelerate back again and take a lot of
speed<00:01:45.369> into<00:01:45.640> this<00:01:45.789> last<00:01:46.360> band<00:01:46.690> in<00:01:46.899> third<00:01:47.110> gear

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
speed into this last band in third gear

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.430 
speed into this last band in third gear
for<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.190> to<00:01:48.399> finish<00:01:48.990> very<00:01:49.990> good<00:01:50.140> luck

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.970 

well<00:01:54.400> that<00:01:54.790> is<00:01:54.970> my<00:01:55.450> lap<00:01:55.720> I<00:01:56.050> hope<00:01:56.470> you<00:01:56.650> enjoy<00:01:56.950> it

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
well that is my lap I hope you enjoy it

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.210 
well that is my lap I hope you enjoy it
he<00:01:57.400> was<00:01:57.580> quite<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.210> quick<00:01:59.050> lap<00:01:59.260> with<00:01:59.500> all<00:01:59.980> the
