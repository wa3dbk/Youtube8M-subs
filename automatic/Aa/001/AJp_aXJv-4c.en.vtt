00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 in the previous chapter of loves 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.920
 crossed the four neighbors dined 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.920
 together 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.210
 Jennifer invited out to joey a day 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.210
 following 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.640
 and I finish thinking about the plan by which 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:23.380
 would stop ronnie from sophie and jennifer and 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.380
 joey had a special appointment 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.140
 no no 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.030
 when I got home I felt great 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.460
 the date with Jennifer had gone so 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.699
 well they had agreed to go to dinner 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.850
 together they are the restaurant that night of 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.190
 immediately and very happy he told me everything to 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.790
 March who congratulate you and wish you 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.790
 luck 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.900
 and Jennifer also spoke with sophie from 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.720
 what happened in the bakery and the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.420
 plans they had to dine the only 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.460
 detail that he did not mention was that he was looking for 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.500
 give Marc a little jealousy with that 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.570
 relationship 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.600
 Sofia listened enthusiastically to everything 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.580
 her friend told her and even lends her a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.580
 dress for use in the new appointment 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.329
 ah 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.560
 When she was ready, Jennifer went down to the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.140
 reception of the building where 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.140
 I would meet with joey and they went together 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.829
 why 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.610
 know little 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 to 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.400
 minutes after your family is 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.160
 outside Sophie put on her bedding and 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.880
 he started watching a movie he planned 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.880
 go to bed early 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.900
 8000 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.570
 for his part he did not want to spend the night 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.090
 only while his friend was not at home 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.710
 so he ordered a pizza that arrived a 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.710
 shortly after I made it out 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.000
 like the food and I play hard in the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.000
 neighbor department 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.030
 and 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.030
 and he 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.900
 sufi thought that maybe Jennifer had 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.450
 forgotten the keys and had returned to 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.580
 look for them so he yelled at him to come in 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.580
 that the door was uninsured 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.049
 When I saw Marc I went to the partner and 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.750
 embarrassed he could not understand that towards him 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.510
 there and it was completely messed up 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.939
 so he went to his room to change 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.120
 the clothes while marc was waiting for her in the 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.700
 cook with the food five minutes 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.680
 Then they appeared again and 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.409
 he apologized for having received it from 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.389
 that way I was still embarrassed by what 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.069
 it had ocurred 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:36.560
 markel explained that since his two 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.930
 friends were not you found a very 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.930
 good idea that they will fill us alone 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.650
 although always 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.560
 and they chatted entertainingly until very 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.829
 late for love had been a good 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.829
 night 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.860
 then they went to the living room to continue 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.930
 the conversation 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.390
 marc asked Sophie if she liked them 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.370
 the sports she answered yes 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.099
 but that I had never tried to do 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.189
 some so he kindly invited him 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:17.829
 to go through his work the next day 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.829
 to have a training session 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.600
 and then marc went to his apartment 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.110
 in his room he began to reflect 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.110
 Y 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.670
 Sophie also thought 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.800
 something in the neighbor called his attention 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:45.300
 he loved his company but could not 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.810
 admit to itself 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.090
 that night seeing her disheveled sophie 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.669
 he realized that what he felt for 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.969
 she was not just a simple attraction 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.459
 for the rejection 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:01.459
 something new was something that had never 

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:04.119
 felt by some other girl was 

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:04.119
 in love
