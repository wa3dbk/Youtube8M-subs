00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.730
 today's smartphones 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.220

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.400

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.720

 I'm going to withdraw this 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.520
 and let's check that really the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.970
 load makes it concrete 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.810
 we are going to 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.810

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.430

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.430

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.120

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.159
 as you have been able to check load without 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.189
 no problem and now what are we going to 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:16.440
 do is going to be connect it to the current 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:18.720

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.930
 ok if we take the charging cable of the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.380

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.380

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.500
 there it is and as you can see in the part of 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.209
 us down lights a red light this 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.290
 red light means that the device 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.569
 it's loading once it's loaded 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.080
 this light will change us to color 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.000

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.190

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.700
