00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.550
 I am proud to present the series 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.520
 serene you an absolute novelty at home 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.619
 trabucco and there is talk of a series of 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.369
 double measure tools here in fact 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:34.649
 in addition to the 420 I have here from 180 g 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.790
 we also have the 450 as a little all the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.160
 our three pieces 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.470
 the feature we went to 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.410
 also research this tool 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.070
 certainly it will be placed in a band 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.590
 average price is the launch distance 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.379
 all the drums are all the more reason 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.679
 this that I have in my hands of serenity 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.320
 able to give excellent performances of 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:01.769
 launch in fact also in this case yes 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.440
 speaks of a rather hard handle for 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.960
 ending in a central part that between 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.420
 the other looks very beautiful 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.110
 we also have a 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.299
 a finish on the tool is in 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.490
 unable to make the wire stick in 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.250
 launch phase even in case of fort 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.610
 humidity the line slips over not 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.640
 sticking to the barrel anyway 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.369
 ending up on a rather yielding peak is 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.580
 able to hold any condition 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.549
 of sea and wind like rings we have 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.000
 chosen an excellent in nature anti 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.880
 salt a steel bridge to the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.350
 series of the kv type having the bridge 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.740
 obligation 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.869
 this to guarantee excellent performance 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.090
 launch is really to reduce to 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:56.750
 the risk of substandard loans being minimal 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.929
 I also launch this rod but it's in 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.159
 carbon cx1 a very light material 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:07.459
 very reactive and a cane anyway 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.649
 may be indicated to all but 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.540
 especially to those who start and maybe not 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.410
 wants to spend the figures 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.989
 unfortunately it is necessary to get hold of the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.079
 top of the range this can be second 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.489
 me a really good alternative 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.190
 taking a look at the finishes 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.280
 the tool to say looks good because 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.640
 they are made with handmade ligatures and 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.829
 the ring is very nice all the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.760
 gluing phase of the finish 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.760
 tool
