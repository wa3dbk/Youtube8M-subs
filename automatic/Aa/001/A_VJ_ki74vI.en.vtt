00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.429
 here I made 14 a 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.879
 one of the most frequent causes that lead to lamentable fires in 

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:27.439
 public places is the ignition of oils or fatty products used in 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.239
 the restaurant kitchens 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.879
 melissa mccarthy has the right solution to protect your kitchen in 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.050
 fast and efficient way using simple acting systems 

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.850
 manual 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 to automatic extinguishing systems 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.130
 in this animation we will show our intelligent automatic system that 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.780
 It is composed of a line of fuses inside the bell 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.010
 a fuse cut detector a smart central and the whole if 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.710
 boundary electrovalve pipes and sprinklers specially designed for 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.580
 this type of fires 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.540
 for the preparation of food, all the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.140
 heat sources of artifacts 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.590
 accidentally due to excess temperature or carelessness 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.090
 they usually start dangerously violent and missions 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.310
 the fuses closest to the fire source detect this situation that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.310
 the temperature rises sharply 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.230
 for excess temperature one of the possible the short which causes the 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.190
 Fuse cut detector sends an electrical signal to the central 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.420
 smart 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.750
 the control panel immediately sends electrical signals to perform the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.200
 cuts of electric power and gas of the protected sector to avoid other 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.330
 incidents 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.910
 an instant later the intelligent central activates the agent's exit 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.120
 extinguisher towards the extinguishing mouths 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.680
 the extinguishing agent moves through the pipe discharging through the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.710
 nozzles vaporized hours on top of the artifacts 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.230
 the inside of the bell 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.230
 and the pipeline at the exit of the latter 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.540
 the extinguishing agent in the form of a spray quickly suffocates the sinister 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.540
 preventing occurrence king missions 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:25.120
 melissa mckean's specialized staff saw the damaged fuses reset 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.909
 the smart central and proceed to recharge the extinguishing agent 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.029
 thank you very much for your time and remember melissa rally genie day this is your 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:40.779
 willingness to provide you with the most appropriate solution tailored to your 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:45.729
 needs do not hesitate to ask us your question we will respond as soon as possible 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.089
 again thank you very much
