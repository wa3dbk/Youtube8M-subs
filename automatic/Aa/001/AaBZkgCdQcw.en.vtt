look<00:01:35.880> at<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.030> before<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.659> actually<00:01:36.840> plug<00:01:37.290> it

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
look at that before you actually plug it

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.069 
look at that before you actually plug it
in<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.189> base<00:01:38.430> does<00:01:38.970> feature<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.720> rubber

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
in the base does feature this rubber

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.039 
in the base does feature this rubber
rise<00:01:40.799> bottom<00:01:41.310> that's<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.060> keep<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.840> in

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
rise bottom that's going to keep it in

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.429 
rise bottom that's going to keep it in
place<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.939> put<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.780> my<00:01:46.020> desk<00:01:46.290> here

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
place so if I put it in on my desk here

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.010 
place so if I put it in on my desk here
and<00:01:46.740> I'll<00:01:46.799> flip<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.040> around<00:01:47.540> it's<00:01:48.540> not<00:01:48.750> easy

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and I'll flip this around it's not easy

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.710 
and I'll flip this around it's not easy
to<00:01:49.259> move<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.280> place<00:01:50.610> an<00:01:51.149> item<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.509> here

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
to move so if you place an item on here

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.420 
to move so if you place an item on here
to<00:01:51.810> charge<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.560> not<00:01:52.740> going<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.070> skipping

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
to charge it's not going to be skipping

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.010 
to charge it's not going to be skipping
left<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.759> right<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.570> see<00:01:54.659> it's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
left to right and you can see it's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.020 
left to right and you can see it's
pretty<00:01:55.290> small<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.159> what<00:01:56.670> we're<00:01:56.759> going<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.939> do

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
pretty small so what we're going to do

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.609 
pretty small so what we're going to do
now<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.360> we're<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> take<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.869> phone<00:01:58.200> put

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
now is we're going to take a phone put

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.350 
now is we're going to take a phone put
it<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.799> top<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.250> will<00:01:59.549> take<00:01:59.729> also<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.119> moto

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
it on top of it will take also a moto

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.090 
it on top of it will take also a moto
360<00:02:00.840> watch<00:02:01.020> put<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.469> top<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.920> can

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
360 watch put it on top of it so you can

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.399 
360 watch put it on top of it so you can
see<00:02:02.250> how<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.969> Qi<00:02:03.360> charging<00:02:03.630> technology<00:02:03.840> works

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
see how the Qi charging technology works

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.899 
see how the Qi charging technology works
and<00:02:04.590> how<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.710> works<00:02:04.950> across<00:02:05.310> multiple<00:02:05.610> devices

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
and how it works across multiple devices

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.850 
and how it works across multiple devices
and<00:02:06.420> we're<00:02:06.869> also<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.320> take<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> look<00:02:07.680> at

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
and we're also going to take a look at

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.290 
and we're also going to take a look at
the<00:02:07.979> illumination<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.670> how<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.970> works<00:02:09.149> as

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the illumination and how that works as

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.240 
the illumination and how that works as
well<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:10.379> demonstration<00:02:10.590> we're<00:02:11.129> going

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
well for this demonstration we're going

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.100 
well for this demonstration we're going
to<00:02:11.340> take<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.670> Moto<00:02:11.849> 360

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
