00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.800
 and then everyone is well max new here with 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.910
 We're going to make a video talking about 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.450
 two things 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:26.770
 basically equipment but not win 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.390
 equipment and give winning equipment 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.030
 the equipment has to do with the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.520
 guitarist and cd 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.350
 the equipment has to do with the company 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.960
 Let's see the part of the guitarist. 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.629
 first a guitarist who already has a name 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.260
 in the market it is already famous to have work 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.340
 is that it really has 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.660
 need to be winning 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.690
 equipment 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.210
 on the other hand a guitarist who is 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.850
 beginning and has a potential but still 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.899
 has not been discovered or does it have some type 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.950
 of fear is in jail has not yet surfaced 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:06.880
 I really committed to cash in the market, right? 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:11.470
 he really needs the equipment there 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.240
 for him to use as he is as a decoy 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.869
 there for his name 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.869
 so let's see the part of the company now 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:25.840
 the company which is already established in 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.619
 market already has a name made a lot 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.619
 enough 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:34.650
 she is already established and what she 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:38.860
 can do it she can donate the equipment 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:43.270
 in case a guy who is starting right? 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:47.380
 queta supporting the Convention tip foot 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.259
 would be a way for her to do the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.560
 her name appears on this 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.079
 go get it will help the new talent right 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.210
 when would she start working with him? 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.040
 It's going to be a new name, there's already a lot of people. 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.439
 who will want to look because they do not know 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.369
 will not be tired of those same ones 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.119
 names 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:10.500
 and something else the company also does not 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:14.200
 you need to be giving the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.870
 equipment is, after all, a company in 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.389
 she has to make a profit and she 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.680
 will not be giving your products to the 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:24.120
 So what happens there in the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.620
 world 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.280
 Okay, let's see the win part. 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.770
 equipment will be that the musician really 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.560
 There are a lot of people who complain because 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.490
 asks things in the company the company does not give 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.570
 does the musician really have done everything 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:46.090
 to deserve this equipment and he 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.700
 work as an endorsement of the company 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.380
 has he done everything possible that 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.390
 it could be the one that already reaches a 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.720
 certain level 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.550
 to be recognized and the company 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.390
 wanted to work with and talk look take 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.370
 this guy really worth it is the time 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.470
 now also the following let's see a 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.380
 the other side from the company side 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.020
 equipment 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.170
 everyone knows that for you to rent a 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.910
 any space today in the media in magazine 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.620
 in our case the guitarist has no 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.470
 program for this has a program of 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.610
 music then the ad serving 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.830
 are in physical media as well as 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.550
 this kind of thing 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.340
 will be that a space in a 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.180
 students to put a girl on a page is 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.990
 cheap is not 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.930
 now if you arrive and start the company 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.820
 start working hard with the 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.010
 new guitarist she thinks goes 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.350
 It's worth it, the guy is pumping in the 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.910
 youtube bombing on facebook 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:58.690
 It really is where everything is today. 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.830
 no one else on television is not like 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.810
 in the old days 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.460
 It is logical that television remains the 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:09.370
 vehicle of greater distribution of 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:12.040
 marketing plus youtube today 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.740
 It's practically beating this is you and 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.600
 You do not want to be the one. 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.790
 guitarist who has a stolen 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.160
 youtube that has a an amount 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.000
 huge page crash on facebook 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.720
 would the company not be cheaper? 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.760
 You got to focus on that and my guys 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.920
 his equipment for him 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.800
 would it not be cheaper than 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.130
 she places an ad in a magazine and 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.920
 pay a bunch of people you think 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.280
 about it right because what happens to 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.550
 asks why there is a mini right of 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.570
 guitarist think they have to win 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.300
 company stuff 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.330
 They find that the company has to arrive and 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.580
 intimidate me ask your wants I want 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.760
 mercilessly person who confuses two with 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.100
 gain product and also have want to have 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.740
 companies do not get their hands on that 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.080
 kind of people and think they do not have 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.300
 open the doors so nobody thinks you have 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.190
 than working with the same person as 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.080
 is there working years that is already 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.300
 with the endorsement of a certain other 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.070
 brand but the company will be filling the 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.380
 Car bag for him to change because 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.960
 it was only bet on the head 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.570
 same people - artists 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.060
 So what do you guys think could be? 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.510
 a middle ground in this scheme there 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.360
 between the part of gaining equipment and 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:39.910
 part of cb equipment or again 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:43.660
 apart from the musician and the company part 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:46.450
 What do you think we are going to give a 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.920
 Rain 10 response that is generated 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.780
 a matter that really goes through the 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.280
 everyone's head already 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.440
 thought about it 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.660
