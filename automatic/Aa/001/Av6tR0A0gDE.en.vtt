00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.569
 second half 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.389
 but no no no here you need to drive the frame 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:43.359

 made it just a monster monster well done 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.919

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.880
 I now have a forward and throw it 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.509
 passes well it should run faster to 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.699
 this sword 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:11.710
 Ah moment , it's still up to 78 minutes and another 20

 Well, it was necessary to finish this yes this 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:35.540
 caste foreshadowed a good fellow David luis 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.360

 the gate badly finished them 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:57.620
 No, but this tour just annoys me 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.630
 much what is not so british defense i 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.550
 I do not understand why not such a gap one 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.690
 minute the arbitrator added one long on 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:10.610
 nobody wants to run this house for a minute 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:14.030
 site well the whole whistle guys whistle 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.930

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:21.470

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:23.650

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.330
 bitch 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.880
 statistics look at statistics 11 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.210
 only five shots on goal 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:35.650
 absolutely smooth game absolutely full 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:39.770
 let's go to the second half 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.780
 Well, no, no, Chinese casting is simple 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:47.470
 I am annoyed by such Salske cues and 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:50.810
 casts but no that jumps fuh well 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:54.070
 let's run she is not or who is this 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:58.160
 it is generally not clear who it does not matter 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:00.620
 break guys and it's all moving 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:05.750
 to kick and because not a single blow 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:09.260
 not yet done turn 61 dangerous 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:12.610

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.610
