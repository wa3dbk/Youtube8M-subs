00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.020
 the vehicle is on the move 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.170
 the best 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.240
 Tire damage the tender or Altersberger excitement so the car 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.609
 at least 1 percent 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.609
 We want a crisis in Europe and lose it 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.149
 how useful 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.609
 St 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.720
 Pröll sees the company is involved in a role 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.770
 the disk was Bryant just but not that in the real world either 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.190
 Aggressiveness of Allan McNish 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.490
 They hope that it went well in the tire piles 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.120
 a beaten course has not looked like the safety for you 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.430
 Car is out logically her e10 car not relocated 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.760
 yes this is not this important game between GC and prototypes 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.980
 the Ferrari has closed "the principle of the North Sea 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.130
 existing gap 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.960
 Roth uses the liquidator ac3 will report 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 led by the prince couple unfortunately in a different direction 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.860
 catapulted as he wanted to drive unmanageable heavy impact in the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.330
 tire wall 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.450
 and hope that there neither the spectators nor the photographer and also 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.990
 if he did nothing 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.690
 because the fly some parts more 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.750
 As I said it was really fierce but through the tire piles and the 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.200
 Safety of the vehicles 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.859
 hope that Helmut Willms 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.990
 while Ferrari had sat Anthony Beltoise 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.840
 yes I think I could not see him in the rearview mirror you can see 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.980
 probably only 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.530
 a car 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.990
 curiously both seen more canteens one Audi do not see the other 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.710
 12 Sébastien Loeb from Wernigerode moved in and can race me though 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.140
 Guess he did not think that part of the north shore you can he could 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.470
 Do not even see what the soft tops of the car were better in between 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.470
 nervous and falling frightened faces at the 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.920
 of course there is what is built there is waiting for it 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.030
 thank goodness shaken certainly 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.620
 speaks for the safety of the vehicles, thank God, absolutely great 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.569
 moving moments on the return of Ulrich w 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.789
 that was looked violent 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.479
 Britta we have not seen such an accident for many years 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.149
 I have to say application so 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.579
 more violent than quick-witted 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.529
 Gabriel I say I am not so relieved or even afraid 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.180
 calms the world that is seen there but there is a lot of involvement just about the floral 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:33.019
 Downsizing the viewers committed that it is definitely towards photographers 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.459
 Mule-post I did not even know that everybody else really did 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.739
 this hummer is not affected by this is also very good 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.759
 but in the end nothing happens but a recognized one is the hail 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.099
 got really bad with the bike which flown in after one 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.189
 so that he already 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.069
 an ugly thing that did not come out well 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.099
 that was almost from both of today's security standards 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.429
 But expect such a horror impact but the big question is something he is 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:59.289
 happened behind the guardrail 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.889
 further show
