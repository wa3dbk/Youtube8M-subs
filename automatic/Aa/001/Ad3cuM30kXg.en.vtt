00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
now we know exactly the height for

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.740 
now we know exactly the height for
putting<00:00:37.410> our<00:00:37.530> screws<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> wall<00:00:38.660> now<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
other side it has these little pins that

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.119 
other side it has these little pins that
are<00:00:41.700> going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.940> make<00:00:42.120> our<00:00:42.239> marks<00:00:42.770> for<00:00:43.770> our

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
are going to make our marks for our

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.700 
are going to make our marks for our
screws<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.210> now<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> built<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.350> level

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710

I<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.640> prefer<00:01:08.790> these<00:01:09.150> self-tapping<00:01:09.930> wall

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
I really prefer these self-tapping wall

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.320 
I really prefer these self-tapping wall
anchors<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.100> wall<00:01:11.340> anchor<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.150> if

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330

actually each one of these are going to
carry<00:01:16.049> 50<00:01:16.470> pounds<00:01:16.920> they're<00:01:17.460> very<00:01:17.790> easy<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.420> put

into<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> wall<00:01:19.250> we're<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.549> give

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
into the wall we're just going to give

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.109 
into the wall we're just going to give
it<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.850> little<00:01:21.030> tap<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.009> start<00:01:23.009> turning<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
it a little tap and start turning and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.539 
it a little tap and start turning and
it's<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.110> embed<00:01:25.619> itself<00:01:25.799> into<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
it's going to embed itself into the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.630 
it's going to embed itself into the
drywall<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:28.350> easy<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.100> that's<00:01:29.430> going<00:01:29.579> to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
drywall that easy and that's going to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.840 
drywall that easy and that's going to
carry<00:01:29.850> 50<00:01:30.329> pounds<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:30.810> very<00:01:31.229> easy<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:32.520> install

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
carry 50 pounds so very easy to install

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:43.060 
carry 50 pounds so very easy to install
this<00:01:33.060> type<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.329> anchor

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.529 

and<00:01:44.070> now<00:01:44.250> we're<00:01:44.429> just<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.939> put<00:01:45.179> in<00:01:45.359> a

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
and now we're just going to put in a

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.499 
and now we're just going to put in a
couple<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.899> screws<00:01:46.289> and<00:01:47.000> leave<00:01:48.000> about<00:01:48.179> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
couple of screws and leave about a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.630 
couple of screws and leave about a
quarter<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.380> an<00:01:49.590> inch<00:01:49.710> or<00:01:50.039> maybe<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.340> little

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
quarter of an inch or maybe a little

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.270 
quarter of an inch or maybe a little
less<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:51.780> slide<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.979> bracket

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
less so that we can slide the bracket

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:03.760 
less so that we can slide the bracket
right<00:01:53.820> into

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.740 

so<00:02:04.340> then<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:04.520> just<00:02:04.640> snap<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.240> mirror<00:02:05.540> right

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
so then I just snap the mirror right

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.630 
so then I just snap the mirror right
into<00:02:06.049> those<00:02:06.170> screws<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.280> just<00:02:07.460> does<00:02:07.610> a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
into those screws and it just does a
