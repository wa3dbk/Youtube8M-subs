we're going to continue constructing
that<00:00:05.580> space<00:00:05.850> station<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:07.639> believe<00:00:08.639> there<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.150> no

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
that space station I believe there is no

that space station I believe there is no
new<00:00:09.540> crew<00:00:09.780> members<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.230> time<00:00:10.469> but<00:00:10.860> because

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
new crew members this time but because

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.700 
new crew members this time but because
this<00:00:11.910> game<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.330> jackass<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:13.170> now<00:00:13.290> have<00:00:13.410> five

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
this game is a jackass you now have five

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.420 
this game is a jackass you now have five
less<00:00:13.950> seconds<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.429> do<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:16.340> really<00:00:17.340> have

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
less seconds to do it in I really have

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.800 
less seconds to do it in I really have
no<00:00:17.550> idea<00:00:17.580> why<00:00:17.940> they<00:00:18.029> helped<00:00:18.240> me<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.570> that

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.089 

this<00:00:24.810> might<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.410> first<00:00:25.439> time<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.800> screw

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
this might be the first time I screw

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.070 
this might be the first time I screw
this<00:00:26.160> up<00:00:27.920> that<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.220> don't<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.720> didn't<00:00:30.990> do

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
this up that I don't that I didn't do

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.450 
this up that I don't that I didn't do
something<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.380> obviously<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.219> up<00:00:32.279> i

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
something that obviously it up i

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.560 
something that obviously it up i
mean<00:00:33.230> aside<00:00:34.230> from<00:00:34.410> my<00:00:34.790> sort<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.880> failures<00:00:36.329> it's

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
mean aside from my sort of failures it's

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:45.730 
mean aside from my sort of failures it's
stopping<00:00:36.780> at<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> right<00:00:37.200> level

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.260 

you<00:00:46.250> have<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.400> be<00:00:46.490> extra<00:00:46.790> careful<00:00:46.940> with<00:00:47.210> these

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
you have to be extra careful with these

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.870 
you have to be extra careful with these
blue<00:00:47.510> things<00:00:47.740> the<00:00:48.740> time<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.160> waste<00:00:49.430> sitting

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
blue things the time you waste sitting

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.490 
blue things the time you waste sitting
and<00:00:50.000> waiting<00:00:50.150> for<00:00:50.510> it<00:00:50.600> is<00:00:50.660> definitely<00:00:50.900> Leslie

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
and waiting for it is definitely Leslie

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.870 
and waiting for it is definitely Leslie
a<00:00:51.530> time<00:00:51.950> that<00:00:52.130> gets<00:00:52.250> wasted<00:00:52.400> by<00:00:52.640> getting

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
a time that gets wasted by getting

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.170 
a time that gets wasted by getting
knocked<00:00:53.060> backwards

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.550 

you<00:00:58.660> know<00:00:58.720> I<00:00:58.780> didn't<00:00:59.020> realize<00:00:59.320> that<00:00:59.350> they're

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
you know I didn't realize that they're

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.930 
you know I didn't realize that they're
all<00:00:59.650> carrying<00:00:59.860> their<00:01:00.070> world<00:01:00.220> toolboxes<00:01:00.820> with

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
all carrying their world toolboxes with

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.790 
all carrying their world toolboxes with
them

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.410 

I<00:01:04.920> think<00:01:05.550> I<00:01:05.610> should<00:01:05.730> have<00:01:05.820> enough<00:01:05.940> time<00:01:06.060> this

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
I think I should have enough time this

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.490 
I think I should have enough time this
is<00:01:06.540> gonna<00:01:06.660> be<00:01:06.750> close<00:01:06.900> though

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500 

and<00:01:11.070> yes<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.370> you<00:01:11.400> aren't<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.120> shuttle<00:01:12.390> by

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and yes if you aren't in the shuttle by

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.590 
and yes if you aren't in the shuttle by
the<00:01:12.570> time<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> thing<00:01:13.050> ends<00:01:13.230> you<00:01:13.410> lose<00:01:14.600> no

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the time the thing ends you lose no

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.360 
the time the thing ends you lose no
matter<00:01:15.750> how<00:01:15.990> close<00:01:16.260> it<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.920> are<00:01:17.010> not<00:01:17.130> in

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
matter how close it is if you are not in

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.580 
matter how close it is if you are not in
there<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.910> it<00:01:18.030> yeah<00:01:18.990> pretty<00:01:19.290> sure<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
there that is it yeah pretty sure the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.640 
there that is it yeah pretty sure the
engineer<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> last<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.370> we<00:01:20.430> gotta<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.790> oh

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
engineer is the last one we gotta get oh

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.110 
engineer is the last one we gotta get oh
man<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.800> is<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.010> to<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.190> really<00:01:23.640> close<00:01:23.820> I

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
man this is going to be really close I

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:32.090 
man this is going to be really close I
might<00:01:24.990> not<00:01:25.110> make<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:28.310> ten<00:01:29.310> seconds

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.620 

I'm<00:01:32.640> assuming<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.180> don't<00:01:33.330> get<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.510> there

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
I'm assuming if you don't get in there

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.820 
I'm assuming if you don't get in there
they<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.900> launched<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.229> shuttle<00:01:34.500> value

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
they just launched the shuttle value

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.760 
they just launched the shuttle value
because<00:01:35.070> that's<00:01:35.220> how<00:01:35.280> NASA<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:36.409> three<00:01:37.409> seconds

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
because that's how NASA is three seconds

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.260 
because that's how NASA is three seconds
ago<00:01:38.009> nice<00:01:41.600> ok<00:01:42.770> back<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.799> once<00:01:44.400> again<00:01:44.520> something

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
ago nice ok back to once again something

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.490 
ago nice ok back to once again something
with<00:01:45.479> nothing<00:01:45.810> different<00:01:45.960> because<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.320> don't

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
with nothing different because I don't

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.080 
with nothing different because I don't
think<00:01:46.680> these<00:01:46.799> either<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.430> these<00:01:47.490> change<00:01:47.820> ever

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
think these either of these change ever

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.300 
think these either of these change ever
again<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.350> only<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.619> one<00:01:52.799> new<00:01:52.979> mission

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
again and we only have one new mission

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.070 
again and we only have one new mission
type

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.290 

so<00:01:59.710> let's<00:02:00.040> just<00:02:00.250> see<00:02:00.400> if<00:02:00.430> we<00:02:00.520> can<00:02:00.640> slog<00:02:01.030> our<00:02:01.210> way

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
so let's just see if we can slog our way

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.040 
so let's just see if we can slog our way
through<00:02:01.480> the<00:02:01.600> rest<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:01.930> crap<00:02:02.230> fest

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.480 

it's<00:02:08.590> kind<00:02:08.740> of<00:02:08.800> sad<00:02:08.950> when<00:02:09.010> the<00:02:09.220> only<00:02:09.310> thing

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
it's kind of sad when the only thing

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.800 
it's kind of sad when the only thing
your<00:02:09.610> game<00:02:09.760> has<00:02:09.910> going<00:02:10.240> for<00:02:10.270> it<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.570> that<00:02:10.690> it's

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
your game has going for it is that it's

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.900 
your game has going for it is that it's
short

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
short

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.460 
short
and<00:02:13.390> kind<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.690> interesting<00:02:14.110> for<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.290> first

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
and kind of interesting for the first

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.950 
and kind of interesting for the first
couple<00:02:14.620> levels<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:16.210> I<00:02:16.330> really<00:02:16.570> got<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.720> admit

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
couple levels and I really got to admit

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.150 
couple levels and I really got to admit
if<00:02:17.080> they<00:02:17.200> got<00:02:17.380> rid<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:17.770> retarded

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
if they got rid of this retarded

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.830 
if they got rid of this retarded
tracking<00:02:18.820> thing<00:02:21.090> these<00:02:22.090> later<00:02:22.330> levels<00:02:22.540> would

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
tracking thing these later levels would

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.210 
tracking thing these later levels would
not<00:02:23.020> be<00:02:23.200> quite<00:02:23.560> as<00:02:23.620> bad<00:02:23.980> but<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:25.270> one<00:02:25.630> event

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
not be quite as bad but this one event

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.670 
not be quite as bad but this one event
is<00:02:27.220> why<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.600> always<00:02:28.810> end<00:02:29.080> up<00:02:29.110> being<00:02:29.350> like<00:02:29.470> I

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
is why I always end up being like I

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.490 
is why I always end up being like I
can't<00:02:29.950> play<00:02:30.130> this<00:02:30.280> game<00:02:30.460> anymore<00:02:30.640> right<00:02:31.330> now

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
can't play this game anymore right now

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.690 
can't play this game anymore right now
because<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.620> just<00:02:32.680> takes<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.490> long

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
because it just takes so long

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.280 
because it just takes so long
and<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.390> pointless<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:38.020> really

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
and is so pointless that I just really

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:46.020 
and is so pointless that I just really
don't<00:02:38.410> get<00:02:38.620> it

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.120 

everything<00:02:46.810> else<00:02:46.959> in<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.200> game<00:02:47.319> is<00:02:47.560> at<00:02:47.920> least

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
everything else in the game is at least

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.460 
everything else in the game is at least
somewhat<00:02:48.790> moderately<00:02:49.480> paced<00:02:49.690> if<00:02:49.959> not<00:02:50.110> fast

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
somewhat moderately paced if not fast

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.010 
somewhat moderately paced if not fast
but<00:02:51.240> this

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
but this

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.600 
but this
this<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.740> just<00:02:54.920> kind<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.160> here

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.610 

this<00:03:02.240> is<00:03:02.390> a<00:03:02.420> little<00:03:02.860> slow<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.010> obnoxious<00:03:04.490> to

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
this is a little slow and obnoxious to

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.330 
this is a little slow and obnoxious to
just<00:03:06.620> because<00:03:06.830> you<00:03:06.890> have<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.130> wait<00:03:07.310> for<00:03:07.340> it

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.190 

ways<00:03:11.030> because<00:03:11.269> i<00:03:11.360> had<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.599> way<00:03:11.690> for<00:03:11.930> cuz<00:03:12.110> i'm

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
ways because i had the way for cuz i'm

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.330 
ways because i had the way for cuz i'm
nowhere<00:03:12.379> near<00:03:12.530> good<00:03:12.830> enough<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.129> get<00:03:13.250> it

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
nowhere near good enough to get it

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.830 
nowhere near good enough to get it
through<00:03:13.370> their<00:03:13.519> ways<00:03:13.790> move<00:03:13.970> it<00:03:14.060> quickly

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.750 

even<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.590> slightest<00:03:20.010> amount<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.310> incidental

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
even the slightest amount of incidental

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:30.690 
even the slightest amount of incidental
contact<00:03:21.239> with<00:03:21.360> those<00:03:21.480> wall<00:03:21.750> things<00:03:22.140> kills<00:03:22.530> you

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.160 

yeah<00:03:31.239> as<00:03:31.360> long<00:03:31.450> as<00:03:31.569> you<00:03:31.629> don't<00:03:31.780> screw<00:03:31.959> up<00:03:31.989> too

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
yeah as long as you don't screw up too

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.570 
yeah as long as you don't screw up too
much<00:03:32.319> on<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.590> first<00:03:32.830> section<00:03:33.099> oh<00:03:33.310> yeah

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
much on the first section oh yeah

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.479 
much on the first section oh yeah
there's<00:03:33.730> something<00:03:33.910> gimbal<00:03:34.920> now<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:36.280> means

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
there's something gimbal now that means

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.009 
there's something gimbal now that means
but<00:03:36.849> it's<00:03:37.000> basically<00:03:37.150> ultimately<00:03:37.720> pressing

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
but it's basically ultimately pressing

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.330 
but it's basically ultimately pressing
the<00:03:38.080> ARB<00:03:38.349> buttons<00:03:38.830> while<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:39.099> beating<00:03:39.280> the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
the ARB buttons while is beating the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.720 
the ARB buttons while is beating the
white<00:03:39.489> blue<00:03:39.700> areas<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.400> guess<00:03:42.519> it<00:03:42.670> means

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
white blue areas so I guess it means

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:50.420 
white blue areas so I guess it means
ping<00:03:43.000> pong

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.990 

that<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.209> an<00:03:51.329> odd<00:03:51.450> pattern

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.090 

I<00:03:58.280> usually<00:03:59.280> screw<00:03:59.580> that<00:03:59.700> one<00:03:59.820> hop<00:03:59.940> to<00:03:59.970> oh<00:04:00.390> well

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
I usually screw that one hop to oh well

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.770 
I usually screw that one hop to oh well
seven<00:04:02.820> lives<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.180> darlin<00:04:03.480> six

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:16.289 

if<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.380> disagree<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:07.920> might<00:04:08.069> be<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.220> communist

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:36.070 

these<00:04:16.870> were<00:04:16.989> finally<00:04:17.289> almost<00:04:17.409> don't<00:04:17.739> air

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.689 

and<00:04:36.379> with<00:04:36.740> these<00:04:36.889> two<00:04:37.129> pretty<00:04:37.550> much

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
and with these two pretty much

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.730 
and with these two pretty much
impossible<00:04:37.849> screw<00:04:38.569> up<00:04:38.720> things<00:04:39.050> we<00:04:39.349> will<00:04:39.439> be<00:04:39.560> in

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
impossible screw up things we will be in

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.050 
impossible screw up things we will be in
space<00:04:40.039> and<00:04:40.310> ready<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.520> start<00:04:40.580> building<00:04:40.879> that

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
space and ready to start building that

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.670 
space and ready to start building that
settle<00:04:41.479> that<00:04:42.310> station<00:04:43.310> again<00:04:44.349> no<00:04:45.349> like<00:04:45.530> you

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
settle that station again no like you

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:59.430 
settle that station again no like you
going<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:45.949> say<00:04:46.069> shuttle

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.370 

ok<00:05:00.220> now<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.460> major<00:05:00.730> change<00:05:01.210> in<00:05:01.750> this<00:05:02.110> mission

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
ok now the major change in this mission

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.120 
ok now the major change in this mission
between<00:05:02.770> this<00:05:03.130> one<00:05:03.370> is<00:05:03.520> former<00:05:04.000> counterpart

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
between this one is former counterpart

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.150 
between this one is former counterpart
is<00:05:06.130> that<00:05:06.460> your<00:05:06.580> underwear<00:05:06.910> the<00:05:07.150> last<00:05:07.950> block<00:05:08.950> we

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
is that your underwear the last block we

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.360 
is that your underwear the last block we
placed<00:05:09.400> was<00:05:09.640> last<00:05:09.970> time<00:05:10.240> all<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.980> blocks<00:05:12.190> and

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
placed was last time all the blocks and

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.310 
placed was last time all the blocks and
this<00:05:12.460> one<00:05:12.610> are<00:05:12.640> past<00:05:12.910> that<00:05:13.090> point<00:05:13.300> so<00:05:14.230> the

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
this one are past that point so the

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.380 
this one are past that point so the
mission<00:05:14.590> takes<00:05:14.710> like<00:05:14.980> twice<00:05:15.220> as<00:05:15.400> long<00:05:15.580> isn't

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
mission takes like twice as long isn't

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.680 
mission takes like twice as long isn't
that<00:05:16.420> great<00:05:16.510> and<00:05:17.880> there's<00:05:18.880> way<00:05:19.060> more<00:05:19.090> stuff<00:05:19.330> to

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
that great and there's way more stuff to

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.880 
that great and there's way more stuff to
dodge<00:05:21.510> I'm<00:05:22.510> going<00:05:22.780> to<00:05:22.840> save<00:05:23.110> after<00:05:23.350> each<00:05:23.530> block

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
dodge I'm going to save after each block

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.030 
dodge I'm going to save after each block
placed<00:05:24.280> this<00:05:24.550> time<00:05:24.790> just<00:05:25.030> because<00:05:25.830> it<00:05:26.830> takes

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040

long enough as it is without having to
restart<00:05:32.320> a<00:05:32.440> trip<00:05:32.680> because<00:05:32.920> you<00:05:32.950> got<00:05:33.100> pegged<00:05:33.490> by

transitions really don't help but you've

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.710 
transitions really don't help but you've
got<00:05:44.560> another<00:05:44.860> tube<00:05:45.220> here<00:05:45.640> for<00:05:45.970> oxygen<00:05:46.600> which

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
got another tube here for oxygen which

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.410 
got another tube here for oxygen which
is<00:05:46.810> really<00:05:46.990> helpful<00:05:47.230> for<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:48.640> blocks<00:05:48.850> go<00:05:49.090> here

is really helpful for the blocks go here

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.090 
is really helpful for the blocks go here
but<00:05:49.780> we<00:05:49.870> have<00:05:49.990> six<00:05:50.290> this<00:05:50.440> time<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:50.920> two<00:05:50.980> of

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
oh did keep my one okay so you could use

oh did keep my one okay so you could use
that<00:06:48.800> as<00:06:48.860> a<00:06:48.919> shortcut<00:06:49.250> but<00:06:49.610> you're<00:06:49.729> going<00:06:49.819> to

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:49.879 
that as a shortcut but you're going to

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:55.749 
that as a shortcut but you're going to
need<00:06:50.060> the<00:06:50.180> lives<00:06:53.979> as<00:06:54.979> the<00:06:55.190> next<00:06:55.430> mission

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 
need the lives as the next mission

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:59.050 
need the lives as the next mission
exactly<00:06:56.449> a<00:06:56.479> little<00:06:56.690> tough<00:06:56.900> and<00:06:57.699> then<00:06:58.699> the<00:06:58.909> last

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
exactly a little tough and then the last

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:05.350 
exactly a little tough and then the last
mission<00:06:59.419> is<00:06:59.870> just<00:07:00.169> a<00:07:00.259> slog<00:07:04.030> kind<00:07:05.030> of<00:07:05.120> painful

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 
mission is just a slog kind of painful

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.390 
mission is just a slog kind of painful
what<00:07:05.659> about

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.370

soon we will be able to go through the

soon we will be able to go through the
