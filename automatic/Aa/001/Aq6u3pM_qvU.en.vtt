00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.040
 hello everyone this time i'm going 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.510
 introduce you to a special motorcycle backpack 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.389
 not quite like the others 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.870
 guaranteed 100% waterproof with a capacity of 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.300
 20 liters 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.300
 this is the easybag by your bike 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.270
 this model is simple but 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.470
 effective one finds there December who 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.720
 allow to hang luggage 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.820
 additional reflective logos 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.820
 one elastic and three outer pockets 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.180
 it is made of pvc canvas waxing 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.070
 seams are heat welded and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.320
 guarantee a real tightness 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.180
 the zip fastening of the outer pockets 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.129
 are protected and closing the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.300
 main pocket is made by a flap 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.300
 that we will roll on itself 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.010
 side face we find the clips 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.960
 necessary to close the pocket 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.700
 main and a pretty handle 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.210
 succinct but sufficient given the volume 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.490
 of the bag 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.350
 the straps are ergonomically wide and 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.729
 padded just like the back plate 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.729
 which promises a good comfort 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.850
 for storage the 20 liters of 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.689
 capacity are good for use 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.659
 daily 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.710
 a laptop pc passes without problem the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.539
 main pocket is not 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.180
 compartmentalized effect a little bit stuffed 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.770
 all of a sudden a little filled the cup and 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:52.319
 the material allow a good implementation 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:53.970
 bag shape for closing 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.220
 just roll the flap on him 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.380
 even on a few turns then to clip 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.030
 the two loops at the back do not need 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.799
 do not forget to extend it well 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.170
 easy and fast but above all that 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.250
 really guarantees tightness and allows 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.250
 to keep things dry 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.060
 once the bag closed the three small 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.800
 outer pockets remain accessible 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.050
 the plant is not waterproof at all 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.570
 because the son is perforated to reserve for 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.220
 weather clemency the two small lateral 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.130
 are not 100% waterproof but well 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.970
 protected with less capacity to book 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.970
 keys for example 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.940
 overall the bag exudes quality 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.370
 the seams are well finished it smells 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.930
 robustness I just regret that there 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.380
 have no belt to accompany 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.390
 braces 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.030
 we will see the used if it's disabling 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.680
 or not a small zipped compartment or 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.360
 separated inside the pocket 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.440
 main would have been a more equally 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.000
 although I do not doubt that they are 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.440
 waterproof I confess that I'm not 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.030
 necessarily in a hurry to check it 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.030
 finally to follow
