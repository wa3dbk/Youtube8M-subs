00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.370
 he greets everyone is in quarters 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.740
 77 is today December 9 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.410
 2013 to discover together a 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.510
 new particular door of rice from 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.050
 christmas minecraft listening to them and I support 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.990
 on the button 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.980
 here is our calendar and not December 9 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.260
 it's here japy is today 9 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.070
 December we'll see simplifier 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.660
 of commands pretty well that's really it 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.500
 a nice machine you will see I have 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.730
 invented so that's something where in 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.329
 made a block command who who suffered from 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.739
 little of the little things that makes that 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.170
 his wife his son and how then this is 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.670
 very simple for example if I do not want to 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.789
 get apples 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.180
 I did not type that gives apple I 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.680
 will say but noted get two apples 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.500
 see like these here and there I press on 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.540
 the button you see that gives me two 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.689
 apples it's convenient not of course 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.040
 as long as the order is there I can I 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.580
 can still get apples etc 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.790
 another example if I want to go over 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.650
 quickly so that is the green square 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.820
 dropped by the idea said I have not 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.590
 how much speed 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.540
 I can just noted going faster and the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.790
 command block will understand me and 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.680
 here he is going to give me speed 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.090
 so he did not give very long 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.490
 but could it still be when 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.770
 even nice an argument that's enough 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.540
 nice and then one last thing I know 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.829
 I do not have any equipment on me 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.150
 want to equip me with a john note 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.649
 complete equipment or complete flock 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.799
 in lyon we will take equipment 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.560
 complete I press and here I get my 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.750
 complete equipment that's so it's 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.350
 rather nice I do not know what 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.040
 what do you think 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.659
 of course behind that it's a little bit 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.219
 more complex that is to say that the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.380
 how I was a little preconfigured 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.719
 that is, if there I note I know 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.960
 not get a carrot 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.390
 it's actually going 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.090
 not exactly a market like you 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.940
 can see him giving away orders that are 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.230
 pre pre recorded somehow and 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.150
 so via that the three commands that 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.670
 I noted there in this case kiki market 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.890
 but the trick and is pretty cool when 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.330
 even I wanted to show when I support 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.860
 actually on the button here so it's not 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.840
 not directly connected to block commands 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.690
 precisely because this block command 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.690
 in fact it did not happen to him who is going 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.760
 play the command directly 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.470
 when I press this on this button it 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.420
 assets this reston line and in 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.310
 function actually it's going to make play the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.570
 strong block tests and depending on what 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.269
 I will have marked in the how of blocks 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.970
 he's going to see a commando that so different 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.850
 which will activate so for example here 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.190
 you see I test I test strong so 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.769
 the coordinates of the block command that is 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.820
 here so I'm testing for a blog command 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:03.010
 from hawaii island five 0 0 we do not care 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.320
 is here days but braces and I note 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.840
 two point commands and between 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.959
 quotation marks I write my order 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.700
 my custom order so here java 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.980
 you see getting two apples but if 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.720
 for example I wrote get two 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.040
 apples 101-100 s like these were seeing 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.630
 that it does not give me anything it takes 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.510
 really it's exactly written 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.540
 like like in the test for if i 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.540
 add here can be here 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.910
 see it got activated suddenly when 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.750
 it turns on and it gives us here 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.400
 two apples guy bass varo to apple 2 la 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.100
 command that really make typing for 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.810
 to have two apples so voila and then the 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.579
 principle is like this for everyone so here 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.380
 we have the order go faster if we have 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.269
 orders and that it misses one pays what 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.500
 is nice behind that you are not 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.579
 not obliged to put a single command 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.769
 blog you see for the equipment 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.480
 full beige and a guide of armor and 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.790
 so it's m 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.959
 it's pretty cool so maybe there 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.090
 who are wondering by level why 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.070
 there is a module a bit complicated as 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.760
 this in fact it's very simple it's a 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.700
 little door 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.989
 andy if it is useful why not this 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.140
 that you will see that if I withdraw it 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.730
 if I put 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:20.130
 come on come we could imagine 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:22.230
 something like that so you see 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.650
 here i get pocket just do not 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.720
 To put myself 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.000
 I hope a fake orders for you 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.350
 show that you see the room acts 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.780
 and where and how tomorrow I put the real 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.950
 order so the apple g8 in my 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.780
 inventory i'm going all out 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.910
 for you see well I support it works 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.410
 it gives me two apples but when I 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.210
 will support me see then there is 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.770
 always the right order that does not 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.419
 give nothing anymore why because in 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.980
 does as you know it's a 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.190
 problem that those who use 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.650
 meeting orders often here this 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.070
 rest remains active and suddenly a 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.180
 time that we can not once have 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.669
 updated are ordered block the 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.080
 comparator is disabled and is basically 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.550
 it does not send a second impulse 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.830
 hanks and that's why I actually 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:09.570
 put that I imitate a little door like 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.370
 that with a reflector on a small 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.450
 port kill like that between that I 'm not going 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.660
 teach you how to make a carrier 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.070
 that's how this is like that 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.410
 if it stays active and we will always 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.530
 a second stream that will come from here and 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.930
 so he will come to validate the enough thing 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.390
 pretty simple then on fights the friends 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.800
 So is you showing the trick of this 9 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.440
 December we end up as usual 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.430
 tomorrow for a new tip left 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.430
 lease application
