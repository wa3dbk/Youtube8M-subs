00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
windshield mount and here you get a base

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.520 
windshield mount and here you get a base
plate<00:03:12.120> just<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.570> case<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.959> want<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.200> connect

plate just in case you want to connect

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.830 
plate just in case you want to connect
it<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.800> your<00:03:13.830> dashboard<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.940> then<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.570> also

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
it to your dashboard and then you also

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.420 
it to your dashboard and then you also
get<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:18.180> windshield<00:03:18.600> mount<00:03:18.810> itself<00:03:19.190> now<00:03:20.190> this

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
get the windshield mount itself now this

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.729 
get the windshield mount itself now this
is<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.820> suction<00:03:21.209> mount<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.840> then<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.560> has<00:03:22.709> a

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
is a suction mount and then it has a

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.350 
is a suction mount and then it has a
locking<00:03:23.040> mechanism<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:23.880> attach<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.180> to

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
locking mechanism so you attach it to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.300 
locking mechanism so you attach it to
your<00:03:24.450> window<00:03:24.600> screen<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.380> turn<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:25.920> then

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
your window screen you turn it and then

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.160 
your window screen you turn it and then
it<00:03:26.430> sticks<00:03:26.850> hard<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.450> it's<00:03:27.630> not<00:03:27.930> going<00:03:28.080> to

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
it sticks hard and it's not going to

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.960 
it sticks hard and it's not going to
fall<00:03:28.320> off<00:03:29.090> this<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.500> an<00:03:31.500> expandable<00:03:32.040> pace<00:03:32.370> so

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
fall off this is an expandable pace so

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.210 
fall off this is an expandable pace so
you<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.239> slide<00:03:33.540> pretty<00:03:34.200> much<00:03:34.320> any<00:03:34.590> device<00:03:34.980> in

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
you can slide pretty much any device in

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.410 
you can slide pretty much any device in
there<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:35.640> you're<00:03:35.790> not<00:03:35.880> gonna<00:03:36.000> have<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.239> change

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
there so you're not gonna have to change

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.540 
there so you're not gonna have to change
it<00:03:36.660> if<00:03:36.810> your<00:03:37.170> partner<00:03:37.650> or<00:03:37.950> your<00:03:38.010> friends<00:03:38.430> have

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
it if your partner or your friends have

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.550 
it if your partner or your friends have
a<00:03:38.580> different<00:03:39.090> device<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:40.200> know<00:03:40.320> this<00:03:40.530> is

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
a different device you know this is

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.229 
a different device you know this is
going<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.890> expand<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:41.550> will<00:03:41.670> fit<00:03:41.970> most

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
going to expand and it will fit most

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.620 
going to expand and it will fit most
devices<00:03:43.100> it<00:03:44.100> also<00:03:44.580> is<00:03:44.760> nice<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.390> works

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
devices it also is nice that it works

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.720 
devices it also is nice that it works
with<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.650> case<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.160> then<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:48.300> has<00:03:48.510> full<00:03:49.730> 360

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
with the case and then it has full 360

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.390 
with the case and then it has full 360
degree<00:03:51.150> rotation<00:03:51.600> so<00:03:52.260> very<00:03:52.650> very<00:03:52.739> nice<00:03:53.130> if

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
degree rotation so very very nice if

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.220 
degree rotation so very very nice if
you're<00:03:53.580> going<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.820> use<00:03:54.060> applications<00:03:55.019> like

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
you're going to use applications like

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.150 
you're going to use applications like
