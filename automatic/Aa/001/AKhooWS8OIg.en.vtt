00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 - We congratulate you! What do you think about this World Cup? 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 - It was very cool. We are both happy and very tired after a day of dancing. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 - You know, when you reach something like this, I mean the goal that we set earlier, this is fantastic. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 - Because you train your entire career to reach the title of World Champion and then you achieve it. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 - What do you think, which of your dances was the best today? 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 - What dance? 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 - Yes. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 - Probably quickstep. I liked the quickstep. The foxtrot was good too, tango. I dont know. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 - In one round, some dances seem to be better; in the other, something may change a little. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 - In tango you perform the movements of the Argentine tango. Do you take special lessons? 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 - Not really. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 - We try to show our best dance, but we do not have private lessons on Argentine tango. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 - But, of course, we are inspired by the show, we try to see some steps and repeat them in our activities, but this is not the same thing. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 - They have an open position, we do not. Therefore, some movements work, and some - no. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 - Perhaps, we will see in you more interesting movements that you invent yourself? 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 - We try to do a lot of different things, everything is constantly changing and sometimes I don’t even know what. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 - This sometimes happens on the floor, there are different situations. But it's fun and good practice too. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 - We are now in Kiev, in Ukraine. Did you try Ukrainian dishes, maybe borsch? 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 “No, this time, but we tried on a previous trip.” I do not really like soups. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 - In Denmark, too many soups, but I am not a fan of them. I love meat and potatoes, they are pretty good here. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 - Try lard! 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 - There are a lot of very tasty salads. Fat, lard, I'll try it! 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 - Thank you very much. We congratulate you once again and wish you all the best! 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 - Thank you bye.
