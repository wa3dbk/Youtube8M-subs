00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:10.750
 Mr. Hello, this time about the way it is passing the card in this way Shakapachi description 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:16.510
 I hope to do it 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.930
 First of all it is why I do shakapachi, but my phi pulls the card like this 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.350
 When 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.380
 Grade is 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:26.380
 It is 1 falling apart 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:31.899
 In the case of me, I would like to arrange them like 01 mountain from left to right 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.630
 In the future, it will be lined up like a mart 10232 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:37.340
 First of all 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.090
 I have this here because I want to replace Mr. Neat 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:47.160
 Pass through 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:50.280
 Then the next step is to reverse so that it can be first, so easy want to swap the 1 and 0 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.770
 I'll do first why early 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.320
 Finally here 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.320
 By doing this 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.370
 Will be like 0122 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:12.240
 I'm going to a bowl for Connor 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:16.670
 Some people that are depending on the person is doing because the hand becomes free time 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.470
 I would like to explain how to do it . 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.480
 Well first 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:27.050
 I will 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:29.560
 And here is this right side and make it the right to buy birth 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:34.100
 Have all the cards 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.310
 Was but have towards the lower right, right this way 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.330
 What 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.330
 In the left hand 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.560
 Like to suck 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.560
 To slide 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.060
 is 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.060
 Me 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.120
 By doing early 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.640
 It becomes like this 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:19.370
 But the card is damaged by the part which does Sakamachi 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.300
 I can recommend too much because there is a competition it is doing much or become unpleasant 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.550
 I do not do 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.550
 I think it would be nice to have a long time without cards
