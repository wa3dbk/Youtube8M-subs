you<00:00:56.850> saw<00:00:57.030> how<00:00:57.180> quickly<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:58.020> worked<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:58.890> I've

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
you saw how quickly that worked now I've

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.569 
you saw how quickly that worked now I've
also<00:00:59.399> noticed<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.960> cover<00:01:01.579> your

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
also noticed that if you cover your

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.729 
also noticed that if you cover your
mouth<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:03.120> down<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.660> your<00:01:03.780> chin<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.350> still

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
mouth on down to your chin it still

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.670 
mouth on down to your chin it still
works<00:01:08.180> we<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.360> how<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:10.049> work<00:01:10.260> there<00:01:10.439> pretty

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
works we see how that work there pretty

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.810 
works we see how that work there pretty
quickly<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.220> guess<00:01:11.460> if<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
quickly so I guess if you have a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.750 
quickly so I guess if you have a
mustache<00:01:12.330> or<00:01:12.689> whatever<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:14.700> doesn't

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
mustache or whatever it doesn't

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.520 
mustache or whatever it doesn't
differentiate<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.570> now<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> cover<00:01:16.380> your

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
differentiate that now if you cover your

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.060 
differentiate that now if you cover your
forehead<00:01:17.070> eyeball<00:01:17.640> or<00:01:17.670> your<00:01:18.390> nose<00:01:18.799> it's<00:01:19.799> going

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
forehead eyeball or your nose it's going

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.070 
forehead eyeball or your nose it's going
to<00:01:20.100> fail<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:21.150> other<00:01:21.270> thing<00:01:21.479> I've<00:01:21.600> noticed<00:01:21.780> is

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
to fail the other thing I've noticed is

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.030 
to fail the other thing I've noticed is
the<00:01:22.320> pattern<00:01:22.979> lock<00:01:23.310> screen<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:24.890> really<00:01:25.890> nice

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the pattern lock screen is really nice

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.660 
the pattern lock screen is really nice
because<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.490> very<00:01:27.299> minimized<00:01:27.840> now<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.670> you

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
because it's very minimized now so you

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.260 
because it's very minimized now so you
can<00:01:29.939> see<00:01:30.329> your<00:01:30.659> home<00:01:30.900> screen<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> lot<00:01:31.560> better

looking<00:02:34.380> at<00:02:34.530> maybe<00:02:34.770> seven<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.790> eight<00:02:35.880> hours<00:02:36.120> on

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
looking at maybe seven to eight hours on

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.880 
looking at maybe seven to eight hours on
the<00:02:37.110> battery<00:02:37.410> life<00:02:37.530> itself<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:40.530> Google<00:02:40.830> is

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
the battery life itself so Google is

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.290 
the battery life itself so Google is
telling<00:02:41.190> us<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.520> five<00:02:41.730> megapixel

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
telling us that the five megapixel

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.320 
telling us that the five megapixel
camera<00:02:42.630> on<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.250> Galaxy<00:02:44.250> Nexus<00:02:44.400> has<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.970> zero

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
camera on the Galaxy Nexus has a zero

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.800 
camera on the Galaxy Nexus has a zero
shutter<00:02:46.110> lag<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.760> let's<00:02:48.030> give<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.390> whirl<00:02:48.420> and

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
shutter lag so let's give it a whirl and

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.600 
shutter lag so let's give it a whirl and
see<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:49.530> it's<00:02:49.800> true<00:02:51.110> okay<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:52.739> we're<00:02:53.160> all<00:02:53.280> set

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
see if it's true okay so we're all set

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.910 
see if it's true okay so we're all set
here<00:02:53.640> I'm<00:02:53.940> going<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.120> focus<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.810> let's<00:02:55.620> fire

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
here I'm going to focus and let's fire

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:04.520 
here I'm going to focus and let's fire
off<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.160> few<00:02:56.310> shots<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.900> was<00:03:04.019> pretty<00:03:04.230> quick

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
off a few shots so that was pretty quick

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.350 
off a few shots so that was pretty quick
now<00:03:05.010> let's<00:03:05.220> look<00:03:05.400> at<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.640> quality<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.180> these

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
now let's look at the quality of these

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.910 
now let's look at the quality of these
shots<00:03:11.390> okay<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:12.570> let's<00:03:12.840> go<00:03:13.110> back<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.350> shot

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
shots okay so let's go back to shot

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.140 
shots okay so let's go back to shot
number<00:03:14.160> one<00:03:15.110> not<00:03:16.110> bad<00:03:16.380> little<00:03:16.890> dark<00:03:17.280> there's

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
number one not bad little dark there's

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:26.500 
number one not bad little dark there's
some<00:03:18.329> noise<00:03:18.510> there<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.410> let's<00:03:19.590> keep<00:03:19.799> going

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.369 

that<00:03:27.140> one's<00:03:27.379> probably<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.799> best<00:03:29.170> it's<00:03:30.170> not

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
that one's probably the best it's not

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.990 
that one's probably the best it's not
bad<00:03:30.590> when<00:03:30.799> you<00:03:30.890> do<00:03:31.069> need<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.400> shoot<00:03:31.610> quickly

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
bad when you do need to shoot quickly

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000 
bad when you do need to shoot quickly
now<00:03:32.780> how<00:03:33.230> about<00:03:33.620> if<00:03:34.010> we<00:03:34.090> actually<00:03:35.090> don't<00:03:36.010> shoot

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
now how about if we actually don't shoot

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.050 
now how about if we actually don't shoot
too<00:03:37.220> fast<00:03:37.549> and<00:03:37.819> actually<00:03:38.120> try<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.329> focus<00:03:38.750> on

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
too fast and actually try to focus on

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.380 
too fast and actually try to focus on
something<00:03:42.519> okay<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:43.579> we've<00:03:43.879> got<00:03:44.030> his<00:03:44.150> eyes

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
something okay so we've got his eyes

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.250 
something okay so we've got his eyes
focus<00:03:46.299> okay<00:03:47.299> let's<00:03:47.750> look<00:03:47.840> at<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.079> quality

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
focus okay let's look at the quality

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:57.429 
focus okay let's look at the quality
that<00:03:48.530> shot<00:03:52.120> still<00:03:53.120> a<00:03:53.359> little<00:03:53.739> fuzzy<00:03:56.109> so<00:03:57.109> let<00:03:57.409> me

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 
that shot still a little fuzzy so let me

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.979 
that shot still a little fuzzy so let me
try<00:03:57.769> to<00:03:57.829> hold<00:03:58.069> steady<00:03:58.430> here<00:03:58.760> I<00:03:58.940> don't<00:03:59.810> think

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
try to hold steady here I don't think

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.830 
try to hold steady here I don't think
there's<00:04:00.230> an<00:04:00.500> thi<00:04:00.709> shake<00:04:01.250> on<00:04:01.519> here<00:04:01.909> as<00:04:02.780> a

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
there's an thi shake on here as a

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.680 
there's an thi shake on here as a
feature<00:04:03.430> so<00:04:04.430> if<00:04:04.760> you've<00:04:05.000> been<00:04:05.120> drinking<00:04:05.269> a<00:04:05.540> lot

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
feature so if you've been drinking a lot

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.080 
feature so if you've been drinking a lot
of<00:04:05.810> coffee<00:04:06.019> like<00:04:06.319> me<00:04:06.700> try<00:04:07.700> not<00:04:07.849> to<00:04:07.970> take

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090

pictures because as you can see it's a

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.599 
pictures because as you can see it's a
little<00:04:11.870> hazy<00:04:12.139> and<00:04:12.470> keep<00:04:12.920> in<00:04:13.040> mind<00:04:13.220> I'm<00:04:13.400> in

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
little hazy and keep in mind I'm in

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.689 
little hazy and keep in mind I'm in
pretty<00:04:13.909> ideal<00:04:14.269> lighting<00:04:14.690> here<00:04:14.930> I<00:04:15.799> don't<00:04:16.579> have

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
pretty ideal lighting here I don't have

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.439 
pretty ideal lighting here I don't have
to<00:04:16.850> chalk<00:04:17.030> this<00:04:17.090> up<00:04:17.419> as<00:04:17.859> not<00:04:18.859> being<00:04:19.579> as<00:04:19.850> great

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
to chalk this up as not being as great

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.560 
to chalk this up as not being as great
the<00:04:20.900> quality<00:04:21.229> is<00:04:21.260> not<00:04:21.410> as<00:04:21.470> great<00:04:21.739> as<00:04:21.919> iphone<00:04:22.570> 4s

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
the quality is not as great as iphone 4s

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.129 
the quality is not as great as iphone 4s
in<00:04:23.840> that<00:04:23.990> regard<00:04:24.350> so<00:04:25.250> image<00:04:25.699> stabilization

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
in that regard so image stabilization

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.930 
in that regard so image stabilization
seems<00:04:27.139> to<00:04:27.410> not<00:04:27.770> be<00:04:28.039> a<00:04:28.400> part<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:30.520> either<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:31.639> see

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
seems to not be a part of either I see

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.150 
seems to not be a part of either I see
Ezra<00:04:32.210> Galaxy<00:04:32.539> Nexus<00:04:32.690> so<00:04:33.560> that's<00:04:33.949> something

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
Ezra Galaxy Nexus so that's something

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.830 
Ezra Galaxy Nexus so that's something
that<00:04:34.310> if<00:04:34.729> it's<00:04:34.910> important<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.360> you<00:04:35.419> this<00:04:35.630> might

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.200 
that if it's important to you this might
not<00:04:35.990> be<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.169> right<00:04:36.260> device<00:04:36.560> for<00:04:36.979> you<00:04:39.970> so<00:04:40.970> I'm

this is more of a pro tip for you
developers<00:04:45.710> out<00:04:45.800> there<00:04:45.860> if<00:04:46.550> you<00:04:47.740> wanted<00:04:48.740> to

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
developers out there if you wanted to

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.650 
developers out there if you wanted to
you<00:04:49.760> can<00:04:49.880> go<00:04:49.940> to<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.180> developers<00:04:50.660> option<00:04:51.380> and

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
you can go to the developers option and

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.460 
you can go to the developers option and
switch<00:04:53.660> on<00:04:53.840> GPU<00:04:54.500> rendering<00:04:56.229> so<00:04:57.229> what<00:04:57.349> this

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
switch on GPU rendering so what this

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.170 
switch on GPU rendering so what this
will<00:04:57.650> do<00:04:57.800> is<00:04:57.830> it<00:04:58.070> will<00:04:58.099> speed<00:04:58.490> things<00:04:58.520> up<00:04:58.910> for

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
will do is it will speed things up for

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.990 
will do is it will speed things up for
you<00:04:59.300> in<00:04:59.330> two<00:04:59.630> dimension<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:00.580> so<00:05:01.580> let's<00:05:01.789> give

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
you in two dimension and so let's give

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.800 
you in two dimension and so let's give
it<00:05:02.060> a<00:05:02.150> test<00:05:02.389> here<00:05:03.460> let's<00:05:04.460> go<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.669> Twitter<00:05:05.030> now

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
it a test here let's go to Twitter now

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.110 
it a test here let's go to Twitter now
let's<00:05:06.229> grow<00:05:06.470> through<00:05:06.800> Twitter<00:05:07.669> look<00:05:08.000> how

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
let's grow through Twitter look how

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.899 
let's grow through Twitter look how
quickly<00:05:08.570> that<00:05:08.720> just<00:05:09.909> scrolls<00:05:10.909> through<00:05:12.909> pretty

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
quickly that just scrolls through pretty
