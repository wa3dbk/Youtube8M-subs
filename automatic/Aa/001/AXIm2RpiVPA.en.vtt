what's inside the packaging and aside
from<00:01:07.470> all<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.790> those<00:01:09.080> neat<00:01:10.080> things<00:01:10.409> included

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
from all of those neat things included

from all of those neat things included
in<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> box<00:01:11.729> let's<00:01:12.270> leave<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.140> battery<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.010> a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
in the box let's leave a battery and a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.929 
in the box let's leave a battery and a
phone<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> galaxy<00:01:16.470> runt<00:01:16.799> ok<00:01:17.549> this

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
phone so this is a galaxy runt ok this

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.050 
phone so this is a galaxy runt ok this
is<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> galaxy<00:01:18.450> round<00:01:18.770> it's<00:01:19.770> uh<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.729> name<00:01:20.880> is

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
is a galaxy round it's uh the name is

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.640 
is a galaxy round it's uh the name is
actually<00:01:21.240> pretty<00:01:21.630> straightforward<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.470> this

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
actually pretty straightforward so this

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.100 
actually pretty straightforward so this
is<00:01:22.799> maybe<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.060> round<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.930> is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
is maybe not that round but this is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.039 
is maybe not that round but this is
curved<00:01:25.740> more<00:01:26.159> likely<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.700> let's<00:01:27.630> take<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> look

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
curved more likely and let's take a look

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.590 
curved more likely and let's take a look
at<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> design<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:29.100> closely<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.360> front

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
at the design more closely on the front

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.179 
at the design more closely on the front
there's<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.900> receiver<00:01:31.380> with<00:01:31.770> front-facing

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
there's a receiver with front-facing

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.880 
there's a receiver with front-facing
camera<00:01:32.549> 5.7<00:01:33.299> inches<00:01:33.540> full<00:01:33.780> HD<00:01:33.990> display<00:01:34.110> that's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
camera 5.7 inches full HD display that's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.499 
camera 5.7 inches full HD display that's
not<00:01:35.280> exactly<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.700> thing<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:35.939> matters<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
not exactly the thing that matters the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.420 
not exactly the thing that matters the
thing<00:01:36.900> matters<00:01:37.259> over<00:01:37.439> here<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.280> is

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
thing matters over here is that is

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.080 
thing matters over here is that is
flexible<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.290> how<00:01:40.530> flex<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.729> this

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
flexible so this is how flex it is this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.020 
flexible so this is how flex it is this
is<00:01:42.270> how<00:01:42.420> curved<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.820> much

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
is how curved it is it's not that much

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.800 
is how curved it is it's not that much
curve<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.770> pretty<00:01:46.770> much<00:01:46.950> likely<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.810> product

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
curve is pretty much likely a product

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.050 
curve is pretty much likely a product
that<00:01:49.229> Samsung<00:01:49.680> would<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.220> launch<00:01:50.430> to

that Samsung would like to launch to

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.910 
that Samsung would like to launch to
prove<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> fact<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.840> they<00:01:51.990> were<00:01:52.049> indeed<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
prove the fact that they were indeed the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.649 
prove the fact that they were indeed the

first first company to launch a phone

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.050 
first first company to launch a phone
with<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.930> flexible<00:01:58.320> display<00:01:58.680> that's<00:01:59.460> all<00:01:59.850> it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
with the flexible display that's all it

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.910 
with the flexible display that's all it
matters<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.290> device<00:02:01.649> and

matters on the on this device and

matters on the on this device and
everything<00:02:02.670> else<00:02:02.820> should<00:02:03.119> be<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.780> boring<00:02:04.140> old

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
everything else should be the boring old

put<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.829> power<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.950> got<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> battery

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
put the power on it's got a battery

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.040 
put the power on it's got a battery
cover<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.060> we<00:02:12.239> have<00:02:12.360> seen<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.780> galaxy

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
cover that we have seen in the galaxy

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.880 
cover that we have seen in the galaxy
note<00:02:13.200> 3<00:02:13.230> as<00:02:13.530> well

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
note 3 as well

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.470 
note 3 as well
this<00:02:13.980> leather<00:02:14.340> likely<00:02:14.910> kind<00:02:15.210> of<00:02:15.270> thingy<00:02:15.530> fills

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
this leather likely kind of thingy fills

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.720 
this leather likely kind of thingy fills
the<00:02:18.480> note<00:02:18.660> threes<00:02:19.110> battery<00:02:19.920> cover<00:02:20.160> felt

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the note threes battery cover felt

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.870 
the note threes battery cover felt
better<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.660> this<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.560> well<00:02:23.130> we<00:02:23.459> can<00:02:23.610> see<00:02:23.730> that

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
better but this is well we can see that

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.390 
better but this is well we can see that
they've<00:02:24.000> tried<00:02:24.330> anyway<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.920> note<00:02:26.100> 3

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
they've tried anyway this is the note 3

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.760 
they've tried anyway this is the note 3
and<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.540> Galaxy<00:02:27.930> round<00:02:28.110> we<00:02:28.350> can<00:02:28.380> see

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
and this is the Galaxy round we can see

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.980 
and this is the Galaxy round we can see
how<00:02:29.040> curved<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.850> compared<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.720> Galaxy

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
how curved it is compared to the Galaxy

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.810 
how curved it is compared to the Galaxy
Note<00:02:31.110> 3<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.530> don't<00:02:31.920> know<00:02:31.980> why<00:02:32.220> anyone<00:02:32.550> would

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
Note 3 I don't know why anyone would

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.910 
Note 3 I don't know why anyone would
actually<00:02:33.209> get<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.690> galaxy<00:02:34.080> round<00:02:34.500> over

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
actually get the galaxy round over

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.660 
actually get the galaxy round over
Galaxy<00:02:35.190> Note<00:02:35.340> 3<00:02:35.370> -<00:02:36.350> got<00:02:37.350> when<00:02:37.980> gals<00:02:38.220> no<00:02:38.400> threes

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
Galaxy Note 3 - got when gals no threes

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.479 
Galaxy Note 3 - got when gals no threes
got<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.880> better<00:02:39.090> function<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:41.220> even

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
got a better function and it's even

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.030 
got a better function and it's even
cheaper<00:02:41.700> but<00:02:42.239> anyway<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:42.989> kind<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.860> a

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
cheaper but anyway this is kind of a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.940 
cheaper but anyway this is kind of a
marquee<00:02:45.050> testing<00:02:46.050> kind<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.320> devices<00:02:46.709> this

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
marquee testing kind of devices this

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.890 
marquee testing kind of devices this
kind<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.310> device<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.850> will<00:02:48.000> launch<00:02:48.690> to

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
kind of a device that you will launch to

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.050 
kind of a device that you will launch to
prove<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.500> are<00:02:49.530> indeed<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.310> first<00:02:50.550> one

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
prove that you are indeed the first one

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.690 
prove that you are indeed the first one
to<00:02:51.300> launch<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.780> flexible<00:02:52.230> device<00:02:52.700> flexible

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
to launch a flexible device flexible

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.130 
to launch a flexible device flexible
display<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.120> quick<00:02:54.420> device<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:54.989> not

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
display a quick device that it's not

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.520 
display a quick device that it's not
flexible<00:02:55.380> anyway<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.500> themed<00:02:58.500> around

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
flexible anyway so this is themed around

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.880 
flexible anyway so this is themed around
of<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.459> gals<00:02:59.640> around<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.239> this<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.840> only<00:03:01.800> an

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
of the gals around and this is a only an

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.400 
of the gals around and this is a only an
unboxing<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.850> was<00:03:03.060> tea<00:03:03.300> into<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:04.110> little

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
unboxing and I was tea into the little

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.020 
unboxing and I was tea into the little
details<00:03:04.769> of<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.010> galaxy<00:03:05.310> around<00:03:05.430> on<00:03:05.760> the

following review of the galaxy round so
this<00:03:08.489> was<00:03:08.640> under<00:03:08.910> kg<00:03:09.360> on<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.690> top<00:03:09.870> over<00:03:10.170> there

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
this was under kg on the top over there

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.650 
this was under kg on the top over there
