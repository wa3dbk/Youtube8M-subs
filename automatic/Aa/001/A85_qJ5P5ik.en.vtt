all<00:00:00.780> right<00:00:00.930> here<00:00:01.110> we're<00:00:01.230> going<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.410> find<00:00:01.650> the

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
all right here we're going to find the

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.409 
all right here we're going to find the
area<00:00:01.979> of<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.190> triangle<00:00:02.490> formed<00:00:03.000> by<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.149> couple

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
area of a triangle formed by a couple

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.260 
area of a triangle formed by a couple
vectors<00:00:03.990> so<00:00:04.500> vector<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.859> has<00:00:05.160> components<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.970> 0

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
vectors so vector a has components to 0

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.320 
vectors so vector a has components to 0
1<00:00:06.540> vector<00:00:07.440> B<00:00:07.589> has<00:00:07.799> components<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.610> negative<00:00:09.059> 6

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
1 vector B has components to negative 6

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.900 
1 vector B has components to negative 6
comma<00:00:09.420> 4<00:00:11.630> so<00:00:12.630> kind<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.960> basic<00:00:13.320> idea<00:00:13.679> here

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.640 

again<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.570> know<00:00:18.690> we've<00:00:18.840> got<00:00:19.020> some<00:00:19.050> vector

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
again so you know we've got some vector

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.830 
again so you know we've got some vector
a<00:00:21.650> we<00:00:22.650> have<00:00:22.800> some<00:00:23.039> vector<00:00:23.460> B<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.240> idea<00:00:24.570> again

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
a we have some vector B the idea again

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.509 
a we have some vector B the idea again
is<00:00:24.900> we<00:00:25.140> want<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.560> area<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> triangle

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
is we want the area of the triangle

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.599 
is we want the area of the triangle
formed<00:00:27.150> by<00:00:27.300> those<00:00:27.480> two<00:00:27.750> vectors<00:00:28.279> well<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.460> get

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
formed by those two vectors well to get

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.890 
formed by those two vectors well to get
that<00:00:29.880> what<00:00:30.119> we're<00:00:30.240> going<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.390> do<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.689> make<00:00:30.869> a

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
that what we're going to do is make a

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.040 
that what we're going to do is make a
little<00:00:31.140> parallelogram<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.450> here's<00:00:33.450> vector<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
little parallelogram so here's vector a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.410 
little parallelogram so here's vector a
let's<00:00:34.410> stick<00:00:34.680> another<00:00:34.890> vector<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.670> over<00:00:35.969> there

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
let's stick another vector a over there

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.020 
let's stick another vector a over there
there<00:00:36.930> was<00:00:37.170> B<00:00:37.380> let's<00:00:37.829> stick<00:00:38.010> another<00:00:38.219> vector<00:00:38.670> B

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
there was B let's stick another vector B

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.790 
there was B let's stick another vector B
over<00:00:39.300> there<00:00:41.840> to<00:00:42.840> get<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> area<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
over there to get the area of the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.220 
over there to get the area of the
parallelogram<00:00:44.309> my<00:00:45.120> rough<00:00:45.629> looking<00:00:45.960> little

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
parallelogram my rough looking little

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.279 
parallelogram my rough looking little
parallelogram<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:48.660> area<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
parallelogram the area of the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.380 
parallelogram the area of the
parallelogram<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.309> turns<00:00:50.520> out<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.300> going

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
parallelogram it turns out is just going

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.010 
parallelogram it turns out is just going
to<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> magnitude<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.739> cross<00:00:53.100> B<00:00:53.430> so

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
to be the magnitude of a cross B so

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.340 
to be the magnitude of a cross B so
that's<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.559> area<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:57.350> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
that's going to be the area of the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
that's going to be the area of the
entire<00:00:58.469> region<00:01:00.140> okay<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.199> well<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.100> only

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
entire region okay so well if we only

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.850 
entire region okay so well if we only
want<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.879> triangle<00:01:03.210> that's<00:01:03.570> half<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.170> so

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
want the triangle that's half of that so

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.410 
want the triangle that's half of that so
that<00:01:05.129> tells<00:01:05.339> us<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> area<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
that tells us that the area of the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.580 
that tells us that the area of the
triangle<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> area<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> triangle<00:01:10.170> is

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
triangle so the area of the triangle is

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.230 
triangle so the area of the triangle is
just<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.979> be<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.310> magnitude<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
just going to be the magnitude of a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.539 
just going to be the magnitude of a
cross<00:01:12.600> B<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:14.010> we'll<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.400> divide

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
cross B and then we'll have to divide

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.420 
cross B and then we'll have to divide
that<00:01:14.729> by<00:01:14.939> 2<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.009> what<00:01:17.159> we're<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.400> to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that by 2 so this is what we're going to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.850 
that by 2 so this is what we're going to
have<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.790> compute<00:01:18.350> all<00:01:19.350> right<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> first

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
have to compute all right so the first

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.950 
have to compute all right so the first
thing<00:01:20.009> I'm<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.939> find<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.750> cross

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
thing I'm going to do is find the cross

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.850 
thing I'm going to do is find the cross
product<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.770> cross<00:01:23.159> B<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.290> do<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.770> cross<00:01:26.130> B

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
product a cross B so to do a cross B

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.390 
product a cross B so to do a cross B
we've<00:01:28.860> got<00:01:28.909> IJ<00:01:29.909> K<00:01:30.560> vector<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.770> has<00:01:31.950> components

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
we've got IJ K vector a has components

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.499 
we've got IJ K vector a has components
to<00:01:32.850> 0<00:01:33.240> 1<00:01:34.159> vector<00:01:35.159> B<00:01:35.340> has<00:01:35.610> components<00:01:36.000> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
to 0 1 vector B has components to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.289 
to 0 1 vector B has components to
negative<00:01:37.140> 6<00:01:37.439> 4<00:01:40.909> alright<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.180> imagine

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
negative 6 4 alright so if you imagine

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.690 
negative 6 4 alright so if you imagine
covering<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.259> AI<00:01:43.290> column<00:01:44.070> we'll<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.490> left

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
covering up the AI column we'll be left

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.580 
covering up the AI column we'll be left
with<00:01:44.820> 0<00:01:45.420> 1<00:01:45.950> negative<00:01:46.950> 6<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.700> 4<00:01:48.110> will<00:01:49.110> subtract

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
with 0 1 negative 6 and 4 will subtract

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.780 
with 0 1 negative 6 and 4 will subtract
away<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.180> J<00:01:51.180> component<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.920> J<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.460> cover<00:01:53.700> up

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
away the J component so J if we cover up

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.590 
away the J component so J if we cover up
that<00:01:54.000> column<00:01:54.509> we're<00:01:54.750> left<00:01:54.899> with<00:01:55.110> 2<00:01:55.350> 1<00:01:55.530> 2<00:01:55.829> 4<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:57.540> 2

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that column we're left with 2 1 2 4 so 2

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.060 
that column we're left with 2 1 2 4 so 2
1<00:01:58.170> 2<00:01:58.590> 4<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.549> then<00:02:00.450> we'll<00:02:00.630> add<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.259> our<00:02:01.560> K

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
1 2 4 and then we'll add to that our K

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.280 
1 2 4 and then we'll add to that our K
component<00:02:03.049> so<00:02:04.049> then<00:02:04.229> we'll<00:02:04.409> be<00:02:04.500> left<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:04.890> 2<00:02:05.270> 0

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
component so then we'll be left with 2 0

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.809 
component so then we'll be left with 2 0
2<00:02:07.290> negative<00:02:07.710> 6<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:10.080> let's<00:02:10.259> see<00:02:10.410> 0<00:02:11.069> minus<00:02:11.400> 4<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.790> 0

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
2 negative 6 so let's see 0 minus 4 is 0

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.760 
2 negative 6 so let's see 0 minus 4 is 0
we'll<00:02:12.569> get<00:02:12.690> minus<00:02:12.930> negative

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
we'll get minus negative

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.100 
we'll get minus negative
six<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:15.060> will<00:02:15.150> leave<00:02:15.270> us<00:02:15.420> with<00:02:15.450> positive

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
six so that will leave us with positive

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.910 
six so that will leave us with positive
6i<00:02:17.180> -<00:02:18.180> we'll<00:02:18.390> have<00:02:18.510> 2<00:02:18.660> times<00:02:18.870> 4<00:02:19.170> which<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.590> 8

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
6i - we'll have 2 times 4 which is 8

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.220 
6i - we'll have 2 times 4 which is 8
minus<00:02:20.430> 2<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.510> that'll<00:02:21.750> leave<00:02:21.900> us<00:02:22.020> with<00:02:22.200> a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
minus 2 so that'll leave us with a

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.940 
minus 2 so that'll leave us with a
negative<00:02:23.010> 6<00:02:23.610> j<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.500> looks<00:02:25.680> like<00:02:25.830> we

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
negative 6 j and then it looks like we

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.010 
negative 6 j and then it looks like we
have<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.160> negative<00:02:26.940> 12<00:02:27.540> minus<00:02:28.520> 0<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:30.660> let's<00:02:30.840> see

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
have a negative 12 minus 0 so let's see

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.370 
have a negative 12 minus 0 so let's see
negative<00:02:31.710> 12<00:02:32.190> minus<00:02:32.690> 0<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:34.020> just<00:02:34.080> going<00:02:34.290> to

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
negative 12 minus 0 is just going to

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.140 
negative 12 minus 0 is just going to
leave<00:02:34.530> us<00:02:34.560> with<00:02:34.710> well<00:02:35.070> negative<00:02:35.760> 12<00:02:36.090> times<00:02:36.210> K

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
leave us with well negative 12 times K

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.700 
leave us with well negative 12 times K
so<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.300> says<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.630> cross<00:02:39.900> product<00:02:40.500> has

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
so it says the cross product has

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.280 
so it says the cross product has
components<00:02:41.220> 6<00:02:41.940> comma<00:02:42.300> negative<00:02:42.660> 6<00:02:43.110> comma

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
components 6 comma negative 6 comma

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.260 
components 6 comma negative 6 comma
negative<00:02:44.030> 12<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.500> now<00:02:46.730> we'll<00:02:47.730> just<00:02:47.910> find<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
negative 12 and now we'll just find the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.410 
negative 12 and now we'll just find the
magnitude<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.060> says<00:02:51.240> the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
magnitude of this so that says the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.790 
magnitude of this so that says the
magnitude<00:02:52.020> of<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.380> cross<00:02:52.770> B<00:02:54.470> well<00:02:55.470> that's<00:02:55.680> going

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
magnitude of a cross B well that's going

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.110 
magnitude of a cross B well that's going
to<00:02:55.920> be<00:02:56.010> 6<00:02:56.430> squared<00:02:56.850> plus<00:02:57.510> negative<00:02:57.810> 6<00:02:58.320> squared

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
to be 6 squared plus negative 6 squared

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.010 
to be 6 squared plus negative 6 squared
plus<00:03:00.120> negative<00:03:00.420> 12<00:03:01.610> squared<00:03:03.410> well<00:03:04.410> let's<00:03:04.560> see

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
plus negative 12 squared well let's see

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.380 
plus negative 12 squared well let's see
6<00:03:07.020> squared<00:03:07.350> is<00:03:07.530> 36<00:03:07.730> negative<00:03:08.730> 6<00:03:09.000> squared<00:03:09.150> is

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
6 squared is 36 negative 6 squared is

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.720 
6 squared is 36 negative 6 squared is
also<00:03:09.750> 36<00:03:10.410> negative<00:03:11.310> 12<00:03:11.610> squared<00:03:11.940> will<00:03:12.120> be<00:03:12.380> 144

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
also 36 negative 12 squared will be 144

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.020 
also 36 negative 12 squared will be 144
so<00:03:14.730> let's<00:03:14.910> see<00:03:15.060> if<00:03:15.150> we<00:03:15.270> simplify<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:16.580> 144<00:03:17.610> I

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
so let's see if we simplify that 144 I

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.680 
so let's see if we simplify that 144 I
guess<00:03:18.900> plus<00:03:19.320> 72<00:03:20.150> that's<00:03:21.150> going<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.450> leave<00:03:21.660> us

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
guess plus 72 that's going to leave us

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:29.360 
guess plus 72 that's going to leave us
with<00:03:21.950> let's<00:03:22.950> see<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:28.980> gets<00:03:29.070> that<00:03:29.220> will

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
with let's see so that gets that will

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.160 
with let's see so that gets that will
leave<00:03:29.490> us<00:03:29.640> with<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.850> square<00:03:30.209> root<00:03:30.240> of<00:03:30.630> what<00:03:30.900> how

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
leave us with a square root of what how

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.290 
leave us with a square root of what how
about<00:03:31.520> 216<00:03:33.500> well<00:03:34.500> again<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.040> find<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.580> area<00:03:36.090> of

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
about 216 well again to find the area of

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.220 
about 216 well again to find the area of
the<00:03:36.540> triangle<00:03:36.840> all<00:03:37.290> we<00:03:37.560> have<00:03:37.740> to<00:03:37.890> do<00:03:38.070> is<00:03:39.230> just

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
the triangle all we have to do is just

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.930 
the triangle all we have to do is just
take<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.590> value<00:03:41.010> again<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.580> is<00:03:41.760> now<00:03:41.880> the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
take this value again this is now the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.510 
take this value again this is now the
area<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.660> parallelogram<00:03:43.190> so<00:03:44.190> again<00:03:44.400> the

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
area of the parallelogram so again the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.590 
area of the parallelogram so again the
area<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.000> triangle

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
area of the triangle

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.590 
area of the triangle
like<00:03:46.500> we<00:03:46.650> said<00:03:46.830> we<00:03:47.040> just<00:03:47.190> take<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.610> magnitude

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
like we said we just take the magnitude

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.350 
like we said we just take the magnitude
of<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.840> cross<00:03:49.020> product<00:03:49.820> which<00:03:50.820> is<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.090> square

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
of the cross product which is the square

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.470 
of the cross product which is the square
root<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.900> 216<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:53.100> then<00:03:53.670> we<00:03:53.820> can<00:03:53.940> divide<00:03:54.209> that

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
root of 216 and then we can divide that

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.770 
root of 216 and then we can divide that
simply<00:03:55.080> by<00:03:55.260> 2<00:03:55.320> so<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.550> guess<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.300> question<00:03:57.480> is

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
simply by 2 so I guess the question is

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.940 
simply by 2 so I guess the question is
this<00:03:57.990> is<00:03:58.170> simplify<00:03:58.680> at<00:03:58.860> all<00:03:58.980> let's<00:03:59.430> see<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.920> we

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
this is simplify at all let's see so we

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.720 
this is simplify at all let's see so we
can<00:04:02.040> always<00:04:02.250> write<00:04:02.370> 2<00:04:02.760> 16<00:04:03.270> as<00:04:03.540> 2<00:04:03.810> times<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.440> guess

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
can always write 2 16 as 2 times I guess

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.420 
can always write 2 16 as 2 times I guess
108<00:04:05.730> we<00:04:06.720> can<00:04:06.870> always<00:04:07.170> break<00:04:07.530> down<00:04:07.560> 108<00:04:08.400> a

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
108 we can always break down 108 a

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.860 
108 we can always break down 108 a
little<00:04:08.850> bit<00:04:08.970> further<00:04:10.820> so<00:04:11.820> 108<00:04:12.270> we<00:04:12.540> could<00:04:12.690> write

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
little bit further so 108 we could write

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.460 
little bit further so 108 we could write
that<00:04:12.900> as<00:04:13.230> 2<00:04:13.530> times<00:04:14.209> 54<00:04:15.209> all<00:04:16.140> over<00:04:18.140> 254<00:04:19.140> we<00:04:19.320> can

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
that as 2 times 54 all over 254 we can

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.349 
that as 2 times 54 all over 254 we can
break<00:04:19.709> down<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:20.340> guess<00:04:20.580> a<00:04:20.609> little<00:04:20.880> bit<00:04:21.090> further

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
break down I guess a little bit further

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.719 
break down I guess a little bit further
as<00:04:21.570> well<00:04:21.720> let's<00:04:22.109> see<00:04:22.229> we<00:04:22.770> have<00:04:22.890> 2<00:04:23.040> times<00:04:23.250> 2<00:04:23.340> so

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
as well let's see we have 2 times 2 so

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.070 
as well let's see we have 2 times 2 so
this<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:23.970> 4<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:24.570> I'm<00:04:24.660> going<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:24.840> bring<00:04:25.050> that

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
this is a 4 so I'm going to bring that

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.210 
this is a 4 so I'm going to bring that
out<00:04:25.320> as<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.530> 2

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.490 

the<00:04:29.220> square<00:04:29.460> root<00:04:29.580> of<00:04:29.610> 54<00:04:30.210> we<00:04:30.630> can<00:04:30.810> write<00:04:31.350> that

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
the square root of 54 we can write that

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
the square root of 54 we can write that
as<00:04:31.710> 27<00:04:32.550> times<00:04:32.850> 2<00:04:33.389> I<00:04:34.290> always<00:04:34.800> just<00:04:34.950> break<00:04:35.250> things

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
as 27 times 2 I always just break things

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.090 
as 27 times 2 I always just break things
down<00:04:35.669> and<00:04:36.060> evens<00:04:36.450> so<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.530> twos<00:04:37.740> we<00:04:37.950> could

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
down and evens so the twos we could

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.900 
down and evens so the twos we could
cancel<00:04:39.590> well<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.740> square<00:04:40.980> root<00:04:41.100> of<00:04:41.130> 27<00:04:41.460> times

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
cancel well the square root of 27 times

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.060 
cancel well the square root of 27 times
2<00:04:42.240> we<00:04:42.510> could<00:04:42.660> really<00:04:42.900> write<00:04:43.139> that<00:04:43.169> as<00:04:43.470> 9<00:04:43.680> times

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
2 we could really write that as 9 times

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.010 
2 we could really write that as 9 times
3<00:04:44.330> times<00:04:45.330> 2<00:04:46.610> well<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.910> square<00:04:48.150> root<00:04:48.240> of<00:04:48.300> 9<00:04:48.480> we

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
3 times 2 well the square root of 9 we

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.750 
3 times 2 well the square root of 9 we
can<00:04:49.169> take<00:04:49.380> we<00:04:49.620> can<00:04:49.740> pull<00:04:49.919> that<00:04:50.040> out<00:04:50.100> so<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.610> 9

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
can take we can pull that out so the 9

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.870 
can take we can pull that out so the 9
will<00:04:50.940> come<00:04:51.120> out<00:04:51.270> as<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.450> 3<00:04:52.190> we're<00:04:53.190> left<00:04:53.430> with<00:04:53.639> 3

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
will come out as a 3 we're left with 3

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.490 
will come out as a 3 we're left with 3
times<00:04:54.060> 2<00:04:54.450> which<00:04:54.840> I'm<00:04:54.990> just<00:04:55.139> going<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.290> multiply

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
times 2 which I'm just going to multiply

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.909 
times 2 which I'm just going to multiply
back<00:04:56.010> together<00:04:57.139> so<00:04:58.139> to<00:04:58.200> me<00:04:58.350> it<00:04:58.470> looks<00:04:58.620> like<00:04:58.680> the

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
back together so to me it looks like the

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.890 
back together so to me it looks like the
area<00:04:59.310> of<00:04:59.370> our<00:04:59.460> triangle<00:04:59.820> would<00:05:00.240> equal<00:05:00.570> 3<00:05:00.870> times

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
area of our triangle would equal 3 times

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.760 
area of our triangle would equal 3 times
the<00:05:01.470> square<00:05:01.620> root<00:05:01.980> of<00:05:02.160> 6
