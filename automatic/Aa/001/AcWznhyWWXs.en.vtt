00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.960
 4 or 5 leaves let's make the garlic and the 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.000
 onion a little 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.280
 asaditos 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.250
 no more so that the flavor is removed 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.500
 strong onion and garlic split their 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.720
 tomatoes in four and put them into 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.390
 blender so you can grind it well 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.010
 we are going to take two nails two 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.760
 peppers 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:41.950
 cinnamon and cumin 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.400
 and chiles this green mold can be 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.850
 do 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:53.690
 with pork or chicken with me 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.900
 and cosi previously a chicken a chicken you 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.560
 I took a little broth because with the 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.100
 broth let's grind this onion 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.660
 normal was to take away a little bit of 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.660
 how strong 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.430
 we're going to grind it well ground our 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.370
 casserole is already hot I'm going to put 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.930
 a little bit of oil and empty what 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.659
 mills 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.959
 you will wonder and the herbs 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:28.959
 because they do not grind them because the herbs 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:33.879
 we are going to put them after that is a 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:37.540
 trick so that the green chlorophyll of 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:41.970
 the one of the herbs stays in the stew 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:46.550
 and it looks nice the color we are going to 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.550
 adore our sesame a little 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.260
 with our nuggets 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.650
 you have to move him because if he does not 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.530
 holly sesame burns very fast 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.140
 then you have to be careful there are 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.870
 move it you have to move it 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.210
 to grab a yellow little yellow 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.900
 beautiful 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.330
 because if we burn bitter this just 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.510
 is that it makes a little golden color 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.690
 Look, you've already grabbed your little color already 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:26.470
 I'm going to pay 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.470
 we are going to put it, we are going to put it in 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:33.220
 in the glass of the blender I'm going to 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.390
 put a little broth just a 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.080
 little bit of broth so they can grind 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.080
 yes 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:50.670
 see how my tomato is already boiling and 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.670
 is well seasoned at this time 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.260
 let's add what sesame is and 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:01.070
 the nugget see how it is a bit white 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.070
 at medium heat 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:09.030
 let's put a little consommÃ© and 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:13.860
 at this moment we are going to grind hours and 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.459
 we put our herbs together for 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.459
 that the grindstone 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.599
 yes but it is this party 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.180
 see how this is already well seasoned and 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:34.789
 we are going to add 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:38.990
 the herbs that we returned see the green 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:41.660
 who grabs our little monkey they put a 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.430
 teaspoon of consommÃ© we leave it 10 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.430
 minutes to boil 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:55.050
 already spent the 10 minutes and see that 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.569
 it's okay the mold is the time to 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.559
 put the chicken 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:06.889
 so that it takes hold of its flavor two minutes 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:06.889
 boil and you're ready to eat
