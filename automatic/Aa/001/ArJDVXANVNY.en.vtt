before<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.579> thunderstorms<00:01:03.300> come<00:01:04.280> but<00:01:05.280> how

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
before the thunderstorms come but how

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.250 
before the thunderstorms come but how
strong<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:05.970> these<00:01:06.150> thunderstorms<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:07.020> now

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
strong with these thunderstorms be now

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.429 
strong with these thunderstorms be now
that<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> question<00:01:08.880> let's<00:01:09.869> take<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.080> look<00:01:10.320> at

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that is a question let's take a look at

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.410 
that is a question let's take a look at
the<00:01:10.680> latest<00:01:10.890> water<00:01:11.430> vapor<00:01:11.520> satellite<00:01:11.760> picture

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the latest water vapor satellite picture

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.370 
the latest water vapor satellite picture
because<00:01:12.600> there's<00:01:12.840> some<00:01:13.049> interesting

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
because there's some interesting

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.969 
because there's some interesting
features<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.280> break<00:01:14.490> down<00:01:15.530> first<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.740> want<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
features to break down first I want to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.859 
features to break down first I want to
talk<00:01:17.159> about<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.549> severe<00:01:17.850> weather<00:01:17.939> that's

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
talk about the severe weather that's

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.109 
talk about the severe weather that's

well<00:02:22.790> basically<00:02:23.600> what<00:02:23.870> we're<00:02:24.050> seeing<00:02:24.230> here<00:02:24.410> is

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
well basically what we're seeing here is

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.340 
well basically what we're seeing here is
that<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.490> entire<00:02:25.970> region<00:02:26.810> all<00:02:26.960> of<00:02:27.260> the

northern Atlantic and all of New England

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.800 
northern Atlantic and all of New England
will<00:02:30.380> become<00:02:30.830> very<00:02:31.490> unstable<00:02:32.030> the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.870 
will become very unstable the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880

lenio<00:02:35.600> moisture<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.740> question<00:02:37.370> remains

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
lenio moisture the question remains

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.050 
lenio moisture the question remains
where<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.230> trigger<00:02:39.530> going<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.010> be<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.760> it

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
where is the trigger going to be and it

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.810 
where is the trigger going to be and it
looks<00:02:41.330> like<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.900> best<00:02:42.290> upper-level<00:02:43.160> dynamics

weekend a rather familiar pattern starts
to<00:06:24.170> develop<00:06:24.380> that's<00:06:25.130> right<00:06:25.430> our<00:06:25.670> ridges<00:06:26.240> back

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
to develop that's right our ridges back

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.840 
to develop that's right our ridges back
we<00:06:27.500> have<00:06:27.620> a<00:06:27.650> trough<00:06:28.010> in<00:06:28.160> the<00:06:28.250> West<00:06:28.460> and<00:06:28.640> as<00:06:28.820> a

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
we have a trough in the West and as a

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.850 
we have a trough in the West and as a
result<00:06:29.060> our<00:06:29.480> ridge<00:06:29.840> and<00:06:30.080> east<00:06:30.290> is<00:06:30.470> going<00:06:30.710> to

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
result our ridge and east is going to

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.130 
result our ridge and east is going to
build<00:06:31.130> and<00:06:31.430> our<00:06:31.760> high<00:06:31.970> pressure<00:06:32.360> system<00:06:32.930> that

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
build and our high pressure system that

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.290 
build and our high pressure system that
was<00:06:33.440> located<00:06:34.070> over<00:06:34.280> the<00:06:34.400> Great<00:06:34.580> Lakes<00:06:34.610> is<00:06:35.090> now

sitting off the southeast coast and that

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.790 
sitting off the southeast coast and that
means<00:06:38.180> a<00:06:38.360> southwesterly<00:06:38.990> flow<00:06:39.110> will<00:06:39.530> be<00:06:39.680> in

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
means a southwesterly flow will be in

means a southwesterly flow will be in
place<00:06:39.980> once<00:06:40.460> again
