00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
 I do not know who fought maidan 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.980
 maybe he fought with the regime he fought 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.929
 personally with Yanukovych 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.599
 but I hope they didn't fight 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.820
 spent yatsenyuk and them like these 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.560
 people have once again discredited themselves and to 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.039
 sorry is in these chairs again 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.859
 and as we see in just a month 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.099
 managed to collapse what was created 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.140
 note for three years 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.900
 rhetoric yatsenyuk from today we will hear 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.540
 regions we will do decentralization we 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.059
 we will return the language 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.660
 why a corner sunbathe yes this is a program 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.850
 Party of Regions 2004 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.160
 he is just like our political 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.110
 force decided not to sign 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.660
 association agreement he signed only 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.399
 decorative political part they 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.199
 when we saw what was behind 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.140
 economic block but it is ruin 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.850
 Ukraine, he also postponed the signing 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.760
 economic part at the end of the year 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.800
 because there it is essential 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.719
 negotiate to change very many 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.960
 positions they will just kill our rural 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.119
 farm sugar production and many 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.040
 many other industries are in fact he 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.939
 doing the same thing today that was 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.299
 made in December understand the trouble 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.950
 only 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:23.070
 hundreds of victims destroyed Kiev destroyed 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.640
 economy population only they scurvy here 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.140
 we do not get financial support 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.750
 because if there is no help from others 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.079
 countries then you need to at least normalize 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.360
 economic relations and not lose 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.400
 all those achievements of the previous power 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.350
 which were achieved as we understand 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.020
 that in this coordinate system we cannot 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.170
 we have been living for twenty years 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.229
 conversation 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.570
 that we are not so different but we 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.119
 anyway one country means within 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.729
 one side we can exist by 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.369
 principle also as there is germanium 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.479
 canada united states of america 24 more 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.190
 non-unitary countries 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.420
 the federal structure of the country is essentially 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:11.430
 affairs what is a federation is one 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.450
 area is one country but its different 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.940
 subjects of the federation have their 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.400
 legislation has its rights they 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.459
 have a common political system they 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.220
 have a common global government they 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.360
 deduct part of their funds 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.640
 central budget for maintenance 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.910
 state natural monopolies on 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.390
 army conditional on the railway to the fleet 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.170
 it does not have its own municipal medicine 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.590
 municipal police 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.090
 they have their own bodies which 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.190
 are managers of the budget and they 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.650
 elect their power parliament and can 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.110
 be bicameral to upper house 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.239
 which people choose and the lower house 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.880
 who choose regional councils authority 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.100
 local government which 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.510
 delegates central authority 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.670
 then power becomes more 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.370
 democratic system more stable 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.410
 Today I think this is the main 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.420
 a discussion that should be in society 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.299
 what they actually offer now 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.630
 they offer to hold elections 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.920
 president in may 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.220
 then consider the changes in 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.150
 September constitution hold elections in 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:23.160
 parliament supreme glad i believe that on 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.570
 today as a result, these are my personal 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.239
 armed coup all power 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.079
 captured representatives will be and let's 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.600
 let's analyze 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.760
 Turchin representative will kill and yes this 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.390
 today we have three in one speaker 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.600
 Acting President 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.880
 Commander Yatsenyuk Prime Minister 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.220
 the cis could have headed parabias 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.230
 I can list them endlessly 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.359
 set that is essentially all power 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.190
 they will surely hold their hands 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.130
 try to delegate Tymoshenko to 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.900
 games by the president and if she wins i 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.880
 sure one hundred percent no 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.610
 changes to the constitution no one wear 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.390
 will be because then all the power 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.950
 and and legality their law is not president 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.980
 may sign any obligations 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.800
 with europe and nato i think it is 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.990
 and there is a goal for today this coup 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.180
 and if she doesn't win the election then 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.370
 then they will reconsider the constitution 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.190
 on parliamentary elections and all the fullness 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.980
 the authorities will be at the prime minister I think that here 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.320
 it is their job but I do not believe that this 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.180
 the task of every Ukrainian I think that 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.120
 the task of every Ukrainians in the first 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.830
 turn to defend their independence 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.570
 to defend their rights and freedoms therefore 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.360
 the only democratic way then 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.580
 first hold a referendum discuss with 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.920
 people first political device 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.160
 states then we stay in the guitar 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.560
 state whether federal to discuss 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.040
 the fullness and authority of authority in 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.100
 presidential parliamentary power 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.930
 prime minister cabinet minister 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.990
 discuss many other issues that 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.650
 depend quite possibly and 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.200
 immunity of deputies 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.030
 powers of people's deputies and only 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.220
 after that make changes to 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.900
 constitution 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.850
 make a political decision on 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.650
 state device and go already on 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.350
 parliamentary presidential waters 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.910
 quite possibly at the same time if 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.490
 made a decision to federated device 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.350
 and local elections 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.280
 self and in the local parliament 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.700
 only so we can save 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.640
 the state is the only way we can 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.919
 protect yourself from both external threats and 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.290
 internal threats i think we're on 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.270
 today can really hurt 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.640
 each other more than harm us 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.220
 neighboring states are debating in 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.500
 European Parliament on assistance to Ukraine 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.130
 already many are beginning to soberly evaluate 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.580
 the situation we live in is already widely 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.500
 developed information field and 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.880
 information andromeda which by 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.480
 killings on the Maidan 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.610
 by the fact as it is now is a power 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.160
 deriban goes to the side it all fall and 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.610
 Europe, they clearly give an assessment 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.740
 what 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.139
 she has fascist forces now too 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.210
 dominates our country it is nobody 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:14.259
 supports the more Germany which 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:16.750
 passed this way 75 years ago I think 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:19.719
 by no means want it 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.780
 repetitions on the border with the European Union 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:25.150
 therefore, you need to clearly assess the situation 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.430
 give a fair assessment of these events 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.500
 wind everything back and continue 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.889
 negotiations are absolutely with all of our 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.889
 neighbors
