that<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> goal<00:01:22.229> scorer<00:01:22.619> does

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that but that's what a goal scorer does

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.410 
that but that's what a goal scorer does
gets<00:01:23.340> goals<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.939> nothing<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
gets goals out of nothing and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.929 
gets goals out of nothing and
fortunately<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.259> me<00:01:25.470> his<00:01:26.159> slightly<00:01:26.549> poor

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590

if I give a player like a run of four
games<00:02:41.340> for<00:02:41.610> example<00:02:41.700> then<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.720> usually<00:02:43.200> you

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
games for example then it usually you

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.020 
games for example then it usually you
know<00:02:43.590> keep<00:02:43.830> some<00:02:44.070> quiet<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.640> they<00:02:44.700> don't<00:02:44.880> get

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
easy games to be played and I was like

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.969 
easy games to be played and I was like
why<00:06:15.360> did<00:06:15.539> I<00:06:15.629> have<00:06:15.839> to<00:06:16.080> draw<00:06:16.289> mine<00:06:16.500> City<00:06:16.740> they're

such<00:06:17.159> a<00:06:17.190> good<00:06:17.400> side<00:06:17.639> but<00:06:17.909> in<00:06:18.690> all<00:06:18.810> honesty

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
such a good side but in all honesty

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:20.839 
such a good side but in all honesty
they've<00:06:19.710> definitely<00:06:19.949> they<00:06:20.339> don't<00:06:20.550> feel<00:06:20.699> as

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
they've definitely they don't feel as

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.279 
they've definitely they don't feel as
nearly<00:06:21.360> as<00:06:21.449> good<00:06:21.599> as<00:06:21.750> they<00:06:21.870> were<00:06:21.900> when<00:06:22.259> I

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
nearly as good as they were when I

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:23.659 
nearly as good as they were when I
played<00:06:22.560> him<00:06:22.680> in<00:06:22.740> the<00:06:22.800> the<00:06:23.129> very<00:06:23.339> first<00:06:23.550> season

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669

played him in the the very first season
with<00:06:23.909> QPR<00:06:24.300> but<00:06:24.750> maybe<00:06:25.020> that's<00:06:25.199> because<00:06:25.259> the

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
with QPR but maybe that's because the

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.689 
with QPR but maybe that's because the
squirrel<00:06:25.740> got<00:06:25.860> a<00:06:25.919> little<00:06:26.159> bit<00:06:26.279> better<00:06:26.430> but<00:06:26.669> a

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
squirrel got a little bit better but a

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.029 
squirrel got a little bit better but a
beautiful<00:06:27.150> cousin<00:06:27.569> from<00:06:27.930> El<00:06:28.110> Shaarawy<00:06:28.349> means

Sunderland<00:06:32.729> game<00:06:32.879> I'm<00:06:33.060> pretty<00:06:33.870> sure<00:06:34.080> the<00:06:34.349> the

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
Sunderland game I'm pretty sure the the

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.230 
Sunderland game I'm pretty sure the the
fixtures<00:06:35.310> were<00:06:35.430> actually<00:06:35.639> quite<00:06:35.789> close<00:06:36.000> so<00:06:36.209> I

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
fixtures were actually quite close so I

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.149 
fixtures were actually quite close so I
had<00:06:36.419> to<00:06:36.539> really<00:06:36.810> keep<00:06:37.080> an<00:06:37.229> eye<00:06:37.349> on<00:06:37.529> the<00:06:37.949> fitness

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:38.159 
had to really keep an eye on the fitness

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.309 
had to really keep an eye on the fitness
of<00:06:38.370> my<00:06:38.459> team<00:06:38.669> so<00:06:38.699> for<00:06:39.180> that<00:06:39.270> reason<00:06:39.659> there<00:06:39.810> were

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 
of my team so for that reason there were

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.360 
of my team so for that reason there were
a<00:06:40.349> few<00:06:40.500> substitutions<00:06:41.190> that

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
a few substitutions that

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.580 
a few substitutions that
went<00:06:41.490> around<00:06:41.550> and<00:06:42.080> fortunately<00:06:43.080> for<00:06:43.260> me<00:06:43.350> just

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
went around and fortunately for me just

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.719 
went around and fortunately for me just
as<00:06:43.680> I<00:06:43.770> made<00:06:43.949> that<00:06:44.040> actually<00:06:44.460> there<00:06:44.580> was<00:06:44.669> a

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:44.729 
as I made that actually there was a

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:46.129 
as I made that actually there was a
tackle<00:06:45.090> in<00:06:45.150> the<00:06:45.240> box<00:06:45.419> I<00:06:45.540> was<00:06:45.600> like<00:06:45.750> right<00:06:45.930> okay

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 
tackle in the box I was like right okay

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.000 
tackle in the box I was like right okay
well<00:06:46.320> I<00:06:46.350> might<00:06:46.530> as<00:06:46.620> well<00:06:46.710> make<00:06:46.860> this

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.010 
well I might as well make this

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.129 
well I might as well make this
substitution<00:06:47.460> now<00:06:47.699> and<00:06:47.940> when<00:06:48.690> I<00:06:48.720> came<00:06:48.810> out<00:06:49.080> of

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
substitution now and when I came out of

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:50.659 
substitution now and when I came out of
it<00:06:49.410> made<00:06:49.620> this<00:06:49.740> substitution<00:06:50.130> it<00:06:50.370> turned<00:06:50.580> out

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
it made this substitution it turned out

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.790 
it made this substitution it turned out
I<00:06:50.729> had<00:06:50.910> somehow<00:06:51.180> got<00:06:51.510> a<00:06:51.540> penalty<00:06:51.780> cells<00:06:52.650> I'm

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
nice to go cushion against Man City is

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.020 
nice to go cushion against Man City is
something<00:06:58.560> you'd<00:06:58.770> take<00:06:59.010> any<00:06:59.280> day<00:06:59.580> so<00:06:59.639> El

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
something you'd take any day so El

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.939 
something you'd take any day so El
Shaarawy<00:07:00.300> again<00:07:00.720> picked<00:07:01.229> up<00:07:01.350> both<00:07:01.530> goals

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:01.949 
Shaarawy again picked up both goals

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:03.890 
Shaarawy again picked up both goals
I<00:07:01.979> believe<00:07:02.460> I<00:07:02.550> played<00:07:02.790> in<00:07:02.940> sin<00:07:03.270> yay<00:07:03.479> in<00:07:03.690> this

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
I believe I played in sin yay in this

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.110 
I believe I played in sin yay in this
game<00:07:04.680> I<00:07:04.830> actually<00:07:04.979> played<00:07:05.310> a<00:07:05.340> very<00:07:05.729> much<00:07:05.970> a

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 
game I actually played a very much a

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.960 
game I actually played a very much a
second<00:07:06.600> team<00:07:06.750> but<00:07:07.260> that<00:07:07.290> was<00:07:07.740> a<00:07:07.770> monster<00:07:08.340> shot

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970 
second team but that was a monster shot

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.219 
second team but that was a monster shot
I<00:07:09.120> think<00:07:09.180> it<00:07:09.479> was<00:07:09.570> from<00:07:09.720> Nazeri

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229 
I think it was from Nazeri

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:11.870 
I think it was from Nazeri
but<00:07:10.680> agüero<00:07:10.979> there<00:07:11.340> with<00:07:11.520> that<00:07:11.639> killer

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
but agüero there with that killer

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.790 
but agüero there with that killer
instinct<00:07:12.419> I<00:07:12.479> managed<00:07:12.780> to<00:07:12.810> clean<00:07:13.199> up<00:07:13.380> but

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 
instinct I managed to clean up but

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.800 
instinct I managed to clean up but
