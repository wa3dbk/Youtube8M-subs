deal<00:02:30.490> i<00:02:30.850> put<00:02:31.240> it<00:02:31.330> down<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.660> was<00:02:31.750> perfect<00:02:32.200> as

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
deal i put it down it was perfect as

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.260 
deal i put it down it was perfect as
long<00:02:32.350> as<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.680> screens<00:02:32.950> clean<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.880> can<00:02:34.060> see

long as the screens clean you can see

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.580 
long as the screens clean you can see
that<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.690> know<00:02:34.810> with<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.050> mirror<00:02:35.410> on

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
that you know with the mirror on

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.800 
that you know with the mirror on
obviously<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.400> get<00:02:36.490> a<00:02:36.550> full<00:02:36.850> Muir<00:02:37.120> look<00:02:37.450> so

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
obviously you get a full Muir look so

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.870 
obviously you get a full Muir look so
you<00:02:38.800> can<00:02:38.950> see<00:02:39.070> yourself<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.700> everything

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
you can see yourself and everything

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.240 
you can see yourself and everything
around<00:02:40.060> when<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:40.840> activate<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.470> phone<00:02:41.740> it

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
around when you activate the phone it

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.430 
around when you activate the phone it
does<00:02:42.490> clear<00:02:42.820> up<00:02:43.000> quite<00:02:43.240> a<00:02:43.270> bit<00:02:43.510> it's<00:02:43.930> not<00:02:44.200> I

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
does clear up quite a bit it's not I

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.340 
does clear up quite a bit it's not I
would<00:02:44.620> say<00:02:44.830> you<00:02:44.890> know<00:02:45.220> crystal<00:02:45.640> clear<00:02:45.850> but<00:02:46.350> you

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
would say you know crystal clear but you

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.930 
would say you know crystal clear but you
know<00:02:47.470> it's<00:02:47.709> not<00:02:47.920> dull<00:02:48.310> either<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:48.850> can

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
know it's not dull either you can

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.310 
know it's not dull either you can
definitely<00:02:49.090> tell<00:02:49.300> there's<00:02:49.420> something<00:02:49.660> on<00:02:50.080> the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
definitely tell there's something on the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.070 
definitely tell there's something on the
screen<00:02:50.470> but<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:51.430> remarkable<00:02:52.000> how<00:02:52.360> much<00:02:52.840> of

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
screen but it's remarkable how much of

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.570 
screen but it's remarkable how much of
the<00:02:53.200> mirror<00:02:53.500> pneus<00:02:53.800> if<00:02:54.070> that's<00:02:54.250> even<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.550> word

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
the mirror pneus if that's even a word

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.900 
the mirror pneus if that's even a word
goes<00:02:55.420> away<00:02:55.630> when<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.590> turn<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.800> screen<00:02:56.950> on<00:02:57.310> so

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
goes away when you turn the screen on so

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.420 
goes away when you turn the screen on so
you<00:02:57.970> can't<00:02:58.450> really<00:02:58.540> see<00:02:58.780> any<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.650> LCD<00:03:00.190> hair

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
you can't really see any of the LCD hair

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.040 
you can't really see any of the LCD hair
but<00:03:00.610> when<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:00.790> activate<00:03:01.240> that<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.870> know<00:03:01.990> you

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
but when you activate that you know you

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.900 
but when you activate that you know you
can<00:03:02.260> see<00:03:02.470> everything<00:03:02.860> just<00:03:03.100> fine<00:03:03.400> it's

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
can see everything just fine it's

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.500 
can see everything just fine it's
totally<00:03:04.590> slick<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.830> glossy<00:03:06.340> feeling<00:03:06.850> doesn't

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
totally slick and glossy feeling doesn't

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.730 
totally slick and glossy feeling doesn't
seem<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.780> add<00:03:07.900> too<00:03:08.200> much<00:03:08.350> in<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.620> way<00:03:08.650> of

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
seem to add too much in the way of

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.250 
seem to add too much in the way of
fingerprints<00:03:09.430> either<00:03:09.580> they<00:03:10.510> do<00:03:10.570> like<00:03:10.930> kind<00:03:11.200> of

fingerprints either they do like kind of
just<00:03:11.320> dissipate<00:03:11.920> as<00:03:12.100> you<00:03:12.250> big<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.610> on<00:03:12.730> there<00:03:13.030> as

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
just dissipate as you big it on there as

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.449 
just dissipate as you big it on there as
far<00:03:13.900> as<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.260> clear<00:03:14.530> one<00:03:14.709> a<00:03:14.890> little<00:03:15.310> bit

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
far as the clear one a little bit

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.220 
far as the clear one a little bit
tougher<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.910> install<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.540> especially<00:03:17.110> on

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
tougher to install that especially on

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.949 
tougher to install that especially on
the<00:03:17.350> white<00:03:17.590> iphone<00:03:17.860> 5<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.760> didn't<00:03:19.540> get<00:03:19.630> full

the white iphone 5 I didn't get full

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.380 
the white iphone 5 I didn't get full
