00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659 

okay<00:00:00.719> let's<00:00:00.960> look<00:00:01.110> at<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.410> sea<00:00:01.680> Dorian<00:00:02.250> skit

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
okay let's look at the sea Dorian skit

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.640 
okay let's look at the sea Dorian skit
scale<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.179> little<00:00:03.449> closer<00:00:03.659> let's<00:00:04.290> look<00:00:04.440> at<00:00:04.560> it

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
scale a little closer let's look at it

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.769 
scale a little closer let's look at it
in<00:00:04.740> terms<00:00:04.799> of<00:00:05.160> its<00:00:05.339> scale<00:00:05.580> degrees<00:00:05.970> so<00:00:06.750> we

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
in terms of its scale degrees so we

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.470 
in terms of its scale degrees so we
start<00:00:07.140> with<00:00:07.170> C<00:00:07.470> now<00:00:07.649> all<00:00:07.890> right<00:00:10.610> if<00:00:11.610> C<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.000> one

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
start with C now all right if C is one

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.250 
start with C now all right if C is one
and<00:00:12.809> we're<00:00:13.200> doing<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.500> Dorian<00:00:15.440> see<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.770> one<00:00:18.080> D<00:00:19.080> is

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
and we're doing a Dorian see is one D is

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.450 
and we're doing a Dorian see is one D is
to<00:00:19.619> just<00:00:20.250> like<00:00:20.400> normal<00:00:21.050> now<00:00:22.050> e<00:00:22.350> flat<00:00:23.130> instead

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
to just like normal now e flat instead

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.920 
to just like normal now e flat instead
of<00:00:23.670> E<00:00:23.910> that's<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.390> flat<00:00:24.750> three<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.650> got<00:00:25.800> 1<00:00:26.039> 2

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
of E that's a flat three so we got 1 2

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:37.880 
of E that's a flat three so we got 1 2
flat<00:00:27.930> 3<00:00:28.310> f<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.760> for<00:00:31.369> G<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:33.890> 5a<00:00:35.719> is<00:00:36.719> six<00:00:37.620> it's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
flat 3 f is for G is 5a is six it's

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.360 
flat 3 f is for G is 5a is six it's
normal<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.700> then<00:00:38.760> B<00:00:39.239> flat<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> flat<00:00:40.170> 7<00:00:40.620> go

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
normal but then B flat is a flat 7 go

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.030 
normal but then B flat is a flat 7 go
back<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.700> one<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> flat<00:00:43.559> 3<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
back to one so we have a flat 3 and a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.340 
back to one so we have a flat 3 and a
flat<00:00:44.280> 7<00:00:44.760> which<00:00:45.210> really<00:00:45.510> defines<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.200> where

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
flat 7 which really defines that where

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:57.889 
flat 7 which really defines that where
I'd<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> Dorian<00:00:47.719> scale<00:00:49.010> 1<00:00:50.010> 2<00:00:51.000> 3<00:00:52.730> 4<00:00:54.350> 5<00:00:56.120> 6<00:00:57.120> flat

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
I'd have a Dorian scale 1 2 3 4 5 6 flat

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.149 
I'd have a Dorian scale 1 2 3 4 5 6 flat
7<00:00:58.010> 1<00:00:59.010> 2<00:00:59.489> flat<00:00:59.940> 3<00:00:59.969> 4<00:01:00.600> 5<00:01:01.050> 6<00:01:01.620> flat<00:01:02.160> 7<00:01:02.190> 1

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.340 

this<00:01:05.789> would<00:01:05.969> also<00:01:06.119> indicate<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.960> us<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.259> we

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
this would also indicate for us that we

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.819 
this would also indicate for us that we
are<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.499> the<00:01:07.590> key<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.799> B<00:01:08.219> flat<00:01:08.249> major<00:01:09.829> okay

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
are in the key of B flat major okay

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.430 
are in the key of B flat major okay
because<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.609> would<00:01:11.759> be<00:01:11.850> our<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.210> onion

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.400 

and<00:01:16.190> then<00:01:16.760> C<00:01:17.000> would<00:01:17.240> be<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.450> Dorian<00:01:17.930> it<00:01:18.110> has

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
and then C would be the Dorian it has

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:25.120 
and then C would be the Dorian it has
the<00:01:18.620> same<00:01:18.830> notes<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.610> different<00:01:22.940> order<00:01:24.130> okay

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
the same notes in a different order okay

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.760 
the same notes in a different order okay
now<00:01:25.760> let's<00:01:26.060> move<00:01:26.600> this<00:01:26.840> get<00:01:27.170> this<00:01:27.350> movable

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
now let's move this get this movable

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.700 
now let's move this get this movable
Dorian<00:01:28.610> shaped<00:01:28.910> up<00:01:29.150> to<00:01:29.330> E<00:01:29.360> flat<00:01:29.830> okay<00:01:30.830> you<00:01:31.520> flat

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
Dorian shaped up to E flat okay you flat

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:47.710 
Dorian shaped up to E flat okay you flat
G<00:01:33.710> flat<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:34.930> G<00:01:39.820> flat<00:01:40.990> G<00:01:41.990> flat<00:01:42.020> E<00:01:45.280> flat<00:01:46.280> sorry<00:01:46.880> f<00:01:47.180> G

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
G flat a G flat G flat E flat sorry f G

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.860 
G flat a G flat G flat E flat sorry f G
flat<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:48.800> think<00:01:49.040> that<00:01:49.160> was<00:01:49.250> right<00:01:49.660> okay<00:01:50.660> a

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
flat and think that was right okay a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.870 
flat and think that was right okay a
flat<00:01:51.680> B<00:01:52.100> flat<00:01:52.130> C<00:01:53.050> D<00:01:54.050> flat<00:01:54.920> E<00:01:55.720> flat<00:01:56.920> okay<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.610> same

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
flat B flat C D flat E flat okay so same

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.670 
flat B flat C D flat E flat okay so same
scale<00:01:59.300> degrees<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.780> are<00:01:59.810> altered<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.500> it

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
scale degrees that are altered and it

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.530 
scale degrees that are altered and it
will<00:02:00.890> be<00:02:01.040> in<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.220> key<00:02:01.340> of<00:02:01.370> D<00:02:01.640> flat<00:02:01.880> if<00:02:02.150> this<00:02:02.360> was

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
will be in the key of D flat if this was

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:11.229 
will be in the key of D flat if this was
the<00:02:02.570> case<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.780> that's<00:02:08.899> your<00:02:09.020> doing
