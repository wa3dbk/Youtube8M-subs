time and I've been really thinking about

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.959 
time and I've been really thinking about
um<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:29.160> guess<00:00:30.090> weird<00:00:30.330> ahead<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.900> like<00:00:31.380> we're<00:00:31.590> to

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
um I guess weird ahead to like we're to

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.979 
um I guess weird ahead to like we're to
spend<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> rest<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.300> my<00:00:33.360> life<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:33.870> which

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
spend the rest of my life like which

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.080 
spend the rest of my life like which
college<00:00:34.500> which<00:00:34.920> study<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.399> do<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.790> stuff<00:00:35.969> like

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.060 
college which study to do and stuff like
that<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:37.050> that's<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.469> main<00:00:37.620> reason<00:00:37.649> why<00:00:38.040> i

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
that so that's the main reason why i

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.940 
that so that's the main reason why i
haven't<00:00:38.250> been<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.610> um<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:40.079> also<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.800> guys

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.450 
know RuneScape's kind of taking over my
life<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.829> it's<00:00:55.829> really<00:00:56.010> not<00:00:56.250> doing

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
life and it's it's really not doing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.040 
life and it's it's really not doing
anything<00:00:56.760> positive<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.570> kind<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.840> getting

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
anything positive it's kind of getting

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.770 
anything positive it's kind of getting
my<00:00:58.260> mind<00:00:58.980> off<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.280> things<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.329> really<00:01:00.629> need

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
my mind off of things and I really need

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.510

to be focusing on school and things that
will<00:01:02.670> actually<00:01:02.789> matter<00:01:03.180> later<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.660> life<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.140> I

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100

something like that I'm stuff I don't

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.219 
something like that I'm stuff I don't
really<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.939> anything<00:01:48.180> left<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.750> my<00:01:48.899> account

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
really have anything left on my account

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.530 
really have anything left on my account
um<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.640> guess<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:51.060> what's<00:01:51.360> been

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
um so I guess that's what's been

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.170 
um so I guess that's what's been
hindering<00:01:51.960> me<00:01:52.110> from<00:01:52.140> getting<00:01:52.680> 90<00:01:53.520> crafting

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
hindering me from getting 90 crafting

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.420 
hindering me from getting 90 crafting
and<00:01:54.420> 90<00:01:54.689> mining<00:01:55.049> I'm<00:01:55.799> not<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.130> sure<00:01:56.250> if

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
and 90 mining I'm not really sure if

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.209 
and 90 mining I'm not really sure if
i'll<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.700> enough<00:01:57.000> cash<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.299> get<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.750> 90

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
i'll have enough cash to get to 90

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.069 
i'll have enough cash to get to 90
crafting<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.340> way<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> wanted<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:01.049> I

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
crafting the way that I wanted to so I

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.080 
crafting the way that I wanted to so I
might<00:02:01.380> end<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.710> doing<00:02:01.770> something<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.729> gold

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
might end up doing something like gold

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.929 
might end up doing something like gold
so<00:02:03.600> that'll<00:02:03.869> be<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> lot<00:02:04.649> cheaper<00:02:04.820> for<00:02:05.820> me<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
so that'll be a lot cheaper for me to

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.290 
so that'll be a lot cheaper for me to
get<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.149> 90<00:02:06.630> um<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:08.220> yeah<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.700> hope<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.149> guys

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
get to 90 um but yeah I hope you guys

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.699 
get to 90 um but yeah I hope you guys
