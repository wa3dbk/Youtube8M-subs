00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.340
 hello friends how are we on this occasion 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.620
 is I bring the games and applications that 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.530
 we can find for free on July 8 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.330
 of 2015 many people had us 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.710
 asked that we return with the series and 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.990
 many people had not said that 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.430
 because we stopped doing the series and good 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.980
 because it was simply because of the lack of 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.570
 support that he was given to give me always 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.820
 I have told you while you support 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.210
 this series we keep doing 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.310
 the videos remember this series I think that 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.190
 is the most difficult to do because 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:41.120
 because we have to record edit and upload 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.760
 all the same day and as fast 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.980
 possible or whether we have to do everything in 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.020
 less than one or two hours and really 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.790
 it costs a lot of work the only thing that 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.190
 I ask is that they share the videos that 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.020
 support the series that leave their like and if 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.780
 they want your comment really friends 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.970
 your support is very very very important for 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.340
 those people who care about 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.590
 leave the likes or comment on youtube 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.780
 I repeat it again it does not pay us because 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.150
 you comment youtube does not pay us for 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.680
 that you leave your like the 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.509
 monetization of the videos is 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.550
 completely different is by means of 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.190
 advertisements 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.410
 but to you we say that it does not affect them 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.330
 in nothing to leave its like its comment in 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.760
