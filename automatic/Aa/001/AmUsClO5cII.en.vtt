00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:08.809
 well this is a manual to show 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.780
 how to send a signal message 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.950
 text and a phone call through 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.849
 of a gsm and comsat module with a 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.119
 arduino card one we have mounted the 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.119
 system 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.600
 and we have our programming done in 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.600
 the computer 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.880
 the idea is that there is a switch that 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.370
 activate twice sends a message 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.020
 text to a phone and a call 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.020
 cell phone to another phone 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.570
 let's go to the land with us the bridge 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.570
 and it has to be reflected in the computer 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.829
 and we have a contact 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.960
 and we have the other contact 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.260
 you see the green light go down and you must 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.260
 get the call to the phone 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.180
 and then that's going to send a message of 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.180
 text to the other cell phone 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.440
 you 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.470
 so I do not know very well what it says but 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.920
 by carrying a text message from 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:40.440
 mobile 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.440
 and after that the green light goes out 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.650
 the system is fully operational 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.100
 to work and redo the same 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.100
 cycle
