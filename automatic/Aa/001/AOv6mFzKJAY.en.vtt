kissing<00:01:06.390> anyone<00:01:06.570> wearing<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.080> lipstick<00:01:07.439> is

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
kissing anyone wearing this lipstick is

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.219 
kissing anyone wearing this lipstick is
a<00:01:07.740> very<00:01:08.159> transferable<00:01:08.880> lipstick<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.930> I've

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
a very transferable lipstick and I've

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
a very transferable lipstick and I've
only<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.619> put<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.250> potentially

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
only just put it on so it potentially

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.270 
only just put it on so it potentially
may<00:01:12.000> dry<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:12.810> bit<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> stick

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
may dry a little bit but it is a stick

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.890 
may dry a little bit but it is a stick
formula<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> doubt<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.540> gonna<00:01:15.659> dry

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
formula so I doubt that it's gonna dry

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.270 
formula so I doubt that it's gonna dry
and<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> cream<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.680> matte<00:01:16.799> lipstick<00:01:17.130> will

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and like a cream to matte lipstick will

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.630 
and like a cream to matte lipstick will
but<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.720> like<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
but I like it

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.130 
but I like it
the<00:01:20.640> only<00:01:20.759> thing<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.060> will<00:01:21.210> say<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.960> this

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the only thing I will say about and this

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.740 
the only thing I will say about and this
shape<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> lipstick<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.060> not<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> best

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
shape of the lipstick is not the best

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.179 
shape of the lipstick is not the best
for<00:01:25.049> applying<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.710> might<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:25.890> better<00:01:26.070> off

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
for applying so you might be better off

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.490 
for applying so you might be better off
using<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.549> brush<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.810> next<00:01:28.110> color<00:01:28.290> I'm<00:01:28.409> going

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
the formula of all of them but I have

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.320 
the formula of all of them but I have
found<00:04:52.220> some<00:04:52.490> of<00:04:52.580> them<00:04:52.729> to<00:04:52.850> be<00:04:52.970> a<00:04:53.000> little<00:04:53.180> bit

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
found some of them to be a little bit

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.180 
found some of them to be a little bit
dry<00:04:53.479> a<00:04:53.510> little<00:04:53.690> bit<00:04:53.840> gritty<00:04:54.140> I<00:04:54.470> think<00:04:54.979> it<00:04:55.070> might

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
dry a little bit gritty I think it might

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.950 
dry a little bit gritty I think it might

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.810 
comes in with the being kind of a
natural<00:04:57.500> makeup<00:04:57.650> brand<00:04:58.130> they<00:04:58.280> meant<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.490> feel

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
natural makeup brand they meant to feel

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.820 
natural makeup brand they meant to feel
sort<00:04:59.120> of<00:04:59.150> real<00:04:59.479> and<00:04:59.810> they<00:04:59.900> don't<00:05:00.050> feel<00:05:00.260> too

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
sort of real and they don't feel too

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.890 
sort of real and they don't feel too
smooth<00:05:01.250> and<00:05:01.520> fake<00:05:01.850> I<00:05:02.120> feel<00:05:02.570> like<00:05:02.660> they<00:05:02.750> will

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
smooth and fake I feel like they will

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.290 
smooth and fake I feel like they will
stay<00:05:03.320> a<00:05:03.560> long<00:05:03.830> time<00:05:04.160> they<00:05:04.430> really<00:05:04.700> grip<00:05:05.000> to

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
stay a long time they really grip to

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.170 
stay a long time they really grip to
your<00:05:05.450> lips<00:05:05.630> and<00:05:06.070> but<00:05:07.070> on<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.550> plus<00:05:07.729> side<00:05:07.789> too

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
your lips and but on the plus side too

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.990 
your lips and but on the plus side too
that<00:05:08.360> they<00:05:08.900> wipe<00:05:09.320> off<00:05:09.560> very<00:05:10.039> very<00:05:10.190> easily<00:05:10.460> then

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
that they wipe off very very easily then

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.400 
that they wipe off very very easily then
don't<00:05:11.210> stain<00:05:11.600> which<00:05:11.870> is<00:05:12.020> something<00:05:12.169> that's

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
don't stain which is something that's

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.350 
don't stain which is something that's
really<00:05:12.590> important

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.179 

and<00:05:17.810> especially<00:05:18.080> with<00:05:18.409> the<00:05:18.470> dark<00:05:18.830> colors

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:19.189 
and especially with the dark colors

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:20.499 
and especially with the dark colors
which<00:05:19.340> I<00:05:19.490> would<00:05:19.610> think<00:05:19.759> the<00:05:19.939> dark<00:05:20.150> ones<00:05:20.360> would

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
which I would think the dark ones would

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.540 
which I would think the dark ones would
stain<00:05:20.780> but<00:05:21.439> they<00:05:21.590> don't<00:05:21.800> they<00:05:22.039> wipe<00:05:22.220> straight

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
stain but they don't they wipe straight

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.920 
stain but they don't they wipe straight
off<00:05:22.669> and<00:05:22.939> leave<00:05:23.090> your<00:05:23.210> lips<00:05:23.360> your<00:05:23.599> normal

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
off and leave your lips your normal

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.240 
off and leave your lips your normal
color<00:05:24.110> without<00:05:24.289> even<00:05:24.620> a<00:05:24.680> hint<00:05:24.830> of<00:05:24.949> the<00:05:25.069> color

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
color without even a hint of the color

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.589
