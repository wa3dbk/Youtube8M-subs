thinking and midget technology so this

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.590 
thinking and midget technology so this
was<00:01:49.710> number<00:01:50.009> seven<00:01:50.280> built<00:01:51.090> by<00:01:51.329> by<00:01:52.159> Curtis<00:01:53.159> and

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
was number seven built by by Curtis and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.780 
was number seven built by by Curtis and
in<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.840> my<00:01:55.500> dad<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.890> very<00:01:55.950> fortunate<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.640> have

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
in it my dad was very fortunate to have

in it my dad was very fortunate to have
it<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.149> then<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:58.619> came<00:01:58.799> along<00:01:59.159> and

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
it and then as it came along and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.160 
it and then as it came along and
everybody<00:01:59.759> understood<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.450> completely

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
everybody understood it completely

correct in that what was probably the

correct in that what was probably the
most<00:02:08.119> earth-shaking<00:02:09.119> thing<00:02:09.539> about<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.899> is

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
most earth-shaking thing about this is

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.390 
most earth-shaking thing about this is
the<00:02:10.170> fact<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.440> was<00:02:10.619> powered<00:02:10.920> by<00:02:10.979> ford

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the fact that was powered by ford

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.490 
the fact that was powered by ford
flathead<00:02:11.610> rather<00:02:12.030> than<00:02:12.120> off

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
flathead rather than off

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.430 
flathead rather than off
our<00:02:12.560> motor<00:02:12.890> well<00:02:13.580> they<00:02:13.700> had<00:02:13.850> two<00:02:14.030> circuits<00:02:14.480> not

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
our motor well they had two circuits not

our motor well they had two circuits not
everybody<00:02:15.770> could<00:02:15.950> afford<00:02:16.220> an<00:02:16.550> Offenhauser

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
everybody could afford an Offenhauser

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.140 
everybody could afford an Offenhauser
motor<00:02:17.480> number<00:02:17.840> one<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:19.340> they<00:02:19.460> so<00:02:19.760> they<00:02:19.880> had

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
motor number one and so they so they had

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.170 
motor number one and so they so they had
a<00:02:20.180> flathead<00:02:20.590> v8<00:02:21.590> 60<00:02:21.980> circuit<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.760> they<00:02:22.970> had<00:02:23.150> a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
a flathead v8 60 circuit and they had a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.810 
a flathead v8 60 circuit and they had a
at<00:02:23.960> an<00:02:24.050> Offenhauser<00:02:24.430> what<00:02:25.430> they<00:02:25.520> call<00:02:25.700> the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
at an Offenhauser what they call the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.970 
at an Offenhauser what they call the
blue<00:02:25.970> circuit<00:02:26.360> this<00:02:26.510> was<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.720> red<00:02:26.990> circuit<00:02:27.410> now

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
blue circuit this was a red circuit now

blue circuit this was a red circuit now
my<00:02:28.370> dad<00:02:28.610> first<00:02:28.850> built<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.780> v8<00:02:30.620> 60<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.540> he

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
my dad first built the v8 60 and he

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.490 
my dad first built the v8 60 and he
bought<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:33.580> in<00:02:34.580> nineteen<00:02:35.150> late<00:02:35.450> 45<00:02:36.110> early

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
bought that in in nineteen late 45 early

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.850 
bought that in in nineteen late 45 early
46<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.370> then<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:38.020> 1947<00:02:39.020> he<00:02:39.140> built<00:02:39.380> an<00:02:39.500> off<00:02:39.650> he

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
46 and then in 1947 he built an off he

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.880 
46 and then in 1947 he built an off he
and<00:02:40.070> he<00:02:40.520> ran<00:02:40.700> both<00:02:40.910> cars<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.480> when<00:02:42.230> he<00:02:42.320> did<00:02:42.620> out

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
and he ran both cars and when he did out

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.670 
and he ran both cars and when he did out
of<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.880> seven<00:02:44.360> days<00:02:44.570> a<00:02:44.600> week<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:45.140> were<00:02:45.260> recent

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
of the seven days a week you were recent

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.430 
of the seven days a week you were recent
five<00:02:45.890> days<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:47.390> then<00:02:47.750> trying<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.170> run<00:02:48.320> his

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
five days and and then trying to run his

five days and and then trying to run his
little<00:02:48.709> business<00:02:49.070> he<00:02:49.670> could<00:02:49.820> only<00:02:49.970> do<00:02:50.150> that

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
little business he could only do that

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.449 
little business he could only do that
for<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.630> year<00:02:50.900> but<00:02:51.230> he<00:02:51.650> did<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:51.890> up<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.160> down<00:02:52.310> the

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
for a year but he did it up and down the

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.190 
for a year but he did it up and down the
coast<00:02:52.700> but<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.209> important<00:02:53.600> part<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:53.959> car

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.010 
coast but the important part of this car
is<00:02:54.380> is<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:55.310> fact<00:02:55.550> that<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:55.850> was<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.390> first<00:02:56.750> car

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
is is the fact that it was the first car

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.090 
is is the fact that it was the first car
ever<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.739> run<00:02:57.950> nitromethane<00:02:58.580> in<00:02:58.820> in<00:02:59.950> in<00:03:00.950> the

where my father's little shop was and

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.979 
where my father's little shop was and
they<00:03:09.800> had<00:03:10.070> already<00:03:10.390> found<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.570> because<00:03:11.870> they

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
they had already found it because they

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.810 
they had already found it because they
had<00:03:12.170> slot<00:03:12.620> cars<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.160> they<00:03:13.310> used<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.640> race

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
had slot cars that they used to race

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.180 
had slot cars that they used to race
look<00:03:14.209> then<00:03:14.600> if<00:03:14.989> you<00:03:15.110> buy<00:03:15.260> one<00:03:15.530> if<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.800> find<00:03:16.100> one

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
look then if you buy one if you find one

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.190 
look then if you buy one if you find one
today<00:03:16.400> it's<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.790> very<00:03:16.970> rare<00:03:17.269> thing<00:03:17.570> to<00:03:17.630> have<00:03:17.900> and

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
today it's a very rare thing to have and

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.039 
today it's a very rare thing to have and
they<00:03:18.650> raced<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:18.980> on<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.130> slot<00:03:19.459> track<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.060> they

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
they raced it on a slot track and they

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.220 
they raced it on a slot track and they
had<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.350> go<00:03:21.470> fast<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:22.360> they<00:03:23.360> they<00:03:23.840> found<00:03:24.110> this

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
had to go fast and they they found this

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.900 
had to go fast and they they found this
