00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.380 
then we have four quicks one two three
four<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.469> then<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:02.040> finish<00:02:02.369> up<00:02:02.549> with<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> basic

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
four and then we finish up with a basic

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.819 
four and then we finish up with a basic
left<00:02:03.780> turn<00:02:04.049> slow<00:02:04.829> slow<00:02:05.790> side<00:02:06.719> together<00:02:06.930> let's

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
left turn slow slow side together let's

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.400 
left turn slow slow side together let's
try<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.099> again<00:02:08.160> from<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.520> different<00:02:08.610> angle

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
try it again from a different angle

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.949 
try it again from a different angle
ready<00:02:10.430> we're<00:02:11.430> going<00:02:11.670> outside<00:02:12.030> partner<00:02:12.450> with

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
ready we're going outside partner with

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.180 
ready we're going outside partner with
the<00:02:13.050> first<00:02:13.260> two<00:02:13.410> steps<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.830> a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the first two steps of a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.140 
the first two steps of a

four grapevine one two three four and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.700 
four grapevine one two three four and
then<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.690> basic<00:02:18.900> left<00:02:19.290> turn

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
then a basic left turn

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.750 
then a basic left turn
slow<00:02:20.010> slow<00:02:21.080> side<00:02:22.080> together<00:02:22.550> let's<00:02:23.550> take<00:02:23.730> a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
slow slow side together let's take a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.140 
slow slow side together let's take a
look<00:02:23.970> at<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.510> ladies<00:02:24.780> footwork<00:02:25.640> ladies<00:02:26.640> first

two<00:02:27.330> steps<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.780> zigzag<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.650> was

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
two steps of a zigzag just like it was

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.640 
two steps of a zigzag just like it was
for<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.980> guys<00:02:29.160> ready<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.910> slow<00:02:30.750> slow<00:02:31.380> and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
then four grapevines one two three four

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.510 
then four grapevines one two three four
and<00:02:35.070> then<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> basic<00:02:36.210> left<00:02:36.930> turn<00:02:37.920> nothing

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
and then a basic left turn nothing

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.820 
and then a basic left turn nothing
