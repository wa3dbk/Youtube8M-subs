 Speak beauty guys, we got here and today. 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.070
 continuing with the series of premieres of 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.630
 planting versus ongs 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.870

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.490

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.039
 roll up more early workouts to 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.420
 show you guys stay in mansion phase 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.609
 of the sambÃ£o 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.650
 if you have playing with the plants 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.260
 You will be born on the opposite side of easter. 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.260
 egg that are born the subs 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.060
 arriving at the bottom of the mansion you go 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.040
 find a tree zapped with faces says 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.960
 an ea and you can use it as 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.570
 reference to find the easter egg 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.310
 near the tree will have a rock with the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.030
 car destroyed on top of it 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.020
 if you look closely the side you will see the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.030
 islanders in the forest 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.710
 but for this regime I can not see 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.770
 Nothing there to tell the truth, me too. 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.700
 I did not really see anything in my game. 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.770
 did not appear 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.330
 just so said after that 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.330
 the pc version came out 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.550
 they took it from there anyway I 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.560
 I have a video here that reminds us of 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.560
 The forest is still and I'm going to show it to you. 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.560
 but the easter egg does not end there after 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.869
 cite the president 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.119
 they will not completely remove slayer 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.579
 he just changed it from place 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.740
 he happened to be found a little 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.909
 more to the right being devoured by 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.909
 a carnivorous plant 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.780
 three fifth laender next premiere 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.759
 is in the garden gallery phase and writes 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.869
 is very easy to find because 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:12.280
 have several of them spread throughout the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.280
 one hour or another someone finds 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.090
 this being is that it is a viral 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.400
 so there's plenty on the internet 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.400
 and you will only be able to see if you 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.640
 have been playing a test in doing what 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.280
 the pc but because I say this is good 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.320
 because the game has a render 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.410
 mediocre on last generation consoles 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.350
 and making this easter egg impossible 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.750
 be seen or by an image of the version of 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.280
 xbox of the year so you can see the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.800
 easter egg 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.260
 I think everybody already recognized the 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.570
 that is written there on the wall, right? 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.310
 this is a reference to goodbye fox ei 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.950
 not come last year or late 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.050
 I remember when you left when you viralized today. 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.050
 in ii but the cool video until 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.630
 only boot that the brother on the achievement is 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.490
 very strange and thus leave this 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.620
 wall with an easter egg on it 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.210
 the other walls of the game are not as 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.210
 Sweaty like this, you'll understand. 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.020
 good guys so this is I hope 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.690

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.910
 Let me like it and share the video. 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.800

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.290
