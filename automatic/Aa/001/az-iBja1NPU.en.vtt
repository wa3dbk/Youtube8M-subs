00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 I want to learn maths sign up 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.220
 come with me 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.019
 hello speaking module the absolute value 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.769
 absolute value is a number without 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.330
 signal 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.940
 it is as if you have compared the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.980
 numbers to know the distance that it 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.619
 is at zero that the origin 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.420
 so I draw number line here that 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.470
 represents the integers because I 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.689
 I put oz 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.849
 then we have to right from zero 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.590
 we have the positive numbers and the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.939
 from zero we have the numbers 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.650
 negative 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.860
 so to know for example the distance 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.719
 that the number minus three states 10 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.930
 we have to know which module is 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.820
 least three modules of -3 equals 3 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.129
 It's an unsigned number so it wants to 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.039
 say that the minus three is 13 units 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.469
 to the left of zero it is three units 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.899
 less than 10 since he is at the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.750
 left 10 is a negative number and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.039
 module for example four would be 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.629
 equal to four 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.480
 that means what's four more 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.289
 here are four units to the right of the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.270
 zero 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.939
 he is on the positive side of the goal 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.299
 numerically and if the following 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.500
 question what is the largest number - 4 or 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.720
 minus 3 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.830
 many people replied that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.990
 at least four 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.710
 but this is not what happens men are 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.880
 negative numbers the -4-modulus is the same 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.320
 to four 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.869
 modulus of -3 is equal to 34 is greater than 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.070
 3 also in negative numbers this 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.020
 logic is reversed 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.159
 then a number minus four like him 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.659
 comes before - 3 - 13 is a unit 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.600
 greater than 1 - 4 therefore less 4 in this 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:48.090
 if here is smaller with at least three stores - 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:51.930
 31 more or less 3 is greater than the least 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.970
 four positive numbers are already 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.530
 asked what the biggest swell more 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.170
 three or more 4 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.920
 obviously with a further 4 is to the right of 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.040
 three more 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.790
 it is a larger unit and three more in the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.430
 globe 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.099
 the number plus four is greater than the most 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.289
 three 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.280
 then for the negative numbers the logic 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.560
 it reverses 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.349
 the larger the module 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.140
 the smaller number it will actually be 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.020
 that the minus sign causes that 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.400
 module is left to the left of the 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.170
 zero 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.660
 I hope it has become clear 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.709
 absolute value we see in the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.280
 next videos 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.280
 thank you very much
