pulling over off the freeway and finding
somewhat<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.760> quiet<00:02:35.030> little<00:02:35.270> colder<00:02:35.690> sack

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
somewhat of a quiet little colder sack

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.330 
somewhat of a quiet little colder sack
to<00:02:36.110> park<00:02:36.320> this<00:02:36.470> thing<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.920> sleep<00:02:37.130> for<00:02:37.310> the

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
to park this thing and sleep for the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.650 
to park this thing and sleep for the
night<00:02:37.490> when<00:02:37.790> we're<00:02:37.940> traveling<00:02:38.390> long

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
night when we're traveling long

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.420 
night when we're traveling long
distances<00:02:40.570> they'll<00:02:41.570> save<00:02:41.810> us<00:02:41.840> Hotel<00:02:42.430> we've

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
distances they'll save us Hotel we've

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.770 
distances they'll save us Hotel we've
always<00:02:43.580> had<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.850> get<00:02:43.910> hotels<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.480> stuff<00:02:44.630> like

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
always had to get hotels and stuff like

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.980 
always had to get hotels and stuff like
that<00:02:44.990> along<00:02:45.290> trips<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:46.220> mean<00:02:47.000> from<00:02:47.330> California

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
that along trips I mean from California

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.250 
that along trips I mean from California
to<00:02:48.230> say<00:02:48.560> like<00:02:49.330> Canada<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.570> last<00:02:50.810> trip<00:02:51.050> that<00:02:51.080> we

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
to say like Canada the last trip that we

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.790 
to say like Canada the last trip that we
did<00:02:52.120> we<00:02:53.120> had<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.390> get<00:02:53.540> lots<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.260> hotels<00:02:54.620> along

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
did we had to get lots of hotels along

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.670 
did we had to get lots of hotels along
the<00:02:55.070> way<00:02:55.330> not<00:02:56.330> lots<00:02:56.960> but<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.290> mean<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.560> whole

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
the way not lots but I mean the whole

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.550 
the way not lots but I mean the whole
week<00:02:58.130> long<00:02:58.400> trip<00:02:59.060> or<00:02:59.360> week<00:03:00.020> and<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.200> half<00:03:00.230> long

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
week long trip or week and a half long

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.600 
week long trip or week and a half long
trip<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.100> think<00:03:01.550> we<00:03:01.820> ended<00:03:01.910> up<00:03:02.060> getting<00:03:02.240> like<00:03:02.540> a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
trip I think we ended up getting like a

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.270 
trip I think we ended up getting like a
hotel<00:03:04.610> every<00:03:05.060> night<00:03:05.240> so<00:03:05.600> that's<00:03:06.080> a<00:03:06.320> huge<00:03:06.650> huge

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
hotel every night so that's a huge huge

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.580 
hotel every night so that's a huge huge
huge<00:03:07.610> expense<00:03:08.180> I<00:03:10.600> think<00:03:11.600> we<00:03:11.720> got<00:03:11.870> one<00:03:12.050> in<00:03:12.170> organ

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
huge expense I think we got one in organ

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.260 
huge expense I think we got one in organ
and<00:03:13.600> slept<00:03:14.600> there<00:03:15.020> and<00:03:15.860> organ<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:16.970> then<00:03:17.060> made

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
and slept there and organ and then made

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.790 
and slept there and organ and then made
the<00:03:17.420> rest<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.810> trip<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:18.230> then<00:03:18.320> when<00:03:18.560> we<00:03:18.680> got

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
the rest the trip and then when we got

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.510 
the rest the trip and then when we got
to<00:03:19.780> Canada<00:03:20.780> we<00:03:21.320> ended<00:03:21.860> up<00:03:21.950> getting<00:03:22.130> hotels

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
to Canada we ended up getting hotels

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.250 
to Canada we ended up getting hotels
while<00:03:25.520> we<00:03:25.700> were<00:03:25.760> staying<00:03:26.060> there<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.990> so

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
while we were staying there and so

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.020 
while we were staying there and so
that's<00:03:27.440> that's<00:03:27.650> probably<00:03:27.860> like<00:03:28.190> roughly

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
that's that's probably like roughly

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.550 
that's that's probably like roughly
probably<00:03:30.160> five<00:03:31.160> four<00:03:32.150> for<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.480> week<00:03:32.930> week<00:03:33.380> and<00:03:33.500> a

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
probably five four for a week week and a

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.990 
probably five four for a week week and a
half<00:03:33.680> long<00:03:33.890> trip<00:03:34.160> that's<00:03:34.370> like<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.670> hundred

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
half long trip that's like a hundred

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.560 
half long trip that's like a hundred
dollars<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.270> night

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
dollars a night

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.880 
dollars a night
it's<00:03:35.990> like<00:03:36.320> yeah<00:03:37.070> it's<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:37.910> huge<00:03:38.150> expense<00:03:38.890> so

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
it's like yeah it's a huge expense so

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.660 
it's like yeah it's a huge expense so
this<00:03:40.070> is<00:03:40.190> going<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.430> cut<00:03:40.610> down<00:03:40.640> expenses<00:03:41.110> and

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
this is going to cut down expenses and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.390 
this is going to cut down expenses and
it's<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:44.110> Toyota<00:03:45.110> Tacoma<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:45.770> mean<00:03:46.100> it's<00:03:46.280> going

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
it's a Toyota Tacoma I mean it's going

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.720 
it's a Toyota Tacoma I mean it's going
to<00:03:46.460> be<00:03:46.550> fairly<00:03:47.500> fuel-efficient<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.770> think

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
to be fairly fuel-efficient I think

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.640 
to be fairly fuel-efficient I think
before<00:03:49.910> I<00:03:50.120> had<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.450> camper<00:03:50.810> shell<00:03:51.020> on<00:03:51.200> there<00:03:51.440> I

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
before I had the camper shell on there I

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.910 
before I had the camper shell on there I
was<00:03:52.340> getting<00:03:52.640> somewhere<00:03:52.880> between<00:03:53.120> 20<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.020> 25

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
was getting somewhere between 20 and 25

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.750 
was getting somewhere between 20 and 25
miles<00:03:55.400> per<00:03:55.580> gallon<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:58.190> camper<00:03:58.580> shell

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
miles per gallon and the camper shell

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.310 
miles per gallon and the camper shell
doesn't<00:03:58.970> weigh<00:03:59.510> a<00:03:59.540> whole<00:03:59.750> lot<00:03:59.960> I<00:03:59.990> think<00:04:00.230> it

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
doesn't weigh a whole lot I think it

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.470 
doesn't weigh a whole lot I think it
probably<00:04:00.500> weighs<00:04:00.770> maybe<00:04:01.040> about<00:04:01.310> 250<00:04:02.030> 300

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
probably weighs maybe about 250 300

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.570 
probably weighs maybe about 250 300
pounds<00:04:02.900> it's<00:04:03.560> fairly<00:04:03.830> heavy<00:04:04.220> because<00:04:04.490> it's

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
pounds it's fairly heavy because it's

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.840 
pounds it's fairly heavy because it's
fiberglass<00:04:06.520> but<00:04:08.800> it's<00:04:09.800> well<00:04:10.010> insulated<00:04:10.370> -

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
fiberglass but it's well insulated -

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.240 
fiberglass but it's well insulated -
let's<00:04:11.270> cut<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.570> Oh<00:04:11.600> site

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
let's cut the Oh site

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.740 
let's cut the Oh site
headliner<00:04:14.250> stuff<00:04:14.700> in<00:04:14.819> here<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.209> cut<00:04:15.390> down<00:04:15.540> on

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
headliner stuff in here to cut down on

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.189 
headliner stuff in here to cut down on
moisture<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.479> I<00:04:18.479> think<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.959> frame

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
moisture and and I think the frame

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.120 
moisture and and I think the frame
itself<00:04:19.620> may<00:04:20.160> weigh<00:04:20.489> about<00:04:20.910> 75<00:04:21.720> pounds<00:04:22.130> so

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
itself may weigh about 75 pounds so

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.499 
itself may weigh about 75 pounds so
we've<00:04:23.280> definitely<00:04:23.400> added<00:04:23.880> some<00:04:24.060> weight<00:04:24.270> to

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
we've definitely added some weight to

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.670 
we've definitely added some weight to
the<00:04:24.630> vehicle<00:04:25.460> but<00:04:26.460> then<00:04:26.639> again<00:04:26.729> I<00:04:27.000> think<00:04:27.060> we've

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
the vehicle but then again I think we've

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.650 
the vehicle but then again I think we've
added<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.860> little<00:04:29.009> more<00:04:29.240> aerodynamics<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.419> it

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
added a little more aerodynamics to it

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:38.210 
added a little more aerodynamics to it
so<00:04:31.110> hopefully<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:31.770> won't<00:04:32.240> notice<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.800> huge<00:04:37.220> huge

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
so hopefully I won't notice a huge huge

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.090 
so hopefully I won't notice a huge huge
jump<00:04:38.580> in<00:04:38.699> gas<00:04:38.940> efficiency<00:04:39.600> but<00:04:40.020> it<00:04:40.229> may<00:04:40.860> be<00:04:40.889> a

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
jump in gas efficiency but it may be a

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.040 
jump in gas efficiency but it may be a
little<00:04:41.370> bit<00:04:41.669> and<00:04:43.729> yeah<00:04:44.729> I<00:04:45.150> think<00:04:45.570> that's<00:04:45.870> it

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
little bit and yeah I think that's it

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
little bit and yeah I think that's it
for<00:04:46.320> this<00:04:46.740> little<00:04:46.979> video<00:04:47.190> on<00:04:47.340> my<00:04:49.070> little

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
for this little video on my little

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.689 
for this little video on my little
Toyota<00:04:51.000> Tacoma<00:04:52.190> urban<00:04:53.190> RV<00:04:54.380> cool<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.710> guess

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
Toyota Tacoma urban RV cool I guess

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.960 
Toyota Tacoma urban RV cool I guess
that's<00:04:57.690> it
