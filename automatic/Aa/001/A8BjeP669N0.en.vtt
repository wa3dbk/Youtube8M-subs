00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.970
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.040
 I am the domino of the space and today we will have 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.099
 review on the earlier demon 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.110
 varaka first I would like to turn to 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.150
 to those people who say that my 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.410
 homemade quite simple and their 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.300
 physique not outstanding and not such 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.050
 and confusing what everyone can do 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.720
 such homemade from any available to him 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.289
 details but want to appeal to such people 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.649
 I do homemade products that I like and 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.260
 I think that is not overloaded with details 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.590
 model looks better than overloaded 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.270
 that is , this figure has all 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.170
 hands-legs 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.890
 longing cool style really do not like that 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.469
 my figures are not why they need tass 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.039
 these are fictional characters from 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.600
 they can have a fantasy world 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.679
 maybe not available 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.769
 this is already the idea of ​​the author 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:06.170
 I would also like to point out that I 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.470
 pass on the silhouette and history of the character 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.009
 which I thought I think that such 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.759
 form 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.950
 passes it well to the viewer no matter 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.500
 overloaded again the model with details or 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.470
 no complicated her design or not 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.509
 it is already a personal choice to make a model 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.049
 overloaded 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.939
 highly detailed or here's how i dont 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.430
 very detailed yet 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.520
 transferring the image and some 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.649
 idea of ​​a character well do you hope me 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.560
 heard these people who wrote it 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.659
 well, we turn to the review we will not start 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.600
 we probably with the weapon that wears it 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.360
 deadly demon is an ordinary staff 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.759
 spear long enough blade on 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.280
 late as you can see it lies 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.860
 holds closer to the blade so that you can 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.320
 deliver much more powerful blows and 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.560
 there are also little heaps 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.710
 big compared 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.890
 with my hand your little fact 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.590
 in the bionicle world and they are almost the size 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.840
 I think their usual hand is big enough 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.150
 damage can inflict on his opponent 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.069
 many of this homemade are not overloaded 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.840
 details 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.330
 Consist of only six if you count 2 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.090
 of course blame and one leg 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.180
 consists of three parts of the foot just 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.180
 the same knee and detail and these here 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.910
 fasteners and again i did 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.620
 homemade which looks like what i am 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.080
 was plotting to make my ideas nor were they 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.799
 big legs or some kind of overwhelmed and 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.049
 feet so that's why the thief does 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.380
 skeleton back similar 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.980
 from metal took it from lego sets 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.080
 Bionicle Pan Current Series 2008 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.200
 also it should have been like 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.019
 some mysterious transparent red of 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.720
 roses by some parasites but I decided that 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.049
 his image will be conveyed much better 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:10.430
 without him there seems to be some kind of darkness 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:13.470
 and you have ribs under it behind 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.680
 flap that closes the back well 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.989
 side of the character and even if 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.299
 some tricky opponent decide 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.269
 sneak up behind you 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.160
 get a deadly blow here 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.090
 This is the thing behind our back. 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.880
 I called the demon gels about the crown for now 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.910
 did not understand what it means very story 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.940
 line so what did not come up but first 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.329
 she thinks will mean that this 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.670
 demon raksha leader of all and he will lead all 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.410
 into battle but it will stay on 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.359
 good enough distance 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.620
 to the enemy so as not to be hit 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.970
 any 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.680
 magical energy or a volley of arrows not 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.300
 head I used a mask Raksha Varaka 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.880
 oddly enough with an elongated 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.070
 modified by the neck of his hand also 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.990
 plain design but to them 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.170
 here are mounted here are demonic 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.980
 wings with some 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.750
 small shoots that allow 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.700
 be much more maneuverable in 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.580
 flying over the skies 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.280
 what does the general have us and the time will come 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:24.130
 we take a look at the rest of his members 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:29.490
 deadly detachment but for now with you 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.490
 I was domination space good luck to all and so far
