00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.300
 a good quality monitor is essential 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.660
 for professionals working with 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.370
 design or edit videos and images up to 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.800
 it has to be great and have a 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.920
 excellent contrast ratio for display 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.869
 the colors perfectly the samsung monitor 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.420
 if the nine ls 27b 9 70 ds arrives for 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.189
 try to meet this need by bringing 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.189
 image quality design 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.350
 Samsung has done a good job of designing 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.450
 this monitor 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.700
 the first impression that you have to see 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.730
 it on the table is that he stands out in 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.800
 compared to other models all part of 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.840
 front of the monitor is covered by a 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.079
 glass panel and the sides of the screen 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.390
 are covered by a piece of aluminum 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.640
 the back is covered by a cover 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.510
 textured plastic one without any 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.670
 opening 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.750
 The most striking detail is the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.450
 metal bonding the fabric to the base of the apertures 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.689
 for refrigeration and TV connections in 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.400
 hd mini displayport power are all on 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.880
 back of base 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.799
 the side features two usb ports 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.380
 both the height and the angulation of the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.960
 monitor can be adjusted accurately 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.930
 because the holder allows you to slide 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.330
 the screen up or down or lightness 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.640
 and softness 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.500
 the monitor control panel can be 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.360
 accessed via touch buttons 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.460
 present at the base 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.829
 they are all illuminated when they are 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.320
 active and stay hidden when you 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.150
 you do not need them 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.369
 the setup menu is relatively 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.560
 simple and does not shy away from the standard 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.590
 found in other models 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.740
 however it allows precise adjustments in the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.810
 image which includes color modules 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.270
 custom work on a screen 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.969
 27 inches with a resolution of 2560 per 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.000
 1.440 pixels is simply amazing. 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.649
 technology pls can samsung 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.500
 provide a very high level of color 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.569
 more faithful which certainly counts a lot 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.650
 when you need to edit images with 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.120
 precision 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.850
 even if this monitor is not 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.070
 aimed exactly at the games 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.350
 resolution ensures a clean and 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.870
 leaving the scenarios and the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.480
 incredibly detailed textures 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.330
 samsung calibrates each of the monitors 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.430
 siles 9 directly at the factory 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.130
 this makes each equipment 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.200
 tested and configured by professionals 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.840
 before you can connect it to your 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.580
 computer 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.300
 this work can also be done by 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.340
 you 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.260
 with the help of an external calibrator and 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.870
 the net software collor export that 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.970
 accompanies the monitor 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.830
 the mobile high definition link is a 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.590
 interface that allows the connection of 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.930
 smartphones and tablets to the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.480
 this technology can display 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.360
 images and videos in high definition and 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.840
 sound quality 7.1 directly from the 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.840
 monitor 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.410
 although the basis of samsung 9 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.050
 an incredible design is a bit fragile 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.050
 the center rod connecting the base fabric is 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.000
 very thin and with this the monitor tends to 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.440
 to rock a lot on the table 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.980
 especially when you are 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.780
 typing as the base is fixed on the monitor. 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.300
 there is no alternative to solve 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.280
 this problem since the substitution of 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.740
 impossible part 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.750
 the new system pls developed by 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.580
 samsung even provides a quality 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.980
 incredible image 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.650
 There is no doubt that this is the only 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.690
 problem is the front glass panel that 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.520
 suffers with many reflexes mainly 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.710
 with dark images on the screen 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.770
 samsung series 9 has a good system 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.810
 built-in sound but it can only be 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.880
 used if you connect the 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.230
 devices to be monitored through a 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.300
 hdmi cable to worsen the situation many 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.700
 equipment available on the market does not 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.270
 they can reproduce larger resolutions 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.740
 that full hd through the hdmi cable 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.989
 forcing you not to choose the 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.850
 maximum resolution offered by the monitor 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.590
 if you want to use the speakers 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.449
 built-in equipment 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.759
 the performance tests of a monitor 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.340
 involve the display and visualization of 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.949
 some different images on the screen 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.860
 Our objective is to analyze the 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.029
 contrast brightness in 2010 and 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.949
 answer 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:40.919
 the latter verifies the presence of 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.080
 trawls in moving images in 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.689
 all the tests a monitor showed 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.759
 quite efficient being able to display 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:50.159
 an excellent contrast ratio and a 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.249
 competent 2010 control 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:54.689
 the response time of 5 milliseconds is 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:59.659
 more than enough to ensure 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:59.659
 images with intense movement on the screen 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.729
 the choice of a monitor is one of the parties 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.430
 most important when you go riding 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.500
 a computer but first of all it is 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.879
 I need to ensure that it meets your 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.620
 needs 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:19.199
 the resolution of 2560 by 1.440 pixels 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.139
 allows more space for work and 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.819
 Allied to pls led panel ensures more 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.430
 Image quality 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.620
 the design of this monitor is very good 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.300
 like making the look of it is 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.650
 highlight the other models with 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.469
 facility 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.129
 in the United States this monitor costs 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:39.990
 approximately 900 dollars in brazil is 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:42.389
 possible to find a model in the range of 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.490
 three thousand and three hundred reais, which 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.830
 same price category of other screens 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.129
 with this resolution how does a fan of 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.139
 boxing display the samsung if the ie9 is a 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:54.509
 excellent equipment with a design 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.550
 very good color technology 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.430
 extremely satisfactory mainly 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.680
 for professionals in the design area 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.080
 if you need a screen that can 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.270
 work with great resolutions without 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.509
 sacrificing visual quality that 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.939
 product is for you 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:14.099
 if your business is games movies or 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:15.689
 other simpler activities 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:17.610
 maybe it's more interesting to look 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:20.460
 a more account model 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.719
 complete analysis of the world and
