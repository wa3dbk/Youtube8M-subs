00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.960 
and is a little impatient like me this
is<00:04:23.830> awesome<00:04:24.669> because<00:04:26.400> this<00:04:27.400> would<00:04:27.639> take<00:04:27.820> you

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
is awesome because this would take you

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.570 
is awesome because this would take you
forever<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.960> grow<00:04:29.110> out<00:04:29.350> I<00:04:29.590> mean<00:04:29.889> my<00:04:30.040> hair<00:04:30.310> is

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580

right here right now

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.150 
right here right now
so<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.720> would<00:04:34.840> take<00:04:34.870> me<00:04:35.169> forever<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.680> grow<00:04:35.980> this

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.850 
so it would take me forever to grow this
back<00:04:36.370> out<00:04:36.550> but<00:04:37.480> this<00:04:37.810> is<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.169> great<00:04:38.560> alternative

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
back out but this is a great alternative

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.570 
back out but this is a great alternative
to<00:04:39.990> having<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.260> deal<00:04:41.710> with<00:04:41.740> just<00:04:42.160> short<00:04:42.370> hair

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
to having to deal with just short hair

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.780 
to having to deal with just short hair
every<00:04:43.540> day<00:04:43.800> if<00:04:44.800> you're<00:04:45.040> sick<00:04:45.250> of<00:04:45.400> it<00:04:45.580> and

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
every day if you're sick of it and

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.220 
every day if you're sick of it and
you're<00:04:45.940> ready<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.240> have<00:04:46.419> long<00:04:46.660> hair<00:04:46.690> already

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
you're ready to have long hair already

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.770 
you're ready to have long hair already
so<00:04:48.100> I'll<00:04:48.460> put<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.640> link<00:04:48.820> below<00:04:48.910> as<00:04:49.419> to<00:04:49.570> where<00:04:49.690> you

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
so I'll put a link below as to where you

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.390 
so I'll put a link below as to where you
can<00:04:49.930> find<00:04:49.960> this<00:04:50.320> hair<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:52.260> how<00:04:53.260> much<00:04:53.410> it<00:04:53.560> costs

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
can find this hair and how much it costs

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.090 
can find this hair and how much it costs
like<00:04:54.729> I<00:04:54.880> said<00:04:55.120> 35<00:04:55.630> 40<00:04:55.990> bucks<00:04:56.140> per<00:04:56.470> box<00:04:56.680> so

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
like I said 35 40 bucks per box so

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.719 
like I said 35 40 bucks per box so
that's<00:04:57.340> really<00:04:57.520> not<00:04:57.820> a<00:04:57.880> lot<00:04:58.180> of<00:04:58.210> money

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
that's really not a lot of money

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.129 
that's really not a lot of money
considering<00:05:00.729> the<00:05:00.970> quality<00:05:01.180> of<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.600> hair<00:05:01.870> and

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
considering the quality of the hair and

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.240 
considering the quality of the hair and
how<00:05:02.290> often<00:05:02.740> this<00:05:02.889> looks<00:05:04.140> so<00:05:05.140> I<00:05:05.620> think<00:05:06.070> it's

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
how often this looks so I think it's

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.120 
how often this looks so I think it's
worth<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.820> investment<00:05:07.950> so<00:05:09.000> with<00:05:10.000> that<00:05:10.180> said

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
worth the investment so with that said

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.740 
worth the investment so with that said
like<00:05:12.130> I<00:05:12.160> say<00:05:12.400> I'll<00:05:12.490> put<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.790> link<00:05:13.000> in<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.330> in

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
like I say I'll put the link in the in

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.680 
like I say I'll put the link in the in
the<00:05:14.710> description<00:05:15.580> so<00:05:15.880> you<00:05:15.910> can<00:05:16.060> find<00:05:16.479> it

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
the description so you can find it

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.820 
the description so you can find it
yourself<00:05:17.700> so<00:05:19.020> I'm<00:05:20.020> thinking<00:05:20.500> I<00:05:20.620> might

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
yourself so I'm thinking I might

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.900 
yourself so I'm thinking I might
actually<00:05:21.100> do<00:05:21.550> a<00:05:21.580> tutorial<00:05:22.030> on<00:05:22.479> how<00:05:23.169> to<00:05:23.669> put<00:05:24.669> the

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
actually do a tutorial on how to put the

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.029 
actually do a tutorial on how to put the
track<00:05:25.210> hair<00:05:25.539> because<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.140> bundles<00:05:26.500> are<00:05:26.680> tract

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
track hair because the bundles are tract

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:33.719 
track hair because the bundles are tract
hair<00:05:27.810> actually<00:05:28.810> put<00:05:29.380> the<00:05:29.590> bundles<00:05:30.479> onto<00:05:31.830> a<00:05:32.830> 3/4

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
hair actually put the bundles onto a 3/4

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.020 
hair actually put the bundles onto a 3/4
clip<00:05:34.120> in<00:05:34.330> like<00:05:34.570> this<00:05:35.729> because<00:05:36.729> it's<00:05:36.880> super

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
clip in like this because it's super

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.940 
clip in like this because it's super
easy<00:05:37.180> but<00:05:37.600> it<00:05:37.720> can<00:05:37.750> be<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.020> little<00:05:38.289> tricky<00:05:38.770> if

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
easy but it can be a little tricky if

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.950 
easy but it can be a little tricky if
you've<00:05:39.100> never<00:05:39.250> done<00:05:39.490> it<00:05:39.550> before<00:05:39.930> so<00:05:40.930> I

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
you've never done it before so I

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.320 
you've never done it before so I
actually<00:05:41.919> think<00:05:42.310> I<00:05:42.520> might<00:05:42.700> do<00:05:42.880> one<00:05:43.060> of<00:05:43.210> those

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
actually think I might do one of those

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.180 
actually think I might do one of those
so<00:05:43.390> I'm<00:05:43.990> gonna<00:05:44.080> have<00:05:44.380> to<00:05:44.410> probably<00:05:44.770> go<00:05:45.010> out<00:05:45.070> and

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
so I'm gonna have to probably go out and

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.010 
so I'm gonna have to probably go out and
get<00:05:45.430> some<00:05:45.640> more<00:05:45.760> hair<00:05:46.000> for<00:05:46.300> that<00:05:46.450> and<00:05:46.750> I

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
get some more hair for that and I

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.960 
get some more hair for that and I
actually<00:05:47.530> might<00:05:48.039> change<00:05:48.280> it<00:05:48.400> up<00:05:48.520> a<00:05:48.640> little<00:05:48.669> bit

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
actually might change it up a little bit

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.770 
actually might change it up a little bit
and<00:05:49.240> maybe<00:05:49.419> go<00:05:50.080> with<00:05:50.500> an<00:05:51.460> ombre<00:05:51.940> style<00:05:52.240> so

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
and maybe go with an ombre style so

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.289 
and maybe go with an ombre style so
we'll<00:05:53.080> see
