00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.459 
from a wedding that I did a couple weeks
back<00:00:41.129> where<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.790> did<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.780> girls<00:00:43.020> full<00:00:43.260> face<00:00:43.440> of

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
back where I did the girls full face of

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.350 
back where I did the girls full face of
makeup<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:44.190> took<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> picture<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.969> them<00:00:45.149> without

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
makeup I took a picture of them without

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.729 
makeup I took a picture of them without
brows<00:00:45.690> done<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.140> then<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.260> did<00:00:46.440> their<00:00:46.559> brows

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
brows done and then I did their brows

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.260 
brows done and then I did their brows
and<00:00:46.950> took<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> picture<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> brows<00:00:48.120> down

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
and took a picture with the brows down

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.330 
and took a picture with the brows down
so<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.750> tell<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> difference<00:00:49.620> like

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
so you can just tell the difference like

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.130 
so you can just tell the difference like
between<00:00:50.640> no<00:00:50.940> brows<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.510> browse

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
between no brows and browse

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.900 
between no brows and browse
so<00:00:52.260> all<00:00:52.559> these<00:00:52.739> shades<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:53.010> super<00:00:53.370> creamy<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
so all these shades are super creamy and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.700 
so all these shades are super creamy and
blendable<00:00:54.360> there's<00:00:54.690> pretty<00:00:55.110> much<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.350> shade

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
how the each pan is just a single shade

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.200 
how the each pan is just a single shade
the<00:01:04.860> other<00:01:04.890> brow<00:01:05.369> palettes<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.790> I've<00:01:05.939> seen

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the other brow palettes that I've seen

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.149 
the other brow palettes that I've seen
have<00:01:06.540> them<00:01:06.810> split<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.200> half<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.799> find<00:01:08.070> that

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
have them split in half and I find that

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.190 
have them split in half and I find that
I<00:01:08.280> don't<00:01:08.729> use<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> other<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.020> the

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.839 
the arch of the brow and I just kind of
feather<00:05:28.840> it<00:05:29.080> on<00:05:29.199> until<00:05:29.800> I<00:05:29.860> get<00:05:30.370> my<00:05:30.520> desired

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
feather it on until I get my desired

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:36.450 
feather it on until I get my desired
look<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:33.599> basically<00:05:34.599> do<00:05:34.900> a<00:05:35.259> line<00:05:35.860> on<00:05:36.039> the<00:05:36.159> bottom

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
look I basically do a line on the bottom

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.939 
look I basically do a line on the bottom
of<00:05:36.490> my<00:05:36.729> brow<00:05:37.060> and<00:05:37.090> then<00:05:37.509> a<00:05:37.539> line<00:05:38.110> AB<00:05:38.469> right

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
of my brow and then a line AB right

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.189 
of my brow and then a line AB right
above<00:05:39.249> the<00:05:39.430> brow<00:05:39.610> and<00:05:39.939> then<00:05:40.089> I<00:05:40.150> feather<00:05:40.479> in<00:05:40.839> the

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
above the brow and then I feather in the

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:55.300 
above the brow and then I feather in the
center<00:05:41.680> of<00:05:41.710> it

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.860 

then<00:05:55.970> I<00:05:56.000> take<00:05:56.300> the<00:05:56.360> color<00:05:56.660> espresso<00:05:57.430> and<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:59.810> do

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
then I take the color espresso and I do

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.960 
then I take the color espresso and I do
the<00:06:00.110> same<00:06:00.140> exact<00:06:00.650> thing<00:06:00.710> but<00:06:01.160> I<00:06:01.340> go<00:06:01.550> from<00:06:01.850> the

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
the same exact thing but I go from the

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.090 
the same exact thing but I go from the
arch<00:06:02.210> of<00:06:02.390> my<00:06:02.420> brow<00:06:02.600> to<00:06:03.230> the<00:06:03.320> very<00:06:03.500> end<00:06:03.740> of<00:06:03.980> the

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
arch of my brow to the very end of the

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:11.310 
arch of my brow to the very end of the
brow

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.170 

and<00:06:12.320> I<00:06:12.860> find<00:06:13.160> that<00:06:13.250> I<00:06:13.430> get<00:06:13.490> a<00:06:13.610> better<00:06:13.820> angle

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
and I find that I get a better angle

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.540 
and I find that I get a better angle
when<00:06:14.780> I<00:06:14.810> kind<00:06:15.080> of<00:06:15.230> scrunch<00:06:15.560> my<00:06:15.710> brows<00:06:15.950> down<00:06:16.280> and

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
when I kind of scrunch my brows down and

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.670 
when I kind of scrunch my brows down and
make<00:06:16.640> an<00:06:16.760> angry<00:06:17.090> face<00:06:17.180> I<00:06:17.690> don't<00:06:18.020> know<00:06:18.320> why<00:06:18.530> that

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
make an angry face I don't know why that

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.260 
make an angry face I don't know why that
is<00:06:18.860> but<00:06:18.890> that's<00:06:19.220> just<00:06:19.460> what<00:06:19.640> I've<00:06:19.760> always<00:06:19.940> done

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
is but that's just what I've always done

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.780 
is but that's just what I've always done
when<00:06:20.510> I<00:06:20.540> do<00:06:20.660> anything<00:06:21.260> on<00:06:21.380> my<00:06:21.470> brows<00:06:21.680> then<00:06:22.580> I<00:06:22.670> go

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790 
when I do anything on my brows then I go

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.000 
when I do anything on my brows then I go
in<00:06:22.910> with<00:06:22.940> and<00:06:23.210> with<00:06:23.510> the<00:06:23.630> spoolie<00:06:24.020> and<00:06:24.230> I<00:06:24.620> brush

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
in with and with the spoolie and I brush

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.330 
in with and with the spoolie and I brush
them<00:06:25.250> out

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.340 

and<00:06:30.340> you<00:06:30.850> can<00:06:31.000> see<00:06:31.150> this<00:06:31.330> just<00:06:31.390> softens<00:06:32.110> the

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
and you can see this just softens the

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.080 
and you can see this just softens the
look<00:06:32.560> of<00:06:32.710> the<00:06:32.800> brows<00:06:33.040> makes<00:06:33.610> them<00:06:33.790> look<00:06:33.820> a

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
look of the brows makes them look a

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.930 
look of the brows makes them look a
little<00:06:34.120> bit<00:06:34.420> more<00:06:34.540> natural<00:06:35.370> then<00:06:36.370> I<00:06:36.400> take<00:06:36.910> a

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
little bit more natural then I take a

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.910 
little bit more natural then I take a
little<00:06:37.270> bit<00:06:37.420> of<00:06:37.480> the<00:06:37.810> brow<00:06:38.200> light<00:06:38.500> highlight

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:38.920 
little bit of the brow light highlight

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.500 
little bit of the brow light highlight
and<00:06:39.160> I<00:06:39.370> usually<00:06:39.640> use<00:06:39.760> a<00:06:39.790> brush<00:06:40.030> but<00:06:40.270> today<00:06:40.450> I

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
and I usually use a brush but today I

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.920 
and I usually use a brush but today I
just<00:06:40.720> use<00:06:40.870> my<00:06:41.050> pinky<00:06:41.410> finger<00:06:41.440> and<00:06:41.920> I<00:06:42.610> put<00:06:42.880> that

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
just use my pinky finger and I put that

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.140 
just use my pinky finger and I put that
going<00:06:43.930> from<00:06:44.260> the<00:06:44.500> arch<00:06:44.740> of<00:06:44.830> my<00:06:45.100> brow<00:06:45.280> to<00:06:45.940> the

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
going from the arch of my brow to the

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:58.679 
going from the arch of my brow to the
end

00:06:58.679 --> 00:06:58.689 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:00.809 

and<00:06:58.779> then<00:06:59.379> an<00:06:59.499> optional<00:06:59.949> step<00:07:00.219> if<00:07:00.489> you<00:07:00.610> have

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:00.819 
and then an optional step if you have

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:02.879 
and then an optional step if you have
brows<00:07:01.059> that<00:07:01.299> tend<00:07:01.539> to<00:07:01.599> be<00:07:01.959> a<00:07:02.110> little<00:07:02.289> bit<00:07:02.499> wild

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
brows that tend to be a little bit wild

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:12.010 
brows that tend to be a little bit wild
is<00:07:03.099> to<00:07:03.279> use<00:07:03.399> a<00:07:03.429> brow<00:07:03.789> wax<00:07:04.029> on<00:07:04.299> top

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.260
