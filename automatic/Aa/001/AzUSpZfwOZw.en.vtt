00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
died and amazingly a base I suppose it

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.180

because<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.899> need<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> base<00:00:58.289> with<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.559> card<00:00:58.859> but

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
because you need a base with a card but

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
going to put it this way

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.690 
going to put it this way
okay<00:01:58.940> or<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.660> can't<00:02:00.260> display<00:02:00.560> him<00:02:00.800> standing

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
okay or you can't display him standing

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.270 
okay or you can't display him standing
up<00:02:01.850> as<00:02:02.120> well<00:02:02.360> if<00:02:02.480> you<00:02:02.600> wanted<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:03.100> just<00:02:04.100> like

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
up as well if you wanted to just like

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.930 
up as well if you wanted to just like
r2d2<00:02:04.640> he<00:02:05.510> has<00:02:05.690> these<00:02:06.130> secret<00:02:07.130> compartments

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
r2d2 he has these secret compartments

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.080 
r2d2 he has these secret compartments
that<00:02:08.090> open<00:02:08.600> up<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:08.930> reveal<00:02:09.610> some<00:02:10.610> tools<00:02:10.910> or

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
that open up and reveal some tools or

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.950 
that open up and reveal some tools or
weapons<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.750> think<00:02:11.990> this<00:02:12.080> is<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.290> blaster<00:02:12.890> or<00:02:13.850> a

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
weapons I think this is a blaster or a

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.200 
weapons I think this is a blaster or a
interface<00:02:14.960> tool<00:02:15.430> yes<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:16.760> think<00:02:17.000> it's<00:02:17.120> an

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
interface tool yes I think it's an

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.670 
interface tool yes I think it's an
interface<00:02:17.630> tool<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:20.540> can<00:02:20.870> use<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.050> open<00:02:21.290> locks

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
interface tool you can use to open locks

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.270 
interface tool you can use to open locks
and<00:02:21.890> whatnot<00:02:22.900> my<00:02:23.900> crappy<00:02:24.470> rendition<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.220> the
