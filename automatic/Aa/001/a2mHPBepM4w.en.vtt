something small but I think that if
you're<00:03:15.390> able<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.840> change<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.320> font<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:17.550> for

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
you're able to change the font to for

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.120 
you're able to change the font to for
the<00:03:18.360> time<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:19.230> whatever<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:19.709> want<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:20.010> know

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
the time so whatever you want to know

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.190 
the time so whatever you want to know

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
to make it time larger bigger I still

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.910 
to make it time larger bigger I still
think<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.200> mean<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.560> know<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.070> can

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.880 
think that I mean I know that you can
click<00:03:30.069> to<00:03:30.220> expand<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.880> scrambles<00:03:31.500> but<00:03:32.500> if

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
click to expand the scrambles but if

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.410 
click to expand the scrambles but if
there<00:03:33.370> was<00:03:33.490> a<00:03:33.520> way<00:03:33.580> to<00:03:33.730> maybe<00:03:33.910> change<00:03:34.239> around

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
there was a way to maybe change around

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.229 
there was a way to maybe change around
the<00:03:34.630> way<00:03:34.780> out<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.260> maybe<00:03:35.650> move<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.340> don't<00:03:37.150> know

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
the way out I maybe move I don't know

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.240 
the way out I maybe move I don't know
like<00:03:37.510> I'm<00:03:38.200> not<00:03:38.349> really<00:03:38.440> sure<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.890> don't<00:03:39.069> you

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
like I'm not really sure you don't you

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.680

wouldn't want to clutter things up but a

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.720 
wouldn't want to clutter things up but a
way<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.200> make<00:03:41.440> this<00:03:41.560> scrambles<00:03:42.250> at<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.459> top<00:03:42.700> a

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
way to make this scrambles at the top a

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.790 
way to make this scrambles at the top a
little<00:03:43.030> bit<00:03:43.239> larger<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:43.959> that<00:03:44.230> like<00:03:44.530> if<00:03:44.709> you

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
little bit larger so that like if you

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.100 
little bit larger so that like if you

like<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:16.720> said<00:04:16.780> an<00:04:17.229> app<00:04:17.500> can<00:04:17.889> read<00:04:18.190> it<00:04:18.459> two<00:04:18.700> by

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
like I said an app can read it two by

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.430 
like I said an app can read it two by
two<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.090> three<00:04:19.329> by<00:04:19.450> three<00:04:19.660> scrambles<00:04:20.079> to<00:04:20.139> you

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
two and three by three scrambles to you

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.020 
two and three by three scrambles to you
which<00:04:20.650> is<00:04:20.769> pretty<00:04:21.070> cool<00:04:21.340> for<00:04:21.579> those<00:04:21.729> of<00:04:21.910> you

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
which is pretty cool for those of you

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.730 
which is pretty cool for those of you
who<00:04:22.510> like<00:04:22.720> it's<00:04:22.930> definitely<00:04:23.320> a<00:04:23.350> neat<00:04:23.530> feature

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
who like it's definitely a neat feature

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.770 
who like it's definitely a neat feature
to<00:04:24.010> have<00:04:24.190> you<00:04:25.030> can<00:04:25.120> also<00:04:25.270> delete<00:04:25.570> multiple

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
to have you can also delete multiple

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.080 
to have you can also delete multiple
times<00:04:26.229> at<00:04:26.410> once<00:04:26.710> so<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.250> think<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.669> should<00:04:27.700> have

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
times at once so I think I should have

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:36.740 
times at once so I think I should have
some<00:04:28.300> in<00:04:28.450> here<00:04:28.950> so<00:04:29.950> let's<00:04:30.130> see<00:04:30.310> edit<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:33.690> oh

optimal random state scrambles which i
know<00:04:55.330> i<00:04:55.479> saw<00:04:55.810> was<00:04:56.200> requested<00:04:56.740> not<00:04:57.010> suddenly

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
also you can add penalties after solve

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.750 
also you can add penalties after solve
which<00:05:32.620> is<00:05:32.740> something<00:05:32.920> that<00:05:33.070> was<00:05:33.280> missing<00:05:33.490> in

five point is a 5.1 5.2 I think I don't
know<00:06:06.280> whatever<00:06:06.760> it<00:06:06.910> is<00:06:07.030> the<00:06:07.240> newest<00:06:07.510> iOS<00:06:09.720> so

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
know whatever it is the newest iOS so

know whatever it is the newest iOS so
yeah<00:06:11.320> pretty<00:06:11.890> much<00:06:11.950> there's<00:06:12.870> nothing<00:06:13.870> really

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
yeah pretty much there's nothing really

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.460 
yeah pretty much there's nothing really
else<00:06:14.500> to<00:06:15.040> say<00:06:15.280> about<00:06:15.430> it<00:06:15.610> um<00:06:16.030> I<00:06:16.630> like<00:06:17.320> the

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
else to say about it um I like the

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.170 
else to say about it um I like the
overall<00:06:17.590> layout<00:06:18.040> and<00:06:18.490> how<00:06:18.730> you<00:06:18.790> can<00:06:19.120> change

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
overall layout and how you can change

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.930 
overall layout and how you can change
the<00:06:19.600> colors<00:06:19.930> I<00:06:20.200> do<00:06:20.410> like<00:06:20.710> it<00:06:20.950> but<00:06:21.130> I<00:06:21.250> do<00:06:21.340> think

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
the colors I do like it but I do think

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.750 
the colors I do like it but I do think
that<00:06:22.090> maybe<00:06:22.450> a<00:06:22.890> remastered<00:06:23.890> layout<00:06:24.280> somehow

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
that maybe a remastered layout somehow

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.700 
that maybe a remastered layout somehow
to<00:06:24.820> just<00:06:25.120> incorporate<00:06:25.630> a<00:06:25.930> bigger<00:06:26.200> scramble

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
to just incorporate a bigger scramble
