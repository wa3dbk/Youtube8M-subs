00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.030 
took a bit more time and making this
emblem<00:01:21.780> because<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> wanted<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.740> good

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
emblem because I wanted it to be as good

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.679 
emblem because I wanted it to be as good
as<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.250> could<00:01:23.310> make<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:24.299> as<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.540> see

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
as I could make it but as you can see

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.910 
as I could make it but as you can see
here<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.170> after<00:01:25.259> getting<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.619> rounded

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
here now going after getting the rounded

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.100 
here now going after getting the rounded
square<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.549> sort<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.820> gonna<00:01:27.299> make<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.659> go

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
square and sort of gonna make it go

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.899 
square and sort of gonna make it go
across<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.860> actual<00:01:29.189> emblem<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
across the actual emblem this is for the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.249 
across the actual emblem this is for the
band<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.329> bit<00:01:30.509> where<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
band a bit where you can have the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.530 
band a bit where you can have the
writing<00:01:31.560> above<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.180> just<00:01:33.180> trying<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.420> work

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
writing above it and just trying to work

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.840 
writing above it and just trying to work
this<00:01:33.750> out<00:01:33.900> trying<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.890> figure<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.490> top

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
this out trying to figure out the top

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.219 
this out trying to figure out the top
bit<00:01:36.030> because<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.360> don't<00:01:36.509> your<00:01:36.630> emblems<00:01:37.020> looks

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
bit because you don't your emblems looks

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.380 
bit because you don't your emblems looks
slightly<00:01:37.650> broken<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.280> where<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.000> you

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
slightly broken and where that is you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.179 
slightly broken and where that is you
don't<00:01:39.540> want<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.869> sort<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.650> distort<00:01:41.070> your

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
don't want it to sort of distort your

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.039 
don't want it to sort of distort your
actual<00:01:41.460> emblem<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.689> can<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:42.869> here

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
actual emblem and as you can see here

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
actual emblem and as you can see here
going<00:01:43.170> into<00:01:43.320> semi<00:01:43.530> celkon<00:01:43.799> fits<00:01:44.070> perfectly<00:01:44.790> in

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
going into semi celkon fits perfectly in

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.139 
going into semi celkon fits perfectly in
on<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> bottom<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:46.430> sort<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.490> saved<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.000> bit

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
on the bottom so sort of saved a bit

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.030 
on the bottom so sort of saved a bit
here<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.689> go<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:48.869> tell<00:01:49.680> them<00:01:49.710> kind<00:01:49.979> of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
here but then I go and tell them kind of

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.260 
here but then I go and tell them kind of
picky<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:50.850> accurate<00:01:51.060> as

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
picky on it to be as accurate as

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.880 
picky on it to be as accurate as
possible<00:01:51.299> i<00:01:51.659> saw<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.049> actual<00:01:52.290> certain

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
possible i saw that the actual certain

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.530 
possible i saw that the actual certain
times<00:01:53.070> burner<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.549> slightly<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.909> bit<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.360> more

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
times burner is slightly a bit of a more

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.569 
times burner is slightly a bit of a more
of<00:01:54.600> an<00:01:54.689> angle<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.950> when<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.159> corrected<00:01:56.460> that

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
of an angle so when it corrected that

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.580 
of an angle so when it corrected that
there<00:01:56.759> i<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.570> tried<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.840> make<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.110> video<00:01:58.259> as

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
there i have tried to make this video as

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.080 
there i have tried to make this video as
quick<00:01:59.100> as<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.340> could<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.549> made<00:01:59.700> at<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.909> same

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
quick as I could have made at the same

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.389 
quick as I could have made at the same
time<00:02:00.329> without<00:02:00.540> actually<00:02:01.079> going<00:02:01.890> too<00:02:02.130> fast

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
time without actually going too fast

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.590 
time without actually going too fast
without<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.820> guys<00:02:02.969> being<00:02:03.119> able<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.360> pause<00:02:03.570> it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
without you guys being able to pause it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.870 
without you guys being able to pause it
because<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.020> dunno<00:02:04.320> maybe<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.399> emblem<00:02:05.610> is

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
because I dunno maybe this emblem is

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.240 
because I dunno maybe this emblem is
very<00:02:06.390> difficult<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.200> wanted<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.770> possibly

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
very difficult so I wanted it possibly

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.089 
very difficult so I wanted it possibly
as<00:02:08.369> be<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:08.640> long<00:02:08.759> as<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.119> could<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.979> at<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
as be as long as it could be and at the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.260 
as be as long as it could be and at the
same<00:02:11.190> time<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.790> guys<00:02:11.879> as<00:02:12.030> quickly

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
same time get it to you guys as quickly

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.309 
same time get it to you guys as quickly
as<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.480> could<00:02:12.540> so

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
as I could so

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.449 
as I could so
as<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.469> guys<00:02:13.590> can<00:02:13.709> see<00:02:13.769> here<00:02:13.980> now<00:02:14.099> I'm<00:02:14.310> just

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
as you guys can see here now I'm just

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.739 
as you guys can see here now I'm just
going<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.730> be<00:02:14.790> working<00:02:14.939> on<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.209> bit<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:15.749 
going to be working on the bit the

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.080 
going to be working on the bit the
stripes<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.409> the<00:02:16.469> middle<00:02:16.680> bit<00:02:16.829> and<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.999> is

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
stripes in the middle bit and this is

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.009 
stripes in the middle bit and this is
one<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.269> those<00:02:18.389> difficult<00:02:18.749> ones<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.900> think

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
one of those difficult ones I think

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.119 
one of those difficult ones I think
you've<00:02:19.109> got<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.260> use<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.379> second<00:02:19.739> lieutenant

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
you've got to use the second lieutenant

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.970 
you've got to use the second lieutenant
on<00:02:20.219> the<00:02:20.249> ranking<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:20.849> emblems<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.859> one<00:02:22.859> thing

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
on the ranking up emblems and one thing

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.649 
on the ranking up emblems and one thing
you'll<00:02:23.129> probably<00:02:23.909> realizes<00:02:24.389> when<00:02:24.540> you're

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
you'll probably realizes when you're

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.229 
you'll probably realizes when you're
changing<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.650> scaling<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:26.639> the<00:02:26.969> actual

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
changing the scaling on the actual

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.839 
changing the scaling on the actual
column<00:02:28.139> bit<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.499> these<00:02:28.709> second<00:02:29.609> internal

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
column bit on these second internal

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.369 
column bit on these second internal
emblems<00:02:30.209> is<00:02:30.299> that<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.900> will<00:02:30.989> change<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
emblems is that it will change the

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.690 
emblems is that it will change the
actual<00:02:31.500> width<00:02:31.799> of<00:02:31.889> them<00:02:32.069> so<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.489> could

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
actual width of them so you could

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.550 
actual width of them so you could
actually<00:02:32.819> then<00:02:33.180> going<00:02:33.959> back<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.379> go<00:02:34.500> to

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
actually then going back it go to

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.869 
actually then going back it go to
freescale<00:02:35.010> then<00:02:35.159> actually<00:02:35.430> make<00:02:35.549> them<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.760> bit

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
freescale then actually make them a bit

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.729 
freescale then actually make them a bit
smaller<00:02:36.150> but<00:02:36.719> trying<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.379> get<00:02:37.469> them<00:02:37.590> all

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
smaller but trying to get them all

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.009 
smaller but trying to get them all
evenly<00:02:38.129> apart<00:02:38.659> that's<00:02:39.659> probably<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.989> main

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
evenly apart that's probably the main

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.119 
evenly apart that's probably the main
difficult<00:02:40.500> you've<00:02:40.590> been<00:02:40.709> actually<00:02:40.950> doing

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
difficult you've been actually doing

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.409 
difficult you've been actually doing
this<00:02:41.219> but<00:02:41.549> I'm<00:02:41.669> trying<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.909> figure<00:02:42.030> out<00:02:42.209> how<00:02:42.329> am

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:42.419 
this but I'm trying to figure out how am

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:43.399 
this but I'm trying to figure out how am
I<00:02:42.450> gonna<00:02:42.569> get<00:02:42.659> in<00:02:42.780> there's<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> bottom<00:02:43.200> gonna

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
I gonna get in there's a bottom gonna

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.800 
I gonna get in there's a bottom gonna
found<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.739> pyramid<00:02:44.249> and<00:02:44.599> trying<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:45.659> see<00:02:45.750> if

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
found this pyramid and trying to see if

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.119 
found this pyramid and trying to see if
they<00:02:45.870> can<00:02:45.989> actually<00:02:46.079> work<00:02:46.590> because<00:02:47.010> i<00:02:47.069> know

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
they can actually work because i know

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.559 
they can actually work because i know
there's<00:02:47.400> quite<00:02:47.579> a<00:02:47.639> few<00:02:47.669> emblems<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.359> choose

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
there's quite a few emblems to choose

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.149 
there's quite a few emblems to choose
from<00:02:48.719> by<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.019> same<00:02:49.200> time<00:02:49.439> I<00:02:49.650> want<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.040> choose

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
from by the same time I want to choose

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.250 
from by the same time I want to choose
one<00:02:50.370> though<00:02:50.579> sort<00:02:50.939> of<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.480> good<00:02:51.780> job<00:02:51.840> at<00:02:52.199> the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
one though sort of do a good job at the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.080 
one though sort of do a good job at the
same<00:02:52.409> time<00:02:52.620> making<00:02:52.889> it<00:02:53.069> very<00:02:53.310> very<00:02:53.579> effective

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
same time making it very very effective

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.170 
same time making it very very effective
so<00:02:54.659> it<00:02:55.169> seems<00:02:55.409> to<00:02:55.590> be<00:02:55.680> doing<00:02:55.909> business<00:02:56.909> here

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
so it seems to be doing business here

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.080 
so it seems to be doing business here
and<00:02:57.829> at<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:58.980> bottom<00:02:59.129> for<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.579> bottom<00:02:59.879> one<00:03:00.000> in

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
and at the bottom for the bottom one in

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.339 
and at the bottom for the bottom one in
the<00:03:00.180> middle<00:03:00.329> what<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.900> could<00:03:01.019> do<00:03:01.139> is<00:03:01.230> actually

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
the middle what you could do is actually

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.869 
the middle what you could do is actually
take<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.769> flip<00:03:02.040> upside<00:03:02.340> down<00:03:02.489> as<00:03:02.609> you<00:03:02.669> can<00:03:02.790> see

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
take it flip upside down as you can see

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.399 
take it flip upside down as you can see
i<00:03:02.909> did<00:03:03.120> there<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:03.359> then<00:03:03.599> open<00:03:04.049> it<00:03:04.079> out<00:03:04.199> and

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
i did there and then open it out and

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.379 
i did there and then open it out and
make<00:03:04.469> it<00:03:04.620> wider<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.129> is<00:03:05.250> because<00:03:05.549> if<00:03:05.790> you

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
make it wider and this is because if you

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.420 
make it wider and this is because if you
just<00:03:07.139> originally<00:03:07.469> just<00:03:07.469> put<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.829> as<00:03:07.919> you've

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
just originally just put it as you've

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.209 
just originally just put it as you've
taken<00:03:08.939> the<00:03:09.120> other<00:03:09.239> one<00:03:09.590> what<00:03:10.590> we<00:03:10.769> find<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.189> that

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219 
taken the other one what we find is that

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.610 
taken the other one what we find is that
the<00:03:11.549> triangle<00:03:12.090> sort<00:03:12.299> of<00:03:12.359> make<00:03:12.719> go<00:03:13.290> wider<00:03:13.500> a

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
the triangle sort of make go wider a

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.439 
the triangle sort of make go wider a
different<00:03:13.980> angle<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.669> got<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.269> go<00:03:15.329> make

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:15.449 
different angle so you got to go make

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.050 
different angle so you got to go make
sure<00:03:15.569> that<00:03:15.719> the<00:03:15.810> top<00:03:15.989> bits<00:03:16.199> at<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.379> bottom<00:03:16.439> and

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
sure that the top bits at the bottom and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.699 
sure that the top bits at the bottom and
he'll<00:03:18.060> soft<00:03:18.419> it<00:03:19.079> sounds<00:03:19.259> a<00:03:19.290> bit<00:03:19.379> complicated

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
he'll soft it sounds a bit complicated

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.349 
he'll soft it sounds a bit complicated
and<00:03:20.040> I'm<00:03:20.189> confusing<00:03:20.579> myself<00:03:20.699> thing<00:03:21.120> I'm<00:03:21.329> doing

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
and I'm confusing myself thing I'm doing

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.349 
and I'm confusing myself thing I'm doing
it<00:03:21.689> but<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:23.340> also<00:03:23.549> figure<00:03:23.909> it<00:03:24.000> out<00:03:24.090> as<00:03:24.209> you're

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
it but you also figure it out as you're

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.189 
it but you also figure it out as you're
going<00:03:24.479> along<00:03:24.629> and<00:03:25.879> now<00:03:26.879> here<00:03:27.180> I'm<00:03:27.329> there<00:03:27.720> 20<00:03:28.079> we

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
going along and now here I'm there 20 we

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.990 
going along and now here I'm there 20 we
just<00:03:28.319> go<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.650> write<00:03:28.829> this<00:03:29.009> some<00:03:29.310> thing<00:03:29.909> is

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
just go and write this some thing is

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.379 
just go and write this some thing is
Santos<00:03:30.329> here<00:03:30.569> and<00:03:30.859> get<00:03:31.859> that<00:03:32.009> in<00:03:32.129> I<00:03:32.340> think<00:03:33.299> it's

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
Santos here and get that in I think it's

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.610 
Santos here and get that in I think it's
Santos<00:03:33.629> FC<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.079> you<00:03:34.139> should<00:03:34.259> go<00:03:34.319> to<00:03:34.379> put<00:03:34.500> in

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
Santos FC that you should go to put in

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.809 
Santos FC that you should go to put in
but<00:03:34.739> we've<00:03:34.859> got<00:03:34.979> to<00:03:35.040> change<00:03:35.189> the<00:03:35.310> scaling<00:03:35.549> on

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
but we've got to change the scaling on

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.879 
but we've got to change the scaling on
the<00:03:35.939> actual<00:03:36.239> s<00:03:36.930> over<00:03:37.379> there<00:03:37.560> then<00:03:37.709> we're<00:03:37.799> going

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
the actual s over there then we're going

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.349 
the actual s over there then we're going
to<00:03:37.949> clone<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.340> over<00:03:38.669> do<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.819> technique<00:03:39.090> that

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
to clone it over do the technique that

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.969 
to clone it over do the technique that
do<00:03:39.509> all<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.959> time<00:03:40.109> when<00:03:40.319> it<00:03:40.560> comes<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.769> running

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
do all the time when it comes to running

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.259 
do all the time when it comes to running
is<00:03:41.099> just<00:03:41.129> cloning<00:03:41.519> over<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:41.819> Slayers<00:03:42.060> and

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
is just cloning over the Slayers and

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.710 
is just cloning over the Slayers and
then<00:03:42.989> putting<00:03:43.319> in<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.799> sea<00:03:44.489> finally<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.209> then

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
then putting in the sea finally and then

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.909 
then putting in the sea finally and then
you<00:03:45.840> got<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:45.989> realize<00:03:46.169> that<00:03:46.290> there's<00:03:46.470> few<00:03:46.739> dots

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
you got to realize that there's few dots

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.039 
you got to realize that there's few dots
over<00:03:47.069> that<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.370> think<00:03:47.639> that's<00:03:47.790> two<00:03:47.879> dots<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.959> we

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
over that I think that's two dots so we

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.330 
over that I think that's two dots so we
got<00:03:49.139> to<00:03:49.199> get<00:03:49.259> those<00:03:49.379> put<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:49.739> there<00:03:49.859> one<00:03:49.979> uses<00:03:50.310> a

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
got to get those put in there one uses a

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.099 
got to get those put in there one uses a
rounded<00:03:50.759> square<00:03:50.849> as<00:03:51.389> I<00:03:51.540> feel<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.810> probably<00:03:52.019> the

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
rounded square as I feel is probably the

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.409 
rounded square as I feel is probably the
best<00:03:52.319> it<00:03:52.590> doesn't<00:03:52.829> look<00:03:52.949> at<00:03:53.129> two<00:03:53.879> squared<00:03:54.269> offs

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
best it doesn't look at two squared offs

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:55.819 
best it doesn't look at two squared offs
and<00:03:54.659> it<00:03:54.810> looks<00:03:54.989> very<00:03:55.079> close<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.620> actual

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
and it looks very close to the actual

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.099 
and it looks very close to the actual
emblem<00:03:56.219> and<00:03:56.310> then<00:03:56.969> I'm<00:03:57.599> going<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.810> work<00:03:57.959> on

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
emblem and then I'm going to work on

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.330 
emblem and then I'm going to work on
that<00:03:58.290> football<00:03:58.530> bit<00:03:58.799> over<00:03:58.979> there<00:03:59.099> so<00:03:59.189> I'm<00:03:59.250> just

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
that football bit over there so I'm just

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.099 
that football bit over there so I'm just
going<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.519> change<00:03:59.790> up<00:03:59.939> here<00:04:00.150> but<00:04:00.719> guys<00:04:00.870> at<00:04:00.900> the

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
going to change up here but guys at the

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.869 
going to change up here but guys at the
