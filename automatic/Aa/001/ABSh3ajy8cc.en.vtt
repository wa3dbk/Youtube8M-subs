ballistics both of these are perks on

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.000 
ballistics both of these are perks on
the<00:00:17.430> last<00:00:17.699> word<00:00:17.970> weapon<00:00:18.300> itself<00:00:18.740> that's<00:00:19.740> just

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
the last word weapon itself that's just

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.529 
the last word weapon itself that's just
my<00:00:20.130> loadout<00:00:20.460> right<00:00:20.699> there<00:00:20.880> guys<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.270> figure

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
my loadout right there guys I figure

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.029 
my loadout right there guys I figure
everyone<00:00:21.810> probably<00:00:22.140> loads<00:00:22.500> there's<00:00:22.769> and

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
everyone probably loads there's and

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.470 
everyone probably loads there's and
stability<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:23.970> let's<00:00:24.119> take<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.269> look<00:00:24.420> at

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
stability but let's take a look at

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.910 
stability but let's take a look at
aggressive<00:00:24.779> ballistics<00:00:25.380> now<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.560> get<00:00:25.769> that

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
aggressive ballistics now you get that

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.130 
aggressive ballistics now you get that
plus<00:00:26.220> ten<00:00:26.460> percent<00:00:26.820> damage<00:00:27.000> minus<00:00:27.570> five<00:00:27.779> range

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
plus ten percent damage minus five range

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.769 
plus ten percent damage minus five range
and<00:00:28.349> minus<00:00:28.680> five<00:00:29.179> stability<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.420> we're<00:00:30.720> just

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
and minus five stability and we're just

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.880 
and minus five stability and we're just
going<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:30.990> do<00:00:31.170> I'm<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.500> show<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> few

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
going to do I'm going to show a few

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.830 
going to do I'm going to show a few
clips<00:00:32.250> right<00:00:32.460> now<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:33.030> how<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.630> actually

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
clips right now of how it actually

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.150 
clips right now of how it actually
handles<00:00:34.340> in<00:00:35.340> PvP<00:00:36.059> does<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> very<00:00:36.480> good<00:00:36.899> job

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
handles in PvP does a very good job

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.400 
handles in PvP does a very good job
especially<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.969> close<00:00:39.000> situations<00:00:39.750> if

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
especially for up close situations if

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.410 
especially for up close situations if
you<00:00:40.530> come<00:00:40.680> around<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.070> corner<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:42.180> got<00:00:42.390> a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
you come around the corner and you got a

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.150 
you come around the corner and you got a
guy<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> shotgun<00:00:43.079> or<00:00:43.260> fusion<00:00:43.590> rifle<00:00:44.040> it

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
guy with a shotgun or fusion rifle it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.940 
guy with a shotgun or fusion rifle it
just<00:00:44.370> guns<00:00:44.670> them<00:00:44.940> down<00:00:45.210> immediately<00:00:45.950> I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
just guns them down immediately I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.010 
just guns them down immediately I
actually<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.760> always<00:00:48.120> been<00:00:48.239> one<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.660> use

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
actually have always been one to use

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.990 
actually have always been one to use
soft<00:00:49.379> ballistics<00:00:49.980> over-aggressive<00:00:50.520> so

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
soft ballistics over-aggressive so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.350 
soft ballistics over-aggressive so
recently<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:51.719> started<00:00:52.289> using<00:00:53.360> aggressive

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
recently I just started using aggressive

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.319 
recently I just started using aggressive
ballistics<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.230> work<00:00:55.670> wonderful<00:00:56.670> I

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
ballistics and they work wonderful I

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.720 
ballistics and they work wonderful I
would<00:00:58.170> say<00:00:58.500> though<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.859> there<00:00:59.550> has<00:00:59.699> been

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
would say though that there has been

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.670 
would say though that there has been
times<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> gun<00:01:00.750> did<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> little<00:01:01.469> bit

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
times that the gun did get a little bit

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.260 
times that the gun did get a little bit
out<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.829> control<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.000> lack<00:01:03.239> of

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
out of control with that lack of

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.929 
out of control with that lack of
stability<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.710> whole<00:01:05.129> lot<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.640> really

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
stability it's not a whole lot to really

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.789 
stability it's not a whole lot to really
make<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> huge<00:01:06.540> difference<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.530> are

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
make a huge difference but if you are

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.219 
make a huge difference but if you are
used<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.369> using<00:01:08.700> soft<00:01:09.240> ballistics<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.990> bunch

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
used to using soft ballistics a bunch

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.649 
used to using soft ballistics a bunch
like<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.130> was<00:01:11.549> which<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.150> only<00:01:12.330> thing<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
like I was which was the only thing I

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.429 
like I was which was the only thing I
use<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:14.520> will<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.509> different<00:01:16.140> feel

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
use you will get it's a different feel

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.840 
use you will get it's a different feel
for<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> weapon<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.250> not<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> whole<00:01:17.670> new

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
for the weapon it's not a whole new

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.719 
for the weapon it's not a whole new
weapon<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> different<00:01:19.170> feel<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.729> so

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
weapon but it is a different feel and so

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.530 
weapon but it is a different feel and so
we're<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> we're<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.330> take<00:01:21.479> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
we're going to we're going to take a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.179 
we're going to we're going to take a
look<00:01:21.750> here<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.470> moment<00:01:22.770> at<00:01:22.860> soft

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
look here in just a moment at soft

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.289 
look here in just a moment at soft
ballistics<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.970> see<00:01:24.210> how<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.630> does<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:25.799> far<00:01:26.159> as

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
ballistics and see how it does as far as

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.300 
ballistics and see how it does as far as
damaging<00:01:27.299> PvP<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:27.900> how<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.409> compares<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
damaging PvP and how it compares to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.620 
damaging PvP and how it compares to
aggressive<00:01:30.000> ballistics<00:01:32.329> all<00:01:33.329> right<00:01:33.420> guys

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
aggressive ballistics all right guys

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.840 
aggressive ballistics all right guys
soft<00:01:34.409> ballistics<00:01:34.979> minus<00:01:35.310> five<00:01:35.520> percent

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
soft ballistics minus five percent

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.450 
soft ballistics minus five percent
damage<00:01:36.090> plus<00:01:36.780> ten<00:01:37.200> stability<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.280> will

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
damage plus ten stability so you will

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.190 
damage plus ten stability so you will
get<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.670> instability<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.990> why

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
get that instability and this is why

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
get that instability and this is why
look<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.369> little<00:01:41.579> bit<00:01:41.670> longer

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
look at that it's a little bit longer

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.069 
look at that it's a little bit longer
range<00:01:42.270> that's<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.570> little<00:01:42.750> more<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
range that's a little more of a

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.350 
range that's a little more of a
mid-range<00:01:43.619> fight<00:01:44.040> right<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.210> this

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
mid-range fight right here and so this

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.929 
mid-range fight right here and so this
is<00:01:45.540> when<00:01:45.689> soft<00:01:45.990> ballistics<00:01:46.530> kind<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.829> shine<00:01:47.100> it

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
is when soft ballistics kind of shine it

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.230 
is when soft ballistics kind of shine it
does<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> better<00:01:48.540> job<00:01:48.890> at<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.340> mid-range<00:01:50.640> than

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
does a better job at at mid-range than

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.480
