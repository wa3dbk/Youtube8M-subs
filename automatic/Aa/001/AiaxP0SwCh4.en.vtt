00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.570
 if you could see those who burn in 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.540
 my fight my life i have it obama jadwa 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.800
 black geipel work or staggered away on 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.690
 had done almost every instrument of 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.310
 the album because we had the green light 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.740
 from first contacts we had 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.230
 through lawyers' editors 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.870
 managers the contact is apparently 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.699
 the request the second request for 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.320
 the undeniably morricone was unacceptable 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.890
 for the group when we learned about the 20th 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.190
 September 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.560
 he asked me to keep the works 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.940
 original for title ie even 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.390
 if we write a text that had nothing 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.100
 to have 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.010
 original to look at the titles 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.239
 originals in Italian especially given all 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.829
 rights that is to say all the work 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.620
 that they accomplished above was 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.680
 transparent and it's just 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.300
 for us unmanageable is unacceptable we 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.250
 decided to abandon it 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.530
 it was our on September 10 but the v 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.539
 it was our 11th of September where the towers 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.810
 collapsed in the aftermath has 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.170
 a 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.560
 a little dejection these e-bonds the worry 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.940
 we have a major concern present the books 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.190
 than january because he is a teacher 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.360
 at berkeley noyoux and it is there that the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.229
 January when the books we want the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.110
 do with prince charles 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.159
 we paid to share in new york we paid 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.900
 the studio in new york 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.250
 what are we doing and we have 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.700
 rolled up the sleeves and we left 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.450
 completely 21 september with no 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.729
 piece and we made 43 3 21 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.799
 September 22 7 and 22 December in 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.380
 effect 43 titles so 35 completely 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.610
 completed but what we did we did 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.159
 a work method that completely 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.080
 different from the other albums 1 by 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.460
 against it was a tightening that 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.020
 looks more like a tightening of 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.960
 does he work at the microphone school 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.060
 money 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.920
 lights and planet mars is to say a 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.409
 historical album of the iam group and 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.430
 the iam band but not the iam band 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.420
 that is to say with very little 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.810
 external interventions 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.679
 the latter denies and women dance is 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.080
 also intervened and and aca hauling 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.510
 rhythm there as a flash team of a marvel 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.640
 we learned the studio was actually 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.250
 was supposed to do the album and cosca 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.900
 we made each corner and we serve 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.090
 danjou's work was writing a place 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.310
 because a component our hunger does and 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.840
 it's good work on stars between 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.950
 place I was working with sand on 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.750
 other instruments right time 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.010
 I wrote another place he elaborated 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.840
 his scratches in another room on 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.580
 made videos that are no less than 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.590
 video teaser that have been launched yet 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.209
 yesterday when we shot in New York 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.890
 but similar in the same principle to new 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.180
 york with françois go fast come on 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.769
 so going to build is going to turn a 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.690
 teaser and we want the playback 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.180
 we added scratchs hainard fact 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.170
 voices did not remake a new piece 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.340
 we did not stop until the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.000
 last limit by the way fortunately 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:59.989
 we have limits otherwise it will be too much 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.690
 Martian late for us it's inscribed 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:08.920
 historically of a true lineage of 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.480
 an iam album in the sun of aia but one 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.680
 also stopped on this album the race 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.180
 to arms what is called it is to 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.700
 to say the race to novelty absolutely 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.890
 we abandon to run novelty for 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.900
 do their learn costs so 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.910
 today we listen to rap 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.720
 American mainly but when the 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.030
 artists we love 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.330
 even if it's old 6th of 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.420
 mainstream the old two patterns 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:36.050
 or so new ones like joey badass 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.870
 as smoke disagreement as the drag 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.330
 dynasty not moved this casanova papoose 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.970
 here we are going to make an album of iam 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.530
 timeless without calculation etc and but what 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.940
 is the sound of the world but it is certain that we 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.230
 will hear more about new york what 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:58.970
 Los Angeles or another city 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:04:00.950
 no south especially in the imagery already 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.870
 of an imagery but gives in the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.340
 final count in the way of 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.200
 to work 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.940
 what we felt was something 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.290
 looks like the school of money mic and 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.600
 quantum or tmx charge 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.370
 even in sound and in the way 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.410
 to bring the odds were after there 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:24.550
 had a part that was wanted it's 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:29.150
 what I say once and he said he 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.710
 did j if you compare me this album there 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.300
 an album from another group 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.970
 yes it would be problematic but a good one 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.830
 moment we have the right when 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.970
 even to tap into the reference of our 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.010
 albums is a minimum 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.419
 so at some point it's sure that 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.289
 it remained in the head it remains a 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.460
 great memories 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.300
 registration and we wanted 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.190
 reproduce the conditions 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.650
 registration who had on the school 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.630
 but oversupplies and lights in the sun 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.100
 torrential rains submitted to the mine 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.610
 the attention of France especially already the 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.870
 first thing is that the first 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.000
 function of her buttocks and we got 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:06.360
 pleasure because we had the bad 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.720
 new is something to be done 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.580
 pleasure 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.170
 i swear to new york then it's 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.180
 the arrival at the studio in the morning isere and 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.620
 art what is it good and all the 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.020
 days every day it was good we are 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.680
 past there are some of us 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.460
 hello silence is the best french 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.750

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.240

 empty there was some kind of abymes 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.160
 it's a drama it stopped Sylvia 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.650
 then at the same time one is aware that 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.940
 it may be even in view of what 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.380
 waiting for us in our contracts it's up to 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.360
 to say this is our last album a cons 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.190
 one may be the same the last time 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.560

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.890
 all this time if you allowed better 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.260
 endure a lot of difficult moments 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.790
 and accept all the good times of 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.740
 to support macrobiotic food 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.720
 of imhotep in the cupboards of 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.310
 the apartment where we ate the food

 hippies the arts the dried seaweed the 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.930
 principles and the combo chalbos of

 vinegar the man drinks vinegar and a 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.390
 pink on years and no it's especially when 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.630
 we know something we did 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.110
 together and there is a lot of a lot 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.630
 of friendship a lot of love and 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.880
 and it's my body and its ways of 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.220
 to laugh with each other are 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.170
 things that translate elsewhere 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.750
 a lot of a lot of affection and 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:46.510
 a lot of esteem had to wait so 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.880
 to help respective minamoto to the revelers 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.300
 all alone in our corner have made the 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.740
 rap 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.380
 why do we say we want it in time 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.420
 full with PASJ sand in 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.160
 lungs always appears to buckle nab 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.470
 around we assume balls 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.310
 the Gambians in the gangs and we will 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.500
 fall 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.870
 you can title redman to rooms 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.400

 own assets that make rap it does not happen 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.490
 not even to follow me they are cooked without 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:19.080
 die will not count anymore and 20 cases very 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.080
 wave their assaults
