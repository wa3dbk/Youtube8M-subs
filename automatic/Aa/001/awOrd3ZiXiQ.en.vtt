00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.620
 the shrubs we plant them and then that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.969
 pushes it grows results well they 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.020
 end up getting embarrassed because we have them 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.029
 planted too close to each other 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.400
 for that, what remedy and well everything 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.560
 simply transplanting them transplanting 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.689
 a shrub asks for some 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.220
 precautions because you have to tear it off 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.189
 with a fashion that is sufficiently 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.840
 big compared to its volume by 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.859
 example for a shrub that gets used to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.750
 about 1 meter 50 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.120
 it's a loaf it's going to take a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.640
 touch a fashion that faces roughly 50 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.710
 cm diameter 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.100
 it is at labÃ¨ge that it happens 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:55.440
 slice the roots to about 20 25 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:57.690
 centimeters of the hole at the worst it takes 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.440
 we feel have sliced roots with 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.180
 wade once we 've been fishing all around 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.369
 that we sliced â€‹â€‹we call it serves but 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.909
 the shrub is lifted by levering 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.909
 with fishing 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.670
 this is my bread that is torn off with a 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.930
 fashion which is a little bit smaller than 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.880
 what I had planned but it's not 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.170
 serious because the roots they are 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.820
 very compact they are well in this 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.830
 game can go replant it elsewhere 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.280
 in a place where there will be more spaced 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.280
 to develop 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.119
 here the bread is going to have something to grow 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.159
 and express themselves and without hindering 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.220
 so I 'm just going to make a 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.360
 hole place it in and watered it's 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.360
 no more stupid than that transplanted 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.710
