00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.099
 Hello 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.720
 all right 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.520
 ah 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.580
 very good to all the boys and girls 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.230
 I am bright and in this video we will continue 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.200
 with the ideas that could appear in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.700
 call of duty zombies of 2015 I leave you a 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.860
 previous bío link here if not 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.690
 I 've seen it and there we go I hope that you 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.489
 like 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.109
 in the previous day we were talking 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.940
 of the pack up and fusion the machine that 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.460
 allows to merge two weapons to obtain 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.860
 a brand new third level weapon 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.379
 if the combination is correct as in 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.930
 black ops 1 there were 36 weapons there is a total 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.360
 of 18 correct combinations that is 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.760
 18 third level weapons with skills 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.379
 and very special features in the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.329
 previous video we saw a few of 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.309
 those weapons and between this video and the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.409
 next we will finish seeing them all 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.760
 I suggest you put in the comments 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.229
 things like what would your weapon be 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.759
 favorite among all those that we will go 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.100
 watching in this video or commenting 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.450
 some of them if you like them if not what 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.369
 you will change them so that it is not 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.720
 so easy to pass rounds because it's true 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.250
 that most of these souls and the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.450
 put in this way they would be very 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.450
 closed and so on 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.650
 let's start with this weapon that in my 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.140
 opinion would be very original I would like 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.570
 a lot and it's known as the tar 115 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.820
 adrenaline when we combine a weapon of 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.340
 high power and low cadence as the 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.080
 predictor the improvement of the command and a 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.930
 weapon of low power and high cadence 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.120
 as the improvement of the mp l we get this 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.740
 third level weapon the name of tar 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.020
 comes from advanced rifle 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.090
 technologically and adrenaline is due to 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.800
 its effect and that is to adapt 115 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.630
 adrenaline acts in one way or another 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.220
 according to the adrenaline levels of 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.470
 user 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.570
 in this way if we are long time 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.300
 firing the cadence increases and the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.190
 recoil gradually decreases by 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.140
 another side if we are long time 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.720
 accepting the shots the power 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.190
 will gradually increase so if 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.470
 we learn to use it correctly and 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.300
 we shoot a lot accepting all the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.850
 shots we can increase at the same time his 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.620
 cadence and power it's about a rifle 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.110
 of assault with a red dot sight and 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.360
 with a large capacity in the loader 75 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.020
 bullets per magazine with a total of 750 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.020
 bullets 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.520
 now we move on to another third weapon 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.470
 also very peculiar level and it is known 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.600
 as intensity and you get by 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.460
 combination of flashpoint the improvement that 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.520
 has been fed from the in field and a 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.430
 sniper like the psg 2 the improvement of 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.860
 the psc 1 flashpoint has a flashlight 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.690
 coupled under the barrel and psg 2 it 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.700
 is about a sniper with blue eyes 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.680
 so the combination of these weapons 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.930
 gives rise to the intensity a sniper 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.300
 third level that triggers an intense 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.370
 laser beam let's talk first of the of 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.570
 115 flashpoint because surely the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.550
 most of you would be 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.780
 asking what the fuck does a 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.030
 Flashlight in zombie mode 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.950
 the creators of these ideas have thought 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.630
 As we will see later on, the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.520
 maps should have some areas 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.800
 dark that not even activating the 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.830
 electricity on the map we can illuminate 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.450
 the lantern coupled 115 flash 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.250
 point that would light with the button 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.590
 right like it was a grenade launcher 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.150
 it would be useful for us to be able to see 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.100
 as we move through these areas 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.319
 dark so the flashlight will 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.489
 would become an accessory 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.069
 indispensable if we want to cross it 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.870
 without dying on the other hand to give you more 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.910
 utility the flashlight have thought that 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.489
 it would also serve to attract bonuses like 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.320
 by two low instantaneous etcetera and 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.060
 Fallen colleagues who need to be 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.620
 revived and are too far away 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.570
 to reach them 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.580
 once seen this we turn to intensity 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.680
 the light sniper obtained thank you 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.630
 to pack up the fusion when firing 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.950
 intensity not only throws a laser beam 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.630
 that kills all the zombies that 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.610
 goes through but also creates a 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.230
 blinding flash that affects and stuns 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.730
 the zombies in front of us 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.310
 for a small period of time 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.650
 about two seconds in semiautomatic 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.209
 kill already from a shot until round 30 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.209
 or so and has a blue scope 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.780
 the next third level soul that 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.820
 let's see in this video it's called 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.890
 fallout and you get by combination of 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.830
 a weapon with grenade launcher as the improvement 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.470
 of the m16 and a revolver as the cobra the 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.600
 improvement of the python is called thus fallout 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.210
 by the cloud of toxic waste that leaves 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.460
 his explosive ammunition what he's going to do 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.710
 this weapon is to shoot limpet bombs like 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.630
 send text or crossbow mustaches that 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.420
 stick on any wall surface 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.520
 ground zombies these bombs would explode 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.440
 shortly after the impact producing a 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.540
 explosion that would harm all that zombie 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.760
 that is also close after the 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.740
 explosion would remain a residual cloud 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.630
 similar to that left by the zombie gas 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.490
 that would hurt all the zombies that 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.470
 will go through it 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.670
 fallout has 6 pump per charger with 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.670
 a total of 60 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.860
 the next weapon is known as 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.900
 hibernate or because of their ability to 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.090
 Freeze is obtained by combination of 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.640
 a freezing weapon like winter rage 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.000
 of five híber ruiz and a submachine gun as the 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.230
 improvement of the aca 74 this weapon of third 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.690
 level has a nitrogen tank 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.000
 liquid in the front of the barrel 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.070
 when firing from the weapon a 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.260
 blue flash that hits the zombies 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.600
 harms them and slows it down as if 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.760
 were frozen the hard effect 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.950
 about 23 seconds enough time to 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.870
 run away if they are many or kill them 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.340
 of a knife stroke after that time 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.340
 will return to their normal speed 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.080
 and the last weapon of the third level that 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.090
 let's see in this video is known as 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.140
 focal point and is obtained by combination 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.500
 of a weapon of electromagnetic waves 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:40.020
 that have been invented known as the sw 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.710
 fasher and a weapon with variable zoom like 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.620
 the ce 115 generator improves from 11 the 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.870
 name of sw phase comes from short wave 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.330
 to be since this weapon shoots waves of 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.000
 short wavelength and therefore 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.710
 high energy and the focal name points 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.810
 it's because focal point is the point 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.700
 where a projection reaches its maximum 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.440
 intensity and this weapon has a 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.560
 determined distance in which the 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.840
 waves are more intense on the one hand the 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.850
 fasher will launch an infrared ray that 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.500
 it causes the zombies to become dehydrated and 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.450
 burn in this way if the lightning 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.370
 infrared reaches a zombie the zombie 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.919
 will emit steam until it is done 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.410
 enough damage to die your 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.450
 improved version the sw fasher shoots 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.280
 gamma rays instead of infrared so 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.040
 that does more damage and can go through 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.350
 more than one zombie focal point of the weapon of 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.600
 third level is the same as the fasher but 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.700
 focal point has an extra sight this 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.560
 Look is a focus lens while 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.660
 we are aiming and shooting 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.090
 move the energy beam with the joystick 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.250
 right and if we pass that ray by 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.040
 the focus lens the beam of light will make 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.389
 double the damage and you're already these have 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.820
 been all the souls that we have seen in 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:50.160
 this video comment you already know which has 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.690
 liked more and what would you change them a 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.410
 hello and see you next video 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.410
 goodbye
