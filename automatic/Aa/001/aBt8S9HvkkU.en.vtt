here and the people who are teaching
here<00:00:13.410> well<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:13.920> think<00:00:14.130> we<00:00:14.400> start<00:00:14.700> really<00:00:14.969> with

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
here well I think we start really with

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.840 
here well I think we start really with
the<00:00:15.599> mission<00:00:15.929> statement<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.500> school<00:00:16.890> we're

the mission statement in school we're

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.029 
the mission statement in school we're
thinking<00:00:18.240> about<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.930> lifelong<00:00:19.529> learners

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
thinking about the lifelong learners

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.099 
thinking about the lifelong learners
we're<00:00:20.340> thinking<00:00:20.670> about<00:00:20.970> children<00:00:21.539> becoming

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
we're thinking about children becoming

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.550 
we're thinking about children becoming
adults<00:00:23.100> who<00:00:23.220> will<00:00:23.340> be<00:00:23.930> socially<00:00:24.930> involved<00:00:25.439> I

adults who will be socially involved I

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.189 
adults who will be socially involved I
do<00:00:25.710> think<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.279> school<00:00:26.490> offers<00:00:26.910> a

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
do think that the school offers a

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.800 
do think that the school offers a
genuine<00:00:28.199> self<00:00:28.920> caring<00:00:29.480> child<00:00:30.480> based

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
genuine self caring child based

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.190 
genuine self caring child based
curriculum<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.949> which<00:00:31.980> children<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.579> grow

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
curriculum in which children can grow

curriculum in which children can grow
and<00:00:34.200> explore<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.860> very<00:00:35.070> things<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.640> they

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
and explore the very things that they

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.540 
and explore the very things that they
are<00:00:36.090> interested<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.899> with<00:00:37.399> expanding<00:00:38.399> their

children are required to look at things
from<00:01:07.860> many<00:01:08.310> different<00:01:08.549> angles<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.530> understand

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
from many different angles to understand

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.010 
from many different angles to understand
the<00:01:10.650> notion<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.040> empathy<00:01:11.850> from<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.360> curriculum

world from their perspective that's
multicultural<00:01:36.900> education<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.710> think<00:01:37.860> part<00:01:38.220> of

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
multicultural education I think part of

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.999 
multicultural education I think part of
what<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:39.450> I've<00:01:39.600> had<00:01:39.750> our<00:01:39.869> approach<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.470> that

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
what like I've had our approach is that

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.679 
what like I've had our approach is that
it's<00:01:41.670> students<00:01:42.060> learning<00:01:42.210> from<00:01:42.390> each<00:01:42.479> other

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
it's students learning from each other

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.350 
it's students learning from each other
it's<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.460> an<00:01:44.460> expert<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.119> front<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
it's not an expert up in the front of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.999 
it's not an expert up in the front of
the<00:01:45.420> room<00:01:45.540> pontificating<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> Gordon

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the room pontificating to be a Gordon

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.520 
the room pontificating to be a Gordon
teacher<00:01:47.220> means<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.240> need<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> be

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
teacher means that you need to be

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.039 
teacher means that you need to be
connected<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> all<00:01:50.700> those<00:01:50.939> aspects<00:01:51.899> of

connected to all those aspects of

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.469 
connected to all those aspects of
teaching<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:53.250> those<00:01:53.549> aspects<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.180> who<00:01:54.329> you

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
teaching but those aspects of who you

outside<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.760> classes<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.420> teach

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
outside of the classes that you teach

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.740 
outside of the classes that you teach
and<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.860> see<00:02:08.040> development<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.450> then

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
and so you can see development and then

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.810 
and so you can see development and then
from<00:02:10.290> year<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.619> year<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.100> teacher<00:02:11.430> has

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
from year to year the teacher has

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.880 
from year to year the teacher has
one-on-one<00:02:12.270> time<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.200> students

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
one-on-one time with you the students

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.830 
one-on-one time with you the students
get<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.070> know<00:02:14.220> each<00:02:14.460> other<00:02:14.610> really<00:02:15.060> well<00:02:15.210> I

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
get to know each other really well I

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.060 
get to know each other really well I
could<00:02:16.020> probably<00:02:16.080> go<00:02:16.350> through<00:02:16.530> all<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.830> kids

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
could probably go through all the kids

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.220 
could probably go through all the kids
in<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.940> middle<00:02:18.270> school<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.990> tell<00:02:19.140> you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
in like the middle school and tell you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.930 
in like the middle school and tell you
their<00:02:19.440> name<00:02:19.710> what<00:02:20.130> grade<00:02:20.370> they're<00:02:20.610> in<00:02:20.730> and

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
their name what grade they're in and

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.030 
their name what grade they're in and
like<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.360> lot<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:21.960> stuff<00:02:22.230> about<00:02:22.350> them<00:02:22.680> we're<00:02:22.890> all

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
like a lot of stuff about them we're all

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.950 
like a lot of stuff about them we're all
friends<00:02:23.610> everybody<00:02:24.090> notes<00:02:24.270> everybody<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
friends everybody notes everybody and

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.930 
friends everybody notes everybody and
there<00:02:25.050> aren't<00:02:25.380> as<00:02:25.470> much<00:02:25.830> flips<00:02:26.490> as<00:02:26.700> there<00:02:26.820> are

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
there aren't as much flips as there are

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.190 
there aren't as much flips as there are
on<00:02:26.970> other<00:02:27.180> schools<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.780> think<00:02:27.810> our

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
on other schools I think our

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.500 
on other schools I think our
after-school<00:02:28.980> program<00:02:29.160> it's<00:02:29.910> called<00:02:30.120> Gators

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
after-school program it's called Gators

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.510 
after-school program it's called Gators
we<00:02:30.840> have<00:02:31.050> three<00:02:31.530> year<00:02:31.709> olds<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.250> same

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
we have three year olds in the same

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.500 
we have three year olds in the same
space<00:02:32.820> as<00:02:33.230> nine<00:02:34.230> year<00:02:34.530> olds<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:36.180> start

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
space as nine year olds and so you start

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.330 
space as nine year olds and so you start
to<00:02:36.570> get<00:02:36.930> these<00:02:37.080> relationships<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:38.040> form

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
to get these relationships that form

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.040 
to get these relationships that form
between<00:02:38.520> third<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.060> fourth<00:02:39.209> graders<00:02:39.750> and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
between third and fourth graders and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.770 
between third and fourth graders and
maybe<00:02:40.740> nursery<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.370> preschool<00:02:41.790> students<00:02:42.150> so

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
maybe nursery and preschool students so

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.720 
maybe nursery and preschool students so
these<00:02:43.080> little<00:02:43.380> ones<00:02:43.530> come<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.040> Gators<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.640> are

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
these little ones come to Gators and are

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.270 
these little ones come to Gators and are
immediately<00:02:45.090> swept<00:02:45.540> up<00:02:45.750> by<00:02:45.990> older<00:02:46.830> students

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
immediately swept up by older students

to<00:02:47.430> play<00:02:47.580> with<00:02:47.760> them<00:02:47.910> boredom<00:02:48.810> focus<00:02:49.080> is

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
to play with them boredom focus is

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.740 
to play with them boredom focus is
primarily<00:02:49.620> on<00:02:50.010> elementary<00:02:50.790> education<00:02:51.240> that's

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
primarily on elementary education that's

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.480 
primarily on elementary education that's
what<00:02:51.959> makes<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:52.650> unique<00:02:52.860> from<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.370> other

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
what makes it so unique from the other

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.460 
what makes it so unique from the other
independent<00:02:54.150> schools<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.900> fact<00:02:55.170> that<00:02:55.290> it

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
independent schools the fact that it

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.800 
independent schools the fact that it
just<00:02:55.500> goes<00:02:55.950> up<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.280> eighth<00:02:56.459> grade<00:02:56.910> she's<00:02:57.570> not
