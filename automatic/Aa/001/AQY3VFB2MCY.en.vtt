that's<00:01:58.680> really<00:01:58.979> cool<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.490> means<00:02:00.450> you're

think<00:02:31.349> about<00:02:31.409> it<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.709> he<00:02:31.829> will<00:02:31.920> say<00:02:32.069> it's<00:02:32.220> flat

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
think about it so he will say it's flat

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.699 
think about it so he will say it's flat
and<00:02:32.849> it<00:02:32.970> won't<00:02:33.180> work<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:33.870> earthworks<00:02:34.500> aren't

and it won't work and earthworks aren't

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
resilience and now going into our second

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.509 
resilience and now going into our second
year<00:03:36.750> with<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.109> system<00:03:37.379> I<00:03:37.769> look<00:03:38.159> forward<00:03:38.430> to

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
year with this system I look forward to

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.369 
year with this system I look forward to
showing<00:03:38.729> it<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.299> by<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.930> time<00:03:40.169> we<00:03:40.290> get

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
showing it to you by the time we get

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:41.930 
showing it to you by the time we get
into<00:03:40.590> mid<00:03:40.769> spring<00:03:41.099> but<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.430> think<00:03:41.699> it's<00:03:41.790> going

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
into mid spring but I think it's going

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.879 
into mid spring but I think it's going
to<00:03:41.970> be<00:03:42.090> pretty<00:03:42.510> impressive<00:03:42.959> anyway<00:03:43.829> I<00:03:43.859> just

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
to be pretty impressive anyway I just

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.129 
to be pretty impressive anyway I just
wanted<00:03:44.159> to<00:03:44.250> check<00:03:44.459> in<00:03:44.519> with<00:03:44.699> you<00:03:44.940> on<00:03:44.970> that

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
wanted to check in with you on that

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.409 
wanted to check in with you on that
