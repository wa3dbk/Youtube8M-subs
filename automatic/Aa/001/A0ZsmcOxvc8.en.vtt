00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the hips the dlc even came out so this

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.590 
the hips the dlc even came out so this
has<00:02:01.649> been<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.950> way<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.310> dlc<00:02:02.880> weapons<00:02:03.420> are

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
has been the way that dlc weapons are

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.030 
has been the way that dlc weapons are
actually<00:02:03.960> been<00:02:04.079> li<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.290> same<00:02:04.590> things<00:02:04.770> happen

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
actually been li the same things happen

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.530 
actually been li the same things happen
recently<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.670> thermite<00:02:06.149> bomb<00:02:06.329> an

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
recently with the thermite bomb an

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.240 
recently with the thermite bomb an
actual<00:02:06.869> in-game<00:02:07.229> proof<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> thermite

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
actual in-game proof of the thermite

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.800 
actual in-game proof of the thermite
bomb<00:02:08.369> has<00:02:08.580> recently<00:02:08.940> been<00:02:09.060> found<00:02:09.330> once<00:02:09.509> again

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
bomb has recently been found once again

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.809 
bomb has recently been found once again
so<00:02:10.319> basically<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> way<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.550> dlc

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
so basically this is the way that dlc

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.800 
so basically this is the way that dlc
weapons<00:02:12.270> get<00:02:12.390> leaked

marketplace<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.830> believe<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.610> may<00:02:56.880> have<00:02:57.120> a

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
marketplace I believe that it may have a

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.670 
marketplace I believe that it may have a
direct<00:02:57.660> connection<00:02:57.720> I'm<00:02:58.230> not<00:02:58.349> saying<00:02:58.590> it's

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
direct connection I'm not saying it's

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.259 
direct connection I'm not saying it's
confirmed<00:02:59.010> once<00:02:59.250> again<00:02:59.489> goes<00:02:59.670> I'm<00:02:59.970> just

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269
