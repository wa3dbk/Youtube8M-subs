to have a DSLR for that splash or that

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.959 
to have a DSLR for that splash or that
macro<00:01:32.060> photography<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:32.749> do<00:01:33.340> not<00:01:34.340> not<00:01:34.670> really

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
macro photography I do not not really

macro photography I do not not really
not<00:01:35.149> really<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:35.539> case<00:01:35.689> this<00:01:36.350> should<00:01:36.530> be

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
not really the case this should be

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.090 
not really the case this should be
enough<00:01:36.859> it<00:01:37.429> has<00:01:37.700> all<00:01:38.259> manual<00:01:39.259> mode<00:01:39.499> I<00:01:39.740> mean<00:01:39.859> I

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
enough it has all manual mode I mean I

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.120 
enough it has all manual mode I mean I
mean<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.459> can<00:01:40.700> use<00:01:41.450> manual<00:01:42.200> shutter<00:01:42.529> speed<00:01:42.889> and

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
mean I can use manual shutter speed and

exposure manual focus plus it has the
hotshoe<00:01:51.340> connector<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:52.670> I<00:01:52.700> can<00:01:52.969> send<00:01:53.450> this

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
hotshoe connector so I can send this

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.830 
hotshoe connector so I can send this
studio<00:01:54.289> flashes<00:01:54.649> and<00:01:55.299> it<00:01:56.299> actually<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.659> has

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
studio flashes and it actually it has

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.580 
studio flashes and it actually it has
very<00:01:57.200> high<00:01:57.619> speed<00:01:59.020> the<00:02:00.020> flash

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
very high speed the flash

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.830 
very high speed the flash
synchronization<00:02:00.829> speed<00:02:01.490> which<00:02:02.149> is<00:02:02.299> somewhere

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
synchronization speed which is somewhere

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.529 
synchronization speed which is somewhere
between<00:02:03.049> 1<00:02:03.679> of<00:02:04.479> 2001<00:02:05.479> 4000<00:02:06.319> of<00:02:06.409> a<00:02:06.499> second

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
between 1 of 2001 4000 of a second

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.920 
between 1 of 2001 4000 of a second
something<00:02:08.539> which<00:02:08.780> DSLR<00:02:09.770> one<00:02:10.720> doesn't<00:02:11.720> have

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
something which DSLR one doesn't have

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.699 
something which DSLR one doesn't have
and<00:02:12.230> probably<00:02:12.410> won't<00:02:12.709> have<00:02:12.980> in<00:02:13.849> near<00:02:14.120> future

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
and probably won't have in near future
