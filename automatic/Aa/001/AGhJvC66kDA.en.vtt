capsule<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.389> you<00:01:42.959> may<00:01:43.139> prick<00:01:43.859> yourself<00:01:44.039> a<00:01:44.549> few

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
capsule on you may prick yourself a few

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.959 
capsule on you may prick yourself a few
times<00:01:45.029> but<00:01:45.539> you'll<00:01:45.719> learn<00:01:46.340> but<00:01:47.340> anyways<00:01:47.700> it

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
times but you'll learn but anyways it

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.269 
times but you'll learn but anyways it
goes<00:01:48.419> on<00:01:48.630> fairly<00:01:49.229> easily<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:50.069> like<00:01:50.249> a

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:50.279 
goes on fairly easily it's like a

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:52.669 
goes on fairly easily it's like a
triangle<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:51.149> pins<00:01:51.509> then<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.409> kind<00:01:52.619> of

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
triangle of pins then you just kind of

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.069 
triangle of pins then you just kind of
gently<00:01:52.919> rock<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.669> and<00:01:53.909> click<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.840> on

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
gently rock it on and click it's on

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.309 
gently rock it on and click it's on
there<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:56.700> think<00:01:56.939> it's<00:01:57.209> a<00:01:57.359> mic<00:01:58.049> that's

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
there and I think it's a mic that's

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.249 
there and I think it's a mic that's
simple<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.739> use<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.479> I've<00:02:00.479> used<00:02:00.749> it<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:00.959> a<00:02:00.989> few

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
simple to use and I've used it on a few

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.399 
simple to use and I've used it on a few
jobs<00:02:01.529> and<00:02:01.919> I<00:02:02.909> will<00:02:03.119> provide<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.809> link<00:02:04.139> to

regular lab use goes I love the sound of
this<00:02:36.780> mic<00:02:37.049> it's<00:02:37.650> got<00:02:37.859> a<00:02:37.890> nice<00:02:38.099> full<00:02:38.519> frequency

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
this mic it's got a nice full frequency

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.589 
this mic it's got a nice full frequency
response<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.470> base<00:02:41.189> is<00:02:41.459> covered<00:02:41.700> but<00:02:42.569> the

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
response the base is covered but the

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.380 
response the base is covered but the
high<00:02:42.900> end<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.379> smooth<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.310> not<00:02:44.670> harsh<00:02:45.000> like

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
high end is smooth and not harsh like

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.140 
high end is smooth and not harsh like
some<00:02:45.810> labs<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.530> get<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.459> think<00:02:47.519> it's<00:02:48.030> an

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
some labs can get and I think it's an

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.500 
some labs can get and I think it's an
overall<00:02:48.389> well<00:02:48.720> balanced<00:02:49.170> mic<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:50.700> am<00:02:51.209> glad

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
overall well balanced mic and I am glad

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.990 
overall well balanced mic and I am glad
to<00:02:51.659> have<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:51.989> in<00:02:52.290> my<00:02:52.560> kit<00:02:52.829> now<00:02:53.040> one<00:02:53.730> thing<00:02:53.909> I'm

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
to have it in my kit now one thing I'm

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.750 
to have it in my kit now one thing I'm
going<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.180> do<00:02:54.389> in<00:02:54.599> my<00:02:54.629> test<00:02:55.079> is<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.470> see<00:02:55.680> if<00:02:55.760> the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
going to do in my test is to see if the

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.360 
going to do in my test is to see if the
sound<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.569> pin<00:02:57.780> mic<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.290> different<00:02:59.220> from

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
sound of the pin mic is different from

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.940 
sound of the pin mic is different from
the<00:02:59.549> road<00:02:59.730> lab<00:03:00.000> they<00:03:00.810> use<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.200> same<00:03:01.379> capsule

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
the road lab they use the same capsule

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.569 
the road lab they use the same capsule
so<00:03:02.579> let's<00:03:03.420> find<00:03:03.629> out<00:03:03.980> okay<00:03:04.980> I've<00:03:05.099> got<00:03:05.280> both

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
so let's find out okay I've got both

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.330 
so let's find out okay I've got both
microphones<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.599> now<00:03:07.170> as<00:03:07.439> you<00:03:07.590> can<00:03:07.739> tell<00:03:08.040> they

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
microphones on now as you can tell they

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.899 
microphones on now as you can tell they
are<00:03:08.689> fairly<00:03:09.689> close<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.290> one<00:03:10.470> another<00:03:10.909> so

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
are fairly close to one another so

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.449 
are fairly close to one another so
hopefully<00:03:12.720> we'll<00:03:13.079> be<00:03:13.319> able<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.620> tell<00:03:14.010> any

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
hopefully we'll be able to tell any

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.720 
hopefully we'll be able to tell any
difference<00:03:14.700> I've<00:03:15.329> got<00:03:16.319> both<00:03:16.590> mics<00:03:16.980> hardwired

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
difference I've got both mics hardwired

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.229 
difference I've got both mics hardwired
into<00:03:18.359> my<00:03:18.480> ex1<00:03:19.230> both<00:03:20.040> set<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.609> exact<00:03:21.000> same

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
into my ex1 both set to the exact same

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.750 
into my ex1 both set to the exact same
settings<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.530> everything<00:03:23.370> should<00:03:23.730> be

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
settings so everything should be

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
settings so everything should be
hunky-dory

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
hunky-dory

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.900 
hunky-dory
now<00:03:25.169> to<00:03:25.230> test<00:03:25.530> out<00:03:25.709> these<00:03:25.859> mics<00:03:26.190> against<00:03:26.669> one

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
now to test out these mics against one

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.599 
now to test out these mics against one
another<00:03:27.799> starting<00:03:28.799> out<00:03:28.949> with<00:03:29.159> the<00:03:29.430> røde

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
another starting out with the røde

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.569 
another starting out with the røde
lavalier<00:03:29.639> I<00:03:30.599> tested<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.620> mic<00:03:31.949> out<00:03:32.159> in<00:03:32.459> a

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
lavalier I tested this mic out in a

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.479 
lavalier I tested this mic out in a
previous<00:03:33.030> lab<00:03:33.720> shootout<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:35.340> came

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
previous lab shootout and it came

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.039 
previous lab shootout and it came
through<00:03:35.699> with<00:03:35.819> flying<00:03:35.849> colors<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.750> really

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
through with flying colors I really

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.830 
through with flying colors I really
liked<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.500> sound<00:03:37.769> of<00:03:37.949> the<00:03:38.010> road<00:03:38.159> level<00:03:38.370> ear<00:03:38.639> as

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
liked the sound of the road level ear as

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.720 
liked the sound of the road level ear as
well<00:03:39.840> as<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.560> other<00:03:40.680> mic<00:03:40.919> I'm<00:03:41.099> wearing<00:03:41.459> the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
well as the other mic I'm wearing the

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.960 
well as the other mic I'm wearing the
road<00:03:41.909> pin<00:03:42.299> mic<00:03:42.540> which<00:03:43.409> also<00:03:43.769> sounds<00:03:44.639> great

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
road pin mic which also sounds great

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.129 
road pin mic which also sounds great
they<00:03:45.780> have<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.139> same<00:03:46.319> capsule<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:48.139> I'm

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
they have the same capsule and I'm

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.390 
they have the same capsule and I'm
thinking<00:03:49.650> they're<00:03:49.769> gonna<00:03:49.859> sound<00:03:50.159> pretty

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
thinking they're gonna sound pretty

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.930 
thinking they're gonna sound pretty
close<00:03:51.030> but<00:03:51.389> I'm<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.629> little<00:03:51.930> curious<00:03:52.199> as<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.940> the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
close but I'm a little curious as to the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.960 
close but I'm a little curious as to the
placement<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.750> mics<00:03:55.019> as<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:56.250> pin<00:03:56.459> mic<00:03:56.669> is

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
placement of the mics as the pin mic is

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.509 
placement of the mics as the pin mic is
pointing<00:03:57.599> out<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.379> lav<00:03:58.620> mic<00:03:58.919> is<00:03:59.159> pointing

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
pointing out and the lav mic is pointing

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.449 
pointing out and the lav mic is pointing
up<00:03:59.699> so<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:01.290> might<00:04:01.500> give<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.739> slight<00:04:02.220> advantage

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
up so that might give a slight advantage

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.819 
up so that might give a slight advantage
to<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.180> lab<00:04:03.389> as<00:04:03.599> far<00:04:03.810> as<00:04:03.900> sound<00:04:04.169> quality<00:04:04.620> and

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
to the lab as far as sound quality and

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.789 
to the lab as far as sound quality and
how<00:04:05.609> much<00:04:05.790> room<00:04:06.090> you're<00:04:06.359> capturing<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.769> a

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
how much room you're capturing this is a

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.240 
how much room you're capturing this is a
pretty<00:04:08.129> quiet<00:04:08.400> treated<00:04:09.090> room<00:04:09.680> but<00:04:10.680> we'll<00:04:10.919> see

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
pretty quiet treated room but we'll see

somebody was asking about putting a

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.029 
somebody was asking about putting a
lavell<00:04:39.759> ear<00:04:39.910> on<00:04:40.300> a<00:04:40.330> street<00:04:40.720> musician<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:41.500> then

letting<00:04:42.310> them<00:04:42.550> do<00:04:42.819> their<00:04:43.000> thing<00:04:43.349> so<00:04:44.349> I<00:04:44.380> just

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
letting them do their thing so I just

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.059

wanted<00:04:45.009> to<00:04:45.069> kind<00:04:45.280> of<00:04:45.490> test<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.180> out<00:04:46.330> and

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
wanted to kind of test that out and

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.439 
wanted to kind of test that out and
lavell<00:04:48.069> airs<00:04:48.220> still<00:04:48.550> in<00:04:48.729> the<00:04:48.819> normal<00:04:49.090> level

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
lavell airs still in the normal level

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.420 
lavell airs still in the normal level
air<00:04:49.569> place<00:04:49.840> maybe<00:04:50.110> I'll<00:04:50.319> change<00:04:50.590> position

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
air place maybe I'll change position

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.219 
air place maybe I'll change position
later<00:04:52.289> but<00:04:53.699> here's<00:04:54.699> what<00:04:55.419> a<00:04:55.449> guitar<00:04:55.780> sounds

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
later but here's what a guitar sounds

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.260 
later but here's what a guitar sounds
like<00:04:56.410> now<00:04:56.620> of<00:04:57.430> course<00:04:57.639> the<00:04:57.849> guitar<00:04:58.150> is

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
like now of course the guitar is

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.490 
like now of course the guitar is
projecting<00:04:58.840> in<00:04:59.620> front<00:05:00.370> of<00:05:00.639> the<00:05:01.270> microphone<00:05:01.960> so

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
projecting in front of the microphone so

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.760 
projecting in front of the microphone so
it's<00:05:03.280> not<00:05:03.460> going<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:03.789> be<00:05:03.880> optimal<00:05:04.419> but<00:05:04.770> anyways

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
it's not going to be optimal but anyways

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:17.999 
it's not going to be optimal but anyways
here's<00:05:06.130> a<00:05:06.190> little<00:05:06.430> test<00:05:16.110> sometimes<00:05:17.110> you've

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
here's a little test sometimes you've

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:25.700 
here's a little test sometimes you've
got<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.310> item<00:05:19.120> mic<00:05:20.789> hide<00:05:21.789> it<00:05:22.120> in<00:05:22.690> plain<00:05:23.349> sight

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
got to item mic hide it in plain sight

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.649 
got to item mic hide it in plain sight
level<00:05:26.710> ears<00:05:27.039> sometimes<00:05:27.789> they<00:05:28.030> just<00:05:28.330> ain't

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:28.659 
level ears sometimes they just ain't

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:55.250 
level ears sometimes they just ain't
right<00:05:30.180> that's<00:05:31.180> when<00:05:31.509> you<00:05:32.020> need<00:05:32.349> a<00:05:32.409> pin<00:05:32.979> mic

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.410 

now<00:05:56.260> I've<00:05:56.380> created<00:05:56.560> a<00:05:56.860> rating<00:05:57.220> system<00:05:57.490> based

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
now I've created a rating system based

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.190 
now I've created a rating system based
on<00:05:58.690> terms<00:05:59.200> my<00:05:59.740> niece<00:06:00.310> jalisa<00:06:00.940> uses<00:06:01.840> so<00:06:02.170> I

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
on terms my niece jalisa uses so I

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.740 
on terms my niece jalisa uses so I
called<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.650> Jojo<00:06:03.100> scale<00:06:03.670> and<00:06:04.000> this

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
called the Jojo scale and this

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.730 
called the Jojo scale and this
microphone<00:06:05.050> is<00:06:06.360> 4.5<00:06:07.360> on<00:06:07.750> the<00:06:07.990> Jojo<00:06:08.350> scale

the test that I just did I honestly

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.700 
the test that I just did I honestly
can't<00:06:49.090> tell<00:06:49.180> the<00:06:49.570> difference<00:06:49.930> between<00:06:50.140> the

can't tell the difference between the
two<00:06:50.890> mics<00:06:51.130> I<00:06:51.400> even<00:06:51.820> had<00:06:52.000> to<00:06:52.120> check<00:06:52.330> to<00:06:52.390> make

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
two mics I even had to check to make

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.420 
two mics I even had to check to make
sure<00:06:52.660> that<00:06:52.990> it<00:06:53.140> didn't<00:06:53.350> record<00:06:53.710> the<00:06:53.920> same<00:06:54.160> mic

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
sure that it didn't record the same mic

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.830 
sure that it didn't record the same mic
twice<00:06:54.990> as<00:06:55.990> some<00:06:56.290> sort<00:06:56.440> of<00:06:56.560> mistake<00:06:56.980> but<00:06:57.840> really

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
twice as some sort of mistake but really

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.570 
twice as some sort of mistake but really
I<00:06:58.990> cannot<00:06:59.470> tell<00:06:59.740> the<00:06:59.890> difference<00:06:59.920> I<00:07:00.310> thought

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
I cannot tell the difference I thought

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.120 
I cannot tell the difference I thought
the<00:07:01.180> pin<00:07:01.480> mic<00:07:01.690> pointing<00:07:02.140> out<00:07:02.290> might<00:07:02.710> make<00:07:03.100> a

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130 
the pin mic pointing out might make a

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.460 
the pin mic pointing out might make a
