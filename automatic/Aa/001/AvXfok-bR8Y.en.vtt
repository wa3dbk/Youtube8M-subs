photography in this video we're gonna
talk<00:00:09.559> about<00:00:09.620> how<00:00:10.070> to<00:00:10.130> create<00:00:11.059> better<00:00:11.900> large

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
talk about how to create better large

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.580 
talk about how to create better large
format<00:00:12.920> negatives<00:00:13.370> and<00:00:13.580> old<00:00:13.730> answer<00:00:14.180> himself

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
format negatives and old answer himself

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.200 
format negatives and old answer himself
let's<00:00:15.590> find<00:00:15.890> out<00:00:16.070> how<00:00:18.130> high<00:00:19.130> this<00:00:19.580> is<00:00:19.640> Ansel

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
let's find out how high this is Ansel

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.870 
let's find out how high this is Ansel
Adams<00:00:20.599> there's<00:00:21.529> no<00:00:21.710> way<00:00:21.919> this<00:00:22.160> Joker<00:00:22.669> can

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
Adams there's no way this Joker can

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.220 
Adams there's no way this Joker can
develop<00:00:23.300> film<00:00:23.570> better<00:00:23.810> than<00:00:24.050> I<00:00:24.169> can

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.960 

so<00:00:30.230> I<00:00:30.289> found<00:00:30.529> myself<00:00:30.710> way<00:00:31.070> behind<00:00:31.430> it<00:00:31.670> so<00:00:31.820> this

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
so I found myself way behind it so this

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.280 
so I found myself way behind it so this
weekend<00:00:32.329> I<00:00:32.419> spent<00:00:32.480> a<00:00:32.809> lot<00:00:32.960> of<00:00:32.989> time<00:00:33.260> just

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
weekend I spent a lot of time just

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.270 
weekend I spent a lot of time just
developing<00:00:34.160> some<00:00:34.370> film<00:00:34.670> and<00:00:35.170> even<00:00:36.280> though

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
developing some film and even though

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.160 
developing some film and even though
this<00:00:37.489> video<00:00:37.820> is<00:00:38.000> titled<00:00:38.210> creating<00:00:38.900> a<00:00:39.020> negative

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
this video is titled creating a negative

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.439 
this video is titled creating a negative
better<00:00:39.680> than<00:00:39.890> old<00:00:40.040> Ansel<00:00:40.520> cam

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
better than old Ansel cam

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.170 
better than old Ansel cam
I'm<00:00:41.899> here<00:00:42.170> to<00:00:42.260> tell<00:00:42.470> you<00:00:42.649> that<00:00:43.180> unfortunately

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
I'm here to tell you that unfortunately

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.060 
I'm here to tell you that unfortunately
I<00:00:44.420> can't<00:00:44.750> create<00:00:45.019> a<00:00:45.199> negative<00:00:45.440> better<00:00:45.860> than

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
I can't create a negative better than

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.170 
I can't create a negative better than
old<00:00:46.250> Ansel<00:00:46.670> I<00:00:46.820> told<00:00:47.600> you<00:00:47.960> good<00:00:48.290> and<00:00:48.530> do<00:00:48.650> it<00:00:49.180> and

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
old Ansel I told you good and do it and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.720 
old Ansel I told you good and do it and
it's<00:00:50.510> beyond<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.019> fact<00:00:51.260> that<00:00:51.489> there's<00:00:52.489> an

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
it's beyond the fact that there's an

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.970 
it's beyond the fact that there's an
obvious<00:00:52.989> skill<00:00:53.989> difference<00:00:54.500> between<00:00:54.949> a

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
obvious skill difference between a

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.240 
obvious skill difference between a
master<00:00:55.309> like<00:00:55.670> him<00:00:55.970> and<00:00:56.420> a<00:00:56.900> guy<00:00:57.050> like<00:00:57.079> me<00:00:57.320> but

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
master like him and a guy like me but

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.069 
master like him and a guy like me but
the<00:00:58.430> fact<00:00:58.699> is<00:00:58.940> there<00:00:59.239> are<00:00:59.269> foundational

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
the fact is there are foundational

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.770 
the fact is there are foundational
elements<00:01:00.559> to<00:01:00.739> how<00:01:00.920> I<00:01:01.280> do<00:01:01.699> large<00:01:02.239> format

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
elements to how I do large format

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.660 
elements to how I do large format
photography<00:01:02.899> that<00:01:03.739> don't<00:01:04.129> allow<00:01:04.369> me<00:01:04.580> to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
photography that don't allow me to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.840 
photography that don't allow me to
practice<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.360> same<00:01:05.600> kind<00:01:05.960> of<00:01:06.170> process<00:01:06.850> and

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
practice the same kind of process and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.480 
practice the same kind of process and
elements<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:08.539> he<00:01:08.720> defined<00:01:09.140> really<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:10.340> he

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
elements that he defined really that he

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.300 
elements that he defined really that he
perfected<00:01:11.119> and<00:01:11.350> one<00:01:12.350> of<00:01:12.470> those<00:01:12.560> foundational

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
perfected and one of those foundational

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.810 
perfected and one of those foundational
elements<00:01:13.880> is<00:01:14.119> this<00:01:14.479> so<00:01:15.440> our<00:01:15.890> old<00:01:16.039> friend<00:01:16.369> Ansel

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
elements is this so our old friend Ansel

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.330 
elements is this so our old friend Ansel
he<00:01:17.570> would<00:01:17.750> spend<00:01:18.020> time<00:01:18.289> in<00:01:18.440> the<00:01:18.530> darkroom<00:01:18.830> and

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
he would spend time in the darkroom and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.669 
he would spend time in the darkroom and
he<00:01:19.580> would<00:01:19.729> develop<00:01:20.000> film<00:01:20.450> one<00:01:21.200> sheet<00:01:21.470> at<00:01:21.619> a

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
he would develop film one sheet at a

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:24.730 
he would develop film one sheet at a
time<00:01:21.710> in<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.580> developer<00:01:23.149> and<00:01:23.600> by<00:01:24.320> doing<00:01:24.560> that

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
time in the developer and by doing that

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.630 
time in the developer and by doing that
he<00:01:25.190> could<00:01:25.640> vary<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.780> development<00:01:27.380> time<00:01:27.640> that

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
he could vary the development time that

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.169 
he could vary the development time that
the<00:01:29.679> the<00:01:30.679> mixture<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.310> recipe<00:01:31.759> that<00:01:31.970> he<00:01:32.030> was

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
the the mixture the recipe that he was

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.240 
the the mixture the recipe that he was
using<00:01:32.420> for<00:01:32.630> development<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:33.740> all<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:34.130> the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
using for development and all of the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.390 
using for development and all of the
elements<00:01:34.670> around<00:01:35.409> allowing<00:01:36.409> this<00:01:36.890> negative

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
elements around allowing this negative

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.700 
elements around allowing this negative
to<00:01:37.850> develop<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:38.659> way<00:01:38.810> that<00:01:39.049> he<00:01:39.170> wanted<00:01:39.530> to

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
to develop the way that he wanted to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.950 
to develop the way that he wanted to
what<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:39.950> contrast<00:01:40.520> he<00:01:40.700> wanted<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.240> at<00:01:41.840> the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
what the contrast he wanted to at the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.420 
what the contrast he wanted to at the
highs<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.650> at<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.310> shadows<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:45.350> it's<00:01:45.950> a

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
highs and at the shadows and so it's a

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.149 
highs and at the shadows and so it's a
mere<00:01:47.060> fact<00:01:47.360> that<00:01:47.720> quite<00:01:48.320> frankly<00:01:48.619> I<00:01:48.890> don't

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
mere fact that quite frankly I don't

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.280 
mere fact that quite frankly I don't
have<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.430> time<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.970> develop<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.990> way<00:01:51.140> that

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
have the time to develop the way that

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.050 
have the time to develop the way that
Ansel<00:01:51.680> did<00:01:51.890> I<00:01:52.040> don't<00:01:52.220> have<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.460> time<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.700> spend

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
Ansel did I don't have the time to spend

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.090 
Ansel did I don't have the time to spend
in<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.270> dark<00:01:53.509> room<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:53.960> spend<00:01:54.200> upwards<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.860> what

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
in a dark room and spend upwards of what

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.450 
in a dark room and spend upwards of what
could<00:01:55.670> be<00:01:55.850> half<00:01:56.210> an<00:01:56.360> hour<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.899> an<00:01:56.930> hour<00:01:57.259> on<00:01:57.649> each

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
could be half an hour to an hour on each

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.330 
could be half an hour to an hour on each
sheet<00:01:58.820> of<00:01:59.030> film<00:01:59.240> I<00:02:00.079> go<00:02:00.619> out<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.070> shoot

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
sheet of film I go out and I shoot

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.899 
sheet of film I go out and I shoot
probably<00:02:01.939> eight<00:02:02.719> to<00:02:03.020> ten<00:02:03.259> sheets<00:02:03.799> when<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:04.670> go

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
probably eight to ten sheets when I go

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.039 
probably eight to ten sheets when I go
out<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.329> shoot<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:06.250> when<00:02:07.250> I<00:02:07.280> come<00:02:07.610> home<00:02:08.049> I'm

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
out on a shoot and when I come home I'm

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.220 
out on a shoot and when I come home I'm
developing<00:02:09.700> using<00:02:10.700> this<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.239> this<00:02:11.959> is<00:02:12.200> a

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
developing using this and this is a

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.690 
developing using this and this is a
relatively<00:02:12.860> low-level<00:02:13.820> joke<00:02:15.280> what<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.519> hell

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
relatively low-level joke what the hell

Ansel's ability to develop film and to

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.670 
Ansel's ability to develop film and to
get<00:03:15.939> the<00:03:16.090> negative<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.689> really<00:03:17.109> reflected

get the negative that really reflected

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.289 
get the negative that really reflected
the<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:18.159> picture<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.639> he<00:03:18.819> saw<00:03:19.030> in<00:03:19.209> his

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
the the picture that he saw in his

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.020 
the the picture that he saw in his
mind's<00:03:19.629> eye<00:03:19.870> I've<00:03:20.560> been<00:03:20.769> able<00:03:20.889> to<00:03:21.040> develop<00:03:21.250> a

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
mind's eye I've been able to develop a

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.170 
mind's eye I've been able to develop a
set<00:03:22.419> of<00:03:22.569> processes<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.739> an<00:03:23.859> approach<00:03:24.189> that

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
set of processes and an approach that

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.879 
set of processes and an approach that
helps<00:03:25.299> me<00:03:25.599> to<00:03:25.629> get<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.139> negative<00:03:26.590> and

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
helps me to get the negative and

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.399 
helps me to get the negative and
ultimately<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.969> print<00:03:28.269> that<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:29.019> reflects

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
ultimately the print that that reflects

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.039 
ultimately the print that that reflects
the<00:03:29.620> picture<00:03:29.980> that's<00:03:30.189> in<00:03:30.340> my<00:03:30.519> mind's<00:03:31.030> eye<00:03:31.329> and

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
the picture that's in my mind's eye and

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.569 
the picture that's in my mind's eye and
so<00:03:32.409> that's<00:03:32.739> what<00:03:32.859> I'm<00:03:32.949> gonna<00:03:33.040> talk<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.549> a
