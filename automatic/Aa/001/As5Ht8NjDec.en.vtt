00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.879
 in the pichincha clinic of marbella with 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.460
 franÃ§ois my limit toledo one of the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.340
 international experts in the field of 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.830
 the medical application of fasting and inside 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.350
 of the congress that on the occasion of the 40 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.810
 years of opening of the clinic in 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.970
 marbella this is developing as 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.720
 we were able to define a little technically what 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.830
 the fast also consists 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.750
 fasting is already a very simple thing is 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.440
 the capacity of animals or beings 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.120
 humans to live off their own reserves 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.030
 essentially fat at the time in 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.430
 where there is no food the earth from 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.680
 millions of years that there has 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.360
 always an alternation of periods in 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.250
 where there is food from farms where there is no 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.470
 today we have food all the time 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.870
 but that is not normal is because we have 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.909
 technologies to preserve food in 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.159
 other times and still today the 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.559
 animals have to have strategies 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.500
 to live we period without food the 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.900
 fat-forming strategy although that 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.810
 fat that is going to be used in these 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:10.070
 moments and for the same occasion the 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.259
 body is regenerated is rebuilt and 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.270
 it rests in a certain way it regenerates in 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.430
 the fasting periods that were in others 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.610
 times for lack of food and that today 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.729
 we have to add voluntarily 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.390
 to diminish the plethoric reserves 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.460
 that we accumulate all for never doing 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.900
 a break in the food 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.930
 lose weight as well says is not a 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.650
 physics requirement but you have to 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.080
 to be complemented with another series of 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.640
 processes not exactly losing weight 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.320
 especially in the abdomen 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.790
 corrects many disorders 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.490
 metabolic as for example in the 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.909
 type 2 diabetes hypertension but 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:57.200
 also la la la excess acid 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:00.409
 uric and especially fasting has 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.670
 also this possibility of decreasing the 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.080
 inflammation through other metabolic steps 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.100
 decreases inflammation decreases by 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.100
 example the pains of 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.550
 joints decrease the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.730
 migraines the allergies the fast has a 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.010
 multidimensional therapeutic effect that 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.870
 we can use it today very well because 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.050
 many times they are suffering from these 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.350
 pathologies doctor buzzi who makes 60 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.650
 years presented the same this hint of 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.610
 techniques and that have been reinforced 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.000
 perfecting a lot in this in 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.590
 these years but that has varied 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.370
 technically 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.080
 well we have what we call today the 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.140
 multidisciplinary therapy we have 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.019
 medical professionals psychologists 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.810
 nutritionists masseurs 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.400
 physiotherapists let's say is soon the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.739
 intervention profession of the thing and 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.019
 also the didactic aspect we teach 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.360
 a lot to people who learn what happens 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.670
 in your own body and what you can 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.680
 do to live better in this style of 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.930
 life today where there are so many 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.819
 abundance nor physical exercise in 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.670
 where there is a lot of stress as we say 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.640
 manage stress like eating less and 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.870
 well in another way and how to introduce 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.060
 how can you exercise a little 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.130
 physical in your life so we give them 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.370
 also everything that is the program for 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.769
 be able to know how your life works 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.379
 after the fast when they have improved 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.690
 a technical question in that aspect the 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.450
 who wants to lose weight in this system 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.950
 you can become obsessed losing weight that's 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.480
 because it does not get it or it costs more 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.620
 work that means a help 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.360
 psychological 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.860
 psychological and but no no does not have to 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.170
 think that fasting is difficult a lot 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.239
 people intuitively say it 's horrible 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.030
 is going to be hungry we are going to tired 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.480
 nervous is exactly the opposite 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.110
 when people accept fasting you pass 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.360
 12 days 3 difficult days and then comes 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.280
 a kind of tranquility a new 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.109
 different energy less nervous a 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.329
 quiet energy very good people 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.480
 can do physical exercise walks 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.430
 a lot are very happy and kind of 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.250
 serenity contrary to what the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.680
 people is an experience of the beautiful the 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.739
 They are very well and they are very happy 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:24.510
 of doing it every year for example then 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.250
 Of course this is achieved with a team of 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.310
 workers that already has a lot 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.510
 experience with that they know how 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.699
 psychologically welcome the people 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.849
 help them in difficult times and 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.249
 when it's okay to leave them 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.800
 that they themselves make their programs 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:44.330
 do your also have your time to 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:47.689
 reflection our our ability to 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.759
 know how to manage a fast a 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.619
 partner and one last question with a 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.589
 once we do the fasting therapy we do not 

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:55.879
 will have to follow a line of 

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:57.319
 training levels are depends on 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.819
 the discipline of the people and what 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.580
 they have when you have for example a 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:05.869
 illness like doctor booking insurance 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.610
 of his polyarthritis and then fasting for 

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:09.649
 other reasons because he realized that 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.599
 it was good for him that it was a moment of 

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:13.909
 reflection in your life because finally 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.750
 I was also overweight we have 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:19.810
 a lot of problems one can be 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.510
 with a fast you may have had your 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.940
 solution but there will be other things that 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.700
 they do that like nature and one each 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.740
 year the winter every year us 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.210
 we have a need to pause 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.650
 and the fasting is would be this annual break 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.230
 because that strip or element of graf and 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.230
 so that the issue of
