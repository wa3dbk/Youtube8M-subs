00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.530 

today<00:00:06.220> I'm<00:00:06.340> going<00:00:06.460> to<00:00:06.550> talk<00:00:06.760> about<00:00:06.790> facial

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
today I'm going to talk about facial

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.280 
today I'm going to talk about facial
motor<00:00:07.990> lesions<00:00:09.840> specifically<00:00:10.840> upper<00:00:11.170> and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
motor lesions specifically upper and

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.560 
motor lesions specifically upper and
lower<00:00:11.469> motor<00:00:11.799> lesions<00:00:12.369> of<00:00:12.610> the<00:00:12.670> our<00:00:13.150> facial

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
lower motor lesions of the our facial

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.930 
lower motor lesions of the our facial
nucleus<00:00:13.719> so<00:00:14.619> first<00:00:14.860> of<00:00:14.980> all<00:00:15.129> I<00:00:15.160> think<00:00:15.760> I<00:00:15.789> should

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
nucleus so first of all I think I should

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.269 
nucleus so first of all I think I should
define<00:00:16.059> lesion<00:00:16.779> it's<00:00:17.440> term<00:00:17.770> it<00:00:17.920> gets<00:00:18.100> on

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
define lesion it's term it gets on

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.640 
define lesion it's term it gets on
thrown<00:00:18.609> around<00:00:18.760> about<00:00:19.150> but<00:00:19.540> it<00:00:19.660> it's<00:00:20.410> a<00:00:20.500> very

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
thrown around about but it it's a very

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.380 
thrown around about but it it's a very
general<00:00:21.040> term<00:00:21.070> which<00:00:21.430> just<00:00:21.640> means<00:00:21.820> that<00:00:22.120> it

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
general term which just means that it

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.670 
general term which just means that it
which<00:00:22.630> just<00:00:22.870> means<00:00:23.020> a<00:00:23.110> tissue<00:00:23.380> which<00:00:23.650> is

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
which just means a tissue which is

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.830 
which just means a tissue which is
suffered<00:00:24.220> damage<00:00:24.940> through<00:00:25.270> injury<00:00:25.690> or

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
suffered damage through injury or

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.710 
suffered damage through injury or
disease<00:00:29.280> so<00:00:30.280> the<00:00:30.430> examples<00:00:30.970> could<00:00:31.060> be<00:00:31.180> a<00:00:31.210> tumor

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
disease so the examples could be a tumor

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.740 
disease so the examples could be a tumor
or<00:00:31.960> actual<00:00:32.920> a<00:00:33.750> severing<00:00:34.750> of<00:00:34.840> a<00:00:34.960> nerve<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.540> first

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
or actual a severing of a nerve so first

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.780 
or actual a severing of a nerve so first
off<00:00:38.020> let's<00:00:38.410> start<00:00:38.500> off<00:00:38.800> with<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.040> anatomy<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
off let's start off with the anatomy the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.319 
off let's start off with the anatomy the
anatomy<00:00:43.780> of<00:00:43.810> this<00:00:44.590> is<00:00:44.800> really<00:00:45.149> important<00:00:46.149> and

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
anatomy of this is really important and

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.380 
anatomy of this is really important and
is<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.630> little<00:00:46.840> bit<00:00:46.930> difficult<00:00:47.560> it's<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:48.390> located

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
is a little bit difficult it's a located

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.200 
is a little bit difficult it's a located
in<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.660> lower<00:00:50.280> ones<00:00:51.280> so<00:00:51.640> this<00:00:51.730> is<00:00:51.850> actually

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
in the lower ones so this is actually

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:00.000 
in the lower ones so this is actually
the<00:00:52.329> very<00:00:53.250> chordal<00:00:54.250> end<00:00:54.430> of<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.730> pons<00:00:58.950> how<00:00:59.950> do

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
the very chordal end of the pons how do

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.520 
the very chordal end of the pons how do
I<00:01:00.070> start<00:01:00.399> off<00:01:00.690> when<00:01:01.690> drawing<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.020> ponds<00:01:02.379> by

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
I start off when drawing the ponds by

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.580 
I start off when drawing the ponds by
start<00:01:02.800> off<00:01:02.890> with<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.290> fourth

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
start off with the with the fourth

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.709 
start off with the with the fourth
ventricle<00:01:05.979> so<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.640> fourth<00:01:06.820> ventricle<00:01:07.030> is

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
ventricle so the fourth ventricle is

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:15.899 
ventricle so the fourth ventricle is
located<00:01:08.200> within<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.499> pons<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:15.340> in<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.639> palms

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
located within the pons now in the palms

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.989 
located within the pons now in the palms
here<00:01:17.130> I'd<00:01:18.130> refer<00:01:18.429> on<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.609> fourth<00:01:18.819> ventricle

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:18.999 
here I'd refer on the fourth ventricle

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:27.679 
here I'd refer on the fourth ventricle
here<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.840> also<00:01:23.049> off<00:01:23.529> to<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.100> side<00:01:24.369> here<00:01:25.679> sorry

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
here and also off to the side here sorry

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.849 
here and also off to the side here sorry
off<00:01:28.689> to<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:28.929> side<00:01:29.139> here<00:01:29.170> I<00:01:29.380> put<00:01:29.560> in<00:01:29.590> the

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
off to the side here I put in the

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.870 
off to the side here I put in the
cerebellar<00:01:30.749> peduncles<00:01:31.749> and<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:33.340> pons<00:01:33.579> is

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
cerebellar peduncles and the pons is

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.669 
cerebellar peduncles and the pons is
down<00:01:34.119> there<00:01:34.389> so<00:01:34.689> I'm<00:01:34.929> talking<00:01:35.170> about<00:01:35.409> getting

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
down there so I'm talking about getting

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.410 
down there so I'm talking about getting
talk<00:01:35.859> about<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:36.130> tegmental<00:01:36.759> area<00:01:36.909> which<00:01:37.270> is

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
talk about the tegmental area which is

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.109 
talk about the tegmental area which is
the<00:01:37.569> the<00:01:38.259> area<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.770> in<00:01:39.369> between<00:01:39.549> which<00:01:39.939> hasn't

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
the the area and in between which hasn't

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.370 
the the area and in between which hasn't
got<00:01:40.329> anything<00:01:40.539> in<00:01:40.749> it<00:01:40.840> here<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.990> area<00:01:44.229> is

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
got anything in it here this area is

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.940 
got anything in it here this area is
split<00:01:44.619> up<00:01:44.709> into<00:01:45.130> two<00:01:45.759> sections<00:01:46.090> by<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:47.499> sulcus

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
split up into two sections by the sulcus

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.789 
split up into two sections by the sulcus
limit<00:01:48.369> hands<00:01:48.579> which<00:01:49.509> pretty<00:01:49.810> much<00:01:49.899> just<00:01:50.169> means

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
limit hands which pretty much just means

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.969 
limit hands which pretty much just means
the<00:01:51.069> limiting<00:01:51.969> sulcus<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:53.259> separates<00:01:53.829> the

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
the limiting sulcus and it separates the

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.940 
the limiting sulcus and it separates the
ALR<00:01:54.520> play<00:01:54.759> from<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.450> basal<00:01:55.899> plate<00:01:56.139> and<00:01:56.770> if<00:01:56.859> you

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
ALR play from the basal plate and if you

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.099 
ALR play from the basal plate and if you
don't<00:01:57.130> know<00:01:57.279> what<00:01:57.849> that<00:01:57.880> means<00:01:58.389> go<00:01:58.779> check<00:01:58.990> it

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
don't know what that means go check it

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:01.780 
don't know what that means go check it
out<00:01:59.169> on<00:01:59.349> Wikipedia

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
out on Wikipedia

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.000 
out on Wikipedia
but<00:02:02.790> basically<00:02:03.030> our<00:02:03.780> plates<00:02:04.320> give<00:02:04.770> rise<00:02:04.980> to

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
but basically our plates give rise to

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.770 
but basically our plates give rise to
the<00:02:05.550> sensory<00:02:06.000> nuclei<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.290> basal<00:02:07.710> plates

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
the sensory nuclei and the basal plates

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.410 
the sensory nuclei and the basal plates
give<00:02:09.780> rise<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.410> motor<00:02:10.619> nuclei<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
give rise to the motor nuclei so the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.980 
give rise to the motor nuclei so the
facial<00:02:13.260> motor<00:02:13.500> nucleus<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:15.480> actually<00:02:15.900> going

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
facial motor nucleus is actually going

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.070 
facial motor nucleus is actually going
to<00:02:16.080> be<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.890> basal<00:02:17.250> plate<00:02:17.490> here<00:02:18.080> separated

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
to be in the basal plate here separated

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.480 
to be in the basal plate here separated
by<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.590> soccers<00:02:20.040> limit<00:02:20.550> ends<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:23.250> drawing

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
by that soccers limit ends so drawing

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.350 
by that soccers limit ends so drawing
the<00:02:23.700> facial<00:02:24.390> nuclei<00:02:25.140> here<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.709> is<00:02:25.860> an

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
the facial nuclei here so this is an

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.290 
the facial nuclei here so this is an
seventh<00:02:27.360> cranial<00:02:27.570> nerve<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.880> sits<00:02:30.090> about

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
seventh cranial nerve and it sits about

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.240 
seventh cranial nerve and it sits about
there<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.959> has<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> strange<00:02:31.620> tract<00:02:32.040> in

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
there and it has a strange tract in

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.790 
there and it has a strange tract in
those<00:02:32.459> white<00:02:32.790> matter<00:02:33.060> tractors<00:02:33.690> loops<00:02:34.560> around

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
those white matter tractors loops around

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.070 
those white matter tractors loops around
the<00:02:34.980> back<00:02:35.190> there<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.790> before<00:02:36.660> exiting<00:02:37.020> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
the back there and before exiting the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.310 
the back there and before exiting the
brainstem<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.890> entering<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.450> innovating

the muscles of the face and this little
bump<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.380> creates<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.860> called<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.190> facial

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
bump it creates is called the facial

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.140 
bump it creates is called the facial
colliculus<00:02:46.370> that's<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.640> bump<00:02:47.880> into

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
colliculus that's just that bump into

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.470

latin<00:02:52.110> literally<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.770> little<00:02:53.130> hill<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.930> you'll

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
latin literally a little hill so you'll

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.500 
latin literally a little hill so you'll
see<00:02:55.680> other<00:02:56.220> colliculi<00:02:56.970> other<00:02:57.300> work

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.949 
see other colliculi other work
especially<00:02:58.020> in<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.170> midbrain<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:03.690> i<00:03:03.750> want<00:03:03.900> to

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
especially in the midbrain so i want to

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.680 
especially in the midbrain so i want to
just<00:03:04.050> talk<00:03:04.170> about<00:03:04.320> this<00:03:04.920> nucleus<00:03:05.400> here<00:03:05.700> so

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
just talk about this nucleus here so

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.840 
just talk about this nucleus here so
i'll<00:03:06.750> draw<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.170> over<00:03:07.470> here<00:03:10.549> first<00:03:11.549> of<00:03:11.700> all

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
i'll draw that over here first of all

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.220 
i'll draw that over here first of all
I'll<00:03:11.970> start<00:03:12.030> with<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.360> brain<00:03:12.690> I'm<00:03:12.930> just<00:03:13.110> going

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
I'll start with a brain I'm just going

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.390 
I'll start with a brain I'm just going
to<00:03:13.290> draw<00:03:13.530> out<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.709> pathway<00:03:16.130> so<00:03:17.130> there's<00:03:17.310> the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
to draw out the pathway so there's the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.180 
to draw out the pathway so there's the
brain<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:19.400> next<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.459> have<00:03:20.489> two<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.720> these

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
brain and next I have two of these

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.509 
brain and next I have two of these
facial<00:03:23.190> nucleosis<00:03:24.030> one<00:03:24.269> on<00:03:24.390> each<00:03:24.480> side<00:03:24.510> and

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.390 

they're<00:03:29.519> split<00:03:29.790> into<00:03:29.940> two<00:03:30.390> sections<00:03:30.660> is<00:03:31.049> a

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
they're split into two sections is a

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.590 
they're split into two sections is a
dorsal<00:03:32.750> section<00:03:33.750> or<00:03:33.900> at<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.100> back<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.640> a

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
dorsal section or at the back and a

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:48.110 
dorsal section or at the back and a
ventral<00:03:37.470> section<00:03:37.829> at<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.010> front

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.720 

so<00:03:49.120> these<00:03:49.270> are<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:49.750> these<00:03:50.590> are<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.770> nuclei<00:03:51.190> so

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
so these are the these are the nuclei so

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.490 
so these are the these are the nuclei so
nuclear<00:03:52.090> being<00:03:52.300> a<00:03:52.360> collection<00:03:52.660> of<00:03:52.840> cell

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
nuclear being a collection of cell

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.570 
nuclear being a collection of cell
bodies<00:03:53.860> that<00:03:54.599> innovate<00:03:55.599> the<00:03:56.110> face<00:03:56.349> and<00:03:56.709> the

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
bodies that innovate the face and the

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.020 
bodies that innovate the face and the
this<00:03:58.090> ventral<00:03:59.160> the<00:04:00.160> ventral<00:04:00.550> part<00:04:00.700> of<00:04:00.880> this

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
this ventral the ventral part of this

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.390 
this ventral the ventral part of this
innovates<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.300> lower<00:04:04.480> face<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.140> the<00:04:05.650> dorsal

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
innovates the lower face and the dorsal

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.300 
innovates the lower face and the dorsal
part<00:04:06.760> innovates<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:08.260> forehead<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.950> sort<00:04:09.280> of

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
part innovates the forehead and sort of

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.570 
part innovates the forehead and sort of
separates<00:04:09.700> around<00:04:10.000> through<00:04:10.569> there<00:04:14.459> so<00:04:15.459> this

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
separates around through there so this

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.699 
separates around through there so this
controls<00:04:15.970> these<00:04:16.720> control<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.169> muscles<00:04:17.590> of

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
controls these control the muscles of

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.449 
controls these control the muscles of
the<00:04:17.769> face<00:04:18.010> this<00:04:18.340> is<00:04:18.400> destroying<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.450> left<00:04:20.260> and

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
the face this is destroying the left and

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.060 
the face this is destroying the left and
right<00:04:21.459> on<00:04:21.700> here<00:04:22.680> now<00:04:23.680> there's<00:04:23.919> innovation

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
right on here now there's innovation

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.690 
right on here now there's innovation
from<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.580> brain<00:04:24.970> down<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:26.310> facial<00:04:27.310> nuclei

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
from the brain down to the facial nuclei

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
from the brain down to the facial nuclei
and<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.770> dorsal<00:04:30.580> nuclei<00:04:30.910> is<00:04:31.180> innovated<00:04:31.690> by

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
and the dorsal nuclei is innovated by

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.750 
and the dorsal nuclei is innovated by
both<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.200> left<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.650> right<00:04:33.070> side<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.639> the

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
both the left and right side of the

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.340 
both the left and right side of the
brain<00:04:36.389> however<00:04:37.389> the<00:04:37.840> ventral<00:04:38.770> nuclei<00:04:39.040> is<00:04:39.370> only

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
brain however the ventral nuclei is only

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.530 
brain however the ventral nuclei is only
being<00:04:41.350> abated<00:04:41.800> by<00:04:41.889> the<00:04:42.000> contralateral<00:04:43.000> so

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
being abated by the contralateral so

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.200 
being abated by the contralateral so
that<00:04:43.660> means<00:04:43.840> from<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.110> opposite<00:04:44.560> side<00:04:45.210> part

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
that means from the opposite side part

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.909 
that means from the opposite side part
of<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.419> brain<00:04:48.720> so<00:04:49.720> if<00:04:49.810> I<00:04:49.900> have<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.050> motor<00:04:50.320> neuron

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
of the brain so if I have a motor neuron

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.320 
of the brain so if I have a motor neuron
lesion<00:04:51.070> through<00:04:51.640> here<00:04:51.880> this<00:04:52.060> would<00:04:52.150> be<00:04:52.240> an

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
lesion through here this would be an

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.279 
lesion through here this would be an
utter<00:04:52.479> mode<00:04:52.720> in<00:04:52.840> your<00:04:53.020> lesion<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:54.940> actually<00:04:55.870> cut

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
utter mode in your lesion I actually cut

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:03.240 
utter mode in your lesion I actually cut
off<00:04:58.080> sensation<00:05:00.419> to<00:05:01.419> the<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:02.950> bottom<00:05:03.190> of

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
off sensation to the to the bottom of

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.610 
off sensation to the to the bottom of
the<00:05:03.340> face<00:05:03.550> but<00:05:03.820> keep<00:05:04.030> it<00:05:04.180> to<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.419> upper<00:05:05.380> part

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
the face but keep it to the upper part

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.750 
the face but keep it to the upper part
of<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.800> face<00:05:05.979> because<00:05:06.430> it<00:05:06.550> can<00:05:06.640> get

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
of the face because it can get

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.310 
of the face because it can get
innovation<00:05:07.300> from<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.479> other<00:05:07.720> half<00:05:08.080> of<00:05:08.260> the

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
innovation from the other half of the

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.710 
innovation from the other half of the
brain<00:05:08.940> so<00:05:09.940> I'll<00:05:10.060> be<00:05:10.150> able<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.360> raise<00:05:10.539> my

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
brain so I'll be able to raise my

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.290 
brain so I'll be able to raise my
eyebrows<00:05:11.550> however<00:05:12.550> if<00:05:12.729> they<00:05:12.820> have<00:05:12.970> a<00:05:13.000> lower

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
eyebrows however if they have a lower

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.880 
eyebrows however if they have a lower
motor<00:05:13.510> neuron<00:05:13.900> lesion<00:05:13.930> so<00:05:14.440> that's<00:05:14.590> down<00:05:14.860> here

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
motor neuron lesion so that's down here

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.850 
motor neuron lesion so that's down here
that's<00:05:15.430> up<00:05:15.669> and<00:05:15.850> motor<00:05:15.970> neurons<00:05:16.300> up<00:05:16.479> here<00:05:16.860> so

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
that's up and motor neurons up here so

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.150 
that's up and motor neurons up here so
the<00:05:18.010> lower<00:05:18.220> motor<00:05:18.460> neuron<00:05:18.820> lesion<00:05:19.530> I'm<00:05:20.530> not

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
the lower motor neuron lesion I'm not

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.830 
the lower motor neuron lesion I'm not
going<00:05:21.310> to<00:05:21.400> get<00:05:21.520> innovation<00:05:22.120> to<00:05:22.270> add<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.600> top

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
going to get innovation to add the top

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.379 
going to get innovation to add the top
or<00:05:23.139> the<00:05:23.440> bottom<00:05:23.560> half<00:05:24.400> of<00:05:24.550> my<00:05:24.610> face<00:05:24.880> so<00:05:25.180> I'm

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
or the bottom half of my face so I'm

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:26.820 
or the bottom half of my face so I'm
going<00:05:25.510> to<00:05:25.570> have<00:05:25.720> total<00:05:26.139> paralysis<00:05:26.350> of<00:05:26.740> the

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
going to have total paralysis of the

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.310 
going to have total paralysis of the
face<00:05:27.070> so<00:05:27.940> diagnostically<00:05:28.570> this<00:05:28.810> is<00:05:28.930> handy

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
face so diagnostically this is handy

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.860 
face so diagnostically this is handy
because<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:30.400> means<00:05:30.610> that<00:05:30.820> if<00:05:31.389> I've<00:05:31.570> got

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
because it means that if I've got

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.050 
because it means that if I've got
movement<00:05:32.200> in<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.530> forehead<00:05:32.770> only<00:05:33.310> there<00:05:33.820> must

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
movement in the forehead only there must

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.010 
movement in the forehead only there must
be<00:05:34.210> an<00:05:34.330> upper<00:05:34.720> motor<00:05:35.289> neuron<00:05:35.710> lesion<00:05:37.020> under

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
be an upper motor neuron lesion under

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.860 
be an upper motor neuron lesion under
flutter<00:05:38.289> down<00:05:38.500> here

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.480 

however<00:05:43.870> if<00:05:44.170> I<00:05:44.380> am<00:05:44.440> there's<00:05:44.830> no<00:05:44.980> movement<00:05:45.250> at

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
however if I am there's no movement at

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.290 
however if I am there's no movement at
all<00:05:45.610> in<00:05:45.820> the<00:05:45.910> face<00:05:47.070> that<00:05:48.070> means<00:05:48.310> that<00:05:48.550> it's<00:05:49.120> a

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
all in the face that means that it's a

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.990 
all in the face that means that it's a
lower<00:05:49.540> motor<00:05:49.900> neuron<00:05:50.350> lesion<00:05:50.820> so<00:05:51.820> it's<00:05:51.970> a

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
lower motor neuron lesion so it's a

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.450 
lower motor neuron lesion so it's a
pretty<00:05:52.180> easy<00:05:52.360> diagnosis<00:05:53.140> to<00:05:53.290> make<00:05:53.470> just<00:05:54.370> by

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
pretty easy diagnosis to make just by

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.710 
pretty easy diagnosis to make just by
getting<00:05:54.700> someone<00:05:54.850> to<00:05:55.000> raise<00:05:55.180> their<00:05:55.360> eyebrows

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
getting someone to raise their eyebrows

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.130 
getting someone to raise their eyebrows
that's<00:05:56.320> all<00:05:56.560> there<00:05:56.710> is<00:05:56.740> really
