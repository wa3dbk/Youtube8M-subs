00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.930 
mobile camera sensor and what that
sensor<00:01:48.320> does<00:01:48.560> is<00:01:48.830> especially<00:01:49.760> under

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
sensor does is especially under

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.250 
sensor does is especially under
low-light<00:01:50.090> conditions<00:01:50.450> giving<00:01:51.170> you

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
low-light conditions giving you

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.410 
low-light conditions giving you
brilliant<00:01:51.500> images<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.190> so<00:01:52.670> with<00:01:52.880> conventional

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
brilliant images so so with conventional

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.540 
brilliant images so so with conventional
sense<00:01:53.660> your<00:01:53.900> sensors<00:01:54.380> they're<00:01:55.280> going<00:01:55.400> to<00:01:55.460> get

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
sense your sensors they're going to get

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.910 
sense your sensors they're going to get
a<00:01:55.760> graininess<00:01:56.300> there<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.020> not<00:01:57.320> such<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.590> bright

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
a graininess there and not such a bright

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.410 
a graininess there and not such a bright
image<00:01:58.280> this<00:01:58.700> gives<00:01:58.910> you<00:01:59.030> twice<00:01:59.240> the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
image this gives you twice the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.270 
image this gives you twice the
brightness<00:01:59.870> and<00:02:00.110> reduces<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:00.890> digital

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
brightness and reduces that digital

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.090 
brightness and reduces that digital
noise<00:02:01.570> in<00:02:02.570> half<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.110> it's<00:02:03.410> just<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.650> clean<00:02:03.920> image

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
noise in half so it's just a clean image

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.770 
noise in half so it's just a clean image
but<00:02:04.670> but<00:02:04.970> giving<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.330> better<00:02:05.480> lighting

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
but but giving you better lighting

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.420 
but but giving you better lighting
conditions<00:02:06.320> when<00:02:06.860> you're<00:02:06.980> shooting<00:02:07.100> under

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
conditions when you're shooting under

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.160 
conditions when you're shooting under
low<00:02:07.550> light<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:08.210> you're<00:02:08.330> getting<00:02:08.450> almost<00:02:08.869> a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
low light so you're getting almost a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.000 
low light so you're getting almost a
sony<00:02:09.440> Sony<00:02:10.130> point<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.790> shoot<00:02:11.740> inside<00:02:12.740> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
sony Sony point and shoot inside the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.040 
sony Sony point and shoot inside the
superior<00:02:13.730> yeah<00:02:14.180> getting<00:02:14.480> those<00:02:14.600> beautiful

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
superior yeah getting those beautiful

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.630 
superior yeah getting those beautiful
assets<00:02:15.440> from<00:02:15.590> Sony's<00:02:16.010> really<00:02:16.370> tangible

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
bravia the Exmoor are for mobile sensor

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.350 
bravia the Exmoor are for mobile sensor
and<00:02:21.680> then<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.040> know<00:02:22.160> something<00:02:22.550> we<00:02:22.670> kind<00:02:23.270> of

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
hardware a complete light and air tight

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.580 
hardware a complete light and air tight
seal<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.850> minimizes<00:02:44.660> any<00:02:44.690> reflection<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
seal that minimizes any reflection the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.930 
seal that minimizes any reflection the
screen<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:45.980> that's<00:02:46.130> important<00:02:46.580> outdoors

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
screen so that's important outdoors

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.920

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
me you can pinch and get all the yeah

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.600 
me you can pinch and get all the yeah
you<00:02:54.650> pinch<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.070> know<00:02:55.160> from<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.430> home<00:02:55.580> screen

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
you pinch you know from the home screen

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.050 
you pinch you know from the home screen
you<00:02:55.850> do<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.090> fish<00:02:56.390> yeah<00:02:57.260> there<00:02:57.440> we<00:02:57.530> go<00:02:57.560> yeah<00:02:58.060> a

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
you do a fish yeah there we go yeah a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
screens and maybe you've just populated

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.070 
screens and maybe you've just populated
with<00:03:04.459> loads<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.850> widgets<00:03:05.270> that's<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.989> that's

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
with loads of widgets that's it that's

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.960 
with loads of widgets that's it that's
ok<00:03:06.440> cuz<00:03:06.590> all<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:06.739> do<00:03:06.890> is<00:03:07.010> do<00:03:07.130> that<00:03:07.160> pinch<00:03:07.610> and

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
ok cuz all you do is do that pinch and

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.400 
ok cuz all you do is do that pinch and
you<00:03:08.120> can<00:03:08.330> on<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.630> yeah<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.020> then<00:03:09.140> this<00:03:09.290> gives

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
you can on it yeah and then this gives

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.870 
you can on it yeah and then this gives
you<00:03:09.560> shortcuts<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.160> all<00:03:10.250> those<00:03:10.400> witches<00:03:10.610> go

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
you shortcuts to all those witches go

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.270 
you shortcuts to all those witches go
let<00:03:11.780> me<00:03:11.810> go<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.020> this<00:03:12.140> one<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:12.920> takes<00:03:13.190> you
