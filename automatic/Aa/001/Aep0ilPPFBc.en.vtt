inexpensive pickups these this Martin

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.310

does not come with pickups installed in

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.760 
does not come with pickups installed in
it<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.270> had<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> put<00:01:33.810> whatever<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.409> could

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
it and so I had to put whatever I could

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.190 
it and so I had to put whatever I could
find<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.850> know<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> had<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.900> luxury

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
find and I you know I had the luxury

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.840 
find and I you know I had the luxury
shopping<00:01:37.920> around<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.340> picking<00:01:38.670> what<00:01:38.820> I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
shopping around and picking what I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.100 
shopping around and picking what I
wanted

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
wanted

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.889 
wanted
now<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> knk<00:01:41.460> Pierre<00:01:41.820> Western<00:01:42.210> mini<00:01:42.420> pickups

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
now the knk Pierre Western mini pickups

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.569 
now the knk Pierre Western mini pickups
are<00:01:44.450> transducer<00:01:45.450> pickups<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.340> think

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
are transducer pickups and I think

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.260 
are transducer pickups and I think
that's<00:01:47.759> right

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that's right

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.050 
that's right
anyway<00:01:48.750> what<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.710> usually<00:01:50.159> get<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.850> an

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
anyway what you usually get in an

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.270 
anyway what you usually get in an
acoustic<00:01:51.299> guitar<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.140> what's<00:01:52.350> called<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.680> piezo

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
acoustic guitar is what's called a piezo

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.270 
acoustic guitar is what's called a piezo
pickup<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.210> sits<00:01:54.600> right<00:01:54.899> underneath<00:01:55.280> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
pickup and it sits right underneath the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.260 
pickup and it sits right underneath the
saddle<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.469> I<00:01:58.469> think<00:01:59.040> they<00:01:59.219> sound<00:01:59.460> terrible

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
saddle and I think they sound terrible

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.990 
saddle and I think they sound terrible
they<00:02:00.810> sound<00:02:01.079> really<00:02:01.140> quacky<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.130> that's

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
they sound really quacky and that's

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.520 
they sound really quacky and that's
usually<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.360> word<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.869> hear<00:02:04.020> described

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
is a completely different style it's a

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.059 
is a completely different style it's a
lot<00:02:18.239> more<00:02:18.420> like<00:02:18.630> what<00:02:18.870> Taylor<00:02:19.110> does<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.800> their

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
lot more like what Taylor does on their

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.880 
lot more like what Taylor does on their
expression<00:02:20.819> system<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.319> it's<00:02:22.470> actually

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
expression system and so it's actually

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.110 
expression system and so it's actually
three<00:02:23.370> microphones<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:25.500> are<00:02:25.650> glued<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.940> the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
three microphones that are glued to the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.540 
three microphones that are glued to the
bottom<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.319> bridge<00:02:28.560> underneath<00:02:29.069> or<00:02:29.519> you

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
bottom of the bridge underneath or you

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.660 
bottom of the bridge underneath or you
just<00:02:29.819> glued<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.330> wood<00:02:31.280> glued<00:02:32.280> underneath

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
just glued to the wood glued underneath

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.479 
just glued to the wood glued underneath
the<00:02:32.819> bridge<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:34.290> install<00:02:34.920> had<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.190> friend

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
the bridge and I install had a friend

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.490 
the bridge and I install had a friend
help<00:02:35.730> me<00:02:35.790> install<00:02:36.209> this<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:36.810> we<00:02:36.930> put<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.290> in

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
help me install this so we put this in

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.520 
help me install this so we put this in
together<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.310> they<00:02:38.880> come<00:02:39.200> basically<00:02:40.200> all<00:02:40.380> you

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
together and they come basically all you

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.039 
together and they come basically all you
have<00:02:40.739> are<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.310> three<00:02:41.610> pickup<00:02:42.030> leads<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.750> you

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
have are the three pickup leads that you

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.820 
have are the three pickup leads that you
glue<00:02:43.319> in<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.890> then<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.700> wire<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.299> goes<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.830> the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
glue in and then a wire that goes to the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.729 
glue in and then a wire that goes to the
the<00:02:47.250> output<00:02:47.430> jack<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.360> that's<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.590> there

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
the output jack and that's it so there

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.589 
the output jack and that's it so there
is<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.890> little<00:02:50.099> bit<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.370> installation<00:02:50.970> involved

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
is a little bit of installation involved

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.809 
is a little bit of installation involved
if<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.380> decide<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.769> go<00:02:53.040> with<00:02:53.069> these<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.760> do

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
if you decide to go with these and I do

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.600 
if you decide to go with these and I do
highly<00:02:54.390> recommend<00:02:54.420> them<00:02:55.069> it<00:02:56.069> might<00:02:56.280> be<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> good

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
highly recommend them it might be a good

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.339 
highly recommend them it might be a good
idea<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:57.330> somebody<00:02:57.599> install<00:02:58.140> them<00:02:58.319> for

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
idea to have somebody install them for

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.229 
idea to have somebody install them for
you<00:02:58.829> but<00:02:59.069> seriously<00:02:59.310> they're<00:02:59.640> cheap<00:02:59.910> enough

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
you but seriously they're cheap enough

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.229 
you but seriously they're cheap enough
that<00:03:01.140> they're<00:03:01.440> well<00:03:01.650> under<00:03:01.920> $100<00:03:02.700> for<00:03:03.120> this

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
that they're well under $100 for this

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.390 
that they're well under $100 for this
pickup<00:03:03.630> system<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.069> could<00:03:05.190> probably

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
pickup system that you could probably

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.789 
pickup system that you could probably
get<00:03:05.750> somebody<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.959> install<00:03:07.290> them<00:03:07.440> for<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.709> and

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
get somebody to install them for you and

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.339 
get somebody to install them for you and
you're<00:03:07.890> still<00:03:08.099> gonna<00:03:08.310> pay<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:08.970> much<00:03:09.209> money

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
you're still gonna pay that much money

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.220 
you're still gonna pay that much money
now<00:03:10.349> because<00:03:11.130> they<00:03:11.819> mount<00:03:12.540> they<00:03:13.079> are

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
now because they mount they are

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.830 
now because they mount they are
transducer<00:03:13.859> pickups<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.340> mount<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:15.660> the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
transducer pickups that mount to the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.069 
transducer pickups that mount to the
body<00:03:16.079> itself<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:17.430> picks<00:03:17.819> up<00:03:18.030> everything<00:03:18.630> so

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
body itself it picks up everything so

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.099 
body itself it picks up everything so
you<00:03:19.140> can<00:03:19.350> tap<00:03:20.220> on<00:03:20.400> your<00:03:20.609> guitar<00:03:20.959> if<00:03:21.959> you've

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
you can tap on your guitar if you've

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.599 
you can tap on your guitar if you've
played<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.380> tailor<00:03:22.709> before<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.130> might<00:03:23.310> notice

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
played a tailor before you might notice

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.039 
played a tailor before you might notice
this<00:03:23.790> about<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.329> you<00:03:24.450> or<00:03:24.600> like<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.900> just

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
this about it to you or like it just

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.520 
this about it to you or like it just
picks<00:03:25.290> everything<00:03:25.560> up<00:03:26.359> and<00:03:27.359> it<00:03:27.989> all<00:03:28.170> comes

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
picks everything up and it all comes

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.440 
picks everything up and it all comes
through<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.829> PA<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.670> they<00:03:29.850> are<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.030> little<00:03:30.269> bit

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
through the PA so they are a little bit

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.110 
through the PA so they are a little bit
prone<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:31.200> feedback<00:03:31.709> they<00:03:31.950> sound<00:03:32.340> much<00:03:32.819> more

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
prone to feedback they sound much more

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.900 
prone to feedback they sound much more
natural<00:03:33.690> but<00:03:34.440> they're<00:03:34.650> prone<00:03:34.889> to<00:03:35.010> feedback<00:03:35.280> so

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
natural but they're prone to feedback so

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.890 
natural but they're prone to feedback so
I<00:03:36.209> have<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:37.400> well<00:03:38.400> here<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.209> have<00:03:39.720> a

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
I have a well here it is I have a

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.819 
I have a well here it is I have a
feedback<00:03:40.400> Buster<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.850> play<00:03:42.620> that<00:03:43.620> any

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
feedback Buster that I play that any

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.900 
feedback Buster that I play that any
time<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:44.130> play<00:03:44.549> plugged<00:03:45.030> in<00:03:45.239> I<00:03:45.569> use<00:03:46.109> this<00:03:46.319> guy

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
time I play plugged in I use this guy

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.360 
time I play plugged in I use this guy
and<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.090> basically<00:03:48.209> stops<00:03:48.780> sound<00:03:49.470> really<00:03:50.220> what

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
and it basically stops sound really what

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.680 
and it basically stops sound really what
you're<00:03:50.519> doing<00:03:50.549> is<00:03:50.819> stopping<00:03:51.090> sound<00:03:51.420> from

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
you're doing is stopping sound from

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.870 
you're doing is stopping sound from
going<00:03:51.959> into<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.410> sound<00:03:52.739> hole<00:03:52.950> because<00:03:53.700> that

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
going into the sound hole because that

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.059 
going into the sound hole because that
goes<00:03:54.090> in<00:03:54.389> it<00:03:54.810> hits<00:03:55.019> those<00:03:55.200> pickups<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.889> comes

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
goes in it hits those pickups it comes

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.500 
goes in it hits those pickups it comes
out<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.519> just<00:03:56.670> create<00:03:56.819> this<00:03:57.030> feedback

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
out and you just create this feedback

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.470 
out and you just create this feedback
loop<00:03:57.840> which<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.680> no<00:03:58.829> good<00:03:59.209> so<00:04:00.209> if<00:04:00.329> you're

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
loop which is no good so if you're

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.569 
loop which is no good so if you're
playing<00:04:00.690> plugged<00:04:01.440> in<00:04:01.680> you're<00:04:02.130> not<00:04:02.250> gonna<00:04:02.340> hear

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
playing plugged in you're not gonna hear

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.640 
playing plugged in you're not gonna hear
the<00:04:02.730> acoustic<00:04:03.269> tone<00:04:03.510> anyway<00:04:04.079> so<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:04.590> doesn't

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
the acoustic tone anyway so it doesn't

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.250 
the acoustic tone anyway so it doesn't
really<00:04:04.889> matter<00:04:05.099> so<00:04:05.900> you<00:04:06.900> can<00:04:07.049> buy<00:04:07.200> these

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
really matter so you can buy these

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.870 
really matter so you can buy these
little<00:04:07.590> guys<00:04:07.799> it's<00:04:08.130> called<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.400> feedback

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
little guys it's called a feedback

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.599 
little guys it's called a feedback
Buster<00:04:09.450> they<00:04:10.019> are<00:04:10.200> pretty<00:04:10.410> cheap<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.950> I

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
Buster they are pretty cheap and I

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.759 
Buster they are pretty cheap and I
recommend<00:04:12.299> using<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:12.900> especially<00:04:13.530> if<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.709> use

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
recommend using it especially if you use

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.460 
recommend using it especially if you use
a<00:04:13.889> pickup<00:04:14.280> system<00:04:14.700> like<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.359> that<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.139> have<00:04:16.320> in

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
a pickup system like this that I have in

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.420 
a pickup system like this that I have in
the<00:04:16.560> guitar<00:04:16.829> so<00:04:17.400> these<00:04:18.060> pickups<00:04:18.479> are<00:04:18.630> passive

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
the guitar so these pickups are passive

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.340 
the guitar so these pickups are passive
one<00:04:19.579> thing<00:04:19.759> I<00:04:19.820> love<00:04:20.030> about<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.299> is<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:20.600> never

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
one thing I love about it is I never

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.740 
one thing I love about it is I never
have<00:04:21.949> to<00:04:22.190> worry<00:04:22.550> about<00:04:22.669> a<00:04:22.789> battery<00:04:23.270> in<00:04:23.570> my

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
have to worry about a battery in my

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.460 
have to worry about a battery in my
guitar<00:04:24.320> my<00:04:25.250> old<00:04:25.520> takamine<00:04:26.210> eats<00:04:26.930> batteries

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
guitar my old takamine eats batteries

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.600 
guitar my old takamine eats batteries
like<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.860> wouldn't<00:04:28.100> believe

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
like you wouldn't believe

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.820 
like you wouldn't believe
so<00:04:29.000> they<00:04:29.120> are<00:04:29.210> passive<00:04:29.660> they<00:04:29.840> actually<00:04:30.229> have<00:04:30.440> a

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
so they are passive they actually have a

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.060 
so they are passive they actually have a
decent<00:04:31.490> amount<00:04:31.850> of<00:04:31.880> output<00:04:32.360> so<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:33.080> can<00:04:33.530> just

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
decent amount of output so you can just

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.249 
decent amount of output so you can just
run<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:34.280> straight<00:04:34.520> into<00:04:34.729> a<00:04:34.850> board<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.389> it

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
run it straight into a board and it

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.450 
run it straight into a board and it
doesn't<00:04:36.560> sound<00:04:36.680> bad<00:04:37.449> but<00:04:38.449> I<00:04:39.250> bought<00:04:40.250> this

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
doesn't sound bad but I bought this

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.040 
doesn't sound bad but I bought this
preamp<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.090> go<00:04:41.210> with<00:04:41.389> it<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:41.690> this<00:04:41.810> guy

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
preamp to go with it and this guy

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.490 
preamp to go with it and this guy
retails<00:04:42.800> for<00:04:42.949> like<00:04:43.630> around<00:04:44.630> $100<00:04:45.169> maybe<00:04:45.380> a

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
competitors to this that are pretty

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.510 
competitors to this that are pretty
popular<00:04:51.470> that<00:04:52.009> LR<00:04:52.370> bags<00:04:53.440> has<00:04:54.440> one<00:04:54.830> that's

popular that LR bags has one that's
really<00:04:55.789> popular<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.210> can't<00:04:56.389> remember<00:04:56.570> the<00:04:56.690> name

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
really popular I can't remember the name

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.730 
really popular I can't remember the name
of<00:04:56.900> it<00:04:57.139> right<00:04:57.169> now

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
of it right now

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.279 
of it right now
but<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:58.190> really<00:04:58.550> liked<00:04:58.789> this<00:04:59.120> I<00:04:59.509> had<00:05:00.020> a<00:05:00.050> chance

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
but I really liked this I had a chance

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:01.600 
but I really liked this I had a chance
to<00:05:00.500> play<00:05:00.620> through<00:05:00.949> it<00:05:00.979> before<00:05:01.340> I<00:05:01.370> bought<00:05:01.580> it

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
to play through it before I bought it

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.909 
to play through it before I bought it
and<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.060> thought<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.419> sounded<00:05:02.599> great<00:05:02.900> a<00:05:03.289> couple

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
and I thought it sounded great a couple

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.310 
and I thought it sounded great a couple
things<00:05:04.099> about<00:05:04.370> this<00:05:04.820> guy<00:05:05.030> that<00:05:05.060> is<00:05:06.050> really

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
things about this guy that is really

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.480 
things about this guy that is really
cool<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:08.000> gets<00:05:08.389> so<00:05:09.199> you<00:05:09.289> have<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.770> either<00:05:10.099> power

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
cool it gets so you have to either power

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.820 
cool it gets so you have to either power
it<00:05:10.789> right<00:05:11.000> here<00:05:11.419> there's<00:05:11.780> a<00:05:11.870> 9-volt<00:05:12.470> power

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
it right here there's a 9-volt power

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.999 
it right here there's a 9-volt power
input<00:05:13.550> you<00:05:14.150> can<00:05:14.330> power<00:05:14.720> it<00:05:14.840> via<00:05:15.139> battery<00:05:15.740> or

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
input you can power it via battery or

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.610 
input you can power it via battery or
this<00:05:16.759> is<00:05:16.880> what<00:05:17.030> I<00:05:17.060> do<00:05:17.180> almost<00:05:17.960> every<00:05:18.349> single

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
this is what I do almost every single

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.550 
this is what I do almost every single
time<00:05:18.800> I<00:05:19.759> just<00:05:20.300> run<00:05:20.479> it<00:05:20.599> to<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:20.840> board<00:05:21.080> via<00:05:21.380> this

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
time I just run it to the board via this

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.450 
time I just run it to the board via this
XLR<00:05:22.220> out<00:05:22.460> and<00:05:22.910> it<00:05:23.150> will<00:05:23.419> take<00:05:24.139> 48<00:05:25.010> volt<00:05:25.370> phantom

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
XLR out and it will take 48 volt phantom

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.270 
XLR out and it will take 48 volt phantom
power<00:05:25.880> so<00:05:26.630> if<00:05:26.720> you<00:05:26.840> can<00:05:27.020> send<00:05:27.229> it<00:05:27.409> 48<00:05:28.039> volt

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
power so if you can send it 48 volt

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.700 
power so if you can send it 48 volt
phantom<00:05:28.370> power<00:05:28.669> from<00:05:29.240> your<00:05:29.389> board<00:05:29.630> it<00:05:30.289> powers

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
phantom power from your board it powers

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.570 
phantom power from your board it powers
it<00:05:30.889> you<00:05:30.979> don't<00:05:31.130> have<00:05:31.190> to<00:05:31.340> worry<00:05:31.490> about

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
it you don't have to worry about

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.730 
it you don't have to worry about
batteries<00:05:32.150> and<00:05:32.419> that's<00:05:32.599> what<00:05:32.750> I<00:05:32.780> do<00:05:32.870> so<00:05:33.680> you

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
batteries and that's what I do so you

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.420 
batteries and that's what I do so you
can<00:05:34.130> go<00:05:34.460> out<00:05:34.490> via<00:05:35.090> XLR<00:05:35.659> or<00:05:35.990> quarter<00:05:36.830> inch<00:05:37.010> line

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
can go out via XLR or quarter inch line

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.520 
can go out via XLR or quarter inch line
out<00:05:38.830> it<00:05:39.830> has<00:05:40.099> a<00:05:40.130> notch<00:05:40.580> filter<00:05:41.150> so<00:05:41.720> if<00:05:42.110> you<00:05:42.380> are

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
out it has a notch filter so if you are

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.830 
out it has a notch filter so if you are
getting<00:05:42.800> some<00:05:43.010> really<00:05:43.039> nasty<00:05:43.490> feedback<00:05:44.360> you

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
getting some really nasty feedback you

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.560 
getting some really nasty feedback you
can<00:05:45.139> turn<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:45.710> knotch<00:05:45.889> filter<00:05:46.280> on<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.909> you

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
can turn the knotch filter on and you

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.560 
can turn the knotch filter on and you
can<00:05:47.750> filter<00:05:48.050> between<00:05:48.320> 100<00:05:49.009> Hertz<00:05:49.220> and<00:05:49.570> 350

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
can filter between 100 Hertz and 350

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.629 
can filter between 100 Hertz and 350
Hertz<00:05:50.780> which<00:05:51.050> is<00:05:51.080> very<00:05:51.470> low-end<00:05:51.919> so<00:05:52.490> it's

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
Hertz which is very low-end so it's

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.219 
Hertz which is very low-end so it's
usually<00:05:52.759> that<00:05:52.970> low<00:05:53.240> in<00:05:53.419> feedback<00:05:53.900> that<00:05:54.139> you

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
usually that low in feedback that you

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.790 
usually that low in feedback that you
get<00:05:54.409> you<00:05:54.740> can<00:05:54.889> find<00:05:55.190> it<00:05:55.370> and<00:05:55.820> you<00:05:55.940> can<00:05:56.090> kill<00:05:56.360> it

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
get you can find it and you can kill it

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.399 
get you can find it and you can kill it
you<00:05:57.800> have<00:05:58.070> an<00:05:58.340> input<00:05:58.490> gain<00:05:59.030> and<00:05:59.330> then<00:06:00.050> you<00:06:00.169> have

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
you have an input gain and then you have

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:02.680 
you have an input gain and then you have
your<00:06:00.710> level<00:06:01.250> out<00:06:01.490> and<00:06:01.880> you<00:06:02.060> have<00:06:02.210> separate

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
your level out and you have separate

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.360 
your level out and you have separate
level<00:06:03.110> 4<00:06:03.320> XLR<00:06:03.889> and<00:06:04.159> line<00:06:04.669> out<00:06:05.229> and<00:06:06.229> then<00:06:07.220> you

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
level 4 XLR and line out and then you

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.580 
level 4 XLR and line out and then you
have<00:06:07.400> what's<00:06:08.210> called<00:06:08.419> the<00:06:08.750> you<00:06:09.110> have<00:06:09.199> a<00:06:09.229> phase

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590
