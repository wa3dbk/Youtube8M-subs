afar<00:03:05.079> or<00:03:05.680> even<00:03:06.040> at<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:06.280> distance<00:03:06.579> it's

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
afar or even at this distance it's

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.050 
afar or even at this distance it's
pretty<00:03:07.810> it's<00:03:08.140> really<00:03:08.530> cute<00:03:08.799> really<00:03:09.190> fun<00:03:09.760> piece

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
pretty it's really cute really fun piece

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.930 
pretty it's really cute really fun piece
a<00:03:10.359> nice<00:03:10.989> accessory<00:03:11.709> but<00:03:12.010> honestly<00:03:12.430> looking<00:03:12.790> up

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
a nice accessory but honestly looking up

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.759 
a nice accessory but honestly looking up
close<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.450> think<00:03:13.660> these<00:03:13.750> rows<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.170> pieces<00:03:14.560> look

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
close I think these rows and pieces look

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.530 
close I think these rows and pieces look
like<00:03:14.950> they<00:03:15.100> cost<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.670> sentence<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.120> know<00:03:16.359> like

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
like they cost to sentence you know like

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.270 
like they cost to sentence you know like
I<00:03:16.720> just<00:03:17.019> wasn't<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.590> impressed<00:03:17.980> with<00:03:18.190> the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
I just wasn't that impressed with the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.000 
I just wasn't that impressed with the
material<00:03:18.760> used<00:03:18.970> for<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.420> specific<00:03:19.660> piece<00:03:20.200> so

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
material used for that specific piece so

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.940 
material used for that specific piece so
this<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.989> when<00:03:22.989> I<00:03:23.019> put<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.380> on<00:03:23.530> it's<00:03:23.829> a

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
this is that when I put it on it's a

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.220 
this is that when I put it on it's a
nice<00:03:24.160> length<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.150> think<00:03:25.390> it's<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.600> seven<00:03:26.019> and<00:03:26.079> a

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
nice length I think it's a seven and a

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.860 
nice length I think it's a seven and a
half<00:03:26.260> inches<00:03:26.590> so<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.190> kind<00:03:27.459> of<00:03:27.519> sits<00:03:27.760> like<00:03:28.450> here

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
half inches so it kind of sits like here

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.449 
half inches so it kind of sits like here
when<00:03:29.079> my<00:03:29.109> arm<00:03:29.350> is<00:03:29.530> up<00:03:29.680> or<00:03:29.890> it'll<00:03:30.010> sit<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.340> little

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
when my arm is up or it'll sit a little

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.890 
when my arm is up or it'll sit a little
bit<00:03:30.670> on<00:03:30.760> my<00:03:30.790> wrist<00:03:31.120> which<00:03:31.329> I<00:03:31.420> kind<00:03:31.630> of<00:03:31.690> like<00:03:31.870> it

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
bit on my wrist which I kind of like it

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.420 
bit on my wrist which I kind of like it
moving<00:03:32.320> along<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.620> bit<00:03:32.859> I<00:03:33.040> don't<00:03:33.190> know<00:03:33.250> why<00:03:33.400> but

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
moving along a bit I don't know why but

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.789 
moving along a bit I don't know why but
I<00:03:33.670> think<00:03:33.880> it's<00:03:34.000> really<00:03:34.180> pretty<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:34.900> then<00:03:35.620> this

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
I think it's really pretty and then this

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.030 
I think it's really pretty and then this
last<00:03:36.160> thing<00:03:36.489> i<00:03:36.579> got<00:03:36.609> is<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:37.150> necklace<00:03:37.690> i<00:03:38.079> picked

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
last thing i got is a necklace i picked

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.580 
last thing i got is a necklace i picked
out<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.430> fantasia<00:03:39.910> necklace<00:03:40.600> which<00:03:41.019> is<00:03:41.319> a

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
out the fantasia necklace which is a

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.160 
out the fantasia necklace which is a
crystal<00:03:42.579> rock<00:03:42.790> design<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:43.600> it's<00:03:43.720> clear

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
crystal rock design and it's clear

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.610 
crystal rock design and it's clear
crystal<00:03:44.680> stone<00:03:44.980> prongs<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.970> light<00:03:46.630> pink<00:03:47.109> resin

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
crystal stone prongs a light pink resin

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.289 
crystal stone prongs a light pink resin
gem<00:03:47.950> so<00:03:48.250> again<00:03:48.489> they're<00:03:48.700> really<00:03:48.940> killing<00:03:49.239> it

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
gem so again they're really killing it

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:50.940 
gem so again they're really killing it
with<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.630> resin<00:03:50.049> and<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.230> think<00:03:50.470> that's<00:03:50.620> just<00:03:50.680> a

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
with the resin and I think that's just a

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.490 
with the resin and I think that's just a
good<00:03:51.519> way<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:51.730> get<00:03:51.940> like<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.470> variety<00:03:53.470> of

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
good way to get like a variety of

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.280 
good way to get like a variety of
textures<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:55.180> this<00:03:55.329> is<00:03:55.510> what<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.959> necklace

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
textures so this is what the necklace

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.580 
textures so this is what the necklace
looks<00:03:56.590> like<00:03:57.959> hopefully<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.049> guys<00:03:59.170> won't<00:03:59.410> be

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
looks like hopefully you guys won't be

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.830 
looks like hopefully you guys won't be
able<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.920> see<00:04:00.160> if<00:04:00.730> not<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.180> probably<00:04:01.600> go<00:04:01.750> on

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
able to see if not you probably go on

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.479 
able to see if not you probably go on
the<00:04:01.959> website<00:04:02.109> and<00:04:02.500> check<00:04:02.680> it<00:04:02.859> out<00:04:03.010> or<00:04:03.310> i<00:04:03.340> could

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
the website and check it out or i could

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.420 
the website and check it out or i could
pictures<00:04:04.420> of<00:04:04.600> my<00:04:04.690> blog<00:04:04.959> but<00:04:05.650> it's<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:06.190> gold

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
pictures of my blog but it's the gold

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.290 
pictures of my blog but it's the gold
chain

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
chain

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.730 
chain
and<00:04:07.480> you<00:04:07.780> do<00:04:07.990> have<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.320> little<00:04:08.590> bit<00:04:08.710> of

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
and you do have a little bit of

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.700 
and you do have a little bit of
flexibility<00:04:09.400> with<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.730> length<00:04:10.470> which<00:04:11.470> is<00:04:11.500> the

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
flexibility with the length which is the

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.940 
flexibility with the length which is the
staple<00:04:12.220> hanging<00:04:12.760> out<00:04:12.880> up<00:04:13.060> here<00:04:13.620> so<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.680> have

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
staple hanging out up here so you have

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.740 
staple hanging out up here so you have
flexibility<00:04:15.640> with<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:15.970> length<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:16.450> could<00:04:16.600> go

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
flexibility with the length it could go

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.500 
flexibility with the length it could go
a<00:04:16.780> little<00:04:17.019> bit<00:04:17.230> longer<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:18.640> chain<00:04:18.910> is<00:04:18.940> really

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
a little bit longer the chain is really

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.500 
a little bit longer the chain is really
like<00:04:19.690> soft<00:04:20.049> it's<00:04:20.739> really<00:04:20.950> silky<00:04:21.459> it<00:04:22.150> doesn't

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
like soft it's really silky it doesn't

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.910 
like soft it's really silky it doesn't
look<00:04:22.600> sound<00:04:22.810> like<00:04:22.960> going<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.200> grab<00:04:23.380> onto<00:04:23.620> your

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
look sound like going to grab onto your

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.880 
look sound like going to grab onto your
neck<00:04:24.400> at<00:04:24.610> all<00:04:24.730> and<00:04:25.060> then<00:04:25.690> this<00:04:25.840> resin<00:04:26.410> piece<00:04:26.680> is

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
neck at all and then this resin piece is

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.770 
neck at all and then this resin piece is
kind<00:04:27.130> of<00:04:27.220> textured<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:28.030> then<00:04:28.210> each<00:04:28.420> of<00:04:28.450> the

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
kind of textured and then each of the

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.720 
kind of textured and then each of the
little<00:04:28.930> gold<00:04:29.290> thing<00:04:29.860> sticking<00:04:30.250> out<00:04:30.460> have

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
little gold thing sticking out have

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.850 
little gold thing sticking out have
little<00:04:31.030> crystals<00:04:31.540> on<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.840> end<00:04:31.990> too<00:04:32.290> so<00:04:32.800> I

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
little crystals on the end too so I

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.770 
little crystals on the end too so I
thought<00:04:33.010> this<00:04:33.160> was<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.370> really<00:04:33.640> unique<00:04:33.940> piece<00:04:34.120> I

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
thought this was a really unique piece I

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.800 
thought this was a really unique piece I
think<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:36.040> yellow<00:04:36.250> gold<00:04:36.580> is<00:04:36.880> really

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
think that the yellow gold is really

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.240 
think that the yellow gold is really
yellow<00:04:38.170> and<00:04:38.440> it's<00:04:38.560> borderline<00:04:39.370> cheesy<00:04:40.210> yellow

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
yellow and it's borderline cheesy yellow

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.070 
yellow and it's borderline cheesy yellow
but<00:04:42.250> at<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.460> same<00:04:42.670> time<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:43.240> think<00:04:43.270> it's<00:04:43.780> it's

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
but at the same time I think it's it's

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.290 
but at the same time I think it's it's
borderline<00:04:44.920> in<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.430> right<00:04:45.640> way<00:04:45.820> like<00:04:46.120> I

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
borderline in the right way like I

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
borderline in the right way like I
definitely<00:04:46.360> not<00:04:46.990> going<00:04:47.170> to<00:04:47.230> feel

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
definitely not going to feel
