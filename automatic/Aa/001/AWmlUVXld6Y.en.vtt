yeah it's good for which get started so

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.509 
yeah it's good for which get started so
these<00:00:22.260> are<00:00:22.320> mirrored<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.279> when<00:00:23.490> I

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
these are mirrored so I just when I

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.679 
these are mirrored so I just when I
deleted<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:25.099> copies<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.510> trying<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> get

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
deleted the copies and trying to get

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.299 
deleted the copies and trying to get
over<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.170> week<00:00:30.619> probably<00:00:31.619> too<00:00:31.679> weird<00:00:32.040> this

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
over a week probably too weird this

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.340 
over a week probably too weird this
on<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> y-axis<00:00:33.630> my<00:00:34.380> way<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.829> hooked<00:00:35.130> around

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
on the y-axis my way it's hooked around

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.420 
on the y-axis my way it's hooked around
right<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:39.210> now<00:00:40.140> I'm<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.160> move<00:00:41.280> it

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
right and now I'm just going to move it

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.830 
right and now I'm just going to move it
over<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.730> little<00:00:41.879> bit<00:00:42.149> because<00:00:42.270> through<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
over a little bit because through the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.330 
over a little bit because through the
arteries<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.329> i'm<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.570> start<00:00:45.809> welding

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
arteries and i'm going to start welding

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.990 
arteries and i'm going to start welding
up<00:00:47.340> these<00:00:47.940> things<00:00:49.100> so<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.550> go<00:00:50.700> into<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
up these things so we go into the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.729 
up these things so we go into the
modifiers<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:54.559> now<00:00:56.539> go<00:00:57.539> ahead<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.050> put

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
modifiers and and now go ahead and put

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.729 
modifiers and and now go ahead and put
in<00:00:58.770> yo<00:00:59.010> I'd<00:00:59.449> like<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.690> vertex<00:01:01.170> election<00:01:01.620> on

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
in yo I'd like the vertex election on

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.679 
in yo I'd like the vertex election on
account<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.809> i'm<00:01:03.809> gonna<00:01:03.960> select<00:01:04.290> attach<00:01:05.689> all

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
account that i'm gonna select attach all

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.289 
account that i'm gonna select attach all
right<00:01:06.900> now<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.640> model<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.630> mesh<00:01:09.900> i

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
right now it's like the model the mesh i

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.240 
right now it's like the model the mesh i
have<00:01:12.299> selected<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.580> now<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:16.170> without<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
have selected and now it without the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.580 
have selected and now it without the
meshes<00:01:18.090> attached<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:19.880> other<00:01:20.880> mesh<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:22.049> I'm<00:01:22.290> do

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
meshes attached to other mesh now I'm do

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.710 
meshes attached to other mesh now I'm do
is<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.220> more<00:01:23.400> efficient<00:01:23.880> wage<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.509> just

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
is the more efficient wage is just

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.280 
is the more efficient wage is just
looking<00:01:25.080> select<00:01:26.299> or<00:01:27.299> selecting<00:01:27.780> two<00:01:27.960> vertices

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
looking select or selecting two vertices

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.880 
looking select or selecting two vertices
and<00:01:29.479> pulling<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.840> weld<00:01:31.200> threshold<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
and pulling up the weld threshold that

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.020 
and pulling up the weld threshold that
clicks<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.369> lucky

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
clicks and lucky

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.760 
clicks and lucky
all<00:01:34.810> right<00:01:35.159> now<00:01:36.159> you<00:01:36.250> can<00:01:36.549> do<00:01:36.700> that<00:01:37.770> why

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
all right now you can do that why

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.380 
all right now you can do that why
everyone<00:01:39.220> doesn't<00:01:39.400> keep<00:01:39.850> say<00:01:40.060> all<00:01:40.210> your

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
everyone doesn't keep say all your

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.719 
everyone doesn't keep say all your
emergency<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.140> straight<00:01:41.470> line<00:01:41.729> she's

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
emergency to the straight line she's

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:49.109 
emergency to the straight line she's
really<00:01:43.090> good<00:01:43.299> for<00:01:44.040> most<00:01:45.040> things<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:47.850> C<00:01:48.850> worked

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
really good for most things so C worked

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.359 
really good for most things so C worked
out<00:01:49.270> really<00:01:49.600> nicely<00:01:49.900> tanned<00:01:50.170> now<00:01:50.500> what<00:01:51.280> you

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
out really nicely tanned now what you

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.609 
out really nicely tanned now what you
could<00:01:51.490> actually<00:01:51.640> do<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.330> just<00:01:52.509> like<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:53.050> give<00:01:53.590> a

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
could actually do you just like I give a

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.930 
could actually do you just like I give a
low<00:01:53.950> threshold<00:01:54.780> he<00:01:55.780> was<00:01:55.930> like<00:01:56.200> more<00:01:56.920> I'd<00:01:57.580> like

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
low threshold he was like more I'd like

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.490 
low threshold he was like more I'd like
to<00:01:57.970> it's<00:01:58.630> like<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:59.049> I'd<00:01:59.200> like<00:02:00.630> our<00:02:01.630> parallel<00:02:02.170> to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
to it's like to I'd like our parallel to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.880 
to it's like to I'd like our parallel to
each<00:02:02.649> other<00:02:03.149> intersecting<00:02:04.149> out<00:02:04.299> up<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.619> you

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
each other intersecting out up and you

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.520 
each other intersecting out up and you
could<00:02:06.070> go<00:02:06.220> ahead<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.520> weld<00:02:07.330> them<00:02:07.420> together<00:02:07.660> if

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
could go ahead and weld them together if

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.310 
could go ahead and weld them together if
you're<00:02:08.769> about<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:09.070> see<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.780> just<00:02:10.780> from<00:02:11.170> a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
you're about to see I just from a

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.750 
you're about to see I just from a
threshold<00:02:11.830> dabbling<00:02:12.220> six<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.880> I<00:02:14.610> got<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> big

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
threshold dabbling six and I got a big

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.550 
threshold dabbling six and I got a big
chunk<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.150> select<00:02:18.840> for<00:02:19.840> some<00:02:19.989> reason<00:02:20.290> my<00:02:20.380> G

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
chunk and select for some reason my G

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.270 
chunk and select for some reason my G
back<00:02:23.010> alright<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.370> we<00:02:24.730> go<00:02:24.880> has<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.330> selected

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
back alright so we go has it selected

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.340 
back alright so we go has it selected
now<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.340> can<00:02:27.819> see<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.330> lot<00:02:30.870> sometimes<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.260> get

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
now you can see a lot sometimes you get

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.500 
now you can see a lot sometimes you get
a<00:02:32.410> little<00:02:32.500> bit<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:33.160> mare<00:02:33.760> or<00:02:33.940> something<00:02:34.330> this

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
a little bit of a mare or something this

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.960 
a little bit of a mare or something this
would<00:02:34.720> target<00:02:35.080> loan<00:02:35.350> comes<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.769> manatee<00:02:36.220> it's

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
would target loan comes to manatee it's

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.160 
would target loan comes to manatee it's
like<00:02:37.239> target<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:37.959> then<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.709> move<00:02:38.950> around<00:02:40.170> and

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
like target and then you move around and

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.430 
like target and then you move around and
there<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.680> go<00:02:42.120> full<00:02:43.120> mesh<00:02:44.670> stop<00:02:45.670> beer

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
there you go full mesh stop beer

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.150 
there you go full mesh stop beer
disconnected<00:02:47.440> um<00:02:48.329> makes<00:02:49.329> really<00:02:49.660> nice<00:02:50.160> so

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
disconnected um makes really nice so

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.670 
disconnected um makes really nice so
