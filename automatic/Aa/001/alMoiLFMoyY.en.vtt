00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.309
 It is convenient to practice the gradient technique with my disk 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.869
 first several spots are drawn with charcoal tricks and blood on a 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.869
 paper applying the flat bonnet 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:34.290
 later with the vih cumin the end of the spot was proposed 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.990
 the ticking continues 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.290
 and the tone is extinguished giving as results a solicitor 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.790
 in the process of assessing this possibility 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.940
 a combination of sangin in charcoal will be used to establish a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.940
 difference of salaries 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.070
 it is drawn and stained its spoiled form 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.160
 then the shadow area is drawn with charcoal 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.460
 the exercise ends by fusing both shifts with the dogs 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.860
 In the following exercise you will practice what you have learned so far 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.969
 these lemons 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.969
 they will work with charcoal and simple 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.010
 the shape of the fruits is first fitted 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.040
 and then 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.840
 the final line starts with a fine and safe line 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.069
 the amazement of those present is drawn 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.069
 exerting strong pressure with the charcoal 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:34.259
 the projected rear shadow is represented both a darker shade 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:59.529
 the darker shadows disappear with the tip of the finger 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.360
 to end 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.620
 the areas that should be the most are highlighted with sanguine 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.620
 dark 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.479
 now the same exercise will be practiced with apples using charcoal and 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.479
 white fruit on colored paper 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.249
 the lace began 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:45.939
 very important to make a good drawing 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.090
 tracing the main lines of the shape of the apples 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.579
 the charcoal is applied marking the main shadow areas 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:08.509
 the most illuminated part is said without staining 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:26.860
 the projected shadow of the fruits is also drawn with a more gray tone 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.860
 dark than the inside 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.780
 with legends of the sport spreads in charcoal inside the 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.490
 apples 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.490
 leaving a darker contrast in the inner area 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.190
 with the white crest in it stains the whole environment of the chiabra fruits 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.189
 they appear isolated 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.550
 inside the fruit a strong impact of white chalk is applied in the 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.550
 zone of more luminosity 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:29.270
 and this exercise is over 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.270
 highlighting some shadows with charcoal 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.819
 It's important to put attention on 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.139
 Valuation means the interpretation of each tonal zone with 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.139
 different degrees of gray yes 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:09.489
 the modeling melts and 9a the different zones valued with grays 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.349
 to increase the brightness if you use the white chalk on papers that are 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:22.349
 colour 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.349
 min 4 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.130
 to perform marches and blocks in the modeling process 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.140
 the charcoal expo-links can be used
