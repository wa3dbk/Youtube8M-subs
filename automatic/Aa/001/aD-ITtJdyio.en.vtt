00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:07.120
 I recently published a work on 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.520
 chía the perfect food already spoke in 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.640
 him of his extraordinary properties and 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.260
 its high nutrient content and you are 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.390
 many who through you 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.880
 comments ask how to take the 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.900
 Chia where is how I get it 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.820
 and this has surprised me a lot because 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.920
 People are not informed 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.039
 nobody asks how to find or 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.640
 get a pack of tobacco 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.380
 that makes it very easy for us 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.380
 what is toxic and carcinogenic 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:42.740
 immortal is within reach of anyone 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.750
 but the chia does not chía like many 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.970
 other good foods do not interest 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.200
 there are no health campaigns recommending the 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:57.640
 chia does not promote its cultivation of sushi 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.550
 soybean or transgenic corn the one you want 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.440

 it will be easy and in another more complicated if 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.110

 chía the germinales those that you do not have 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.200
 germinator you can do it in a tupper 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.629
 with a little water and cotton and a 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.590
 Once the buds of the chia 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:03.099
 you throw in the salad 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.200
 2 in the form of a smoothie you take a glass of 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.629
 almond milk from soy or milk 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.090
 Normal that you like adds a 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.580
 spoonful of chía you leave it to soak 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.760
 until it absorbs the liquid about 15 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.280
 minutes and then you put it in the blender 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.280
 that shake you can add a little 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.150
 fresh fruit what combines best is the 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.380
 strawberry or banana for you is everything and 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.480
 you have a nutritious smoothie 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.550
 You can also make smoothies with 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.640
 other liquids such as carrot juice 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:41.970
 of celery and so on is good for 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.560
 any juice milk or milkshake 3 milled 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.810
 take the chia seeds and use 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.330
 your coffee grinder to grind 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.730
 which gives a fine texture and something 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.330
 caked and that's because the 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.070
 Chia flour is rich in fatty acids 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.150
 well, you can throw a flour 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.550
 little bit in yogurt 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.430
 sprinkle on the cereals on the 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.880
 salads add tofu to cheese 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.500
 cool in short what you most want and 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.600
 finally you can take it in jelly 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.150
 take half a cup of chia and 4 cups of 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.020
 water you put everything in a container that 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.820
 it's country and you keep it in the fridge 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.710
 medical the next day has been like 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.570
 a jelly that's because of the high 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.020
 Chia's ability to absorb water 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.080
 up to 10 times its weight said gelatin os 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.980
 natural several days if you are going to have to 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.740

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.620
 and you can use it in smoothies juices 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.680
 As you can see, these are four good 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.570
