make sure you use a lock tight okay
this<00:02:38.319> is<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.590> way<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.799> bracket<00:02:39.159> melts<00:02:40.260> okay

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
this is the way the bracket melts okay

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.470 
this is the way the bracket melts okay
if<00:02:41.379> you'll<00:02:41.530> notice<00:02:41.769> there's<00:02:42.730> two<00:02:43.090> sets<00:02:43.329> of

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
if you'll notice there's two sets of

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.479 
if you'll notice there's two sets of
holes<00:02:43.659> okay<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.799> would<00:02:45.010> be<00:02:45.160> for<00:02:45.459> the

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
holes okay this would be for the

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.500 
holes okay this would be for the
standard<00:02:46.359> size<00:02:46.769> stock<00:02:47.769> size<00:02:48.129> tire<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:49.390> this

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
standard size stock size tire and this

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.390 
standard size stock size tire and this
would<00:02:49.780> be<00:02:49.900> if<00:02:50.079> you<00:02:50.200> do<00:02:50.319> go<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.680> bigger<00:02:50.980> diameter

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
would be if you do go a bigger diameter

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.039 
would be if you do go a bigger diameter
vintage<00:02:52.060> tire<00:02:52.299> like<00:02:52.510> we<00:02:52.629> have<00:02:52.780> on<00:02:52.900> this

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
vintage tire like we have on this

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.890 
vintage tire like we have on this
motorcycle<00:02:53.349> so<00:02:54.340> we<00:02:54.459> have<00:02:54.609> two<00:02:54.849> sets<00:02:55.090> of<00:02:55.269> holes

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
motorcycle so we have two sets of holes

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.780 
motorcycle so we have two sets of holes
there<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.739> want<00:02:56.920> this<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.489> know<00:02:57.579> have

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
a decent amount of clearance there but

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.270 
a decent amount of clearance there but
you<00:02:59.319> don't<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.739> know<00:02:59.829> you<00:02:59.890> don't<00:03:00.010> want<00:03:00.159> to<00:03:00.220> be
