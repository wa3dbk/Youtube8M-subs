00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
show you today is a way of strumming

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.340 
show you today is a way of strumming
with<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:35.270> plectrum<00:00:35.510> which<00:00:35.930> will<00:00:36.079> make<00:00:36.230> your

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
with the plectrum which will make your

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.319 
with the plectrum which will make your
plane<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:36.859> much<00:00:37.070> more<00:00:37.309> interesting<00:00:37.969> because

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
plane so much more interesting because

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.810 
plane so much more interesting because
here's<00:00:38.750> the<00:00:38.930> thing<00:00:39.199> when<00:00:39.859> people<00:00:40.280> first<00:00:40.579> learn

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
here's the thing when people first learn

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.330 
here's the thing when people first learn
guitar<00:00:41.000> usually<00:00:41.570> they<00:00:42.350> just<00:00:42.379> strum<00:00:42.859> downwards

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
guitar usually they just strum downwards

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:53.840 
guitar usually they just strum downwards
with<00:00:43.519> the<00:00:43.609> plectrum<00:00:43.850> like<00:00:44.180> this

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.599 

and<00:00:54.480> that's<00:00:54.750> okay<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.350> after<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.649> while<00:00:55.890> you'll

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
and that's okay but after a while you'll

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:57.979 
and that's okay but after a while you'll
find<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.210> starts<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.629> sound<00:00:57.780> quite

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
find that that starts to sound quite

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.020 
find that that starts to sound quite
boring<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.769> what<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.190> want<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> give<00:00:59.910> you

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
boring so what I want to do is give you

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790 
boring so what I want to do is give you
a<00:01:00.089> more<00:01:00.359> interest<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:00.960> strumming<00:01:01.410> pattern

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
a more interest in strumming pattern

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.529 
a more interest in strumming pattern
that<00:01:01.980> will<00:01:02.070> make<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.519> sound<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.510> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that will make it sound of you know a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.719 
that will make it sound of you know a
lot<00:01:03.930> more<00:01:04.110> alive<00:01:04.440> and<00:01:04.830> also<00:01:05.430> I'm<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
lot more alive and also I'm going to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.859 
lot more alive and also I'm going to
show<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.940> a<00:01:05.970> new<00:01:06.210> chord

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
show you a new chord

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.649 
show you a new chord
today<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.440> G<00:01:07.920> chord<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.240> this

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
today it's the G chord and so this

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.830 
today it's the G chord and so this
strumming<00:01:10.110> pattern<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> Down<00:01:11.159> stroke<00:01:11.840> an

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
strumming pattern is a Down stroke an

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.910 
strumming pattern is a Down stroke an
upstroke<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:14.180> chop<00:01:15.180> I'll<00:01:16.140> explain<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.770> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
upstroke a chop I'll explain that in a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.700 
upstroke a chop I'll explain that in a
minute<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.399> an<00:01:17.700> upstroke<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:19.259> when<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.500> put

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
minute and an upstroke so when we put

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:35.080 
minute and an upstroke so when we put
that<00:01:19.860> together<00:01:20.039> it<00:01:20.399> sounds<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.759> this

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.539 

okay<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.049> you<00:01:36.229> can<00:01:36.409> see<00:01:36.649> that<00:01:36.859> it<00:01:37.009> gives<00:01:37.250> it<00:01:37.429> a

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
okay and you can see that it gives it a

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.760 
okay and you can see that it gives it a
more<00:01:37.729> interesting<00:01:38.179> sound<00:01:38.929> because<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.469> charm

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
more interesting sound because the charm

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.669 
more interesting sound because the charm
is<00:01:40.189> quite<00:01:40.820> percussive<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.689> to<00:01:41.990> me<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:42.350> sounds<00:01:42.619> a

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
is quite percussive it to me it sounds a

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:43.990 
is quite percussive it to me it sounds a
little<00:01:42.770> bit<00:01:43.009> like<00:01:43.159> a<00:01:43.189> drum<00:01:43.490> kit<00:01:43.729> when<00:01:43.909> the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
little bit like a drum kit when the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.480 
little bit like a drum kit when the
drummer<00:01:44.240> hits<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.689> snare<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.289> especially<00:01:46.250> if

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
drummer hits the snare and especially if

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.309 
drummer hits the snare and especially if
you're<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:46.969> sort<00:01:47.179> of<00:01:47.210> person<00:01:47.299> that<00:01:47.899> might<00:01:48.140> be

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
you're the sort of person that might be

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.499 
you're the sort of person that might be
you<00:01:48.560> know<00:01:48.590> busking<00:01:49.159> on<00:01:49.310> your<00:01:49.460> own<00:01:49.640> or<00:01:50.000> playing

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
you know busking on your own or playing

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.809 
you know busking on your own or playing
acoustic<00:01:51.079> guitar<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.979> it's<00:01:52.280> really<00:01:52.579> going<00:01:52.759> to

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
acoustic guitar and it's really going to

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.399 
acoustic guitar and it's really going to
be<00:01:52.880> useful<00:01:53.299> for<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.539> to<00:01:53.600> get<00:01:53.869> used<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.229> this

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
be useful for you to get used to this

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.109 
be useful for you to get used to this
strumming<00:01:54.770> pattern<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.610> will<00:01:55.729> make<00:01:56.000> your

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
strumming pattern and it will make your

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.660 
strumming pattern and it will make your
plane<00:01:56.360> sign<00:01:56.689> much<00:01:57.110> better<00:01:57.350> okay<00:01:58.219> so<00:01:58.280> let's

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
plane sign much better okay so let's

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.219 
plane sign much better okay so let's
begin<00:01:58.789> now<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.209> first<00:01:59.569> thing<00:01:59.750> I<00:01:59.840> want<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.049> show

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
and the little finger goes right next to

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.680 
and the little finger goes right next to
it<00:02:18.410> on<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.980> first<00:02:19.250> string<00:02:19.459> at<00:02:19.549> fret<00:02:19.579> three<00:02:20.030> so

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
it on the first string at fret three so

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.970 
it on the first string at fret three so
if<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.900> just<00:02:21.049> want<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.290> look<00:02:21.410> at<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.680> chord

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
if you just want to look at that chord

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.220 
if you just want to look at that chord
diagram<00:02:22.400> next<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.790> me<00:02:22.879> just<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.209> clarify<00:02:23.750> what

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
diagram next to me just to clarify what

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.869 
diagram next to me just to clarify what
those<00:02:24.440> notes<00:02:24.709> are<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.459> you're<00:02:25.579> going<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.730> use

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
those notes are and you're going to use

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.309 
those notes are and you're going to use
the<00:02:26.030> plectrum<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:26.569> strum<00:02:26.870> all<00:02:27.049> the<00:02:27.110> strings

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.199 

now<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:29.799> should<00:02:30.219> know<00:02:30.400> by<00:02:30.640> now<00:02:30.849> if<00:02:31.060> you

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
now you should know by now if you

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.580 
now you should know by now if you
remember<00:02:31.359> me<00:02:31.719> telling<00:02:31.900> you<00:02:32.109> in<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.379> last

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
remember me telling you in the last

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.559 
remember me telling you in the last
lesson<00:02:32.859> that<00:02:33.579> you<00:02:33.700> should<00:02:33.879> be<00:02:33.999> art<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.420> these

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
lesson that you should be art in these

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.270 
lesson that you should be art in these
fingers<00:02:35.019> up<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.439> there<00:02:35.560> should<00:02:35.739> be<00:02:35.769> plenty<00:02:36.040> of

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
fingers up and there should be plenty of

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.699 
fingers up and there should be plenty of
space<00:02:36.639> underneath<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.659> you<00:02:38.319> know<00:02:38.439> you<00:02:38.499> should

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
space underneath and you know you should

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:39.989 
space underneath and you know you should
be<00:02:38.739> holding<00:02:38.980> down<00:02:39.159> with<00:02:39.430> lots<00:02:39.579> of<00:02:39.700> pressure

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:39.999 
be holding down with lots of pressure

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.300 
be holding down with lots of pressure
and<00:02:40.359> the<00:02:40.749> back<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.200> finger<00:02:41.709> shouldn't<00:02:42.159> be

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
and the back of the finger shouldn't be

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.369 
and the back of the finger shouldn't be
accidentally<00:02:43.180> touching<00:02:43.749> the<00:02:43.900> string<00:02:44.200> behind

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
accidentally touching the string behind

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.860 
accidentally touching the string behind
it<00:02:44.829> so<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.370> when<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:45.849> strum<00:02:46.239> all<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.420> all

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
it so that when you strum all the all

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.910 
it so that when you strum all the all
the<00:02:47.049> notes<00:02:47.260> that<00:02:47.590> should<00:02:47.799> sound<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.069> this

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.150 

nice<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:51.940> clean<00:02:52.210> and<00:02:52.510> clear<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.800> if<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.010> need

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
nice and clean and clear so if you need

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.650 
nice and clean and clear so if you need
to<00:02:54.190> practice<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:54.700> for<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.060> second<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.630> know

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
to practice that for a second you know

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.449 
to practice that for a second you know
by<00:02:55.900> all<00:02:56.050> means<00:02:56.290> pause<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.830> video<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.430> just

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
by all means pause the video and just

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.070 
by all means pause the video and just
make<00:02:57.970> sure<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.240> got<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.510> right

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
make sure you got that right

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.800 
make sure you got that right
so<00:02:59.560> this<00:02:59.800> strumming<00:03:00.280> pattern<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:01.600> we're<00:03:01.720> going

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
so this strumming pattern so we're going

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.360 
so this strumming pattern so we're going
to<00:03:01.870> strum<00:03:02.140> downwards<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:04.000> then<00:03:04.450> upwards<00:03:05.370> and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
to strum downwards and then upwards and

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.580 
to strum downwards and then upwards and
then<00:03:06.520> we're<00:03:06.640> gonna<00:03:06.730> do<00:03:06.970> this<00:03:07.090> chop<00:03:07.480> right<00:03:08.350> so

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
then we're gonna do this chop right so

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.410 
then we're gonna do this chop right so
let<00:03:08.740> me<00:03:08.830> explain<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.280> now<00:03:09.700> now<00:03:10.120> what<00:03:10.300> the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
let me explain that now now what the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.780 
let me explain that now now what the
chop<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.200> we're<00:03:12.010> going<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.160> use<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.490> palm

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
chop is is we're going to use the palm

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.300 
chop is is we're going to use the palm
of<00:03:13.030> our<00:03:13.150> hand<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:14.020> touch<00:03:14.350> all<00:03:14.740> the<00:03:15.010> strings

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
of our hand to touch all the strings

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.449 
of our hand to touch all the strings
like<00:03:15.490> this<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:16.360> what<00:03:16.660> happens<00:03:17.080> is<00:03:17.290> our<00:03:18.100> hand

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
like this and what happens is our hand

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.460 
like this and what happens is our hand
comes<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:19.300> palm<00:03:19.540> touches<00:03:19.959> all<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.170> strings

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
comes the palm touches all the strings

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.920 
comes the palm touches all the strings
and<00:03:20.770> then<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.760> plectrum<00:03:22.000> follows<00:03:22.569> through

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
and then the plectrum follows through

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.810 
and then the plectrum follows through
but<00:03:23.260> because<00:03:23.890> we're<00:03:24.070> touching<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.489> strings

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
but because we're touching the strings

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.650 
but because we're touching the strings
all<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.239> notes<00:03:25.450> are<00:03:25.660> muted<00:03:26.430> like<00:03:27.430> that<00:03:27.660> now

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
all the notes are muted like that now

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.030 
all the notes are muted like that now
you<00:03:28.720> shouldn't<00:03:29.019> be<00:03:29.110> able<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.320> hear<00:03:29.560> any<00:03:29.739> notes

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
you shouldn't be able to hear any notes

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.759 
you shouldn't be able to hear any notes
at<00:03:30.280> all<00:03:30.459> if<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:30.820> can<00:03:30.970> hear<00:03:31.209> anything<00:03:31.769> like

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
at all if you can hear anything like

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.680 
at all if you can hear anything like
that<00:03:32.830> then<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.760> need<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.060> make<00:03:34.330> sure<00:03:34.390> you're

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
that then you need to make sure you're

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.330 
that then you need to make sure you're
holding<00:03:35.110> down<00:03:35.290> on<00:03:35.470> those<00:03:35.620> strings<00:03:36.010> with<00:03:36.190> more

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
holding down on those strings with more

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.759 
holding down on those strings with more
pressure<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:37.540> they<00:03:37.750> should<00:03:37.930> be<00:03:38.050> totally<00:03:38.530> dead

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
pressure and they should be totally dead

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.020 
pressure and they should be totally dead
so<00:03:41.769> that'll<00:03:42.130> take<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.340> little<00:03:42.519> bit<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.850> practice

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
so that'll take a little bit of practice

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.660 
so that'll take a little bit of practice
and<00:03:43.660> eventually<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.860> can<00:03:45.070> bring<00:03:45.280> your<00:03:45.430> hand

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
and eventually you can bring your hand

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.990 
and eventually you can bring your hand
down<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.739> chop<00:03:47.739> all<00:03:47.980> in<00:03:48.190> one<00:03:48.370> motion<00:03:48.610> like

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
down and chop all in one motion like

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.410 
down and chop all in one motion like
that<00:03:52.380> okay<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:53.890> just<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.370> clarify<00:03:54.580> I'll<00:03:55.209> tell

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
that okay so just to clarify I'll tell

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.180 
that okay so just to clarify I'll tell
you<00:03:55.510> again<00:03:55.750> make<00:03:56.079> sure<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.799> palm<00:03:57.010> of

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
you again make sure that the palm of

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.800 
you again make sure that the palm of
your<00:03:57.220> hand<00:03:57.489> is<00:03:57.670> laying<00:03:58.030> across<00:03:58.269> all<00:03:58.540> those

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
your hand is laying across all those

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.170 
your hand is laying across all those
strings<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.470> effectively<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.670> know<00:04:00.730> killing

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
strings and effectively you know killing

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.819 
strings and effectively you know killing
the<00:04:01.299> notes<00:04:01.620> okay<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:03.130> what<00:04:03.310> happens<00:04:03.670> is<00:04:04.829> you're

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
the notes okay so what happens is you're

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.470 
the notes okay so what happens is you're
gonna<00:04:05.920> practice<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:06.640> until<00:04:06.910> you<00:04:07.180> can<00:04:07.329> do<00:04:07.450> it

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
gonna practice it until you can do it

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.479 
gonna practice it until you can do it
like<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:07.870> nice<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.290> smoothly<00:04:08.620> all<00:04:09.070> in<00:04:09.340> one

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
like that nice and smoothly all in one

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.300 
like that nice and smoothly all in one
motion<00:04:13.140> okay<00:04:14.140> so<00:04:14.200> that's<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.709> Chop<00:04:14.980> that's

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
motion okay so that's the Chop that's

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.219 
motion okay so that's the Chop that's
how<00:04:15.430> it<00:04:15.579> works<00:04:15.820> so<00:04:16.180> when<00:04:16.630> we<00:04:16.750> put<00:04:16.930> that<00:04:17.079> into

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
how it works so when we put that into

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.780 
how it works so when we put that into
the<00:04:17.440> strumming<00:04:17.799> pattern<00:04:17.829> we're<00:04:18.519> gonna<00:04:18.609> go

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
the strumming pattern we're gonna go

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.670 
the strumming pattern we're gonna go
down

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:44.820 

chop<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:22.920> then<00:04:23.370> up<00:04:23.520> again<00:04:24.170> sound<00:04:25.170> like<00:04:25.320> this

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.670 

okay<00:04:45.730> now<00:04:46.150> it's<00:04:46.450> easier<00:04:46.840> said<00:04:47.080> than<00:04:47.230> done<00:04:47.290> I

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
okay now it's easier said than done I

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.410 
okay now it's easier said than done I
expect<00:04:47.920> that<00:04:48.610> will<00:04:48.730> take<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.000> quite<00:04:49.150> a<00:04:49.210> bit<00:04:49.270> of

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
expect that will take you quite a bit of

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.480 
expect that will take you quite a bit of
time<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:49.840> practice<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.470> I<00:04:50.680> mean<00:04:51.040> I<00:04:51.160> know<00:04:51.250> it

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
time to practice that I mean I know it

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.130 
time to practice that I mean I know it
takes<00:04:51.700> my<00:04:51.880> students<00:04:52.330> quite<00:04:52.540> a<00:04:52.570> while<00:04:52.840> before

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
takes my students quite a while before

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.690 
takes my students quite a while before
they<00:04:53.440> really<00:04:53.800> get<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.070> hang<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.340> it

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
they really get the hang of it

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.250 
they really get the hang of it
so<00:04:54.910> that's<00:04:55.120> brilliant<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:55.660> go<00:04:55.810> easy<00:04:55.840> on

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
so that's brilliant so go easy on

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.750 
so that's brilliant so go easy on
yourself<00:04:56.680> that<00:04:56.890> you<00:04:57.010> know<00:04:57.130> don't<00:04:57.400> don't<00:04:57.580> give

yourself any pressure to be able to play

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.530 
yourself any pressure to be able to play
that<00:04:59.560> straight<00:04:59.920> away<00:05:00.070> be<00:05:00.970> patient<00:05:01.420> with

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
that straight away be patient with

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.270 
that straight away be patient with
yourself<00:05:01.630> stop<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.350> video<00:05:02.620> in<00:05:02.860> fact<00:05:03.100> watch

yourself stop the video in fact watch

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.070 
yourself stop the video in fact watch
the<00:05:03.460> video<00:05:03.700> several<00:05:04.030> times<00:05:04.180> if<00:05:04.600> you<00:05:04.690> need<00:05:04.900> to

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
the video several times if you need to

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.910
