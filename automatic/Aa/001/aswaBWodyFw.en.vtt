00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 something happened over time something 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.980
 truly scary 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.230
 and it was that some of them went back to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.360
 use anabolic steroids in a few 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.360
 weeks that we buried taylor 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.820
 the temptation to use steroids seemed 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.250
 be stronger than the risks 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.260
 perceived but that could make a 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.360
 normal teenager will take his life 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.130
 the answer lies in the depths 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.200
 of the brain when you take steroids the 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.720
 hypothalamus in your brain of all this 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.640
 charge coming from outside and then 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.160
 send a message to the testicles 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.320
 saying we have enough 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.120
 steroids on board do not manufacture more 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.489
 we have a large supply 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.500
 overwhelmed the testicles stop 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.230
 work and what is known is produced 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.390
 as hypogonadism taylor stopped taking 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.519
 steroids from one moment to another which 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.760
 he left him low on testosterone and running 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.040
 a very high risk go into deep 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.409
 depressions and during that period when 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.699
 your testosterone level cesc low before 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.060
 of the testes returning to 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.740
 become active they become suicidal in a 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.320
 survey about adults who used 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.840
 steroids 4% attempted suicide 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.090
 during abstinence 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.350
 with this ball he scored his first homer 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.729
 of June 16, 2001 and the reason why 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.610
 which is important is that it was his 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.830
 first homer and Alavés the last 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.690
 was to look for it in the brush when the 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.100
 batting as any father would and 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.100
 when his son scores his first homer 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.690
 don ottón now runs a foundation with 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.030
 the name of taylor to protect 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.460
 other teens steroids in 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.650
 the year 2007 texas passed the law of 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.600
 taylor the surveillance program against 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.910
 Larger steroids for athletes 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.860
 of baccalaureate but nowadays many 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.840
 Steroid users use 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.060
 creams so their detection is more 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.980
 difficult is this why people from 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.070
 all ages are swelling the 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.180
 rows of steroid users 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.680
 currently the fastest group 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.150
 growth of consumers of 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.280
 steroids is not the students' 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.490
 of high school or that of the athletes 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.490
 professionals 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.300
 the stereotypical perception is that there 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.550
 they are grotesque giants with a syringe 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.420
 stuck in the forehead they're going to come to 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:24.020
 eating the children of others is like that 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.580
 as people see it is their perception the 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.320
 reality is that within the population 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.959
 there are millions of people who 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.550
 they use steroids and nobody notices it and 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.580
 they look like ordinary people and 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.580
 currents 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.230
 it is estimated that more than 50 percent of 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.270
 all steroid consumers do not 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.010
 they are athletes of any kind but 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.220
 people who resort to steroids 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.840
 to look better holy god we live in 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.610
 a generation of young people who are 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.710
 they brainwashed and they just want to have 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.000
 a sculptural body is a generation 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.870
 that the only thing he knows is the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.870
 immediate gratification 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.040
 and things are getting worse 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.710
 and yulo if you watch the dolls of the 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.960
 70 years you will notice that they look like subjects 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.940
 perfectly normal but if you see the 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.980
 same toys of the same figures 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.140
 that went on the market in the 90s 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.140
 you'll see that it looks like they took steroids 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.400
 in the year 1964 a very popular doll 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.969
 had the equivalent of a bicep 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.599
 32.2 centimeters for 1991 was 41 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:33.450
 centimeters in the mid-90s were 69 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.480
 centimeters by definition are models 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.430
 completely steroidal 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.829

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.659
 Dr. Harrison Pop is one of the most 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.640
 important medical experts in the 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.620
 male obsession with the body follows 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.189
 the trace to steroid users 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.349
 two decades ago I was surprised that a 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:55.530
 a large number of them had what I call 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.450
 or reverse anorexia nervosa is vigorexia 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.140
 they look in the mirror and they look small even 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.350
 when they are big and muscular 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.510
 [Music] 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.580
 the pop doctor estimates that the vigorexia 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.140
 affects 2 percent of all 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.150
 men but among bodybuilders 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.040
 the figure is almost 10% 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.940
 anabolic steroids feed the 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.220
 ego make us powerful important 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.430
 you live your life through the ego and you wait 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.230
 get that response from the people you 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.750
 you usually enter any place and 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.000
 that people look at you, you get used to 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.630
 enter the restaurants to go to the 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.830
 beach and that everyone is surprised you 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.510
 you get used to that 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.820
 nowadays the world of 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.040
 Elite bodybuilders favor the 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.750
 volume above beauty a 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.840
 biased product view of 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.460
 steroids for them it's hard to win 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.980
 in the steroid contest and the 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.350
 bodybuilding 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.120

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.970
