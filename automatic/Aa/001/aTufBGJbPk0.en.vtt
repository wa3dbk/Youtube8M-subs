we have on loan from chill blast as you
can<00:00:18.090> see<00:00:18.240> here<00:00:18.480> we're<00:00:18.630> actually<00:00:18.720> running

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
can see here we're actually running

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.950 
can see here we're actually running
pretty<00:00:19.320> high<00:00:19.619> settings<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.689> basically<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
pretty high settings it's basically the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.839 
pretty high settings it's basically the
high<00:00:22.260> preset<00:00:22.980> at<00:00:23.279> 1080p<00:00:24.470> and<00:00:25.849> the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
high preset at 1080p and the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.330 
high preset at 1080p and the
anti-aliasing<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.289> turned<00:00:28.619> down<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.160> just

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
anti-aliasing on but turned down to just

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.640 
anti-aliasing on but turned down to just
two<00:00:29.609> times<00:00:29.970> as<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.660> think<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.080> was<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.320> eight

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
two times as I think it was on eight

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.209 
two times as I think it was on eight
times<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.099> eight<00:00:32.219> times<00:00:32.460> anisotropy<00:00:34.219> by

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
times and eight times anisotropy by

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.010 
times and eight times anisotropy by
default<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.090> tweaked<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.630> down<00:00:36.809> very

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
default so I was tweaked that down very

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.200 
default so I was tweaked that down very
slightly<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.649> still<00:00:37.890> pretty<00:00:38.250> high<00:00:38.579> settings

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
slightly but still pretty high settings

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.040 
slightly but still pretty high settings
for<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.170> kind<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.590> game<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.540> what<00:00:42.930> is

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
for this kind of game and on what is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.630 
for this kind of game and on what is
essentially<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.649> integrated<00:00:44.460> graphics

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
essentially a integrated graphics

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.209 
essentially a integrated graphics
solution<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.719> things<00:00:46.350> from<00:00:46.590> pretty<00:00:46.890> well

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
solution and things from pretty well

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.779 
solution and things from pretty well
we're<00:00:47.640> seeing<00:00:47.850> frame<00:00:48.210> rates<00:00:48.480> typically<00:00:49.789> over

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
we're seeing frame rates typically over

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.189 
we're seeing frame rates typically over
30<00:00:51.180> frames<00:00:51.480> per<00:00:51.629> second<00:00:52.079> higher<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.340> places

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
30 frames per second higher in places

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.439 
30 frames per second higher in places
and<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.129> nice<00:00:56.309> level<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.789> detail<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
and it's a nice level of detail for the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.840 
and it's a nice level of detail for the
game<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:57.840> well<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.440> runs<00:00:58.739> quite<00:00:59.070> acceptable<00:00:59.820> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
game as well it runs quite acceptable I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.939 
game as well it runs quite acceptable I
was<00:01:00.120> able<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.449> play<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> little<00:01:01.559> bit<00:01:01.710> without

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
was able to play a little bit without

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.800 
was able to play a little bit without
any<00:01:02.280> real<00:01:02.489> issues<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.589> so<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.129> seems<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
any real issues and so it's it seems a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.690 
any real issues and so it's it seems a
success<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:07.049> iris<00:01:07.710> Pro<00:01:07.950> 6<00:01:08.250> 200<00:01:10.580> obviously<00:01:11.580> if

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
success on iris Pro 6 200 obviously if

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.700 
success on iris Pro 6 200 obviously if
you<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.090> want<00:01:12.390> sort<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.810> higher<00:01:13.020> frame<00:01:13.409> rates

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
you do want sort of higher frame rates

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.410 
you do want sort of higher frame rates
then<00:01:14.100> you've<00:01:14.280> got<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> option<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.970> dropping

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
then you've got the option of dropping

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.630 
then you've got the option of dropping
first<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.380> I'd<00:01:16.530> start<00:01:16.830> by<00:01:16.890> turning<00:01:17.340> off

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
first of all I'd start by turning off

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.870 
first of all I'd start by turning off
anti-aliasing<00:01:18.479> completely<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:20.400> probably

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
anti-aliasing completely and probably

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
anti-aliasing completely and probably
then<00:01:21.060> dropping<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.689> resolution<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.560> little<00:01:22.590> as

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
then dropping the resolution a little as

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.830 
then dropping the resolution a little as
well<00:01:24.770> but<00:01:25.770> yeah<00:01:26.159> if<00:01:26.790> you're<00:01:27.210> happy<00:01:27.570> sort<00:01:27.750> of

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
well but yeah if you're happy sort of

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.510 
well but yeah if you're happy sort of
playing<00:01:28.049> around<00:01:28.229> 30<00:01:28.560> frames<00:01:28.860> per<00:01:28.890> second<00:01:29.280> mark

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
playing around 30 frames per second mark

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.920 
playing around 30 frames per second mark
then<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.030> should<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.329> able<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.689> very

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
then you should be able to have a very

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.260 
then you should be able to have a very
nice-looking<00:01:31.290> game<00:01:31.920> or<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.909> drop<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
nice-looking game or you can drop the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.580 
nice-looking game or you can drop the
detail<00:01:33.829> settings<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.549> suit<00:01:36.140> your<00:01:37.140> tastes

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
detail settings to suit your tastes

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.130 
detail settings to suit your tastes
really<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.450> hope<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.509> found<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.930> video
