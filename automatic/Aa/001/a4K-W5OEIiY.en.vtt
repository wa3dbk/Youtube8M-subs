slightly different we've added one or

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.530 
slightly different we've added one or
two<00:01:26.310> questions<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.090> try<00:01:27.240> make<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
two questions just to try make it a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.719
