khandoba better now walk stay green

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.190 
khandoba better now walk stay green
that's<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:49.730> judgin<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:50.480> that's<00:01:50.750> pretty<00:01:50.990> neat

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
that's so judgin so that's pretty neat

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.720 
that's so judgin so that's pretty neat
that<00:01:51.350> he<00:01:51.440> should<00:01:51.590> have<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:51.980> color<00:01:52.190> swap<00:01:52.550> on

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
that he should have that color swap on

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.370 
that he should have that color swap on
that<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.030> it's<00:01:53.150> really<00:01:53.660> smell<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.110> tracker

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
that so it's really smell the tracker

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.280 
that so it's really smell the tracker
ratchet<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:56.030> if<00:01:56.570> they<00:01:56.690> were<00:01:56.870> to<00:01:56.990> repeat

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
ratchet and if they were to repeat

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.530 
ratchet and if they were to repeat
repaid<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.070> wager<00:01:58.520> like<00:01:58.670> this<00:01:58.910> I<00:01:59.120> would<00:01:59.360> buy

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
repaid the wager like this I would buy

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.470 
repaid the wager like this I would buy
it<00:02:00.310> but<00:02:01.310> then<00:02:01.520> again<00:02:01.640> I<00:02:01.850> think<00:02:01.910> that<00:02:02.090> molds

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
it but then again I think that molds

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.180 
it but then again I think that molds
gonna<00:02:02.660> be<00:02:02.810> used<00:02:03.290> too<00:02:03.500> many<00:02:03.620> times<00:02:03.920> with<00:02:04.100> the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
gonna be used too many times with the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.640 
gonna be used too many times with the
Human<00:02:04.490> Alliance<00:02:04.580> ratchet<00:02:05.270> if<00:02:05.990> that<00:02:06.230> it's

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
Human Alliance ratchet if that it's

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.610 
Human Alliance ratchet if that it's
gonna<00:02:06.800> come<00:02:07.040> out<00:02:07.750> anyway<00:02:08.750> here's<00:02:10.569> Megatron<00:02:11.620> he

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
gonna come out anyway here's Megatron he

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.950 
gonna come out anyway here's Megatron he
is<00:02:12.800> different

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.250 

she<00:02:17.960> lost<00:02:18.170> about<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:20.390> these<00:02:20.510> do<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.810> ratchets

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
she lost about so these do the ratchets

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.440 
she lost about so these do the ratchets
is<00:02:21.440> just<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.770> swap<00:02:22.340> color<00:02:22.610> scheme<00:02:22.940> like<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.240> said

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
is just a swap color scheme like I said

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.090 
is just a swap color scheme like I said
before<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:23.959> here's<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.230> Megatron's<00:02:24.800> uh

somewhere<00:05:30.800> I<00:05:30.830> learned<00:05:31.220> I<00:05:31.490> think<00:05:31.729> it's<00:05:32.560> it's

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
somewhere I learned I think it's it's

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.700 
somewhere I learned I think it's it's
Ironhide<00:05:34.460> and<00:05:34.849> Starscream<00:05:35.570> I<00:05:36.080> think<00:05:36.440> is<00:05:36.530> the

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
Ironhide and Starscream I think is the

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.950 
Ironhide and Starscream I think is the
next<00:05:36.830> one<00:05:37.099> number<00:05:37.520> seven<00:05:38.240> but<00:05:38.599> my<00:05:38.720> shirt

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
next one number seven but my shirt

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.529 
next one number seven but my shirt

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
chamber games overall the RPMs are

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:42.879 
chamber games overall the RPMs are
really<00:05:41.810> fun<00:05:42.080> and<00:05:42.259> really<00:05:42.380> cool<00:05:42.680> especially

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
really fun and really cool especially

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.980 
really fun and really cool especially
with<00:05:43.219> the<00:05:43.310> Devastator<00:05:43.759> track<00:05:44.060> set<00:05:44.330> which

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
with the Devastator track set which

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.110 
with the Devastator track set which
unfortunately<00:05:45.380> probably<00:05:45.949> all<00:05:46.430> four<00:05:46.969> of<00:05:47.000> these

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
unfortunately probably all four of these

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.600 
unfortunately probably all four of these
won't<00:05:47.330> be<00:05:47.449> able<00:05:47.659> to<00:05:47.750> be<00:05:47.840> work<00:05:48.050> with<00:05:48.289> I<00:05:48.610> will

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
won't be able to be work with I will

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.909 
won't be able to be work with I will
eventually<00:05:49.880> hopefully<00:05:50.419> probably<00:05:51.409> most

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
eventually hopefully probably most

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.499 
eventually hopefully probably most
likely<00:05:52.130> will<00:05:52.490> get<00:05:52.639> the<00:05:52.820> Devastator<00:05:53.270> track

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:53.509 
likely will get the Devastator track

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.490 
likely will get the Devastator track
sets<00:05:53.860> and<00:05:54.860> one<00:05:55.039> idea<00:05:55.159> I<00:05:55.400> will<00:05:55.669> review<00:05:56.000> that

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
sets and one idea I will review that

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.930 
sets and one idea I will review that
most<00:05:57.500> likely<00:05:58.210> somewhere<00:05:59.210> where<00:05:59.419> I<00:05:59.449> have<00:05:59.539> room

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
most likely somewhere where I have room

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:26.360 
most likely somewhere where I have room
anyway<00:06:01.940> so<00:06:02.210> much<00:06:02.389> time<00:06:02.599> sad<00:06:03.080> saying<00:06:03.380> goodbye
