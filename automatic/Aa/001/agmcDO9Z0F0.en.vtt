when I took it out of the case and I

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.620 
when I took it out of the case and I
tried<00:04:07.480> to<00:04:07.720> adjust<00:04:08.019> it<00:04:08.880> because<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.060> action

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
tried to adjust it because the action

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.680 
tried to adjust it because the action
was<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:12.040> action<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.430> his<00:04:12.640> is<00:04:12.790> quite<00:04:13.000> high<00:04:13.150> and

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
was the action and his is quite high and

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.229 
was the action and his is quite high and
that's<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.079> same<00:04:14.260> as<00:04:14.410> my<00:04:14.590> one<00:04:14.829> and<00:04:15.040> so<00:04:15.910> I<00:04:15.940> tried

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
that's the same as my one and so I tried

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.300 
that's the same as my one and so I tried
to<00:04:16.269> adjust<00:04:16.660> it<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.079> I<00:04:17.410> basically<00:04:18.130> it

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
to adjust it and I basically it

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.949 
to adjust it and I basically it
out<00:04:18.430> I've<00:04:18.970> never<00:04:19.120> loved<00:04:19.329> it<00:04:19.510> so<00:04:19.630> I'm<00:04:19.750> gonna

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
out I've never loved it so I'm gonna

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.420 
out I've never loved it so I'm gonna
sort<00:04:20.200> it<00:04:20.829> out<00:04:20.979> but<00:04:21.729> for<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.390> money<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:23.010> think<00:04:24.010> we

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
sort it out but for the money I think we

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.969 
sort it out but for the money I think we
paid<00:04:24.700> 240<00:04:25.660> pounds<00:04:26.200> which<00:04:26.380> was<00:04:26.590> like<00:04:26.740> three

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
paid 240 pounds which was like three

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.290 
paid 240 pounds which was like three
hundred<00:04:27.039> forty<00:04:27.490> dollars<00:04:27.520> are<00:04:27.910> sort<00:04:28.060> of<00:04:28.120> that

hundred forty dollars are sort of that

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.659 
hundred forty dollars are sort of that
it<00:04:29.020> is<00:04:29.229> definitely<00:04:29.919> worth<00:04:30.100> it<00:04:30.340> if<00:04:30.460> you're
