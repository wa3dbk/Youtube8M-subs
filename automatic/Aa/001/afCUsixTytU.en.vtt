00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.290
 the little note we made on 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.410

 rectors files to retrieve them to 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.460
 the internet and has no intermediary for 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.920
 anyway know it plays with the feet 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:32.730
 when you want 1 2 but now a 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.910
 hard drive to tidy them up so 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.550
 it's a movie or 6 7 1 6 and a series 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.350
 by the user zada a soft app that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.629
 is called caillebotte who will us 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.710
 to identify sites a movie 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:51.020

 poz filming where you need it 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.809
 all this in automatic 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.790
 so let's see also the little perished sentence 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.159
 here an exploit of bell fido 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:13.290
 then the trendy russia yes the little 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:17.100
 hard drive to push night one that is 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.380
 powered live the little wifi dongle 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.380
 leave here for internet connection 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.460
 when I put myself on it acts for me 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.720
 because I have no snow usb port 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.790
 not what is more needed of 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.920
 feed it angers country or for 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.650
 power the hard drive because it is 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.360
 much more lenient consume both at 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.820
 level of the pi 2 the courage to me 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.090
 connect on the small amp leaves here 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.799
 who was the time we see and who makes 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.299
 committee of spin - offs on television 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.329
 ok so we wanted to show us a little 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.479
 little will the solution look like 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.299
 so for that we'll do a little 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.060
 demonstration then of course 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.230
 the environment it's a bit more 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.520
 I will power small acts 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.740
 some ordered we had that 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.920
 sarah some projects in go what 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.500
 can pilot diploma is al hawa 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.120
 which is a protocol is nice since 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.920
 so nice for the time at home and me 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.570
 leave a little high caliber and because 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.240
 that he says worries but it deserves your 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.700
 attention I think and it will attract 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.290
 your attention I also think 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:37.570
 so here we are going to start a jarvis is 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.380
 on TV she actually has there I 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.920
 commanded to voice to show how 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.360
 How's it going 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.660
 you see all the equipment on the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.180
 case of a single blow to the voice because 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.830
 the hdmi-cec protocol turn and all 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.050
 the facilities that are here are 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.630
 reproductions are compatible hdmi sex 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.640
 which allows to pass a signal 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.740
 feed order feeding 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.709
 via a device to all 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.330
 devices and use only one 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.410
 only tele columns if necessary to 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:13.269
 piloted for example the media center 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.950
 jarvis turns on the TV is the beta of 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.500
 he does not recognize what it is 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.370
 said lack of courage but all that 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.810
 turns very well if not gervis but the 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.810
 next episode of breaking bad 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.390
 jarvis but the next episode of 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.800
 breaking Bad 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.160
 then there he will start reading iso 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.680
 press of the season since we are at the 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.150
 database here that my episode that 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:47.680
 I did not see but the following one 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:49.989
 episode 13 jarvis stops the movie that 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.080
 so lets actually if we go there 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.910
 need will be seen when it is hot it in 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.010
 jarvis went to connect he knows 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.660
 she sells to her children 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.820
 only 13 indicates april next 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.239
 episode 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.350
 it's a nice little pleasure to 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:09.260
 additional compared to others 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.480
 another shot says another little ryder 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.070
 and then then to show you this is the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.239
 pressure to mediate is so 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:20.120
 classic with the small remote control 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.709
 television since your TV have little 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.820
 of chances she fights tiger line 7 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.350
 it will allow you to increase the volume of 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.920
 drop for furniture at that time that 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:40.240
 Volume 2 of the amp and vice versa 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:44.240
 hop I have a little thing that will not go here 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.470
 as much for me as that I can show 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:52.180
 that indeed is the volume too 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.710
 crazy still not the same remote 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.850
 power launched the movies of 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.170
 thousands to have small enrollers 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.840
 crazy watch the trailer 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.390
 and if I want to go there I the options 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.500
 I have a little description can summarize there 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.190
 where I was the end of tour 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:12.470
 England marks as being due or 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.790
 to have information here is I can 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.960
 watch the trailer if he goes to discuss it 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.700
 because the theaters youtube 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.570
