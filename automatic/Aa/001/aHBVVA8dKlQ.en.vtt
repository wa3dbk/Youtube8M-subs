00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.410 
even despair orsa if I'd had a gun right
here<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:14.250> would<00:02:15.250> have<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.489> brought<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:15.970> up<00:02:16.120> one

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
here I would have just brought it up one

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.740 
here I would have just brought it up one
smooth<00:02:16.780> movement<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:18.940> like<00:02:19.060> linen<00:02:19.420> oh<00:02:19.540> they

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
smooth movement just like linen oh they

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.630 
smooth movement just like linen oh they
have<00:02:19.840> French<00:02:20.140> crust<00:02:20.470> pizza<00:02:20.680> doot-doot

have French crust pizza doot-doot

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.350
