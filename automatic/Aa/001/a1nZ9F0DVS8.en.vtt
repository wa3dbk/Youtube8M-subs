00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.580
 robert pirès hello hello without humor it makes robert pirès can 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.759
 to say that she is a beautiful woman 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.970
 actually percent what could be our concern in asia we are my 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.980
 woman and my children it's true that m 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.650
 since% and quite a while we come here to Mauritius and every time 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.509
 it's always the same 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.509
 that is, we are always well received and with a smile 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.550
 actually I have 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.800
 but what's the q2 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.050
 in e robert pires right now 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.680
 current and 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.920
 family is very simple to 1 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.030
 like everyone else this is my approach very slowly from the cup of 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.770
 world 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.820
 I work for a chain called sports lab 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.630
 a leap in a few days 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.530
 I will fly to the side 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.890
 from doha to participate in a show every night a daily 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.200
 then the software is with arsenal as an ambassador the same thing with 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.680
 uefa 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.159
 so that means I play 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.360
 to say to oneself I travel a lot forgiveness 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.190
 but we are always a bit curious to know what makes a sportsman 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.730
 high level gold when he stops 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.520
 match after you know that it depends on 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.650
 of the direction and direction one wants to take intense who 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.820
 regards me one I have this chance to have always had good reports 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.690
 with them 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.170
 with journalists with the press 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.939
 today I have not if I went through the om on the other side of the 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.080
 fence 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.690
 That's why I work for a TV channel 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.600
 after I try to give a good analysis of the players' game of what is 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.310
 past 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.680
 for this precisely on the field and sintis little my conversion for 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.130
 the moment 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.460
 I will not complain 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.200
 everything goes well and again I kept very good 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.780
 relations with arsenal 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.780
 especially with arsenal wenger have that that's all 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.180
 and we heard about india if for you with an exotic destination 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.230
 a bit like alaska man left australia themselves 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.720
 it's true that william hill took the direction of australia's rent 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.359
 which concerns me m for the moment 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.749
 I'm heading straight towards a towards India specially glass curved 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:20.739
 so it's true it's exotic% with respect 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.699
 in my job that's what I know it's balloon 2006 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:29.909
 1 financially it's true it's also for this very interesting but for his 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.549
 any case regarding adventure in india 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.859
 aa i will be very proud to be the first french to play on the 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.140
 Indian territory agree 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.730
 to educate you a bit about Indian culture you watch movies 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.479
 bollywood shah rukh khan for example 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.859
 not yet but percent and I got a little bit of information and that's 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.749
 true that the movies there 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:52.269
 we will have great success with regard to bollywood backbone say 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.170
 % and it's true that I will have time to m 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.050
 you saw born 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.159
 I will have the time to always wait but this time 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.579
 to food it's true that I really like what the people can do 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.869
 indian even though it's sometimes a little 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:07.349
 and then these grocers 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.849
 but percent again I was playing by the discovery of new paid a 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.300
 new people of a new culture so bring them my experience my 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.989
 lived with regard to football 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.649
 and then I'm sure it will be a beautiful 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:21.999
 beautiful adventure 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.279
 at the world cup in Brazil cost for the 11 billion euros 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:29.059
 does% a possible victory of brazil are worth as much investment 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.169
 this compared to what is happening now for months when we 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.669
 knows a little bit of the blow 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.789
 afp 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:40.699
 the couple comes back to Brazil to organize 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.309
 I want to say no with a plan because we see people in 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:48.409
 difficulty for those who do not have security who are talking about structures 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.579
 for health 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.069
 apparently no structure for schools 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.899
 so one percent a win could allow the yes to the brazilian people of 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:59.649
 find a little more 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:02.739
 the smile but in any case regarding the debt 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.739
 it is true that with difficult to manage for the brazilians 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.709
 and we go there you can arsenal 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.709
 what do you think of the galley team currently 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.389
 I will be honest with you is that 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.289
 today we can make a balance sheet 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.609
 of the arsenal season and the people released for me the good ones 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:25.509
 good on two criteria because already they won the classic 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.379
 1 it was 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:31.050
 that the club did not win any trophy 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.240
 so that's already a great relief for arsene wenger and the 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.960
 second goal is achieved 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.229
 to play the champions league again 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.919
 % next year not that o'globo german I think it's a beautiful 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.240
 season for 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.039
 for arsenal waiting for me to see what will happen a little bit in the offseason 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.440
 and I hope for the 2014 2015 season 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.190
 that the goal is to win the championship
