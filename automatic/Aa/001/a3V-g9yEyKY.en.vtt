exactly<00:01:36.840> where<00:01:37.409> he's<00:01:37.530> located<00:01:37.920> now<00:01:38.549> as<00:01:38.670> far<00:01:38.790> as

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
exactly where he's located now as far as

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.910 
exactly where he's located now as far as
I<00:01:38.970> know<00:01:39.030> his<00:01:39.420> path<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> same<00:01:40.380> every<00:01:40.710> time<00:01:40.740> I

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
I know his path is the same every time I

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.399 
I know his path is the same every time I
could<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.579> wrong<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.810> take<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.170> path

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
could be wrong so you can take this path

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.950 
could be wrong so you can take this path
I'm<00:01:43.680> taking<00:01:44.100> if<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.659> once<00:01:45.810> we

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
I'm taking if you like and then once we

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.899 
I'm taking if you like and then once we
kill<00:01:46.170> everyone<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.829> need<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.159> take<00:01:47.369> him<00:01:47.640> out

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
kill everyone we need to take him out

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.630 
kill everyone we need to take him out
without<00:01:48.210> him<00:01:48.810> spotting<00:01:49.380> us<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.460> be

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
without him spotting us and that can be

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.520 
without him spotting us and that can be
a<00:01:50.670> little<00:01:51.000> tricky<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.540> trophy<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.899> not<00:01:52.110> hard

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
a little tricky this trophy is not hard

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.770 
a little tricky this trophy is not hard
it<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.729> be<00:01:53.850> frustrating<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:54.659> you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
it you can just be frustrating if you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.679 
it you can just be frustrating if you
don't<00:01:54.990> know<00:01:55.140> what<00:01:55.320> you're<00:01:55.470> doing<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:57.360> well<00:01:57.659> so

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
don't know what you're doing so well so

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.990 
don't know what you're doing so well so
I<00:01:57.899> would<00:01:58.110> think<00:01:58.159> everybody<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.430> dead<00:01:59.729> known

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
I would think everybody is dead known

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.459 
I would think everybody is dead known
just<00:02:00.360> trying<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.659> find<00:02:00.869> them<00:02:01.020> he's<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:01.320> there

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
just trying to find them he's up there

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.530 
just trying to find them he's up there
in<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.649> top<00:02:01.860> left<00:02:02.130> corner<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.820> now<00:02:02.969> we<00:02:03.030> need<00:02:03.299> to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
in the top left corner so now we need to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.870 
in the top left corner so now we need to
essentially<00:02:04.409> meet<00:02:04.680> him<00:02:04.799> around<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.219> corner<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
essentially meet him around a corner and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.240 
essentially meet him around a corner and
take<00:02:06.780> him<00:02:06.930> out<00:02:07.079> as<00:02:07.290> he's<00:02:07.530> coming<00:02:07.860> around<00:02:07.950> a

take him out as he's coming around a

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.790 
take him out as he's coming around a

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
along the side of the building you don't

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.260 
along the side of the building you don't
want<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.230> do<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.830> along<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.190> wall<00:02:16.760> there<00:02:17.090> you

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
want to do it along that wall there you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.300 
want to do it along that wall there you
want<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.540> make<00:02:17.600> sure<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.170> there's<00:02:18.440> no<00:02:18.680> spaces

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
want to make sure that there's no spaces

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.090 
want to make sure that there's no spaces
between<00:02:19.460> his<00:02:20.330> path<00:02:20.690> in<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.170> wall<00:02:21.410> as<00:02:21.710> well<00:02:22.040> as

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
between his path in the wall as well as

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.790 
between his path in the wall as well as
yours<00:02:22.490> so<00:02:23.240> you<00:02:23.300> see<00:02:23.600> there's<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:23.900> there's<00:02:24.560> he's

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
yours so you see there's a there's he's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.770 
yours so you see there's a there's he's
two<00:02:25.040> spaces<00:02:25.400> away<00:02:25.700> from<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:26.210> actual<00:02:26.540> wall

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
two spaces away from the actual wall

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.070 
two spaces away from the actual wall
there's<00:02:27.740> a<00:02:27.830> gap<00:02:28.130> there<00:02:28.460> and<00:02:28.670> that's<00:02:29.570> not<00:02:29.750> good

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
there's a gap there and that's not good

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.600 
there's a gap there and that's not good
because<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.410> means<00:02:30.620> when<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:30.980> approach<00:02:31.370> him

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
because that means when you approach him

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.500 
because that means when you approach him
to<00:02:32.090> melee<00:02:32.840> him<00:02:33.110> he's<00:02:33.590> going<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.090> possibly<00:02:35.090> see

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
to melee him he's going to possibly see

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.480 
to melee him he's going to possibly see
you<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.230> all<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.530> need<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.710> do<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.040> just<00:02:37.220> wait
