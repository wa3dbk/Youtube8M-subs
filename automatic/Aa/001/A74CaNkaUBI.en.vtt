00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.720 
really nice with this bright and shiny
display<00:04:11.340> but<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.359> bad<00:04:12.540> part<00:04:12.569> is<00:04:12.959> it<00:04:13.680> sure<00:04:14.549> as

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
display but the bad part is it sure as

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.089 
display but the bad part is it sure as
hell<00:04:15.500> gonna<00:04:16.500> get<00:04:16.799> scratched<00:04:17.220> up<00:04:17.489> and

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
hell gonna get scratched up and

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.640 
hell gonna get scratched up and
fingerprints<00:04:20.099> all<00:04:20.250> over<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.669> so<00:04:21.470> that's<00:04:22.470> the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
fingerprints all over it so that's the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.409 
fingerprints all over it so that's the
bad<00:04:22.800> part<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:23.340> think<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.849> would<00:04:23.970> get<00:04:24.120> the

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
bad part so I think I would get the
