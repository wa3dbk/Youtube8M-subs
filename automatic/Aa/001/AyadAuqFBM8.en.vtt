00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
this is the bleed valve and I've

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.890 
this is the bleed valve and I've
loosened<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> little<00:00:22.920> bit<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.900> connected

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
loosened it a little bit and connected

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.589 
loosened it a little bit and connected
this<00:00:24.990> tube<00:00:25.970> which<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.179> now<00:00:27.710> running<00:00:29.330> all<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
this tube which is now running all the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:49.750 
this tube which is now running all the
way<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:45.920> it's<00:00:46.920> connected<00:00:47.460> there<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.530> brake

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
way to it's connected there to the brake

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.200 
way to it's connected there to the brake
bleed<00:00:50.760> valve<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:55.190> we've<00:00:56.190> got<00:00:56.399> brake<00:00:56.730> fluid<00:00:57.090> in

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
bleed valve and we've got brake fluid in

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
bleed valve and we've got brake fluid in
this<00:00:57.300> line<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:01.850> filled<00:01:02.850> up<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> reservoir<00:01:03.300> in

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 
this line and filled up the reservoir in

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.460 
this line and filled up the reservoir in
the<00:01:04.290> engine<00:01:04.920> bay

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
the engine bay

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:15.100 
the engine bay
so<00:01:09.080> procedure<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:12.500> loosen<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.590> valve

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
so procedure is to loosen this valve

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.040 
so procedure is to loosen this valve
first<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:17.520> then<00:01:18.270> there'll<00:01:18.480> be<00:01:18.510> air<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.960> this

first and then there'll be air in this

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.140 
first and then there'll be air in this
line<00:01:19.320> connect<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.980> all<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.400> lines<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.560> then

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
the fluid through using a syringe but

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.809 
the fluid through using a syringe but
that<00:02:30.389> didn't<00:02:30.599> work<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:32.250> seems<00:02:32.609> to<00:02:32.790> be

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
that didn't work this seems to be

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.179
