reasonable price so please don't tell me
anything<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.910> has<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.809> with<00:00:16.230> changing

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
anything that has to do with changing

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.349 
anything that has to do with changing
the<00:00:17.279> price<00:00:18.710> yeah<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.070> first<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.119> new

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
the price yeah so first are the new

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.779 
the price yeah so first are the new
improvements<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:22.020> can<00:00:22.199> see<00:00:22.529> already<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:23.279> that

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
improvements you can see already is that

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.009 
improvements you can see already is that
I've<00:00:24.000> improved<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:26.330> mesh<00:00:27.330> deformations

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
I've improved the the mesh deformations

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.710 
I've improved the the mesh deformations
like<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.730> there<00:00:30.359> are<00:00:30.449> two<00:00:30.570> more

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
like you can have to there are two more

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.760 
like you can have to there are two more
bones<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.489> it's<00:00:32.489> more<00:00:32.910> control<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.770> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
bones here so it's more control and the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.470 
bones here so it's more control and the
main<00:00:34.920> improvements<00:00:35.430> are<00:00:35.550> mesh<00:00:35.820> deformations

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
main improvements are mesh deformations

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.319 
main improvements are mesh deformations
and<00:00:36.600> stuff<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.110> let<00:00:37.500> me<00:00:37.559> get<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:39.000> click<00:00:39.210> on

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and stuff so let me get it so click on

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.049 
and stuff so let me get it so click on
this<00:00:39.540> thing<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.350> basically<00:00:40.950> what<00:00:41.879> you

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
this thing this is basically what you

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.139 
this thing this is basically what you
can<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:44.070> mesh<00:00:44.219> deformation<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.000> can

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
can the mesh deformation so you can

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.330 
can the mesh deformation so you can
change<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> type<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.719> fingers<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.530> yeah

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
change the type of fingers you like yeah

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.160 
change the type of fingers you like yeah
and<00:00:47.820> then<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> stretch<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
and then we have the stretch and the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.939 
and then we have the stretch and the
whatever<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.039> UV<00:00:53.969> whatever

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
whatever if you have this UV whatever

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.260 
whatever if you have this UV whatever
problem<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.730> will<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.420> change<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
problem you will have to change that and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.990 
problem you will have to change that and
then<00:01:00.350> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.559> even<00:01:01.680> make<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.850> looks

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
then you can even make it so it looks

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.170 
then you can even make it so it looks
like<00:01:03.120> he's<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.510> stretching<00:01:03.899> out<00:01:04.049> his<00:01:04.199> arm<00:01:05.180> so

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
like he's just stretching out his arm so

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.179 
like he's just stretching out his arm so
this<00:01:06.420> gives<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.750> lot<00:01:07.080> more<00:01:07.229> control<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.590> trust

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
this gives a lot more control and trust

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.530 
this gives a lot more control and trust
me<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.610> comes<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.090> handy<00:01:09.470> I'll<00:01:10.470> show<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.790> a<00:01:11.790> way

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
me it comes in handy I'll show you a way

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.179 
me it comes in handy I'll show you a way
you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.810> use<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> have<00:01:13.590> wrists

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
you can use it and then you have wrists

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.330 
you can use it and then you have wrists
and<00:01:14.869> other<00:01:15.869> side<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:16.650> enable<00:01:17.130> bounce

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and other side and then enable bounce

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.469 
and other side and then enable bounce
which<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.790> new<00:01:18.060> feature<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.780> came<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:20.479> so

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
which is new feature I came up with so

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.749 
which is new feature I came up with so
what<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.320> locks<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.860> into<00:01:23.070> one

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
what this is is it locks it into one

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.609 
what this is is it locks it into one
area<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.420> cannot<00:01:24.840> move<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.200> outside<00:01:25.320> this

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
area so you cannot move it outside this

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.929 
area so you cannot move it outside this
area<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.450> move<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.900> control<00:01:28.939> it

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
area and so you move the control it

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.149 
area and so you move the control it
still<00:01:30.270> works<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:31.049> come<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.829> two

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
still works I have come up with two

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.520 
still works I have come up with two
methods<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.909> doing<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.350> i'm

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
methods of doing this one is what i'm

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.499 
methods of doing this one is what i'm
using<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.009> constraint<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> other<00:01:36.119> is

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
using a constraint and the other is

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.960 
using a constraint and the other is
using<00:01:37.020> expresso<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.220> expression<00:01:38.700> one<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:38.939> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
using expresso the expression one is a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.920 
using expresso the expression one is a
lot<00:01:39.210> more<00:01:39.390> complicated<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:41.119> takes<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> lot

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
lot more complicated and takes out a lot

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.020 
lot more complicated and takes out a lot
more<00:01:44.509> it<00:01:45.509> has<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> lot<00:01:46.020> more<00:01:46.049> lag<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.250> what<00:01:47.909> you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
more it has a lot more lag so what you

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.240 
more it has a lot more lag so what you
can<00:01:48.210> use<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.659> wrist<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.320> whatever<00:01:49.920> feature

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
can use this wrist and whatever feature

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.609 
can use this wrist and whatever feature
for<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.759> say<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.119> want<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.450> animate<00:01:52.320> him

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
for is say you want to animate him

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.370 
for is say you want to animate him
touching<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> ground<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.759> he's<00:01:54.020> he's<00:01:55.020> doing

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
touching the ground so he's he's doing

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.740 
touching the ground so he's he's doing
like<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> split<00:01:56.040> or<00:01:56.219> something<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.939> say<00:01:57.450> wants

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
like a split or something and say wants

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.429 
like a split or something and say wants
him<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.990> touch<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> ground<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.219> select<00:01:59.759> that

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
him to touch the ground so select that

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.160 
him to touch the ground so select that
enable<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> strength<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.240> stretch<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.689> not

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
enable the strength that stretch and not

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.889 
enable the strength that stretch and not
enable<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:05.969> stretch<00:02:06.509> his<00:02:06.719> leg

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
enable it but it's just stretch his leg

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.499 
enable it but it's just stretch his leg
out<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> little<00:02:07.350> maybe<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.330> can

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
out a little maybe if you like you can

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.690 
out a little maybe if you like you can

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
looks like he's stretching out and then

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.160 
looks like he's stretching out and then
add<00:02:17.650> some<00:02:19.349> added<00:02:20.349> looked<00:02:20.590> with<00:02:21.629> it<00:02:22.629> looks<00:02:22.959> like

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
add some added looked with it looks like

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.699 
add some added looked with it looks like
he's<00:02:23.349> pointing<00:02:23.860> down<00:02:24.099> and<00:02:24.400> then<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:26.500> looks

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
he's pointing down and then that looks

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.370 
he's pointing down and then that looks
like<00:02:26.860> he's<00:02:27.040> going<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.489> slide<00:02:28.110> something<00:02:29.110> and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
like he's going to slide something and

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.740 
like he's going to slide something and
that<00:02:29.500> looks<00:02:29.709> like<00:02:29.890> he's<00:02:30.390> putting<00:02:31.390> his<00:02:31.599> foot<00:02:31.690> on

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
that looks like he's putting his foot on

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.620 
that looks like he's putting his foot on
the<00:02:31.959> ground<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.060> then<00:02:34.180> we<00:02:34.330> can<00:02:34.480> always

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
the ground so and then we can always

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.900 
the ground so and then we can always
move<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.140> bit<00:02:35.170> forward<00:02:35.860> because<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.730> looks

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
move it a bit forward because it looks

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.640 
move it a bit forward because it looks
kind<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.239> weird<00:02:37.300> like<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.610> yeah<00:02:40.650> this

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
kind of weird like that and yeah this

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.039 
kind of weird like that and yeah this
gives<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.040> lot<00:02:42.190> more<00:02:42.250> control<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.870> mesh

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
gives you a lot more control of the mesh

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.740 
gives you a lot more control of the mesh
the<00:02:44.230> foundation<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:46.120> doesn't<00:02:46.450> take<00:02:46.480> a

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
the foundation and it doesn't take a

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.339 
the foundation and it doesn't take a
much<00:02:47.049> of<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.380> hassle<00:02:47.799> to<00:02:48.069> do<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:50.549> do<00:02:51.549> I<00:02:51.579> do<00:02:52.349> Sam

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
much of a hassle to do it do I do Sam

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.030 
much of a hassle to do it do I do Sam
for<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.590> head<00:02:54.690> if<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.840> can<00:02:56.019> select<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.620> okay

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
for the head if I can select it okay

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:05.089 
for the head if I can select it okay
ahead<00:02:57.400> stretch<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.360> out<00:02:58.510> stuff<00:03:00.209> yeah<00:03:03.750> okay

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
ahead stretch it out stuff yeah okay

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.770 
ahead stretch it out stuff yeah okay
everything<00:03:06.099> else<00:03:06.250> is<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.489> same<00:03:06.519> I've<00:03:07.239> added

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
everything else is the same I've added

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.890 
everything else is the same I've added
two<00:03:08.170> more<00:03:08.349> layers<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.459> have<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:10.480> controls

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
two more layers so you have the controls

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.110 
two more layers so you have the controls
and<00:03:10.989> materials<00:03:11.560> what<00:03:11.769> this<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.190> for<00:03:12.640> is<00:03:12.880> when

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
and materials what this is for is when

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.569 
and materials what this is for is when
you<00:03:13.209> go<00:03:13.329> into<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:14.440> animation<00:03:14.769> set<00:03:15.190> up<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:15.549> you

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
you go into the animation set up so you

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.430 
you go into the animation set up so you
have<00:03:15.790> all<00:03:16.090> your<00:03:16.329> stuff<00:03:16.390> here<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:17.109> want<00:03:17.290> a

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
new character to animate and you have to

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.849 
new character to animate and you have to
like<00:03:20.560> hey<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.880> doesn't<00:03:22.350> dare<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.530> just<00:03:23.709> go

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
like hey it doesn't dare you just go

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.289 
like hey it doesn't dare you just go
into<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.160> layer<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:24.790> click<00:03:25.090> on<00:03:25.239> that

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
into this layer and you click on that

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.890 
into this layer and you click on that
thing<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.730> thing<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.150> off<00:03:28.389> sit<00:03:28.660> from

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
thing that thing and it off sit from

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.610 
thing that thing and it off sit from
your<00:03:29.500> animation<00:03:30.069> layer<00:03:30.220> plus<00:03:30.609> from<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.060> grid

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
your animation layer plus from the grid

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.129 
your animation layer plus from the grid
yup<00:03:32.620> objects<00:03:33.069> a<00:03:33.370> manager<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.299> your<00:03:34.420> materials

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
yup objects a manager and your materials

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.660 
yup objects a manager and your materials
so<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.560> looks<00:03:35.799> like<00:03:35.859> you<00:03:36.130> don't<00:03:36.340> even<00:03:36.400> have<00:03:36.579> the

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
so it looks like you don't even have the

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.289 
so it looks like you don't even have the
grid<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.090> say<00:03:37.660> I've<00:03:37.780> done<00:03:37.810> animating<00:03:38.650> him<00:03:39.299> and

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
grid and say I've done animating him and

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.090 
grid and say I've done animating him and
you<00:03:40.720> don't<00:03:40.900> want<00:03:41.019> to<00:03:41.079> seize<00:03:41.319> control<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:42.069> that

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
you don't want to seize control so that

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.430 
you don't want to seize control so that
you<00:03:42.400> accidentally<00:03:43.000> don't<00:03:43.329> move<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.319> or

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
you accidentally don't move it or

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.979 
you accidentally don't move it or
something<00:03:44.829> you<00:03:44.920> can<00:03:45.100> always<00:03:45.370> off<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.850> like<00:03:46.810> so

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
something you can always off it like so

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.960 
something you can always off it like so
and<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.500> don't<00:03:47.799> want<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.160> see<00:03:48.489> him<00:03:48.700> at<00:03:48.850> all

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
visual selector so we have two more here

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.520 
visual selector so we have two more here
not<00:04:12.819> much<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.150> improvement<00:04:13.720> but<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:15.329> it's<00:04:16.329> done
