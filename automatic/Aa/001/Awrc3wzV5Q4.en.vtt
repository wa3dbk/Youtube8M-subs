00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
gumption thinking you loved it these

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.210 
gumption thinking you loved it these
things<00:02:14.210> are<00:02:14.360> rockets<00:02:14.840> maybe<00:02:15.650> on<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.950> track

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
things are rockets maybe on the track

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.430 
things are rockets maybe on the track
but<00:02:16.730> not<00:02:16.940> on<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.180> road<00:02:17.360> yeah<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:20.690> feel<00:02:21.050> it's<00:02:21.200> too

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
but not on the road yeah I feel it's too

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.250 
but not on the road yeah I feel it's too
small<00:02:21.710> for<00:02:21.770> me<00:02:22.330> yeah<00:02:23.330> where's<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.780> blade<00:02:24.080> was

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
small for me yeah where's the blade was

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.780 
small for me yeah where's the blade was
slightly<00:02:24.650> bigger<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.400> it's<00:02:25.550> not<00:02:25.670> the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
slightly bigger so it's not the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.330 
slightly bigger so it's not the
performance<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:27.350> performance<00:02:27.380> wasn't<00:02:28.070> what

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
performance the performance wasn't what

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.540 
performance the performance wasn't what
I<00:02:28.370> expected<00:02:28.550> either<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:30.080> must<00:02:30.470> be<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.890> bike<00:02:31.070> it

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
I expected either it must be the bike it

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.700 
I expected either it must be the bike it
must<00:02:31.850> be<00:02:32.030> this<00:02:32.150> particular<00:02:32.480> by<00:02:32.810> possibly<00:02:33.200> yeah

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
must be this particular by possibly yeah

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.810 
must be this particular by possibly yeah
there's<00:02:33.950> probably<00:02:34.160> people<00:02:34.310> all<00:02:34.580> over<00:02:34.670> the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
there's probably people all over the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.910 
there's probably people all over the
country<00:02:34.850> with<00:02:35.270> our<00:02:35.390> one<00:02:35.690> shell<00:02:35.990> TV<00:02:36.740> at<00:02:36.800> the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
country with our one shell TV at the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.630 
country with our one shell TV at the
moment<00:02:37.420> but<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.540> just<00:02:38.690> wasn't<00:02:39.050> for<00:02:39.170> me

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
moment but it just wasn't for me

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.490 
moment but it just wasn't for me
really<00:02:40.640> so<00:02:41.210> you<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.810> don't<00:02:42.020> think<00:02:42.170> it's<00:02:42.410> a

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
really so you you don't think it's a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.930 
really so you you don't think it's a
stone<00:02:42.740> of<00:02:42.860> this<00:02:42.980> bike<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.370> think<00:02:43.580> it's<00:02:43.730> the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
stone of this bike you think it's the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.060 
stone of this bike you think it's the
size<00:02:44.180> of<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.690> size<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.260> bike<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.830> feel

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
size of it the size of the bike the feel

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.370 
size of it the size of the bike the feel
of<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.370> bike<00:02:46.550> but<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.360> also<00:02:47.630> think<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.170> this

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
of the bike but I also think that this

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.470 
of the bike but I also think that this
bike<00:02:48.710> may<00:02:49.010> not<00:02:49.370> be<00:02:49.520> able<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.730> spec<00:02:50.000> may<00:02:50.210> not<00:02:50.360> be

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
bike may not be able to spec may not be

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.040 
bike may not be able to spec may not be
up<00:02:50.570> to<00:02:50.600> spec

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
up to spec

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.710 
up to spec
so<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.170> mean<00:02:51.470> tell<00:02:52.190> me<00:02:52.220> was<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:53.090> power<00:02:53.300> wasn't
