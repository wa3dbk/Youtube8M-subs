00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:14.509
 he turns out to be fine m 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.549
 after the cda split 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.549
 i'm not obsolete yet he would be a bit 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.089
 I don't want that at all 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.759

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.049

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.089
 last hole 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:47.209
