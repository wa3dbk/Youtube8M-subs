00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
obviously there's many reasons to write

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.660 
obviously there's many reasons to write
this<00:01:52.870> book<00:01:53.110> but<00:01:53.290> one<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.040> big<00:01:54.280> reason<00:01:54.580> is

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
this book but one of the big reason is

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.060 
this book but one of the big reason is
to<00:01:54.940> really<00:01:55.300> share<00:01:56.110> some<00:01:56.410> of<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.560> stories<00:01:56.890> and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
as I started talking to other fathers it

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.620 
as I started talking to other fathers it
was<00:01:59.860> amazing<00:02:00.400> how<00:02:00.610> similar<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.300> story's

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
was amazing how similar the story's

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
was amazing how similar the story's
worth

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
worth

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.040 
worth
there<00:02:03.160> was<00:02:03.310> one<00:02:03.640> circumstance<00:02:04.120> in<00:02:04.660> therapy

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
there was one circumstance in therapy

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.350 
there was one circumstance in therapy
and<00:02:05.580> I<00:02:06.580> got<00:02:07.480> down<00:02:07.660> there<00:02:07.900> and<00:02:09.149> Artie<00:02:10.149> didn't

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
and I got down there and Artie didn't

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.229 
and I got down there and Artie didn't
respond<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.720> me<00:02:10.869> at<00:02:10.959> all<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:12.250> at<00:02:12.879> that<00:02:13.060> moment

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
respond to me at all and at that moment

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.530 
respond to me at all and at that moment
I<00:02:13.660> knew<00:02:14.019> that<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.830> better<00:02:15.550> get<00:02:15.670> on<00:02:15.730> board<00:02:16.060> and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
I knew that I better get on board and

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.470 
I knew that I better get on board and
understand<00:02:17.530> what<00:02:17.800> autism<00:02:18.220> is

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
understand what autism is

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.480 
understand what autism is
otherwise<00:02:20.200> I'm<00:02:20.440> gonna<00:02:20.530> lose<00:02:20.770> my<00:02:20.800> son<00:02:21.310> my

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
otherwise I'm gonna lose my son my

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.640 
otherwise I'm gonna lose my son my
family<00:02:21.970> everything<00:02:22.450> around<00:02:22.780> me<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.530> was

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
family everything around me it was

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.680 
family everything around me it was
important<00:02:24.069> for<00:02:24.099> me<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.390> share<00:02:25.390> those<00:02:25.599> stories

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
important for me to share those stories

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.080 
important for me to share those stories
so<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> think<00:02:26.860> it's<00:02:26.980> it's<00:02:27.220> it's<00:02:27.459> something<00:02:27.970> I

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
so I think it's it's it's something I

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.390 
so I think it's it's it's something I
hope<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.540> lot<00:02:28.569> of<00:02:28.870> men<00:02:29.050> read<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.620> not<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:30.220> men

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
hope a lot of men read and not just men

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.100 
hope a lot of men read and not just men
but<00:02:30.580> women<00:02:30.790> as<00:02:31.000> well<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.510> change<00:02:31.840> that

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
but women as well and change that

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.290 
but women as well and change that
expectations<00:02:32.950> once<00:02:33.489> you're<00:02:33.700> able<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.940> change

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
expectations once you're able to change

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.449 
expectations once you're able to change
that<00:02:34.480> expectation<00:02:35.230> then<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.860> can<00:02:36.069> grow<00:02:36.280> and

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
that expectation then you can grow and

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.370 
that expectation then you can grow and
move<00:02:36.580> forward<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:37.180> as<00:02:37.480> long<00:02:37.690> as<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:37.959> sit

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
move forward but as long as you sit

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.250 
move forward but as long as you sit
right<00:02:38.410> there<00:02:38.620> in<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.069> place<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:40.020> feel<00:02:41.020> this

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
right there in that place and feel this

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.100 
right there in that place and feel this
sense<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.770> why<00:02:41.950> me<00:02:42.280> why<00:02:42.550> my<00:02:42.819> son<00:02:43.150> not<00:02:43.540> my<00:02:43.780> boy

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
sense of why me why my son not my boy

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.729 
sense of why me why my son not my boy
and<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.950> stay<00:02:45.280> there<00:02:45.310> then<00:02:46.209> you're<00:02:46.360> just

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
and you stay there then you're just

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.960 
and you stay there then you're just
stagnant<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.340> think<00:02:48.400> what's<00:02:48.760> great

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
stagnant and so I think what's great

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.910 
stagnant and so I think what's great
about<00:02:49.000> Rodney's<00:02:49.630> book<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.620> talks

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
about Rodney's book is that it talks

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.059 
about Rodney's book is that it talks
about<00:02:51.099> just<00:02:51.730> really<00:02:52.200> having<00:02:53.200> hope<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.860> these

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
about just really having hope that these

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.490 
about just really having hope that these
things<00:02:54.220> will<00:02:54.400> happen<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.880> find<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:56.019> way<00:02:56.170> come

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
things will happen and find a way come

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.680 
things will happen and find a way come
up<00:02:56.620> with<00:02:56.769> some<00:02:57.010> way<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.519> figure<00:02:57.880> out<00:02:58.030> how<00:02:58.480> you

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
up with some way to figure out how you

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.229 
up with some way to figure out how you
can<00:02:59.170> have<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> little<00:02:59.650> bit<00:02:59.739> more<00:02:59.920> empathy<00:03:00.519> the

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
can have a little bit more empathy the

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.970 
can have a little bit more empathy the
biggest<00:03:01.569> part<00:03:02.080> is<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.560> there's<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.799> small

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
biggest part is that there's a small

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.160 
biggest part is that there's a small
window<00:03:03.519> of<00:03:03.549> time<00:03:06.060> if<00:03:07.060> you're<00:03:07.269> wasting<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.840> year

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
window of time if you're wasting a year

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.740 
window of time if you're wasting a year
six<00:03:08.560> months<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:09.160> being<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:09.940> denial<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:10.630> your

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
six months of being a denial and your

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.259 
six months of being a denial and your
self-pity<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.530> your<00:03:11.650> ego<00:03:12.010> that's<00:03:12.850> time

self-pity and your ego that's time

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.360 
self-pity and your ego that's time
wasted<00:03:13.780> from<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:14.049> child<00:03:14.350> being<00:03:14.920> able<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.160> be

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
wasted from a child being able to be

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.190 
wasted from a child being able to be
brought<00:03:15.640> out<00:03:15.850> of<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:16.030> world<00:03:16.390> yeah<00:03:16.810> and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
has a different approach but the one

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.390
