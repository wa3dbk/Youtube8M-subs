00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 I want in my recipe today 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.379
 show you what to do with nutella everything 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.950
 can do great and like all of us 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.719
 know nutella tastes delicious but there 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.519
 It just can not threaten to spread 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.279
 Eat but always delicious too 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:26.939
 make known and today we do 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:29.119
 so a nutella flowers and good 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.119
 appetite 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.890
 for the nutella flower need with almost 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.110
 550 grams of flour and seven as in 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.000
 Of course, a bowl is important 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.040
 Take a little time this day 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.050
 and just nice by 75 150 grams 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.890
 then we have a total of 80 grams 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.890
 sugar off these 80 grams we take 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.840
 the half so 40 grams and crush 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.729
 in ours the dice 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.119
 we can take the whole lever or 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.400
 the appropriate amount of dry yeast 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.869
 works just as well and then 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.360
 it connects beautifully and it will 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.860
 just liquid that gives me then easy 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.590
 in the flour with it and then come 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.649
 just 250 milliliters slightly warmed up 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.920
 the milk into it in the short 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.220
 microwave is okay and 100 grams 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.780
 butter 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.810
 it can be a bit softer 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.540
 He just likes to throw in his clean 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.350
 and then there are two fresh eggs 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.009
 I just have size m with me 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.009
 into the day 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.960
 then give me the remaining 40 grams 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.640
 sugar is added to the total 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.010
 80 grams come and then it will be quite 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.960
 with the knee days just before is before 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.369
 then have to go over so handwork and 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.660
 now the dough with ducks nice 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.310
 work through again and again 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.950
 pull apart 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.090
 as long as it really is a completely 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.470
 is homogeneous mass and then it is 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.950
 ready and then we can rest her 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.980
 to let 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.950
 30 minutes let me detail is beautiful 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.640
 go until it has increased slightly 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.709
 and then it was already 30 minutes around 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.700
 yes , we quickly give our dough 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.700
 him on a floured work surface 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.290
 make a kind of small washes and 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.530
 Share detail, it goes in four equal 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.690
 great parts and that these individual 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.260
 We will continue to work on parts now 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.630
 by rolling it out 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.750
 take rolling pin 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.739
 and we need the size that we have one 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.310
 springform or whatever form 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.620
 wanted to get out or cut out 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.489
 I could just take it from me 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.790
 my springform the floor of the still 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.900
 just then 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.340
 and then you can use the knife here 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.760
 just happy once 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.760
 herumschnippeln 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.620
 so and then we have 30 am bumble 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.200
 things with nutella at the same time I give you 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.280
 the good tip I had one 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.840
 had forgotten a bit like 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.940
 some difficulties is the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.920
 same on the baking paper to date 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.750
 Just put on the page before you can 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.600
 it sweeps really serves you 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.670
 easier yes I have in the meantime 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.280
 then rolled out the second day 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:37.070
 and just put it over her 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.360
 over it paint box beautiful and then 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.400
 simply I do now with the cover the 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.730
 small imprint on it so I know where 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.209
 one dish get there again and again 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.860
 will honestly promise nutella 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.420
 it 's good if it's not so cold 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.950
 is then a bit stiffened 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.170
 otherwise easily warps namely 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:00.709
 the dough slightly warmer nutella leaves 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.410
 then really easier to process 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.180
 is the retailer's face so 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.010
 All in all, of course we process all 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.560
 four dough pieces that means we have four 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.239
 lay and only the top position is 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.239
 no longer coated with nutella 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.810
 always have to look nice 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.770
 new in line with my country 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.790
 This can really be done with the spoon 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.790
 work well 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.729
 through to the edge of small distance 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.099
 let him come 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.229
 so now which whole ever on the 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:42.150
 sheet metal and the last days hung up 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.889
 that is, one is almost ready now 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:50.099
 idea 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:53.480
 again my stencil on one 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:57.600
 ghosts from landshut 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.840
 count eastern circle coming weeks 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.600
 must section of wine yeast streuselkuchen 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.500
 made apples why should you finally 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.810
 Master makes miracle of my nutella 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.350
 glass with lid and that's just go 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.970
 in the center 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.400
 for a small imprint I would 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.889
 just know where you are in the middle and 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.830
 Now I start 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.020
 the circular set to cut first 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.310
 four parts 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.310
 that is in the courts once 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:34.469
 and then we have those segments the 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:36.089
 world, the four segments have again 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:40.189
 subdivided means that I hold the 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:40.189
 rigide this segment again 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.690
 at 8 and then it goes on exactly the same 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.729
 here are some more exercises so far 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.559
 at the end of all 16 segments 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.229
 and now it comes for our flowers 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:57.770
 we simply took one of these 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.770
 segments 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.860
 catherines once again lying around 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.260
 I'm all in the same here 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.850
 direction makes it a bit 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.310
 careful june back posted it 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.870
 somewhere this turn looks flat budget 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.460
 Of course the fear is nice, too 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.350
 I'm all in the same group 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:23.060
 direction but it is just as possible 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:24.800
 always two to each other we see 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.729
 have an even number of segments 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.370
 it goes so it is always but everyone 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:34.430
 It's easy to step in one direction 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.040
 for his then like it then and 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:41.210
 it's off in the oven at 180 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.850
 Grad around 20 minutes there was that 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.770
 depends heavily on the stove from there you have to 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.330
 looking exactly who is not too dark 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.850
 you will find it a bit dark 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.689
 but it does taste 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.279
 action so I still fit well 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:57.519
 and when I'm very beautiful the 

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:58.389
 stories a bit I walk 

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:00.489
 just have a little shopping 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.209
 applied and understandable 

00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:04.059
 reproduced 

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:05.199
 I hope you had fun on 

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:08.699
 Try it and see you next time 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.699
 cooking at boni baking
