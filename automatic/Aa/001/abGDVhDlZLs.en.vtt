locate the diagram to wind the bobbin
thread<00:00:55.219> onto<00:00:55.820> your<00:00:56.300> bobbin<00:00:56.690> case<00:00:56.930> that<00:00:57.559> would

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
thread onto your bobbin case that would

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.860 
thread onto your bobbin case that would
be<00:00:57.920> this<00:00:58.160> one<00:00:58.219> right<00:00:58.520> here<00:00:59.120> let's<00:00:59.660> take<00:00:59.840> a

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
be this one right here let's take a

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.320 
be this one right here let's take a
closer<00:01:00.199> look<00:01:02.379> you<00:01:03.379> have<00:01:03.590> two<00:01:03.920> diagrams<00:01:04.550> this

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
closer look you have two diagrams this

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.690 
closer look you have two diagrams this
one<00:01:05.660> is<00:01:05.899> to<00:01:06.110> load<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.380> thread<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.430> video

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
one is to load the thread and the video

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.600 
one is to load the thread and the video
for<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:08.060> is<00:01:08.479> down<00:01:08.960> below<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.680> this<00:01:10.310> diagram

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
for that is down below and this diagram

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.410 
for that is down below and this diagram
is<00:01:10.939> to<00:01:11.299> load<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:11.540> bobbin<00:01:15.970> we're<00:01:16.970> going<00:01:17.270> to

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
is to load the bobbin we're going to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.330 
is to load the bobbin we're going to
follow<00:01:17.570> this<00:01:17.930> diagram<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:18.799> according<00:01:19.189> to

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
follow this diagram and according to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.820 
follow this diagram and according to
this<00:01:19.460> diagram<00:01:19.729> it<00:01:20.240> says<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:20.780> pull<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.530> thread

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
this diagram it says to pull the thread

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.760 
this diagram it says to pull the thread
through<00:01:22.180> through<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.330> thread<00:01:23.630> guide<00:01:23.900> loop<00:01:24.560> it

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
through through the thread guide loop it

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.410 
through through the thread guide loop it
through<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:25.310> then<00:01:25.610> come<00:01:25.909> all<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.270> way<00:01:26.299> back

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
through and then come all the way back

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.609 
through and then come all the way back
around<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:27.530> let's<00:01:27.680> try<00:01:28.009> it<00:01:31.960> so<00:01:32.960> we<00:01:33.110> pull<00:01:33.409> on<00:01:33.530> the

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
around so let's try it so we pull on the

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.140 
around so let's try it so we pull on the
thread<00:01:34.600> placing<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.720> through<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.049> guide

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
thread placing it through the guide

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.469 
thread placing it through the guide
looping<00:01:38.150> it<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:40.479> then<00:01:41.530> pulling<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:42.799> this<00:01:43.040> way

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
looping it and then pulling it this way

00:01:43.479 --> 00:02:01.599 
looping it and then pulling it this way
let's<00:01:44.479> take<00:01:44.689> a<00:01:44.720> closer<00:01:45.049> look

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.099 

take<00:02:02.609> a<00:02:02.640> look<00:02:02.909> at<00:02:03.060> your<00:02:03.179> bobbin<00:02:03.630> case<00:02:03.840> you'll

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
take a look at your bobbin case you'll

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.800 
take a look at your bobbin case you'll
notice<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.740> has<00:02:04.770> two<00:02:05.310> holes<00:02:05.609> on<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.780> top

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
notice that it has two holes on the top

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.710 
notice that it has two holes on the top
side<00:02:07.439> on<00:02:08.160> both<00:02:08.489> sides<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.300> bobbin<00:02:09.690> case

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
side on both sides of the bobbin case

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.979 
side on both sides of the bobbin case
and<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.340> bottom<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:11.849> well<00:02:12.060> you're<00:02:12.750> going

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
and on the bottom as well you're going

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.839 
and on the bottom as well you're going
to<00:02:13.140> pass<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.680> end<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.069> your<00:02:14.220> thread<00:02:14.489> through

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
to pass the end of your thread through

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:28.970 
to pass the end of your thread through
the<00:02:15.330> inside<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.799> holes

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.790 

next<00:02:29.940> locate<00:02:30.330> your<00:02:30.810> bobbin<00:02:31.290> winder<00:02:31.770> shaft

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
next locate your bobbin winder shaft

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.869 
next locate your bobbin winder shaft
it's<00:02:32.670> located<00:02:33.239> right<00:02:33.360> here<00:02:33.989> next<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.590> your

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
going to do is place your bobbin onto

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:49.430 
going to do is place your bobbin onto
the<00:02:41.400> shaft<00:02:47.360> next<00:02:48.360> you're<00:02:48.569> going<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.050> put<00:02:49.260> your

bobbin<00:02:49.739> shaft<00:02:50.250> into<00:02:50.930> position<00:02:51.930> by<00:02:52.470> switching

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
bobbin shaft into position by switching

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.180 
bobbin shaft into position by switching
this<00:02:53.760> over<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.660> here<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.680> we're

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
this over to here so to do that we're

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.240 
this over to here so to do that we're
simply<00:02:56.580> just<00:02:56.760> going<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.360> push<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.349> over<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.069> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
simply just going to push it over to the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.550 
simply just going to push it over to the
bobbin<00:02:59.640> shaft<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.390> locks<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.049> place<00:03:01.080> and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
bobbin shaft that locks it in place and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.199 
bobbin shaft that locks it in place and
it<00:03:01.680> tells<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.099> machine<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:02.849> ready<00:03:03.120> to

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
it tells the machine that it's ready to
