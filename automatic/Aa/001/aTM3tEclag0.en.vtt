00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
dragoons that are gonna stick off both

on the hips and on the backpack

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.350 
on the hips and on the backpack
hopefully<00:02:23.490> they're<00:02:23.640> all<00:02:23.670> going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> look<00:02:24.150> good

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
hopefully they're all going to look good

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.420 
hopefully they're all going to look good
when<00:02:24.570> they're<00:02:24.690> put<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:24.990> in<00:02:25.740> terms<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.160> weapons

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
when they're put on in terms of weapons

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.910 
when they're put on in terms of weapons
you're<00:02:26.610> going<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.850> have<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.200> very<00:02:28.200> large<00:02:28.500> shield

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
you're going to have a very large shield

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.680 
you're going to have a very large shield
but<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.610> shield<00:02:29.820> could<00:02:30.000> have<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.270> addition

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
but the shield could have the addition

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.170 
but the shield could have the addition
of<00:02:30.810> an<00:02:31.440> oversized<00:02:31.950> beam<00:02:32.280> saber<00:02:32.640> there<00:02:32.970> which

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
of an oversized beam saber there which

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.460 
of an oversized beam saber there which
is<00:02:33.300> going<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.600> come<00:02:33.750> out<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:33.990> hopefully<00:02:34.140> looks

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
is going to come out and hopefully looks

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.620 
is going to come out and hopefully looks
good<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:35.460> head<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.820> one<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.120> more<00:02:36.270> unique

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
good the head is one of the more unique

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.420 
good the head is one of the more unique
features<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.590> Providence<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:38.160> because

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
features of the Providence just because

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.860 
features of the Providence just because
it's<00:02:38.580> got<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.760> lot<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.000> black<00:02:39.330> in<00:02:39.360> there

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
it's got a lot of black in there

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.840 
it's got a lot of black in there
perhaps<00:02:40.620> foreshadowing<00:02:41.280> for<00:02:41.310> anybody<00:02:41.730> who

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
perhaps foreshadowing for anybody who

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.190 
perhaps foreshadowing for anybody who
didn't<00:02:42.090> know<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.420> was<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.630> bad<00:02:42.870> guy<00:02:43.020> that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
didn't know that this was a bad guy that

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.500 
didn't know that this was a bad guy that
it<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.770> it's<00:02:44.520> got<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.700> lot<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:44.910> yellow<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.360> there

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
it is it's got a lot of yellow in there

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.760 
it is it's got a lot of yellow in there
which<00:02:45.720> hopefully<00:02:45.960> those<00:02:46.320> vents<00:02:46.650> and

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
which hopefully those vents and

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.260 
which hopefully those vents and
everything<00:02:47.070> are<00:02:47.190> reflected<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.880> kit<00:02:48.060> and

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
everything are reflected in the kit and

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.970 
everything are reflected in the kit and
then<00:02:48.870> you're<00:02:49.020> going<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.290> have<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.500> beam<00:02:49.740> rifle

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
then you're going to have a beam rifle

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.060 
then you're going to have a beam rifle
just<00:02:50.490> in<00:02:50.640> case<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.270> dragons<00:02:51.740> weren't<00:02:52.740> enough

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.580 

inside<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.220> box<00:02:56.900> you're<00:02:57.900> gonna<00:02:58.080> get<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.320> color

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
inside the box you're gonna get a color

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.070 
inside the box you're gonna get a color
-<00:02:58.740> hey<00:02:58.860> plates<00:02:59.250> some<00:03:00.180> gray<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.690> red<00:03:00.950> gray<00:03:01.950> a

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
- hey plates some gray and red gray a

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.470 
- hey plates some gray and red gray a
bigger<00:03:04.080> black<00:03:04.650> plates<00:03:05.010> poly<00:03:05.340> caps<00:03:05.700> gray<00:03:06.120> and

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
bigger black plates poly caps gray and

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.170 
bigger black plates poly caps gray and
the<00:03:07.380> manual<00:03:07.800> from<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.550> plate<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:08.820> think<00:03:09.060> that

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
the manual from the a plate I think that

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.640 
the manual from the a plate I think that
you<00:03:09.270> can<00:03:09.420> see<00:03:09.570> that<00:03:09.750> because<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.290> an<00:03:10.500> old

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650

one one-hundredth seat kit the pieces

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.520 
one one-hundredth seat kit the pieces
are<00:03:12.360> pretty<00:03:12.690> large<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.230> that's<00:03:13.350> especially

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
are pretty large and that's especially

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.250 
are pretty large and that's especially
apparent<00:03:14.010> here<00:03:14.430> with<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.090> beam<00:03:15.270> saber<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:16.080> is

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
apparent here with the beam saber it is

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.330 
apparent here with the beam saber it is
good<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.530> see<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.800> they<00:03:16.860> do<00:03:16.920> have<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.190> special

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
good to see that they do have a special

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.610 
good to see that they do have a special
custom<00:03:17.910> clear<00:03:18.120> part<00:03:18.360> here<00:03:18.540> for<00:03:19.080> colors<00:03:19.440> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
custom clear part here for colors the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.810 
custom clear part here for colors the
yellow<00:03:19.830> parts<00:03:20.100> are<00:03:20.190> gonna<00:03:20.280> get<00:03:20.490> the<00:03:20.580> chest

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
yellow parts are gonna get the chest

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.340 
yellow parts are gonna get the chest
vents<00:03:21.270> you're<00:03:21.390> going<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.690> get<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.930> neck<00:03:22.080> part

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
vents you're going to get the neck part

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.780 
vents you're going to get the neck part
and<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.680> looks<00:03:22.830> like<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.100> top<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.640> head

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and it looks like the top of the head

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.970 
and it looks like the top of the head
here<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.750> blue<00:03:24.930> for<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.230> main<00:03:25.410> chest<00:03:25.740> and

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
here and the blue for the main chest and

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.770 
here and the blue for the main chest and
outer<00:03:26.400> little<00:03:26.820> trim<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.210> think<00:03:27.390> those<00:03:27.540> go

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
outer little trim and I think those go

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.660 
outer little trim and I think those go
on<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.960> back<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.410> backpack<00:03:28.830> Rob

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.390 
what else to say you've got big funnels
a<00:03:36.960> few<00:03:37.470> little<00:03:37.680> tips<00:03:37.860> there<00:03:38.070> but<00:03:38.220> otherwise

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
a few little tips there but otherwise

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.640 
a few little tips there but otherwise
it's<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:38.940> dominated<00:03:39.540> by<00:03:39.690> these<00:03:39.870> two<00:03:40.140> massive

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650

special<00:03:47.310> out<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.700> these<00:03:47.820> funnels<00:03:48.270> I<00:03:48.510> think

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
special out of these funnels I think

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.150 
special out of these funnels I think
you're<00:03:49.170> going<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.350> be<00:03:49.410> pretty<00:03:49.620> disappointed

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
you're going to be pretty disappointed

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.380 
you're going to be pretty disappointed
because<00:03:50.220> they<00:03:50.490> are<00:03:50.610> just<00:03:50.820> one<00:03:50.940> piece<00:03:51.150> which

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
because they are just one piece which

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.240 
because they are just one piece which
sure<00:03:51.570> makes<00:03:51.780> them<00:03:51.900> easy<00:03:52.050> to<00:03:52.200> put<00:03:52.350> together<00:03:52.440> but

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
sure makes them easy to put together but

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.070 
sure makes them easy to put together but
certainly<00:03:53.700> not<00:03:53.970> up<00:03:54.300> there<00:03:54.450> master<00:03:54.900> grade

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
certainly not up there master grade

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.800 
certainly not up there master grade
quality<00:03:55.290> in<00:03:55.770> terms<00:03:55.800> of<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.280> complexity<00:03:56.850> more

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
quality in terms of the complexity more

big<00:03:58.020> parts<00:03:58.260> here<00:03:58.380> on<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.560> D<00:03:58.680> plate<00:03:58.920> especially

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
big parts here on the D plate especially

big parts here on the D plate especially
we're<00:04:00.000> talking<00:04:00.390> about<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.720> late<00:04:00.870> pieces

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
we're talking about the late pieces

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.350 
we're talking about the late pieces
which<00:04:01.500> are<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:01.890> massive<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.700> give<00:04:03.210> no

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
which are just massive and give no

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.640 
which are just massive and give no
indication<00:04:03.540> whatsoever<00:04:04.020> that<00:04:04.440> they're<00:04:04.530> going

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
indication whatsoever that they're going

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.320 
indication whatsoever that they're going
to<00:04:04.709> have<00:04:04.830> much<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.070> an<00:04:05.280> inner<00:04:05.430> frame<00:04:05.730> which<00:04:06.300> is

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
to have much of an inner frame which is

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.600 
to have much of an inner frame which is
to<00:04:06.570> be<00:04:06.690> expected<00:04:07.020> I<00:04:07.410> don't<00:04:08.100> know<00:04:08.190> why<00:04:08.340> but<00:04:08.580> you

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
to be expected I don't know why but you

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.130 
to be expected I don't know why but you
think<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.000> some<00:04:09.180> head<00:04:09.390> parts<00:04:09.660> would<00:04:09.810> go<00:04:09.959> on

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
think that some head parts would go on

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.330 
think that some head parts would go on
the<00:04:10.230> earlier<00:04:10.500> plates<00:04:10.800> instead<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.160> all<00:04:11.250> the

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
the earlier plates instead of all the

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.190 
the earlier plates instead of all the
way<00:04:11.430> here<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.820> e<00:04:11.910> plate<00:04:12.240> but<00:04:12.870> it's<00:04:12.990> good<00:04:13.110> to

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
way here to the e plate but it's good to

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.390 
way here to the e plate but it's good to
see<00:04:13.320> that<00:04:13.350> with<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.650> head<00:04:13.800> there<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.070> lot<00:04:14.280> of

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
see that with the head there is a lot of

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.590 
see that with the head there is a lot of
hollow<00:04:14.610> parts<00:04:14.970> there<00:04:15.150> which<00:04:15.330> means<00:04:15.480> that

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
hollow parts there which means that

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.909 
hollow parts there which means that
other<00:04:15.870> colors<00:04:16.260> are<00:04:16.380> going<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.530> be<00:04:16.590> put<00:04:16.890> on

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
other colors are going to be put on

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.740 
other colors are going to be put on
there<00:04:17.190> you've<00:04:17.669> got<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.970> front<00:04:18.210> grille<00:04:18.479> here

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
there you've got the front grille here

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.060 
there you've got the front grille here
and<00:04:18.930> then<00:04:19.020> you've<00:04:19.140> got<00:04:19.290> parts<00:04:19.590> for<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.859> legs

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
and then you've got parts for the legs

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.420 
and then you've got parts for the legs
and

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
and

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.580 
and
this<00:04:22.030> dark<00:04:22.389> gray<00:04:22.629> are<00:04:22.840> sort<00:04:23.020> of<00:04:23.110> black<00:04:23.289> for<00:04:23.499> the

this dark gray are sort of black for the
F<00:04:23.710> plate<00:04:23.949> very<00:04:24.189> similar<00:04:24.639> to<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:24.849> same<00:04:25.030> well

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
F plate very similar to the same well

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.339 
F plate very similar to the same well
it's<00:04:25.300> actually<00:04:25.599> the<00:04:25.689> same<00:04:25.870> as<00:04:25.900> what<00:04:26.169> you<00:04:26.259> get

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
it's actually the same as what you get

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.050 
it's actually the same as what you get
on<00:04:26.469> the<00:04:26.560> a<00:04:26.590> plate<00:04:26.860> but<00:04:27.400> I'm<00:04:27.550> glad<00:04:27.669> to<00:04:27.849> see<00:04:27.969> that

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
on the a plate but I'm glad to see that

our guide and this is always interesting

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:37.299 
our guide and this is always interesting
to<00:06:34.909> look<00:06:34.999> at<00:06:35.179> it's<00:06:35.869> 90%<00:06:36.439> white<00:06:36.979> they're

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:37.309 
to look at it's 90% white they're

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:39.579 
to look at it's 90% white they're
calling<00:06:37.610> for<00:06:37.819> with<00:06:38.149> 10%<00:06:38.509> neutral<00:06:39.080> gray<00:06:39.319> and

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:39.589 
calling for with 10% neutral gray and

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:43.479 
calling for with 10% neutral gray and
the<00:06:40.159> tiniest<00:06:40.669> bit<00:06:41.059> of<00:06:41.679> purple<00:06:42.679> which<00:06:43.189> I<00:06:43.309> didn't

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:43.489 
the tiniest bit of purple which I didn't

00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:45.159 
the tiniest bit of purple which I didn't
quite<00:06:43.610> expect<00:06:43.789> then<00:06:44.629> you're<00:06:44.719> gonna<00:06:44.839> have<00:06:45.050> the

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
quite expect then you're gonna have the

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:46.929 
quite expect then you're gonna have the
main<00:06:45.349> red<00:06:45.649> and<00:06:45.949> then<00:06:46.099> you<00:06:46.189> can<00:06:46.309> put<00:06:46.489> on<00:06:46.610> some

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:46.939 
main red and then you can put on some

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:49.149 
main red and then you can put on some
blue<00:06:47.179> and<00:06:47.419> make<00:06:47.599> that<00:06:47.779> into<00:06:48.050> grey<00:06:48.289> and<00:06:48.559> there

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:49.159 
blue and make that into grey and there

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.339 
blue and make that into grey and there
is<00:06:49.369> how<00:06:49.550> you<00:06:49.610> actually<00:06:50.179> paint<00:06:50.479> the<00:06:50.749> figure<00:06:51.169> so

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349 
is how you actually paint the figure so

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.469 
is how you actually paint the figure so
