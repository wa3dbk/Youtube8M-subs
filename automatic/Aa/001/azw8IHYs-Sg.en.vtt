the<00:01:23.300> figure<00:01:23.720> out<00:01:23.869> of<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.050> package<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:24.710> um<00:01:25.390> we

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
the figure out of the package and um we

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.730 
the figure out of the package and um we
want<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.630> just<00:01:26.750> be<00:01:26.869> honest<00:01:27.140> with<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.500> I<00:01:27.710> think

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
want to just be honest with you I think

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.930 
want to just be honest with you I think
this<00:01:28.190> is<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.460> start<00:01:28.729> of<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:30.500> second<00:01:31.399> half<00:01:31.460> of

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
this is the start of the second half of

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.990 
this is the start of the second half of
this<00:01:32.090> wave<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.720> mean<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:33.530> know<00:01:33.789> don't<00:01:34.789> get<00:01:34.880> it

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
this wave I mean you know don't get it

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.990 
this wave I mean you know don't get it
twisted<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.569> first<00:01:35.899> half<00:01:36.140> it<00:01:37.069> was<00:01:37.310> was<00:01:37.670> great

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
twisted the first half it was was great

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.480 
twisted the first half it was was great
but<00:01:38.840> as<00:01:38.960> far<00:01:39.110> as<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.319> movie<00:01:39.560> figures<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.159> think

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
but as far as the movie figures I think

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.590 
but as far as the movie figures I think
this<00:01:40.640> might<00:01:40.850> be<00:01:40.880> about<00:01:41.179> the<00:01:41.330> best<00:01:41.479> one<00:01:41.750> um<00:01:43.600> as

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
this might be about the best one um as

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.419 
this might be about the best one um as
far<00:01:44.840> as<00:01:44.960> paint<00:01:45.229> goes<00:01:45.500> I<00:01:45.770> mean<00:01:45.920> he's<00:01:46.039> basically

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
far as paint goes I mean he's basically

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.029 
far as paint goes I mean he's basically
just<00:01:46.520> blue<00:01:47.090> he<00:01:47.539> has<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.660> little<00:01:47.959> bit<00:01:48.679> of<00:01:48.709> black
