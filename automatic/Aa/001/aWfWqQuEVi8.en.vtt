my decision to retire I guess I mean I
had<00:01:57.079> been<00:01:57.229> thinking<00:01:57.350> about<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.799> for<00:01:58.039> some

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
had been thinking about it for some

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.550 
had been thinking about it for some
years<00:01:58.759> now<00:01:58.939> I<00:01:59.179> always<00:01:59.960> seem<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.170> come<00:02:00.350> out<00:02:00.439> and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
years now I always seem to come out and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.429 
years now I always seem to come out and
try<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.710> do<00:02:01.609> Southwick<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.719> know<00:02:02.810> retain

that<00:02:03.590> number<00:02:03.829> 16<00:02:04.130> number<00:02:04.159> that's<00:02:04.609> been<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:04.789> kind

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
that number 16 number that's been a kind

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.419 
that number 16 number that's been a kind
of<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.210> cool<00:02:05.380> thing<00:02:06.380> for<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:06.740> handful<00:02:07.100> of<00:02:07.159> years

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
of a cool thing for a handful of years

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.520 
of a cool thing for a handful of years
since<00:02:07.909> I've<00:02:08.060> retired<00:02:08.330> from<00:02:08.569> full-time<00:02:08.750> stuff

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
since I've retired from full-time stuff

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.490 
since I've retired from full-time stuff
but<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:11.390> know<00:02:11.420> recently<00:02:11.870> I've<00:02:12.049> been<00:02:12.170> kind<00:02:12.410> of

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
but you know recently I've been kind of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.710 
but you know recently I've been kind of
I<00:02:12.769> guess<00:02:13.129> I've<00:02:13.400> been<00:02:13.549> you<00:02:14.090> know<00:02:14.150> losing<00:02:14.599> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
I guess I've been you know losing the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.119 
I guess I've been you know losing the
desire<00:02:15.049> to<00:02:15.230> keep<00:02:15.379> coming<00:02:15.620> out<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.830> doing<00:02:15.950> that

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
desire to keep coming out and doing that

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.460 
desire to keep coming out and doing that
I've<00:02:16.310> been<00:02:16.370> kind<00:02:16.549> of<00:02:16.610> thinking<00:02:16.819> about<00:02:17.269> my<00:02:18.140> exit

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
I've been kind of thinking about my exit

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.220 
I've been kind of thinking about my exit
strategy<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:19.099> guess<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.459> could<00:02:19.610> say<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.230> so

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
strategy I guess you could say and so

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.550 
strategy I guess you could say and so
when<00:02:21.739> I<00:02:21.769> heard<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.099> news<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.580> Southwick<00:02:23.560> you

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
know going out you know off the off the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.050 
know going out you know off the off the
schedule<00:02:27.319> I<00:02:27.680> just<00:02:28.099> right<00:02:28.459> away<00:02:28.549> I<00:02:28.640> knew<00:02:28.849> that

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
schedule I just right away I knew that

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.759 
schedule I just right away I knew that
was<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.510> was<00:02:29.630> my<00:02:29.750> cue<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.170> just<00:02:30.410> figured<00:02:30.650> you

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
was that was my cue I just figured you

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.500 
was that was my cue I just figured you
know<00:02:30.829> what<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.190> started<00:02:31.970> my<00:02:32.090> first<00:02:32.239> my<00:02:32.480> first

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
know what I started my first my first

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.390 
know what I started my first my first
race<00:02:32.900> was<00:02:33.079> here<00:02:33.380> at<00:02:33.680> Southwick<00:02:34.069> in<00:02:34.930> 1987<00:02:35.930> and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
race was here at Southwick in 1987 and

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.759 
race was here at Southwick in 1987 and
so<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.430> guess<00:02:37.810> I'm<00:02:38.810> gonna<00:02:38.989> finish<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.349> off<00:02:39.560> where

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
so I guess I'm gonna finish it off where

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.489 
so I guess I'm gonna finish it off where
it<00:02:39.799> all<00:02:39.920> started<00:02:40.310> here<00:02:40.459> in<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.640> sand

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:43.499 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.940 

I<00:02:43.530> think<00:02:44.430> my<00:02:44.519> goal<00:02:44.760> for<00:02:45.540> for<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.079> last<00:02:46.650> race

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
I think my goal for for this last race

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.920 
I think my goal for for this last race
is<00:02:47.189> uh<00:02:47.219> I<00:02:47.639> don't<00:02:48.420> know<00:02:48.480> if<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.569> actually<00:02:48.659> have<00:02:48.900> a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
is uh I don't know if I actually have a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.479

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
plan for my son race in the national was

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.490 
plan for my son race in the national was
it<00:03:28.520> was<00:03:28.610> kind<00:03:28.819> of<00:03:28.880> always<00:03:29.030> uh<00:03:29.209> sort<00:03:30.050> of<00:03:30.080> in<00:03:30.230> in

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
it was kind of always uh sort of in in

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.470 
it was kind of always uh sort of in in
the<00:03:30.620> back<00:03:30.739> of<00:03:30.860> our<00:03:30.920> minds<00:03:31.099> and<00:03:31.400> I<00:03:31.670> had<00:03:32.330> always

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
the back of our minds and I had always

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.780 
the back of our minds and I had always
hoped<00:03:32.750> someday<00:03:33.650> that<00:03:34.040> he<00:03:34.310> could<00:03:34.520> try<00:03:34.760> to

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
hoped someday that he could try to

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.460 
hoped someday that he could try to
qualify<00:03:35.270> for<00:03:35.300> a<00:03:35.510> race<00:03:35.660> while<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:35.930> was<00:03:36.200> trying<00:03:36.410> to

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
qualify for a race while I was trying to

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.630 
qualify for a race while I was trying to
qualify<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.860> just<00:03:37.130> thought<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.370> would<00:03:37.489> be<00:03:37.520> a

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
qualify I just thought that would be a

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.640 
qualify I just thought that would be a
really<00:03:37.849> really<00:03:38.300> cool<00:03:38.480> thing<00:03:41.530> we<00:03:42.530> weren't

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
really really cool thing we weren't

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.470 
really really cool thing we weren't
really<00:03:42.770> planning<00:03:43.040> this<00:03:43.220> year<00:03:43.489> I<00:03:43.640> didn't<00:03:44.420> know

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
really planning this year I didn't know

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.800 
really planning this year I didn't know
if<00:03:44.569> he<00:03:44.660> was<00:03:44.810> quite<00:03:44.989> ready<00:03:45.280> but<00:03:46.690> seeing<00:03:47.690> how

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
if he was quite ready but seeing how
