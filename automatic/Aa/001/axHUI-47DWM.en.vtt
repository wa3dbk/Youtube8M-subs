00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello how are my name is joseph and 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.300
 techno fanatic dotcom and because of that 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.450
 There have been many doubts after I raised 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.690
 Video cases versus mini Annex 7 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.789
 here then let's clear up the doubts for 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.770
 that we are all calm and not 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.510
 discuss gentlemen within the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.720
 comments so well let's go with the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.720
 video 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.849
 first of all I want to tell you that 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.160
 when I do a video analysis or a 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.920
 video where you compared two devices 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.449
 I do not marry the idea of these 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.920
 videos is to provide you 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.809
 information regarding those 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.449
 devices so that you can 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.390
 make a better decision at the moment of 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.430
 buy a product second place 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.040
 I can make mistakes I can make mistakes 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.019
 is human therefore I also have 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.030
 the opportunity to recognize and empower them 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.829
 informing them better is what happened in 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.720
 the previous video that unfortunately 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.970
 thanks to several comments that you 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.920
 they have done so effectively there 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.510
 made an error with respect to the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.960
 brightness of the screen and step to 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:13.080
 teach them in the part of 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.210
 settings a bright part screen 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.470
 bright because I had put the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.119
 maximum splendor and I had not noticed 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.760
 of what comes to be automatic brightness 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.830
 therefore we have already retired 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.590
 to accept and now yes gentlemen we are going to 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.430
 do the comparison not in more form 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.540
 just what in the previous video 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.390
 As I tell you, I had made the mistake 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.200
 so let's ask the question to the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.200
 two personal assistants 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.990
 images of beaches 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.670
 looking for images of beaches on the internet 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.550
 let's go here 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.880
 what we are going to do now is to teach 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.200
 you again the images so that 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.989
 you can 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.290
 draw your own conclusions of which 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.739
 You put 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.109
 it's better as far as you're concerned 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.090
 again I repeat are the tablets but 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.969
 in a considero I keep appearing 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.859
 more alive in the colors but I leave it 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.959
 to you that to make that decision 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:30.629
 let's show them some other 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.659
 definitive images when you go to 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.870
 make a pixel and you will see that 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:39.480
 indeed in Annex 7 you 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.370
 they will have a better quality at the moment 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.709
 that you enlarge the images by 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.260
 fact that it has more pixels per 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.639
 inch no but when you are 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.840
 seeing the images you can 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:54.560
 appreciate that in this case 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.870
 virtually the same look is considered 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.519
 in my personal point of view that I 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.489
 I have the two tablets in front of me 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.590
 they are brighter but it can be 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.669
 that is not so for you 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.669
 normally another image more 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:17.030
 and here we have another image 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.190
 then we also have another comment 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.810
 that someone tells me that we have 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.810
 been maybe doing the navigation 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.180
 using different connections 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.950
 wireless then we go again to 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.350
 teach you who is this way we are going to 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.940
 oils and here we go to signals that 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.410
 we are connected in wifi 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.630
 it's kind of 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.560
 established collection 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:47.440
 and here we have 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:49.989
 or f 16 then again let's do 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.920
 navigation tests 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.860
 let's go to chrome 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:59.510
 let's teach them again or eliminate 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.700
 the applications that we had open 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.340
 so that you have an idea in the 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.620
 ipad mini I have 380 megabytes 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.579
 available in this house I have around 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.739
 700 720 700 gigabytes available and 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.980
 what we are going to do now is go to 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.980
 chrome 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.170
 let's erase here 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.080
 we 're really going to do everything 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:30.720
 so I hope 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.720
 with a new tab and 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.050
 you are going to see today 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.050
 the knee above 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.760
 both the mine and this one 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.580
 and it's already on 27 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.560
 you can usually see there the 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.900
 brilliance in terms of the screen the 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.750
 colors on the ipad I keep saying they look 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.200
 brighter and more alive but good 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.830
 Let's go to another one 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.830
 Imagine 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:14.539
 let's see what is a page that has 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:14.539
 many videos as they bring images 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.500
 and it appears that already the good and 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.710
 practically downloaded 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.660
 and there is also 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.889
 Annex 7 is like you download it and 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.110
 again 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.110
 it begins to download but it is already 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.569
 now we are going to 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.569
 another page 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.270
 again in the tab we're going to 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:50.419
 support today of other favorite pages 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.870
 and if not seen which one came out first but 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:03.080
 also another one and we're going to like a 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:08.650
 last that is the diary that I always 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.650
 I read online the trade goes 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.640
 first in Annex 7 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:25.600
 but there was not this tight well 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.460
 again we are going to 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.470
 you can see while it has 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:35.610
 closed the window 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.610
 let's open the tab was 1 2 3 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:50.530
 It is 7 then there you have seen 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:52.060
 that I open different windows or 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.160
 sorry different web pages do not 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.870
 only mine not and you have been able 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.710
 appreciate that in the four pages 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.430
 that I have opened on the ipad has been 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:04.960
 thousandths of a second faster 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:06.760
 possibly so no it is not that point 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.690
 so that one can make the decision at 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.880
 end of the video that I made on the day 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.650
 Yesterday I told them what they are 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.250
 for me the important points for 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.360
 to be able to make a decision at the moment of 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.500
 buy one of these products in case 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.200
 who have not seen it, just do 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.940
 click here so they can enter the 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.430
 video where he compared in many 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.050
 aspects both tablets hopefully 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.200
 I liked this video again I ask 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:36.310
 apologies for what happened previously 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:39.169
 and there is always a possibility to be able 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:42.169
 consider a point that has 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:44.330
 possibly that wrong way is the 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:46.069
 case of the previous video that was 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.270
 so so again he apologized 

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:48.469
 gentlemen and good hope that you have 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.879
 liked this video not only in that click 

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:51.050
 in the milestone above we forget 

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:52.520
 subscribe to our channel to follow 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.800
 receiving more information or repeating 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.509
 technology in my name jose de techno
