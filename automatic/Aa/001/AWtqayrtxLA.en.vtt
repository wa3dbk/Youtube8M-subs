it where you cannot is a Ferrari 355 but

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.020 
it where you cannot is a Ferrari 355 but
the<00:02:32.260> best<00:02:32.530> car<00:02:32.920> ever<00:02:33.390> in<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.570> history<00:02:34.690> of

the best car ever in the history of

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.380 
the best car ever in the history of
you'll<00:02:37.030> see<00:02:37.240> cuz<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.810> might<00:02:38.050> not<00:02:38.290> be<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.650> 3.5

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
you'll see cuz it might not be the 3.5

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.330 
you'll see cuz it might not be the 3.5
so<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:40.540> not<00:02:40.690> when<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.470> say<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:41.860> best<00:02:42.070> car
