00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
of movement you can see how slender it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.789 
of movement you can see how slender it
is<00:01:17.000> on<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.450> design<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.289> it's<00:01:18.409> going<00:01:18.500> to<00:01:18.560> tuck

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.139 
also anodized it's attached to a steel
cord<00:01:35.960> in<00:01:36.109> a<00:01:36.259> figure<00:01:36.710> 8<00:01:36.920> configuration<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:37.969> when

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
cord in a figure 8 configuration so when

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.870 
cord in a figure 8 configuration so when
you<00:01:38.240> turn<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.659> dial<00:01:39.280> it's<00:01:40.280> gonna<00:01:40.520> distribute

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
you turn the dial it's gonna distribute

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.700 
you turn the dial it's gonna distribute
even<00:01:41.509> tension<00:01:41.719> through<00:01:42.049> the<00:01:42.079> back<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.380> your

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
even tension through the back of your

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.709 
even tension through the back of your
knee<00:01:42.799> so<00:01:43.070> it's<00:01:43.189> really<00:01:43.549> secure<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.119> it's<00:01:44.539> not

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
knee so it's really secure and it's not

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.230 
knee so it's really secure and it's not
gonna<00:01:44.899> slip<00:01:45.619> as<00:01:45.859> you're<00:01:46.100> riding<00:01:46.429> and<00:01:46.579> what's

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
gonna slip as you're riding and what's

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.819 
gonna slip as you're riding and what's
really<00:01:47.390> cool<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:47.869> they've<00:01:48.049> done<00:01:48.229> is<00:01:48.469> they've

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
really cool that they've done is they've

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.679 
really cool that they've done is they've
added<00:01:49.039> a<00:01:49.250> sequence<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:49.880> how<00:01:50.119> you're<00:01:50.329> supposed

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
added a sequence and how you're supposed

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.840 
added a sequence and how you're supposed
to<00:01:50.840> strap<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.469> brace<00:01:51.649> up<00:01:51.890> for<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.219> proper<00:01:52.609> fit

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
to strap the brace up for the proper fit

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.910 
to strap the brace up for the proper fit
because<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.600> is<00:01:53.780> very<00:01:54.109> important<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:54.740> won't

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
because that is very important it won't

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.800 
because that is very important it won't
do<00:01:55.070> its<00:01:55.219> job<00:01:55.429> unless<00:01:56.030> it's<00:01:56.299> on<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.600> body

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
do its job unless it's on the body

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.779 
do its job unless it's on the body
correctly<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:57.710> this<00:01:57.829> thing<00:01:58.009> is<00:01:58.130> very<00:01:58.369> easy<00:01:58.640> to

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
correctly so this thing is very easy to

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.060 
correctly so this thing is very easy to
get<00:01:59.060> in<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.390> out<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.689> you<00:01:59.929> have<00:02:00.109> a<00:02:00.289> tab<00:02:00.619> in<00:02:00.890> the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
get in and out of you have a tab in the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.649 
get in and out of you have a tab in the
front<00:02:01.219> which<00:02:01.759> then<00:02:01.999> releases<00:02:02.270> that

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
front which then releases that

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.719 
front which then releases that
figure-eight<00:02:03.140> cable<00:02:03.679> so<00:02:03.829> you<00:02:03.859> can<00:02:04.070> then<00:02:04.310> slide

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
figure-eight cable so you can then slide

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.279 
figure-eight cable so you can then slide
your<00:02:04.939> leg<00:02:05.090> through<00:02:05.329> and<00:02:05.600> then<00:02:05.960> just<00:02:06.140> follow

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
your leg through and then just follow

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.109 
your leg through and then just follow
with<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.679> rest<00:02:06.859> of<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.039> steps<00:02:07.310> it's<00:02:07.759> numbered

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
with the rest of the steps it's numbered

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.600 
with the rest of the steps it's numbered
so<00:02:08.300> it's<00:02:08.450> very<00:02:08.690> easy<00:02:08.959> I<00:02:09.080> really<00:02:09.500> like<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:09.860> the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
so it's very easy I really like that the

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.009 
so it's very easy I really like that the
first<00:02:10.849> strap<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.209> going<00:02:11.239> to<00:02:11.390> go<00:02:11.510> around<00:02:11.840> the

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
first strap is going to go around the

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.350 
first strap is going to go around the
cap<00:02:12.260> when<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.099> move<00:02:13.250> on<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.519> the<00:02:13.640> second<00:02:14.000> step

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
cap when you move on to the second step

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.660 
cap when you move on to the second step
that's<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.660> dial<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.620> CCR<00:02:16.250> s<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
that's the dial so the CCR s the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.000 
that's the dial so the CCR s the
continues<00:02:17.150> cable<00:02:17.540> routing<00:02:17.870> system<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:18.650> as<00:02:18.830> you

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
continues cable routing system so as you

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.650 
continues cable routing system so as you
turn<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:19.610> going<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.820> evenly<00:02:20.240> dispersed

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
turn that it's going to evenly dispersed

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.300 
turn that it's going to evenly dispersed
that<00:02:20.840> tension<00:02:21.320> through<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.560> back<00:02:21.740> portion<00:02:22.040> of

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
that tension through the back portion of

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.710 
that tension through the back portion of
your<00:02:22.580> knee<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.910> make<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.210> really<00:02:23.510> nice<00:02:23.690> and

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
your knee to make it really nice and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.840 
your knee to make it really nice and
secure<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.620> brace<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.070> then<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:25.670> have

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
secure in the brace and then you have

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.580 
secure in the brace and then you have
supporting<00:02:26.390> straps<00:02:26.690> toward<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.140> bottom<00:02:27.320> of

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
supporting straps toward the bottom of

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.500 
supporting straps toward the bottom of
the<00:02:27.710> leg<00:02:27.890> like<00:02:28.400> number<00:02:28.700> three<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.180> then

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
the leg like number three and then

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.330 
the leg like number three and then
number<00:02:29.810> four<00:02:30.020> at<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.440> top<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.860> thigh

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
number four at the top of the thigh

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.390 
number four at the top of the thigh
so<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.300> VA<00:02:32.570> foam<00:02:32.930> makes<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.470> very<00:02:33.710> comfortable

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
so a VA foam makes it very comfortable

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.340 
so a VA foam makes it very comfortable
