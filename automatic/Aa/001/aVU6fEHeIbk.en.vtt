00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
noise in this is the impact band for the

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.190 
noise in this is the impact band for the
samsung<00:00:10.590> galaxy<00:00:10.950> s3<00:00:11.099> from<00:00:11.910> tech<00:00:12.210> 21<00:00:12.900> we've<00:00:13.110> got

samsung galaxy s3 from tech 21 we've got

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.870 
samsung galaxy s3 from tech 21 we've got
some<00:00:13.320> really<00:00:13.469> nice<00:00:13.620> packaging<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.460> one<00:00:14.670> i

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
some really nice packaging on this one i

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.369 
some really nice packaging on this one i
just<00:00:15.330> want<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.509> concentrate<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.199> bat<00:00:16.350> a

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
just want to concentrate on the bat a

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.410 
just want to concentrate on the bat a
little<00:00:16.529> bit<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:16.920> explains<00:00:17.430> about<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.820> d3o

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
little bit this explains about the d3o

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.210 
little bit this explains about the d3o
technology<00:00:19.170> that's<00:00:19.380> built<00:00:19.529> into<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.980> band

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
technology that's built into the band

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.349 
technology that's built into the band
what<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.270> 30<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.590> pliable<00:00:22.949> material

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
what the 30 is is a pliable material

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.330 
what the 30 is is a pliable material
that<00:00:24.359> actually<00:00:24.840> becomes<00:00:25.289> more<00:00:25.560> rigid<00:00:26.010> when<00:00:26.220> it

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
that actually becomes more rigid when it

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.460 
that actually becomes more rigid when it
meets<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.849> resistance<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:28.019> drop<00:00:28.289> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
meets a resistance so if you do drop the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.519 
meets a resistance so if you do drop the
phone<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.400> orange<00:00:30.000> part<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.900> case<00:00:31.109> you're

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
phone the orange part of the case you're

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.500 
phone the orange part of the case you're
going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.740> see<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> minute<00:00:32.189> actually<00:00:32.850> give

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
going to see in a minute actually give

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.560 
going to see in a minute actually give
you<00:00:33.630> extra<00:00:34.079> impact<00:00:34.620> protection<00:00:35.420> so<00:00:36.420> let's

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
you extra impact protection so let's

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.530 
you extra impact protection so let's
take<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.930> out<00:00:37.170> now<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.070> band<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.360> goes

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
take this out now is a band so this goes

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.479 
take this out now is a band so this goes
around<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.110> edges<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> phone<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.399> they

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
around the edges of the phone but they

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.700 
around the edges of the phone but they
have<00:00:41.640> also<00:00:41.730> supplied<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.600> clear<00:00:43.110> sort<00:00:43.590> of

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
have also supplied this clear sort of

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.340 
have also supplied this clear sort of
plastic<00:00:44.219> back<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.789> go<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> back<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
plastic back to go on to the back of the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.660 
plastic back to go on to the back of the
phone<00:00:46.530> as<00:00:46.710> well<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.190> gives<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.460> little

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
phone as well so it gives you a little

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.569 
phone as well so it gives you a little
bit<00:00:47.820> extra<00:00:48.059> protection<00:00:48.660> from<00:00:48.780> scratches<00:00:49.579> so

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
bit extra protection from scratches so

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.220 
bit extra protection from scratches so
let's<00:00:50.789> pop<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.120> into<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.570> case<00:00:51.750> first<00:00:52.020> of

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
let's pop this into the case first of

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
let's pop this into the case first of
all<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:54.350> we<00:00:55.350> offer<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> phone<00:00:56.039> up

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
all like so and we offer the phone up

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.029 
all like so and we offer the phone up
we're<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.489> control<00:00:57.000> side<00:00:57.270> first<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.039> it's

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
we're going control side first and it's

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.590 
we're going control side first and it's
a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.190> bit<00:00:59.309> tricky<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.820> get<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.420> into

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
a little bit tricky to get this one into

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.779 
a little bit tricky to get this one into
the<00:01:00.899> case<00:01:01.620> actually<00:01:01.920> because<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the case actually because you have to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.920 
the case actually because you have to
keep<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.300> back<00:01:03.930> portion<00:01:04.500> lined<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.400> straw

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
keep that back portion lined up or straw

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.780 
keep that back portion lined up or straw
pushing<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.290> impact<00:01:07.860> band<00:01:08.130> around<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> sides

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
pushing the impact band around the sides

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.840 
pushing the impact band around the sides
of<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> phone<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.950> there<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.280> go<00:01:11.340> that's<00:01:11.640> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
of the phone so there we go that's it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.310 
of the phone so there we go that's it
sort<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.360> place<00:01:12.659> we're<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
sort of in place we're just going to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.840 
sort of in place we're just going to
look<00:01:13.890> around<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> edges<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.670> check

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
look around the edges and check

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.969 
look around the edges and check
everything's<00:01:15.270> lined<00:01:15.570> up<00:01:15.780> properly<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.950> then

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
everything's lined up properly and then

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.980 
everything's lined up properly and then
we<00:01:17.400> look<00:01:17.520> round<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.790> back<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.659> that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
we look round the back you can see that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.640 
we look round the back you can see that
this<00:01:19.080> plastic<00:01:19.710> portion<00:01:19.950> has<00:01:20.570> moved<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.990> this

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
this plastic portion has moved and this

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.289 
this plastic portion has moved and this
is<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:22.890> second<00:01:23.369> attempt<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.090> in

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
is my second attempt to get in this in

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.649 
is my second attempt to get in this in
so<00:01:24.570> very<00:01:24.900> tricky<00:01:25.409> case<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.009> actually<00:01:26.659> install

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
so very tricky case to actually install

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.050 
so very tricky case to actually install
let's<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.470> try<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.740> again<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.850> try<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
let's just try that again but try a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.670 
let's just try that again but try a
different<00:01:30.420> way<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.689> time<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.290> line<00:01:31.500> this

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
different way this time so we line this

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.749 
different way this time so we line this
up<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> back<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:33.979> we're<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.250> control

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
up on the back and we're going control

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.859 
up on the back and we're going control
side<00:01:36.060> first<00:01:36.360> again<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:40.850> he's<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.150> phone<00:01:42.390> into

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
side first again and he's the phone into

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.350 
side first again and he's the phone into
the<00:01:42.899> case<00:01:45.680> like<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.100> let's<00:01:47.820> look<00:01:48.000> around<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
the case like so let's look around the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.730 
the case like so let's look around the
back<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.930> little<00:01:49.049> bit<00:01:49.259> better<00:01:49.409> but

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
back so that's a little bit better but

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.560 
back so that's a little bit better but
you<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:49.950> still<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> really

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
you can still see that this is a really

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.200 
you can still see that this is a really
hard<00:01:51.780> case<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.140> fit<00:01:52.500> very<00:01:52.770> frustrating<00:01:53.610> that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
hard case to fit very frustrating that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.359 
hard case to fit very frustrating that
there's<00:01:54.450> no<00:01:54.659> easy<00:01:55.020> way<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.590> actually<00:01:56.130> getting

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
there's no easy way of actually getting

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.760 
there's no easy way of actually getting
this<00:01:56.640> back<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.090> place<00:01:57.390> now<00:01:58.290> I'm<00:01:58.439> showing<00:01:58.710> you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
this back in place now I'm showing you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.319 
this back in place now I'm showing you
this<00:01:58.920> how<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.310> because<00:01:59.700> we're<00:02:00.180> going<00:02:00.270> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
this how it is because we're going to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.789 
this how it is because we're going to
get<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> same<00:02:00.780> frustration<00:02:01.409> if<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.590> buy<00:02:01.740> this

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
get the same frustration if you buy this

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.010 
get the same frustration if you buy this
case<00:02:02.189> let's<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:02.670> rid<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.180> perspex<00:02:03.719> part

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
case let's get rid of the perspex part

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.760 
case let's get rid of the perspex part
and<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:05.030> put<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.299> impact<00:02:06.840> band<00:02:07.140> around<00:02:07.439> and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
and just put the impact band around and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.859 
and just put the impact band around and
that's<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.789> much<00:02:09.000> easier<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.569> install

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
that's just so much easier to install

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.510 
that's just so much easier to install
without<00:02:10.319> having<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.800> deal<00:02:11.009> with<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.250> piece

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
without having to deal with this piece

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.540 
without having to deal with this piece
of<00:02:11.700> perspex

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
of perspex

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.930 
of perspex
there<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.270> no<00:02:13.450> way<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.920> can<00:02:14.950> get<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.400> perspex

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
there is no way you can get the perspex

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.440 
there is no way you can get the perspex
in<00:02:16.180> after<00:02:16.930> you've<00:02:17.800> put<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.280> main<00:02:18.580> impact<00:02:19.210> band

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
in after you've put the main impact band

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.230 
in after you've put the main impact band
on<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:19.990> would<00:02:20.290> probably<00:02:20.440> not<00:02:21.430> use<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:21.910> I

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
on so I would probably not use this I

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.870 
on so I would probably not use this I
would<00:02:23.110> just<00:02:23.140> use<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.710> impact<00:02:24.130> man<00:02:24.340> by<00:02:24.550> itself

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
would just use the impact man by itself

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.000 
would just use the impact man by itself
now<00:02:25.240> mention<00:02:25.660> these<00:02:25.810> orange<00:02:26.260> portions<00:02:26.740> on<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
now mention these orange portions on the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.160 
now mention these orange portions on the
case<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.460> this<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.700> where<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:27.970> d3o<00:02:28.510> material

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
case and this is where the d3o material

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.830 
case and this is where the d3o material
lives<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:30.220> these<00:02:30.400> are<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.640> parts<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.150> if<00:02:31.660> you

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
lives so these are the parts that if you

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.420 
lives so these are the parts that if you
do<00:02:31.990> get<00:02:32.110> an<00:02:32.230> impact<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:32.920> drop<00:02:33.220> your<00:02:33.400> phone

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
do get an impact and you drop your phone

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.910 
do get an impact and you drop your phone
these<00:02:33.880> are<00:02:34.000> going<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.210> go<00:02:34.300> more<00:02:34.600> rigid<00:02:35.020> so<00:02:35.800> it's

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
these are going to go more rigid so it's

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.340 
these are going to go more rigid so it's
a<00:02:35.980> nice-looking<00:02:36.480> band<00:02:37.480> for<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.870> case<00:02:38.140> it

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
a nice-looking band for the case it

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.490 
a nice-looking band for the case it
offers<00:02:38.560> up<00:02:38.680> minimal<00:02:38.980> protection<00:02:39.250> obviously

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
offers up minimal protection obviously

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.630 
offers up minimal protection obviously
with<00:02:41.500> regards<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.070> back<00:02:42.250> you're<00:02:42.550> still

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
with regards to the back you're still

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.280 
with regards to the back you're still
going<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:42.880> get<00:02:43.000> these<00:02:43.240> scratches<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.140> back

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
going to get these scratches on the back

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.650 
going to get these scratches on the back
cause<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.800> phone<00:02:45.040> unless<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:46.000> manage<00:02:46.270> to<00:02:46.450> fit

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
cause the phone unless you manage to fit

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.600 
cause the phone unless you manage to fit
this<00:02:46.810> in<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.290> get<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.500> lined<00:02:47.740> up<00:02:47.950> properly<00:02:48.190> so

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
this in and get it lined up properly so

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.090 
this in and get it lined up properly so
I'm<00:02:49.420> not<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.780> great<00:02:50.050> fan<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.350> this<00:02:50.560> case<00:02:50.830> the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
I'm not a great fan of this case the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.940 
I'm not a great fan of this case the
actual<00:02:51.370> price<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:52.030> prohibitive<00:02:52.600> as<00:02:52.720> well<00:02:52.950> 16

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
actual price is prohibitive as well 16

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.550 
actual price is prohibitive as well 16
pounds<00:02:54.490> which<00:02:54.790> isn't<00:02:55.210> too<00:02:55.420> bad<00:02:55.690> but<00:02:56.020> if<00:02:56.440> you're

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
pounds which isn't too bad but if you're

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.510 
pounds which isn't too bad but if you're
in<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.770> u.s.<00:02:57.040> you're<00:02:57.220> going<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.400> pay

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
in the u.s. you're going to pay

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.820 
in the u.s. you're going to pay
thirty-eight<00:02:58.330> dollars<00:02:58.690> which<00:02:59.170> is<00:02:59.320> just<00:02:59.440> far

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
thirty-eight dollars which is just far

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.310 
thirty-eight dollars which is just far
too<00:02:59.890> much<00:03:00.340> for<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.730> case<00:03:00.940> like<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.420> so<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:02.230> think

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
too much for a case like this so I think

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.780 
too much for a case like this so I think
one<00:03:02.710> they<00:03:02.890> need<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.250> bring<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.520> price<00:03:03.730> down

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
one they need to bring the price down

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.930 
one they need to bring the price down
and<00:03:04.300> two<00:03:05.110> they<00:03:05.710> need<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:06.040> maybe<00:03:06.190> find<00:03:06.640> some

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
and two they need to maybe find some

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.880 
and two they need to maybe find some
sort<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.180> channeling<00:03:07.750> system<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.740> actually

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
sort of channeling system to actually

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.730 
sort of channeling system to actually
locate<00:03:09.220> this<00:03:09.700> perspex<00:03:10.390> part<00:03:10.750> in<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.410> back<00:03:11.590> of
