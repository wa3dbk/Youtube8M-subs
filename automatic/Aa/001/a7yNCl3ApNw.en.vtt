00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.430
 boil blue 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.250
 then it will be the first stage 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.670
 cooking our dishes at this stage 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.210
 we are about cooking eggplants 4 liters of water 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.810
 there we will add 60 grams of salt in this 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.460
 salted water we boil eggplants 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.090
 10-15 minutes while they fall through 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.820
 eggplant we will prepare the filling for 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.140
 we will try this on a coarse grater 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.990
 carrot and chop through garlic 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.060
 garlic here we have crushed the filling now 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.049
 we add salt to it and carefully 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.049
 mix 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.750
 after the blue boil 15 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.560
 minutes we take them out of the water and now 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.140
 you need to put them under any under 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.689
 any arbitrary press to 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.909
 remove from them excess moisture under the press 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.640
 eggplants need to be kept around 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.759
 four hours, for example, I use here 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.110
 outdoor grid grill laid out all 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.330
 eggplant on the grid I put another top 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.880
 a small bucket with water 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.179
 with instrument design endure our 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.090
 about four o'clock eggplants 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.910
 removed and now we will fill 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:20.340
 we will fill this way 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:26.450
 cut the eggplant in halves but not until 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.450
 end and add the stuffing in the middle 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.819
 slightly presses we lay in 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.819
 saucepan 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.090
 so do all of our 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.090
 eggplants 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:52.829
 and now we fill them with vegetable oil 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.140
 we need him half a liter further us 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.829
 will be required 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.590
 cover it all with a piece of gauze like this 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.930
 here begins the process of staining they 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.730
 must curse calico will be for three 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.599
 four days at room temperature 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.409
 and so here it is in four days 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.659
 our eggplants were beautiful about painting 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.930
 so they have a sectional view 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.359
 so these eggplants will go great 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.049
 as an independent snack or as 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:28.409
