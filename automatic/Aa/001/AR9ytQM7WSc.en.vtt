00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.320
 you are you and I am me and that 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.120
 That's good too 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.289
 together we are we 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:22.550
 but before it's me and you one 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:30.230
 how does 1 need to be clarified who are you? 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:32.669
 I bother at all I am I am 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.700
 that does not quite explain it to me 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.110
 am motivated engaged 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.879
 markus bretz to eat and am 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.969
 damn good forget 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.270
 I 'm lazy when interest is more necessary 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.180
 and what if something completely banal 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.489
 I like to stand in front of my alarm clock 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.570
 and I'm so damned damn bad 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.899
 but anyway I am thoughtful 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.359
 especially when it comes to people what 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.000
 they do what they want what they think 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.570
 and if they are driving they are lonely or 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.030
 Not 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.439
 take or give an assist 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:16.500
 and most importantly they are real and were 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.810
 and net and really not 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.460
 artificially in this evil way and are 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.440
 you there and pay attention to you 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.530
 what do they like and what would they be 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.040
 what are you waiting for? 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.740
 what would you hate her if we did 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.619
 let's hear it inside us 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.270
 To whom would we reveal all this 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.159
 our parents a 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.290
 they would already know ours 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:49.030
 friends no, that's just that 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:53.630
 what they know now and who they are 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.520
 then who the question of all questions on the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.160
 Nobody can really give an answer 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.729
 so let's do it this way 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.970
 try together to achieve all that 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.450
 We therefore let us say who we are 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.759
 are 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.920
 Essens reveal what we like best 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.860
 read or talk about what we like or 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.160
 what is quite banal is our favorite place 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.110
 So tell me who are you or better 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.700
 who are you you do not have to 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.530
 write down a life story or 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.140
 tell what you do at night but 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.160
 For example, if you really burden me 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.950
 then that would be clarified that we who you 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.810
 You are how I am and what connects us 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.660
 for a whole one big one 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.700
 thus can be digressed but 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.450
 do that we do not want to 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.230
 we'll see each other and do not forget 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.660
 write 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.660
 who is that you ever 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.660
