00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.070
 clash of clans and today I have again 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.540
 a pure fun attack for you 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:29.769
 15 healers and alone and the fines 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:35.920
 kings and the barbarian king 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:40.390
 So first of all I really want the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.400
 market the market 1002 how 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.019
 200 a thank very hard for 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.000
 wall breaker looks like it sounded to me 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.120
 team has given 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.890
 So thank you very much and again 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.720
 I also want to thank the news very hard 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.220
 before it left a whole level 3 left me 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.400
 has given 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:02.049
 so thank you both guys 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.100
 so let's go until the attack goes on 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.049
 actually it was intended 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.970
 that I only git the barbarian king 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.920
 use 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.580
 but that 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.170
 so is not really i have that and my 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.939
 forests to score in anyway 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.360
 put on what else I really had 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:25.320
 Lost where I thinking 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:29.049
 but how do i do it then i start with 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.780
 the barbarians cooling wallah 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.229
 dari is there it is coming the wall 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.689
 crushers and the entire level 3 to 4 der 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.310
 second skies and let me through the wall 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.640
 not immediately broken 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.190
 that's unfortunate else barbarians 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.569
 king of being able to go straight through 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.979
 to go 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:52.210
 so there you see go through hitler's already 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.869
 Pillowcases are all tip or folded 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.869
 was very unfortunate 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.590
 there goes the wrong way when he 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.780
 this is what the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.140
 they could have broken that anti-aircraft 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.870
 but with the sky or here is now 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.569
 ar ben here is popping and there 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.020
 he also has ready troops 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.830
 I also do terrible 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.830
 so was really a shame 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.310
 so there it will be mine soon 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.600
 archers king for that anti-aircraft 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.709
 can destroy what else it goes 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.709
 really did not end well 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.970
 all right 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.610
 so there the air or here is minutes and 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.049
 oh and there are six built on you 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.659
 but the king goes well to the center 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:03:00.900
 of the bass and goes for the 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.519
 for the the town hall it stays in it 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.340
 city ​​hall not yet in front of the town hall and 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.840
 there came and what does he do whole 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.629
 wrong direction and does not go 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.650
 the urban saying is lax and that is 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.650
 not the intention 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.459
 fortunately there are also enough lieler 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.459
 nail on to keep the good and 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.629
 so a routes bridge grows there that I 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.159
 did not want to use but different 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.040
 I didn't make it because we were 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:41.299
 really only 30 seconds left and different 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.299
 I didn't make it at all 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.989
 I had to do the green now otherwise I had 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.190
 but 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.190
 41% there them 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.570
 but there is the 50% oh 50% 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:10.150
 and there was the attack actually 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:23.770
 pretty hard failed was nicer can 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:28.630
 do not go well as you should 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:30.610
 lembeek 123 has only 3 left 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.650
 lost a defense 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.520
 so that's pretty good for a base 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.200
 william also use 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:41.700
 go ahead and let them go really well 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.700
 must here is also the level 6 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:56.979
 but call because and asked if that's me 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.960
 that I could often train sweaters but 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.560
 that you enjoy being around 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.460
 you have been given my ubrique 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.460
 oh that 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.479
 and this was it again for this one 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:16.690
 desk delivery headline that you like 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:19.840
 find give more ideas in the responses 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.380
