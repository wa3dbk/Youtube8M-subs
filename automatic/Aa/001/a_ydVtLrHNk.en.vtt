decent<00:01:12.570> microphone<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.290> always<00:01:13.380> get<00:01:13.530> a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
decent microphone I can always get a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.830 
decent microphone I can always get a
better<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.220> need<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:17.659> have<00:01:18.659> this

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
better one if I need and I have this

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.109 
better one if I need and I have this
brand<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.380> antenna<00:01:19.860> running<00:01:20.400> outside<00:01:20.850> it's

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
brand of antenna running outside it's

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.469 
brand of antenna running outside it's
the<00:01:22.310> Sochi<00:01:23.310> antenna<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.939> think<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.390> I

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the Sochi antenna I think that's I

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.609 
the Sochi antenna I think that's I
pronounce<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.560> starters

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
pronounce it this is just for starters

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.990 
pronounce it this is just for starters
as<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.280> said<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:26.850> better

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
as I said I'm going to get better

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.330 
as I said I'm going to get better
equipment<00:01:27.450> soon<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.590> kind<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.829> get<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.189> with

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
equipment soon as I kind of get in with

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.460 
equipment soon as I kind of get in with
the<00:01:29.460> intent<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> hobby<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.079> CB

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the intent with the hobby it's a CB

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.679 
the intent with the hobby it's a CB
antenna<00:01:31.650> with<00:01:32.579> magnetic<00:01:33.030> mount<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.600> is

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
antenna with magnetic mount so this is

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.990 
antenna with magnetic mount so this is
for<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> car<00:01:34.170> car<00:01:35.070> mount<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> looks<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:35.880> on

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
for a car car mount if it looks like on

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.670 
for a car car mount if it looks like on
the<00:01:36.090> back<00:01:36.240> there<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.790> outside

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
the back there and that's it outside

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.450 
the back there and that's it outside
that<00:01:40.680> little<00:01:40.799> metal<00:01:41.570> coil<00:01:42.570> thing<00:01:43.280> that's<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
that little metal coil thing that's the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.429 
that little metal coil thing that's the
spring<00:01:44.850> base<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.390> actually<00:01:45.630> mounted<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
spring base it's actually mounted on the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.050 
spring base it's actually mounted on the
metal<00:01:46.799> part<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> air<00:01:47.340> conditioner<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:47.970> you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
metal part of the air conditioner if you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.719 
metal part of the air conditioner if you
can<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.890> don't<00:01:50.280> really<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.549> anything

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
can see so I don't really have anything

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.340 
can see so I don't really have anything
because<00:01:51.299> I'm<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> second<00:01:51.930> floor<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.320> I

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
because I'm on the second floor so I

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.069 
because I'm on the second floor so I
can't<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:52.950> run<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> huge<00:01:53.430> 2x4<00:01:54.149> down<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.990> get

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
can't really run a huge 2x4 down and get

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.450 
can't really run a huge 2x4 down and get
a<00:01:55.110> different<00:01:55.470> one<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:55.590> even<00:01:55.770> mount<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.250> whole

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
a different one or even mount the whole

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.580 
a different one or even mount the whole
thing<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.790> side<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.119> my<00:01:57.180> house<00:01:57.409> maybe<00:01:58.409> I'll

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
thing to the side of my house maybe I'll

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.219 
thing to the side of my house maybe I'll
do<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> future<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.700> don't<00:01:59.939> know

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
do that in the future but I don't know

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.350 
do that in the future but I don't know
so<00:02:01.229> that's<00:02:01.380> pretty<00:02:01.590> much<00:02:01.680> my<00:02:01.979> CB<00:02:02.369> radio<00:02:02.579> base
