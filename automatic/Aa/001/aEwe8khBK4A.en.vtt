00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
way down when the water comes up pushes

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.520 
way down when the water comes up pushes
out<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.119> air<00:01:57.270> when<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.719> goes<00:01:57.869> down<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.140> pulls

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
out the air when it goes down it pulls

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.940 
out the air when it goes down it pulls
in<00:01:58.770> there<00:01:59.270> now<00:02:00.270> over<00:02:00.509> here<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.869> side<00:02:00.950> this

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
drains down to there that water will

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.759 
drains down to there that water will
come<00:02:47.190> down<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.700> she'll<00:02:48.390> drain<00:02:48.720> into<00:02:49.260> here<00:02:49.590> and

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
come down and she'll drain into here and

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.039 
come down and she'll drain into here and
then<00:02:50.670> she'll<00:02:50.970> break<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.359> siphon<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:51.900> when

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
then she'll break the siphon and when

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.839 
then she'll break the siphon and when
this<00:02:52.170> comes<00:02:52.379> here<00:02:52.739> then<00:02:53.010> air<00:02:53.280> will<00:02:53.459> come<00:02:53.639> in

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
this comes here then air will come in

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.030 
this comes here then air will come in
and<00:02:54.060> now<00:02:54.150> she's<00:02:54.420> on<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.599> fill-up<00:02:54.900> mode<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.889> now

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
and now she's on the fill-up mode so now

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.349 
and now she's on the fill-up mode so now
this<00:02:56.220> water's<00:02:56.609> going<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.849> fill<00:02:57.030> all<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.329> way

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
this water's going to fill all the way

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.319 
this water's going to fill all the way
back<00:02:57.629> up<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.930> here<00:02:58.349> so<00:02:58.879> when<00:02:59.879> he<00:02:59.940> gets<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.239> the

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
back up to here so when he gets to the

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.750 
back up to here so when he gets to the
high<00:03:00.480> tide<00:03:00.780> mark<00:03:00.989> which<00:03:01.349> is<00:03:01.500> here<00:03:01.889> then<00:03:02.639> the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
high tide mark which is here then the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.460 
high tide mark which is here then the
water's<00:03:03.030> going<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.239> come<00:03:03.389> across<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:04.079> it's

going<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.680> go<00:03:04.859> down<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:05.579> going<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.760> come

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
going to go down and it's going to come

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.080 
going to go down and it's going to come
out<00:03:06.120> here<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:07.290> going<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.590> flow<00:03:07.799> through

out here it's going to flow through
until<00:03:09.090> he<00:03:09.150> gets<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.599> overflow<00:03:10.109> over<00:03:10.500> here

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
until he gets to the overflow over here

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.030 
until he gets to the overflow over here
and<00:03:11.489> then<00:03:11.700> it's<00:03:11.849> going<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.060> go<00:03:12.180> down<00:03:12.769> here<00:03:13.769> and
