 rpgs of the paper presents back 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:15.540
 fall and salty taste has invaded areas 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.950
 with difficulties only if 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.760
 until she opened her eyes. 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:26.900
 everything in general was then sand water 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.690
 Beautiful water and then back with taste 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.570
 in the mouth began to bother with a blues 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.800
 rose and pilot stumps felt the mouth 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.960
 dry only what came out was a cough 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.970
 the sky was strong and sought vision 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.720
 he has total arm and look 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.630
 some way I was on a beach full of 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.260
 wreckage cracked wooden barrels 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.170
 all the singing win a gigantic 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.540
 occurs the meeting some dexterity 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.540
 other side some trees that looked like 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.640
 to be part of some neighborhood movements 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.220
 thought he saw some moving 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.270
 quickly on screen but should be 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:12.200
 raving your mind preached tricks 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.390
 he walked troupe direction take place close 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.690
 of the water was weak 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.300
 dehydrated did not know much time was 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:25.580
 free and realized that he did not even know 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.600
 where he better did not know nor who 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.270
 he was 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.630
 arrived debris and managed to recognize 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.619
 who were part of a large vessel 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.020
 and powerful but completely destroyed 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.450
 noted that the surrounding countries were 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.590
 filled with gold that had spread 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.659
 all over the beach glittering in the sand 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.280
 even though I could not force myself 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.689
 andradine 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.820
 entered a vessel through a hole in the 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.920
 case even on the inside 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:02.109
 encountered other people alive or dead 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.439
 at each step the cover head more than 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:08.259
 more confusion and a staircase partially 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.899
 damaged after giving a little arrived 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.370
 what looked like a kitchen and sighted 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.950
 fruits scattered on the ground and 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.049
 quickly picked up a few sat on the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.510
 ground and started to eat but in the 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.380
 first bite your mouth what happened 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.599
 they were all messed up 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.440
 salty was so hungry that poorly 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.220
 noticed the state of them struggled to 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.260
 rise 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.049
 the effort was too much for your body 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.410
 malnutrition tried in vain to hold on to 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:42.340
 something but could not and went straight to the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.799
 ground something fall from your bearded clothes 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.370
 took what appeared to be a medallion 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.560
 there was no symbol like a shield 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.489
 surrounded by some kind of bird 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.450
 Stranger could not recognize that 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.950
 he would be walking with that 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.230
 got up and continue to search the 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.140
 boat hoping to find 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.170
 something to help you about the goal and not 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.610
 found nobody or anything but wreckage 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.819
 from useless things remnants of destruction 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.160
 finally the deck went up to the mast 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.140
 was shattered and blocked. 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.049
 the way to a room well the journey 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.239
 who was at the end with much effort and 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.200
 removed part of the wreckage 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.750
 enough to get in there 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.360
 nothing was a cabin like the furniture 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.180
 intact, scattered or knocked over 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.329
 until in a corner I saw / worried 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.950
 The album was taken from there and revealed in 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:48.430
 under day 31 a very rich chest in 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.560
 details and very heavy also tried 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.940
 to unsuccessfully open 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.670
 It was locked like opening that chest. 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:01.030
 conquered therein the legacy aid 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.889
 of such destruction would be worth the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.230
 Worth wasting your time with him. 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.230
 could there be no curse
