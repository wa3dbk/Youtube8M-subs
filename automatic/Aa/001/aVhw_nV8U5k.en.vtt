which you've well I think I think the

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.010 
which you've well I think I think the
thing<00:05:59.890> and<00:06:00.890> I<00:06:01.340> was<00:06:01.790> told<00:06:02.060> this<00:06:02.300> so<00:06:02.720> you<00:06:02.780> guys

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020

he's<00:06:04.730> third<00:06:05.180> or<00:06:05.360> fourth<00:06:05.600> in<00:06:05.750> the<00:06:05.840> league<00:06:05.990> and

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
he's third or fourth in the league and

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.190 
he's third or fourth in the league and
consecutive<00:06:06.830> games<00:06:07.010> played<00:06:07.160> is<00:06:07.790> that<00:06:07.970> correct

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
consecutive games played is that correct

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.050
