00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000 
her spare shooting but as we said before
there's<00:04:06.450> a<00:04:06.510> lot<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.990> oil<00:04:07.260> in<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.560> middle<00:04:07.890> of

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
there's a lot of oil in the middle of

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.300 
there's a lot of oil in the middle of
the<00:04:08.190> lane<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:10.230> can<00:04:10.260> see<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.710> just<00:04:10.740> never

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
the lane you can see it just never

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.940 
the lane you can see it just never
grabbed<00:04:11.990> when<00:04:12.990> she<00:04:13.170> threw<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.470> gutter<00:04:13.650> ball

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
grabbed when she threw the gutter ball

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.710 
grabbed when she threw the gutter ball
it<00:04:14.190> hit<00:04:14.550> right<00:04:14.850> in<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.030> middle<00:04:15.240> of<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.540> lane

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
it hit right in the middle of the lane

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.930 
it hit right in the middle of the lane
slid<00:04:16.200> right<00:04:16.230> through<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.859> oil<00:04:16.890> never<00:04:17.549> caught

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
slid right through the oil never caught

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.780 
slid right through the oil never caught
so<00:04:18.720> she's<00:04:18.930> gonna<00:04:19.049> have<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.380> adjust<00:04:19.710> to<00:04:20.580> shoot

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
so she's gonna have to adjust to shoot

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.030 
so she's gonna have to adjust to shoot
the<00:04:20.910> cross<00:04:21.150> lane<00:04:21.420> there's<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.650> weakness

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
the cross lane there's that weakness

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.250
