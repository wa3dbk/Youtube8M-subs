00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello youtube today gives an outfit of 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.230
 today of me that I have been so long 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.059
 I did not shoot anymore or I got it 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.710
 recently a very old car video of 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.440
 pulled me in and I found it real 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.849
 funny so I do not know I'll be you 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.360
 a few times up in the infobox 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.560
 Left 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.650
 then maybe you can also 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.150
 mesh so with respect to my videos 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.310
 because it had already changed a lot 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.980
 I would say but nothing first thing 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.400
 I want you my outfit two today 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.710
 so variants depending on the once that 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.570
 what I'm doing right now and you can 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.520
 actually always see the half 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.040
 meaningful 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.719
 well it does not matter in any case 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.879
 This outfit is very simple 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.340
 so simple in black so I have 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.829
 actually only black things were on 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.989
 we oh man what you already see so me 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.370
 I would wear that outfit if I did 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.379
 So going away would not go away 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.379
 just like a party but just with friends 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.809
 what to eat or where to stop 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.760
 makes a bit fancier and this 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.899
 Video is supposed to be on inspiration 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.960
 maybe you can serve that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.210
 or others look 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.930
 So, what do I have? I have these 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.720
 more cool leather jacket on her see it has 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.000
 Here above, rivets patch this jacket 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.130
 is from the look book store which is more 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.479
 So it went really perfect 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.640
 also know again then show 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.869
 can you see how she sits like this 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.570
 including one I just 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.610
 black and white polo true it is 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.560
 such a nice nitrogen somehow so 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.840
 you can already see how force 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.850
 I would say black mottled white 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.180
 the special thing is that in some 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.890
 Sharing has something so nasty as it 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.900
 is so far gone and I became 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.790
 already asked if the top part 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.439
 broken but no it is not broken 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.960
 but I think that judgment is so cool 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.610
 because is so versatile combinable 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.560
 To this I serve a black one 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.450
 tight jeans 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.979
 yes i just love black jeans because 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.810
 looking very chic and very 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.610
 noble and very elegant so i like it 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.310
 totally and wearing black 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.500
 wedge heels so that's something 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.189
 but I also have a slightly lower one 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.860
 but I'm relatively small and that's why 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.319
 need very high sales fro all info 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.420
 there's in the infobox and we come 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.989
 now to variant 2 like me this one 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.830
 I would just take it 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.920
 change my shoes 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.870
 so instead of these elegant ones it is 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.489
 yes, by elegant from high 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.440
 Wedge heels I would just mean 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.780
 I also love to wear black boots 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.160
 my boat and then it would be okay yet 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.450
 emphasize more so by the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.299
 leather jacket that we too already 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.319
 makes quite rocky and then still has good 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:39.510
 then it's just about the 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.370
 second variant I would wear 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.600
 if i would go for example the start or 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.910
 to school 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.620
 so it is for the school I want too 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.269
 not too overdressed even if you have it 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.950
 But things could be considered yes 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.840
 just as a normal thing so easy 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.980
 more wheels jackets sweaters and easy 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.599
 So plaster actually something 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.120
 stinknormal is in combination with them 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.670
 is just as big as I think 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.140
 and if it's a bit too fishy for you 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.290
 is you just a mega 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.450
 fat ones neck down and then you are 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.100
 actually packed pretty warm 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.900
 I say I still show this 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.510
 outfit rings are currently very 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.340
 rarely wear but yes I found it 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.019
 actually quite fitting and my nails 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.340
 I also rather kept dark so 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.359
 this outfit very black yellow the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.040
 it was already with mine 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.859
 I like to put up in the comments 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.470
 how you find this outfit and whether he 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.920
 rather the casual type since or so 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.209
 lets the graphics or the chic ones 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.760
 In terms of cost so I have to admit yes 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.290
 that I like to send 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.840
 I just ran around because of that 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.880
 which was very nice but yes 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.470
 Currently I just wear everything mixed 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.709
 So depending on your mood than I would 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.530
 In general, that means that this varied 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.940
 but it does not matter that was with my 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.709
 outfit if you are further up for 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.269
 just want to see inspirations 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.190
 quite off the device it seems to me 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.650
 comments or leave me one 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.840
 thumbs up then I know and 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.700
 so then what a short video 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.109
 I hope it was short and then I say 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.359
 bye and hopefully until the next one 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.139
 and thank you for turning it on and now 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.139
