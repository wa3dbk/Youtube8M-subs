tumble<00:03:56.709> that's<00:03:57.220> not<00:03:57.459> good<00:03:57.730> so<00:03:58.030> they've

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
tumble that's not good so they've

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.750 
tumble that's not good so they've
recessed<00:03:58.690> them<00:03:58.870> very<00:03:59.769> hard<00:04:00.040> but<00:04:00.459> underneath

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
recessed them very hard but underneath

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.000 
recessed them very hard but underneath
that<00:04:00.940> in<00:04:01.299> your<00:04:01.510> shoulders<00:04:01.840> is<00:04:02.019> bio<00:04:02.410> armor<00:04:02.829> and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
that in your shoulders is bio armor and

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.360 
that in your shoulders is bio armor and
in<00:04:03.760> your<00:04:04.560> elbows<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.769> into<00:04:05.890> your<00:04:06.010> forearm

in your elbows and into your forearm

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.990 
in your elbows and into your forearm
that<00:04:06.519> is<00:04:07.000> actually<00:04:07.390> GPR<00:04:08.230> armor<00:04:08.980> say<00:04:09.640> that<00:04:09.820> ten

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
that is actually GPR armor say that ten

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.080 
that is actually GPR armor say that ten
times<00:04:10.030> faster<00:04:10.570> GPR<00:04:11.019> armor<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:12.579> beauty<00:04:12.850> is<00:04:12.940> it

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
times faster GPR armor the beauty is it

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.850 
times faster GPR armor the beauty is it
think<00:04:13.329> of<00:04:13.450> bio<00:04:13.690> armor<00:04:14.079> kind<00:04:14.560> of<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.709> same

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
think of bio armor kind of the same

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.190 
think of bio armor kind of the same
thing<00:04:15.070> except<00:04:15.670> it<00:04:15.820> is<00:04:15.970> substantially<00:04:16.900> longer

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
thing except it is substantially longer

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.460 
thing except it is substantially longer
and<00:04:17.669> whiter<00:04:18.669> so<00:04:19.270> you<00:04:19.330> get<00:04:19.690> more<00:04:19.900> coverage

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
and whiter so you get more coverage

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.390 
and whiter so you get more coverage
okay<00:04:21.420> you're<00:04:22.420> gonna<00:04:22.510> notice<00:04:25.440> these<00:04:26.440> foam<00:04:27.100> pads

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
okay you're gonna notice these foam pads

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.320 
okay you're gonna notice these foam pads
up<00:04:27.640> on<00:04:27.760> top<00:04:27.940> here

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
up on top here

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.870 
up on top here
they're<00:04:29.230> obviously<00:04:29.920> it<00:04:30.430> looks<00:04:30.610> like<00:04:30.730> they're

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
they're obviously it looks like they're

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.580 
they're obviously it looks like they're
perforated<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:31.840> they<00:04:31.960> are<00:04:32.110> because<00:04:32.560> that

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
perforated and they are because that

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.460 
perforated and they are because that
actually<00:04:32.970> through<00:04:33.970> that<00:04:34.210> foam<00:04:35.020> padding

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
actually through that foam padding

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.200 
actually through that foam padding
inside<00:04:35.680> there<00:04:36.040> that<00:04:36.280> actually<00:04:36.640> flows<00:04:36.880> air

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
inside there that actually flows air

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.600 
inside there that actually flows air
into<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.810> jacket<00:04:38.200> underneath<00:04:39.010> you'll<00:04:39.430> see

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
into the jacket underneath you'll see

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.310 
into the jacket underneath you'll see
when<00:04:39.730> we<00:04:39.820> dive<00:04:40.030> in<00:04:40.210> there's<00:04:40.600> armor<00:04:41.020> inside

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
when we dive in there's armor inside

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.440 
when we dive in there's armor inside
here<00:04:41.680> what<00:04:42.400> we<00:04:42.550> want<00:04:42.700> to<00:04:42.760> do<00:04:42.910> though<00:04:43.060> is<00:04:43.300> we

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
and intake perforations here I didn't

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.820 
and intake perforations here I didn't
take<00:04:48.580> offense<00:04:48.760> but<00:04:49.030> perforations<00:04:49.390> that

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
and here and on the speed hump the

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.480 
and here and on the speed hump the
beauty<00:04:55.540> of<00:04:55.570> this<00:04:55.870> speed<00:04:56.110> hump<00:04:56.320> this<00:04:57.250> is<00:04:57.430> the

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
beauty of this speed hump this is the

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.770 
beauty of this speed hump this is the
same<00:04:57.670> speed<00:04:57.910> hump<00:04:58.090> that<00:04:58.330> you're<00:04:58.450> gonna<00:04:58.540> find

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
same speed hump that you're gonna find

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.050 
same speed hump that you're gonna find
actually<00:04:59.290> on<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.440> one-piece<00:04:59.860> suit<00:05:00.160> this<00:05:00.790> is<00:05:00.970> a

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
actually on the one-piece suit this is a

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.370 
actually on the one-piece suit this is a
3d<00:05:01.840> mesh<00:05:02.970> wraps<00:05:03.970> around<00:05:04.120> it's<00:05:04.870> also<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.200> same

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
3d mesh wraps around it's also the same

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.610 
3d mesh wraps around it's also the same
that's<00:05:05.530> on<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:05.710> cuffs<00:05:07.140> see<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.230> top<00:05:08.410> of<00:05:08.560> that

that's on the cuffs see the top of that
speed<00:05:08.860> hump<00:05:09.210> so<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.300> air<00:05:10.450> channels<00:05:10.870> in<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.380> on

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
speed hump so the air channels in and on

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.050 
speed hump so the air channels in and on
when<00:05:11.710> we<00:05:11.800> jump<00:05:12.010> on<00:05:12.100> the<00:05:12.190> inside<00:05:12.490> you'll<00:05:12.850> see<00:05:12.940> a

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
when we jump on the inside you'll see a

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.020 
when we jump on the inside you'll see a
massive<00:05:13.450> gray<00:05:14.110> panel<00:05:14.590> and<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.130> air<00:05:15.310> gets

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
massive gray panel and the air gets

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.820 
massive gray panel and the air gets
basically<00:05:16.270> channeled<00:05:16.930> down<00:05:17.140> that<00:05:17.380> speed<00:05:17.620> hump

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
basically channeled down that speed hump

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.740 
basically channeled down that speed hump
and<00:05:18.010> there<00:05:18.550> you<00:05:18.669> go<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:19.270> beauty<00:05:19.570> of<00:05:19.600> that

and there you go the beauty of that

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.200 
and there you go the beauty of that
speed<00:05:20.050> hump<00:05:20.260> however<00:05:20.560> is<00:05:20.770> its<00:05:21.250> articulating

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
speed hump however is its articulating

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.540 
speed hump however is its articulating
you're<00:05:23.140> thinking<00:05:23.470> that<00:05:23.590> maybe<00:05:23.770> it's<00:05:24.040> lake<00:05:24.310> up

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
you're thinking that maybe it's lake up
