about<00:01:49.609> the<00:01:49.789> helicopter<00:01:50.270> itself<00:01:50.619> let's<00:01:51.619> take<00:01:51.799> a

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
about the helicopter itself let's take a

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.769 
about the helicopter itself let's take a
look<00:01:52.009> at<00:01:52.130> this<00:01:52.279> head<00:01:52.490> now<00:01:52.939> this<00:01:53.149> is<00:01:53.299> a<00:01:53.329> fixed

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:53.779 
look at this head now this is a fixed

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:55.989 
look at this head now this is a fixed
pitch<00:01:53.990> head<00:01:54.259> made<00:01:54.590> out<00:01:54.799> of<00:01:54.979> anodized<00:01:55.429> aluminum

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
45-degree offset from the main rotor

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.199 
45-degree offset from the main rotor
blades<00:02:00.740> which<00:02:01.579> should<00:02:01.759> give<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.029> more

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
blades which should give it more

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.769 
blades which should give it more
responsive<00:02:02.859> control<00:02:03.859> while<00:02:04.249> it's<00:02:04.399> in<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.549> air

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:04.779 
responsive control while it's in the air

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:07.389 
responsive control while it's in the air
the<00:02:05.779> swash<00:02:06.079> plate<00:02:06.319> is<00:02:06.619> also<00:02:06.829> made<00:02:07.219> out<00:02:07.369> of

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
the swash plate is also made out of

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.309 
the swash plate is also made out of
anodized<00:02:07.939> aluminum<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:08.869> let's<00:02:09.110> take<00:02:09.289> a

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
anodized aluminum and let's take a

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.649 
anodized aluminum and let's take a
closer<00:02:09.649> look<00:02:09.800> at<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.220> now<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.120> can<00:02:11.360> see<00:02:11.510> this

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
closer look at it now you can see this

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.080 
closer look at it now you can see this
is<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.870> two<00:02:12.230> servo<00:02:12.709> 90<00:02:13.220> degree<00:02:13.549> swash<00:02:13.849> plate

brushed smaller brush motor for your
tail<00:02:38.040> rotor<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.569> new<00:02:39.690> design<00:02:39.870> on

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
tail rotor but I like the new design on

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.229 
tail rotor but I like the new design on
this<00:02:40.319> helicopter<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:41.519> brushed<00:02:41.790> motor<00:02:42.000> for

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
this helicopter the brushed motor for

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.539 
this helicopter the brushed motor for
the<00:02:42.329> tail<00:02:42.540> rotor<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:43.349> not<00:02:43.680> out<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.190> end<00:02:44.459> of

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
the tail rotor is not out on the end of

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.640 
the tail rotor is not out on the end of
the<00:02:44.670> tail<00:02:44.909> it's<00:02:45.390> actually<00:02:45.930> mounted<00:02:46.349> on<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
the tail it's actually mounted on the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.650 
the tail it's actually mounted on the
main<00:02:46.829> frame<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.280> helicopter<00:02:47.910> near<00:02:48.510> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
main frame of the helicopter near the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.780 
main frame of the helicopter near the
center<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.019> gravity<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.590> have<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> direct

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
center of gravity you have a direct

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.640 
center of gravity you have a direct
drive<00:02:51.090> shaft<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.810> goes<00:02:51.959> out<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.470> tail

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
drive shaft that goes out to the tail

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.650 
drive shaft that goes out to the tail
rotor<00:02:52.890> that's<00:02:53.280> geared<00:02:53.579> that<00:02:54.000> actually<00:02:54.390> drives

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
rotor that's geared that actually drives

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.690 
rotor that's geared that actually drives
it<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.109> I<00:02:55.590> think<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.099> going<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.430> improve

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
it and I think this is going to improve

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.250 
it and I think this is going to improve
the<00:02:56.910> performance<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.660> helicopter

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
the performance of the helicopter

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.750 
the performance of the helicopter
because<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:59.160> don't<00:02:59.310> have<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.579> waive<00:02:59.730> that

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
because you don't have to waive that

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.819 
because you don't have to waive that
motor<00:03:00.209> out<00:03:00.510> on<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.840> end<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.230> tail<00:03:01.440> it's

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
motor out on the end of the tail it's

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.650 
motor out on the end of the tail it's
actually<00:03:02.250> away<00:03:02.519> from<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.329> it<00:03:03.480> should<00:03:03.629> be

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
actually away from it so it should be

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.500 
actually away from it so it should be
more<00:03:03.959> responsive<00:03:04.530> on<00:03:04.650> those<00:03:04.829> rudder<00:03:05.129> terms

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
more responsive on those rudder terms

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.300 
more responsive on those rudder terms
well<00:03:06.510> that's<00:03:07.170> about<00:03:07.379> it<00:03:07.440> for<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.920> first<00:03:08.190> part

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
well that's about it for the first part

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.330 
well that's about it for the first part
of<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.640> review<00:03:08.970> for<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.660> Novus<00:03:10.109> 200<00:03:10.680> let's<00:03:11.190> go

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
of the review for the Novus 200 let's go

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.680 
of the review for the Novus 200 let's go
ahead<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.670> take<00:03:11.819> it<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.120> flying<00:03:12.390> field

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
ahead and take it to the flying field

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:21.059 
ahead and take it to the flying field
and<00:03:13.140> give<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.560> go<00:03:13.680> ok<00:03:17.900> all<00:03:18.900> right<00:03:19.079> we're<00:03:19.260> up

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
and give it a go ok all right we're up

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.589 
and give it a go ok all right we're up
and<00:03:21.189> you<00:03:21.280> can<00:03:21.400> hear<00:03:21.549> that<00:03:21.700> tail<00:03:21.969> other<00:03:22.209> motors

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
and you can hear that tail other motors

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.259 
and you can hear that tail other motors
going<00:03:23.249> that's<00:03:24.249> the<00:03:24.400> heading<00:03:24.670> lock<00:03:24.909> gyro

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
going that's the heading lock gyro

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.569 
going that's the heading lock gyro
controlling<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.170> tail<00:03:26.379> rotor<00:03:26.560> motor<00:03:26.769> and<00:03:27.280> it

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
controlling the tail rotor motor and it

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.699 
controlling the tail rotor motor and it
looks<00:03:27.760> rock<00:03:27.999> solid<00:03:28.269> engine<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:32.290> was<00:03:32.439> pretty

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
looks rock solid engine that was pretty

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:33.239 
looks rock solid engine that was pretty
good

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:33.249 
good

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:38.570 
good

have to supply eight double-a batteries
for<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:45.960> transmitter<00:03:46.760> but<00:03:47.760> other<00:03:47.910> than<00:03:48.030> that

out the box it's ready to go and check

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.370 
out the box it's ready to go and check
out<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.640> fast<00:03:51.000> forward<00:03:51.360> flight<00:03:53.660> nice<00:03:54.660> we<00:03:55.230> got

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
out that fast forward flight nice we got

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.650 
out that fast forward flight nice we got
a<00:03:55.410> little<00:03:55.590> bit<00:03:55.770> of<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.950> breeze<00:03:56.190> here<00:03:56.550> not<00:03:57.420> too

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
a little bit of a breeze here not too

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.830 
a little bit of a breeze here not too
bad

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
bad

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.940 
bad
and<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:00.960> think<00:04:01.170> it's<00:04:01.350> handling<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.740> looks

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
and I think it's handling it looks

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.070 
and I think it's handling it looks
pretty<00:04:02.190> well<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:03.780> like<00:04:03.960> it<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:04.260> far<00:04:04.290> can<00:04:04.650> you

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
pretty well you like it so far can you

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.920 
pretty well you like it so far can you
go<00:04:07.080> ask<00:04:07.230> me<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.500> klappa<00:04:07.740> oh<00:04:08.300> okay<00:04:09.300> nice<00:04:09.450> up<00:04:09.600> Nick

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.810 

pretty<00:04:12.930> nice<00:04:13.140> too<00:04:13.350> stable<00:04:13.620> helicopter

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.580 

being<00:04:17.480> that<00:04:17.630> this<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:17.780> a<00:04:18.020> fixed<00:04:18.410> pitch

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
being that this is a fixed pitch

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.700 
being that this is a fixed pitch

fly<00:04:37.880> to<00:04:38.000> collect<00:04:38.390> a<00:04:38.450> pitch<00:04:38.660> because<00:04:39.050> it's<00:04:39.290> this

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
fly to collect a pitch because it's this

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.770 
fly to collect a pitch because it's this
is<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:39.920> true<00:04:40.340> control<00:04:40.730> like<00:04:41.090> you<00:04:41.120> fly<00:04:41.630> with

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
is the true control like you fly with

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.970 
is the true control like you fly with
collective<00:04:42.170> pitch<00:04:42.290> you<00:04:42.470> just<00:04:42.680> don't<00:04:42.860> have

collective pitch but I'm blocking the

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.210 
collective pitch but I'm blocking the
helicopter<00:04:47.270> what<00:04:47.420> do<00:04:47.480> you<00:04:47.540> think<00:04:47.980> three<00:04:48.980> very

oh there's a heavy verse yeah it's kind
of<00:04:52.730> got<00:04:52.880> reversing<00:04:53.330> it<00:04:53.420> somewhere<00:04:53.690> you<00:04:54.380> would

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
of got reversing it somewhere you would

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.020 
of got reversing it somewhere you would
ask<00:04:54.710> you<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:55.040> get<00:04:55.280> across<00:04:55.490> him<00:04:55.820> though

recommend it to beginners with maybe a
little<00:05:22.410> bit<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.620> flight<00:05:23.250> training<00:05:23.580> but<00:05:24.240> it's

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
little bit of flight training but it's

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.800 
little bit of flight training but it's
very<00:05:24.720> easy<00:05:24.960> to<00:05:25.170> fly<00:05:26.300> somebody<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:27.450> has<00:05:27.600> had

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
very easy to fly somebody that has had

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.140 
very easy to fly somebody that has had
some<00:05:28.020> coaxial<00:05:28.650> blade<00:05:28.830> experience<00:05:29.160> would<00:05:30.120> be

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
some coaxial blade experience would be

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.850 
some coaxial blade experience would be
able<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:30.480> jump<00:05:30.660> on<00:05:30.810> this<00:05:30.960> with<00:05:31.140> no<00:05:31.260> problem

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
able to jump on this with no problem

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.700 
able to jump on this with no problem
so<00:05:32.360> beginner<00:05:33.360> yeah<00:05:33.720> it's<00:05:34.110> possible

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
so beginner yeah it's possible

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.390 
so beginner yeah it's possible
intermediate<00:05:35.130> oh<00:05:35.580> yeah<00:05:36.390> you<00:05:36.990> know<00:05:37.080> what<00:05:37.320> I<00:05:37.740> say

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
intermediate oh yeah you know what I say

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.280 
intermediate oh yeah you know what I say
intermediate<00:05:38.970> somebody<00:05:39.690> has<00:05:39.810> been<00:05:40.020> flying

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
intermediate somebody has been flying

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.380 
intermediate somebody has been flying
for<00:05:40.440> a<00:05:40.620> short<00:05:41.010> amount<00:05:41.160> of<00:05:41.280> time<00:05:41.340> I<00:05:41.760> still<00:05:42.150> think

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
for a short amount of time I still think

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.850 
for a short amount of time I still think
you<00:05:42.510> should<00:05:42.540> have<00:05:43.080> no<00:05:43.290> problems<00:05:43.680> with<00:05:43.770> this

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
you should have no problems with this

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:54.230 
you should have no problems with this
helicopter<00:05:49.280> that's<00:05:50.280> on<00:05:50.520> high<00:05:50.760> rates<00:05:53.240> okay

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
helicopter that's on high rates okay

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.500 
helicopter that's on high rates okay
let's<00:05:55.110> take<00:05:55.290> it<00:05:55.410> is<00:05:55.820> and<00:05:56.900> land<00:05:57.900> it

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.820 

now<00:06:01.510> I<00:06:01.540> flew<00:06:01.810> the<00:06:01.960> date<00:06:02.110> a<00:06:02.140> little<00:06:02.410> bit<00:06:02.590> of<00:06:02.680> wind

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
now I flew the date a little bit of wind

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.470 
now I flew the date a little bit of wind
you<00:06:03.040> see<00:06:03.340> a<00:06:03.370> heady<00:06:03.580> you<00:06:04.000> didn't<00:06:04.240> have<00:06:04.330> any

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
you see a heady you didn't have any

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.920 
you see a heady you didn't have any
problems<00:06:04.900> flying<00:06:05.200> whatsoever<00:06:06.160> I<00:06:06.810> really<00:06:07.810> do

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
problems flying whatsoever I really do

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.030 
problems flying whatsoever I really do
like<00:06:08.110> this<00:06:08.320> helicopter

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
like this helicopter

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.130 
like this helicopter
I<00:06:09.070> think<00:06:09.310> the<00:06:09.370> flight<00:06:09.610> time<00:06:09.850> on<00:06:10.030> this<00:06:10.210> we've

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
I think the flight time on this we've

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.750 
I think the flight time on this we've
actually<00:06:11.350> made<00:06:11.770> a<00:06:11.830> couple<00:06:12.010> of<00:06:12.160> shots<00:06:12.400> out<00:06:12.550> here

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
actually made a couple of shots out here

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.370 
actually made a couple of shots out here
we've<00:06:13.330> been<00:06:13.450> flying<00:06:13.630> it<00:06:13.840> for<00:06:13.960> at<00:06:14.050> least<00:06:14.140> six

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
we've been flying it for at least six

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.660 
we've been flying it for at least six
minutes<00:06:14.530> or<00:06:14.770> so<00:06:14.950> with<00:06:15.220> no<00:06:15.340> problems

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
minutes or so with no problems

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.130 
minutes or so with no problems
whatsoever<00:06:15.820> so<00:06:16.240> I<00:06:16.270> don't<00:06:16.510> think<00:06:16.690> there<00:06:17.080> will

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
whatsoever so I don't think there will
