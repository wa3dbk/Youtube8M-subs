00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.290
 Hello everyone, today I will show how to do 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.500
 bracelet with aronia 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:18.580
 from polymer clay we need 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:24.070
 polymer clay black and yellow 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:30.270
 color mole stupid leaf flat 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:35.880
 small screwdriver chain lock 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:38.440
 rings Perez loop tools 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:46.450
 roll out black polymer clay in 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:48.370
 sausage and cut into pieces further 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:59.860
 it is better to work with gloves or 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:01:02.579
 companion doing ball insert with 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.579
 eyelet 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:13.460
 and we fix it well in clay we remove 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:16.870
 smooth out all the bumps further attach 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.870
 more or less round shape 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.450
 Next, take a small flat screwdriver and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:45.159
 make notches 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:47.860
 we make five pieces like an asterisk because 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:53.970
 this berry turns slightly flattened and 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.970
 we need it we make such 50 pieces 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.799
 cut into small pieces yellow 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.399
 polymer clay do the ball then 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.399
 a little bit 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.229
 we take from 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.600
 and wrap it with cling film this 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.980
 need for polymer clay not 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.980
 stuck to the face 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.319
 also wrapped a pair with cling film 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.880
 you can wear a fingertip and glove 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.880
 We put a drop and press 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:38.049
 carefully remove and make a hole 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.609
 we make such leaves of 10 pieces and all 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:47.140
 bake bake at 110 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:48.130
 degrees within 30 minutes further 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.489
 turn down 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.489
 peak at a berry at an angle of 90 degrees 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.709
 biting off excess wire 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.709
 reserve about 8 millimeters 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.109
 take round pliers and make a loop 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.750
 the loop should work smoothly and 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.969
 neatly 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.510
 do the same on steel beads 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:35.590
 take a chain length of 20 centimeters 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.989
 turn down and leave the chain about 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:44.709
 centimeter and a half and string the berries 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.709
 berries put on each link in the chain and 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:52.599
 I will also hang 2 more berries on the 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:56.269
 long tip 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:59.090
 the length of the bracelet just turns 20 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:10.459
 centimeters berries are located on 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:13.190
 about 16 centimeters long if you 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.579
 correctly baked little leaves then they should 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:20.620
 very well bend not break and also 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.620
 they return to the original for and 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:33.850
 take a ring and open it first I 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:36.360
 string lock yes I string 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.360
 leaf 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.800
 and hang it on a chain 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.099
 open another little ring and hang everything 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:54.550
 leaves 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:54.550
 I weigh them every 5 berries 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:10.069
 and bracelet with chokeberry ready 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.529
 yellow leaves blend beautifully with 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.449
 black berries and I hope that you 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.459
 like my master class 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.419
 and we will see you in the next video 

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:19.419
 bye Bye
