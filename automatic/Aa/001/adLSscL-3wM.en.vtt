00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.240 
straight so doing this will definitely
ensure<00:01:53.690> that<00:01:53.869> your<00:01:54.020> insolent<00:01:54.440> good<00:01:54.619> as<00:01:54.890> well

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
ensure that your insolent good as well

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.440 
ensure that your insolent good as well
as<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.460> rest<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.759> your<00:01:55.940> hair

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
as the rest of your hair

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.760 
as the rest of your hair
and<00:01:58.450> I'm<00:01:58.720> just<00:01:58.870> going<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.050> do<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.290> same<00:01:59.500> thing

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
and I'm just going to do the same thing

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.890 
and I'm just going to do the same thing
on<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.010> top<00:02:02.760> and<00:02:03.760> I<00:02:03.880> think<00:02:04.090> doing<00:02:04.330> for<00:02:04.630> braids

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
on the top and I think doing for braids

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.810 
on the top and I think doing for braids
definitely<00:02:05.650> a<00:02:05.680> good<00:02:05.920> idea<00:02:05.950> if<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.460> want<00:02:06.670> like

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
definitely a good idea if you want like

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.740 
definitely a good idea if you want like
bigger<00:02:07.480> waves<00:02:08.259> or<00:02:08.649> curls<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.509> want

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
bigger waves or curls if you want

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.830 
bigger waves or curls if you want
smaller<00:02:11.170> curls<00:02:11.740> then<00:02:12.280> do<00:02:12.970> more<00:02:13.180> breaks<00:02:13.450> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
smaller curls then do more breaks the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:34.080 
smaller curls then do more breaks the
less<00:02:14.020> braids<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.530> bigger<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.950> girls<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.700> I'm

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
less braids the bigger the girls and I'm

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.100

colder climates this is definitely a

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.430

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
better than going outside looking like a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:04:13.869 
better than going outside looking like a
wet<00:03:43.590> dog<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.250> trying<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.820> get<00:03:44.910> pneumonia
