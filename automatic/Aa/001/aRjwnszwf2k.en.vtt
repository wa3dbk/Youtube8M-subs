00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
but one thing I'm also going to be using

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.119 
but one thing I'm also going to be using
a<00:00:39.090> 4<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.480> airplay<00:00:40.050> feature<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.559> really<00:00:40.950> love

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.380 
a 4 is the airplay feature I really love
this<00:00:41.250> feature<00:00:41.489> because<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.239> actually

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
this feature because I can actually

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.290 
this feature because I can actually
stream<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.200> only<00:00:43.469> my<00:00:43.649> iphone<00:00:44.219> or<00:00:44.489> ipad

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
stream not only my iphone or ipad

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.600 
stream not only my iphone or ipad
content<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.230> mirror<00:00:46.469> my<00:00:46.680> display<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.460> my

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
content and mirror my display on to my

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.430 
content and mirror my display on to my
TV<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.780> i<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.350> display<00:00:49.680> my<00:00:50.190> mac<00:00:51.090> as<00:00:51.360> well<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.410> i

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
TV but i can display my mac as well so i

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.380 
TV but i can display my mac as well so i
think<00:00:52.590> that's<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.219> pretty<00:00:53.399> cool<00:00:53.789> now

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
think that's going to be pretty cool now

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.750 
think that's going to be pretty cool now

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
diving into the unboxing we simply just

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.900 
diving into the unboxing we simply just
have<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.270> push<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.870> out<00:00:58.430> right<00:00:59.430> here<00:00:59.489> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
at that here in a second let's go ahead

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.370 
at that here in a second let's go ahead
and<00:01:10.830> see<00:01:11.010> what<00:01:11.369> else<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.640> got<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.850> here<00:01:12.080> here<00:01:13.080> we

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and see what else we got in here here we

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.450 
and see what else we got in here here we
have<00:01:13.619> our<00:01:14.270> actual<00:01:15.270> rather<00:01:16.049> thin<00:01:16.560> controller

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
have our actual rather thin controller

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.730 
have our actual rather thin controller
it's<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.060> simple<00:01:18.330> controller<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.439> this

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
it's a really simple controller and this

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.899 
it's a really simple controller and this
will<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.159> course<00:01:21.140> control<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.380> Apple<00:01:22.770> TV

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
will of course control your Apple TV

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.030

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.010 
here up top we have the IR blaster and
then<00:01:26.159> right<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> circle

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
then right here we just have a circle

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.050 
then right here we just have a circle
with<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.500> down<00:01:28.740> left<00:01:28.799> right<00:01:29.159> buttons<00:01:29.820> and

the play and pause and menu button so

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.090 
the play and pause and menu button so
that's<00:01:33.540> really<00:01:33.780> simple<00:01:34.200> controller<00:01:34.590> now

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
that's really simple controller now

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.190 
that's really simple controller now
going<00:01:35.250> back<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> box<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.420> our<00:01:36.720> power

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
going back to the box we have our power

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.670 
going back to the box we have our power
cable<00:01:37.710> here<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.509> what<00:01:39.869> will<00:01:40.170> power<00:01:40.530> up

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
cable here so this is what will power up

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.929 
cable here so this is what will power up
to<00:01:41.040> apple<00:01:41.400> TV<00:01:41.570> obviously<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.280> now<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.340> have
