00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.250
 Hello my name is Paul, I linitsky 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.540
 Today I will tell you about the process 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.820
 stabilization and stabilized flowers 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:22.230
 these are unusual flowers 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:25.320
 These flowers came to us from France 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.570
 Franco-Belgian technology process 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.349
 stabilizing these flowers retain their 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.719
 stamina 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.829
 from 5 years or more somewhere around 5 in 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.820
 average years this rosebuds are also there 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.719
 flowers like so small 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.910
 flowers and greens could bring it 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.010
 it is worth it all natural 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.760
 used from living natural 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.020
 of plants 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.210
 these are the leaves of lavender particles also 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.750
 soft great leaves 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.040
 moss they retain their resilience this is 80 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.509
 years main stabilization 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.820
 this is the substitution of water for a solution and for 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.250
 based on glycerin for a long time this 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.619
 the process remained closed to us so 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.540
 how could not not make them environmentally 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.740
 clean 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.939
 but now it's possible how would they 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.540
 anti-allergenic 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:39.630
 environmentally friendly as well as good 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.299
 smell retains its smell on care 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.450
 stabilize colors 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:49.229
 you need to keep them not too dry 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.530
 indoors as well as not very wet 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:57.020
 that is, the bathroom is very keep it 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.689
 can lead to their bottom fast 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.179
 creation is not desirable to them 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:07.729
 direct sunlight is also not 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:11.170
 you need to put them around heating 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.840
 devices that is near the battery and 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.019
 principle of special care this is not just 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.560
 blow dust from them and everything is in principle if 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:24.769
 comply with these not so difficult conditions 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.000
 these flowers will delight you for a very long time 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.000
 very long years
