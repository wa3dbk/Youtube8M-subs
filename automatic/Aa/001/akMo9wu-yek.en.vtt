00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
it caused a lot of injuries you put a

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.719

almost a weapon like the de padding in
the<00:04:31.030> shoulder<00:04:31.330> pads<00:04:31.540> now<00:04:31.840> is<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.320> hard<00:04:32.860> plastic

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
the shoulder pads now is a hard plastic

the shoulder pads now is a hard plastic
if<00:04:33.760> they<00:04:34.300> went<00:04:34.479> back<00:04:34.720> to<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:35.350> softer<00:04:35.830> shoulder

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
if they went back to the softer shoulder

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.480 
if they went back to the softer shoulder
pads<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:37.360> softer<00:04:37.810> elbow<00:04:38.139> pads<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:38.740> think<00:04:39.310> that

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
pads the softer elbow pads I think that

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.240 
pads the softer elbow pads I think that

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
forward you're not going to very much

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.460 
forward you're not going to very much
balance<00:06:41.730> whereas<00:06:42.660> the<00:06:42.780> new<00:06:42.930> blades<00:06:43.260> these

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
balance whereas the new blades these

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.790 
balance whereas the new blades these
days<00:06:43.770> they<00:06:44.550> come<00:06:44.960> with<00:06:45.960> that<00:06:46.140> kind<00:06:46.440> of<00:06:46.530> length

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
days they come with that kind of length

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.160 
days they come with that kind of length
I<00:06:47.160> mean<00:06:47.460> you<00:06:47.580> have<00:06:47.730> balance<00:06:47.970> on<00:06:48.420> the<00:06:48.750> front<00:06:48.780> end

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.170 
I mean you have balance on the front end

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.150 
I mean you have balance on the front end
the<00:06:49.350> toe<00:06:49.530> on<00:06:49.830> the<00:06:50.060> front<00:06:51.060> end<00:06:51.240> the<00:06:51.360> heel<00:06:52.160> and

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
the toe on the front end the heel and

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.210 
the toe on the front end the heel and
it's<00:06:53.370> all<00:06:53.490> overall<00:06:53.760> fastest<00:06:54.240> faster<00:06:54.780> blade

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
it's all overall fastest faster blade

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.530 
it's all overall fastest faster blade
I'd<00:06:56.220> like<00:06:56.430> to<00:06:56.580> see<00:06:56.700> him<00:06:56.790> go<00:06:56.910> back<00:06:57.090> to<00:06:57.270> some<00:06:57.450> of

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:57.540 
I'd like to see him go back to some of

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.340 
I'd like to see him go back to some of
the<00:06:57.630> old-style

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350 
the old-style

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.120 
the old-style
gloves<00:06:59.040> shoulder<00:06:59.880> pads<00:07:00.680> but<00:07:01.680> I<00:07:01.710> don't<00:07:01.980> think

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
gloves shoulder pads but I don't think

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.980 
gloves shoulder pads but I don't think
that'll<00:07:02.370> happen<00:07:02.490> it'll<00:07:02.940> probably<00:07:03.240> develop

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
that'll happen it'll probably develop

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.240 
that'll happen it'll probably develop
into<00:07:04.310> later<00:07:05.310> equipment<00:07:05.880> again<00:07:06.120> I<00:07:06.980> hope<00:07:07.980> less

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
into later equipment again I hope less

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.090 
into later equipment again I hope less
plastic<00:07:08.580> and<00:07:09.030> more<00:07:09.900> padding<00:07:10.410> per<00:07:10.860> se

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:13.100 
plastic and more padding per se

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.450 
plastic and more padding per se
hopefully<00:07:14.750> that<00:07:15.750> you<00:07:15.930> know<00:07:16.110> that<00:07:16.980> it'll<00:07:17.130> help

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 
hopefully that you know that it'll help

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.830 
hopefully that you know that it'll help
some<00:07:17.730> of<00:07:17.820> these<00:07:17.910> players<00:07:18.210> because<00:07:18.600> of<00:07:18.750> the

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
some of these players because of the

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.880 
some of these players because of the
speed<00:07:19.080> of<00:07:19.110> the<00:07:19.320> game<00:07:19.700> is<00:07:21.440> phenomenal<00:07:22.440> now<00:07:22.620> and

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:22.890 
speed of the game is phenomenal now and

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.650 
speed of the game is phenomenal now and
guys<00:07:23.160> are<00:07:23.340> getting<00:07:23.520> taken<00:07:23.700> out<00:07:23.970> and<00:07:24.510> I<00:07:24.600> don't

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660 
guys are getting taken out and I don't

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.150 
guys are getting taken out and I don't
think<00:07:24.870> the<00:07:25.110> equipment's<00:07:25.590> protecting<00:07:26.070> them

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 
think the equipment's protecting them

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160 
think the equipment's protecting them
enough<00:07:26.400> so<00:07:26.640> hopefully<00:07:27.060> that<00:07:27.270> they'll<00:07:27.480> develop

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.170 
enough so hopefully that they'll develop

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.710 
enough so hopefully that they'll develop
something<00:07:28.710> that<00:07:28.890> will<00:07:29.400> protect<00:07:30.330> them<00:07:30.660> a

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 
something that will protect them a

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.850 
something that will protect them a
little<00:07:30.930> better<00:07:31.110> with<00:07:31.290> the<00:07:31.440> speeds<00:07:31.710> of<00:07:31.830> the

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 
little better with the speeds of the

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.890 
little better with the speeds of the
game<00:07:32.100> and<00:07:32.340> the<00:07:32.730> changing<00:07:33.150> of<00:07:33.240> the<00:07:33.300> rules<00:07:33.600> that

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.900 
game and the changing of the rules that

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.620 
game and the changing of the rules that
they're<00:07:34.080> changing<00:07:34.470> now
