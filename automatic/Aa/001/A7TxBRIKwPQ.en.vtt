okay so this is my Lego gun mechanism an
update<00:00:04.170> that<00:00:04.440> is<00:00:04.560> better<00:00:04.770> questioned<00:00:05.430> by<00:00:06.270> some

people so basically here we go so here
is<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.980> update<00:00:11.460> update<00:00:11.969> parts<00:00:12.450> pretty<00:00:12.660> simple

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230

it simple mm that fits in and you can
just<00:00:24.359> go<00:00:24.960> either<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.180> for<00:00:27.480> living

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
just go either one then this for living

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
except for sometimes my gun actually

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.030 
except for sometimes my gun actually
breaks<00:00:40.140> these<00:00:40.440> things<00:00:40.710> off<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.780> yeah<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:43.170> now

breaks these things off so yeah but now
the<00:00:44.640> gun<00:00:44.879> mechanism<00:00:45.690> part<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.410> I'm<00:00:46.860> gonna<00:00:47.070> have

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the gun mechanism part so I'm gonna have

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.010 
the gun mechanism part so I'm gonna have
to<00:00:47.520> take<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.570> thing<00:00:48.840> apart<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:50.930> might<00:00:51.930> as

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
to take this thing apart so might as

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.689 
to take this thing apart so might as
well<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.500> show<00:00:52.860> how<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.219> do<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.550> you

just take off the roof parts you take
off

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.410 

and<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.619> not<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:08.670> damaging<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and this is not like really damaging the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.210 
and this is not like really damaging the
gun<00:01:09.630> I've<00:01:10.020> had<00:01:10.259> to<00:01:10.380> take<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> apart<00:01:10.799> before

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
gun I've had to take it apart before

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:27.670 
gun I've had to take it apart before
this<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.180> varies<00:01:12.830> like<00:01:13.830> upgrades<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.090> stuff

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:02:01.139 

let's<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:29.840> okay<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:30.899> I<00:01:31.229> guess<00:01:33.380> now<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.680> just

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.050 

this<00:02:02.149> parts<00:02:02.570> pretty<00:02:02.869> cool<00:02:03.429> okay<00:02:04.429> so<00:02:04.490> what

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
this parts pretty cool okay so what

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.060 
this parts pretty cool okay so what
happens<00:02:05.509> is<00:02:05.719> you<00:02:05.869> just<00:02:06.049> lift<00:02:06.380> that<00:02:06.469> off<00:02:06.619> after

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
happens is you just lift that off after

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.070 
happens is you just lift that off after
you<00:02:07.340> like<00:02:07.700> poke<00:02:08.030> through<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.360> pegs<00:02:08.599> and<00:02:08.780> stuff

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
you like poke through the pegs and stuff

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.479 
you like poke through the pegs and stuff
and<00:02:09.940> there<00:02:10.940> we<00:02:11.030> go<00:02:11.209> so<00:02:11.920> first<00:02:12.920> part<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.400> the

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
and there we go so first part is the

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.550 
and there we go so first part is the
magazine<00:02:14.000> lock<00:02:14.269> so<00:02:14.840> this<00:02:15.549> switch<00:02:16.549> down<00:02:17.239> here

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
magazine lock so this switch down here

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.820 
magazine lock so this switch down here
turns<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.739> up<00:02:18.950> but<00:02:19.430> it's<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:21.260> pushing<00:02:21.739> a

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
turns it up but it's you pushing a

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.070 
turns it up but it's you pushing a
magazine<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:24.110> pushes<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.769> up<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:26.510> comes<00:02:26.840> back

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
magazine it pushes it up it comes back

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.750 
magazine it pushes it up it comes back
down<00:02:27.379> and<00:02:27.769> then<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.370> locks<00:02:29.799> until<00:02:30.799> you<00:02:30.950> go<00:02:31.549> like

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
down and then it locks until you go like

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.370 
down and then it locks until you go like
that<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:34.000> that's<00:02:35.000> how<00:02:35.269> that<00:02:35.510> works<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.290> the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
that so that's how that works and the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.440 
that so that's how that works and the
carpets<00:02:36.769> kind<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.069> giving<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.489> friction<00:02:38.150> but

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
carpets kind of giving it friction but

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.660 
carpets kind of giving it friction but
I'm<00:02:39.440> sorry<00:02:39.799> okay<00:02:40.640> so<00:02:41.060> um<00:02:42.280> yeah<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:43.489> is

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
I'm sorry okay so um yeah this is

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.289 
I'm sorry okay so um yeah this is
nothing<00:02:44.950> okay<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.310> part<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:46.940> part

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
nothing okay so this part is the part

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.319 
nothing okay so this part is the part
that<00:02:47.360> goes<00:02:47.860> it's<00:02:48.860> basically<00:02:49.220> just<00:02:49.370> simple

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
that goes it's basically just simple

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.759 
that goes it's basically just simple
slide<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:52.310> put<00:02:52.579> it<00:02:52.700> right<00:02:53.209> before<00:02:53.769> this

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
slide and you put it right before this

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.759 
slide and you put it right before this
part<00:02:55.160> which<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.640> rubber<00:02:55.819> band<00:02:56.150> part<00:02:56.769> that

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
part which is the rubber band part that

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.589 
part which is the rubber band part that
I'll<00:02:58.160> show<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.459> in<00:02:58.519> a<00:02:58.579> second<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.060> this<00:02:59.239> is

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
I'll show you in a second so this is

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.400 
I'll show you in a second so this is
your<00:02:59.780> simple<00:03:00.230> slide<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:01.269> rails<00:03:02.269> into<00:03:02.630> here

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
your simple slide that rails into here

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.340 
your simple slide that rails into here
like<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.579> you<00:03:04.790> just<00:03:04.819> slide<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:06.019> back

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
like that and you just slide this back

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.340 
like that and you just slide this back
when<00:03:06.799> you<00:03:06.889> pull<00:03:07.100> it<00:03:07.190> back<00:03:07.299> and<00:03:10.359> you<00:03:11.359> know<00:03:11.750> to

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
when you pull it back and you know to

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:31.670 
when you pull it back and you know to
show<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.850> let<00:03:13.850> me

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.880 

and<00:03:32.069> then<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.700> logged<00:03:33.239> in<00:03:33.569> so<00:03:34.110> basically<00:03:34.379> when

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
and then I logged in so basically when

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.160 
and then I logged in so basically when
you<00:03:34.920> pulled<00:03:35.519> this<00:03:35.730> back<00:03:36.090> which<00:03:36.569> I'll<00:03:36.750> take<00:03:36.989> off

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
you pulled this back which I'll take off

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.330 
you pulled this back which I'll take off
over<00:03:37.709> bands<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:40.470> pull<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.860> back<00:03:41.069> as

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
over bands you pull it back as

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.539 
over bands you pull it back as
rubberband<00:03:42.150> power<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:43.019> it's<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.470> little<00:03:43.739> bit<00:03:43.890> so

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
rubberband power so it's a little bit so

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.339 
rubberband power so it's a little bit so
it<00:03:44.700> gives<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.209> little<00:03:45.450> bit<00:03:45.599> of<00:03:45.750> resistance

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
it gives it a little bit of resistance

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:52.520 
it gives it a little bit of resistance
but<00:03:46.560> this<00:03:46.939> sorry<00:03:50.090> okay<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.989> doesn't<00:03:52.379> come<00:03:52.500> out

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
but this sorry okay it doesn't come out

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.410 
but this sorry okay it doesn't come out
of<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.829> rail<00:03:53.040> because<00:03:53.310> it's<00:03:53.609> pushed<00:03:53.970> in<00:03:54.180> by<00:03:54.390> a

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
of the rail because it's pushed in by a

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.479 
of the rail because it's pushed in by a
wall<00:03:54.720> but<00:03:55.049> when<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.319> push<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.709> back<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:56.129> pushes

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
wall but when you push it back it pushes

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.809 
wall but when you push it back it pushes
down<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.700> first<00:03:57.150> open<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.079> bullet<00:03:58.409> and<00:03:58.829> then

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
down the first open the bullet and then

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.530 
down the first open the bullet and then
it<00:04:00.480> comes<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.500> trigger<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.700> don't<00:04:03.359> know<00:04:03.450> if

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
it comes to the trigger I don't know if

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.759 
it comes to the trigger I don't know if
you<00:04:03.629> guys<00:04:03.780> can<00:04:03.989> see<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:05.569> that<00:04:06.569> it<00:04:07.530> comes<00:04:09.769> to

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
you guys can see that that it comes to

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.490 
you guys can see that that it comes to
the<00:04:10.980> trigger<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.700> pushes<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.150> down<00:04:12.750> then

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
the trigger and pushes that down then

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.900 
the trigger and pushes that down then
the<00:04:13.709> trigger<00:04:13.920> locks<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.180> can't<00:04:15.450> go<00:04:15.900> and

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
the trigger locks so it can't go and

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.930 
the trigger locks so it can't go and
basically<00:04:18.709> what<00:04:19.709> happens<00:04:20.100> is<00:04:20.280> when<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.669> pull

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
basically what happens is when you pull

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.420 
basically what happens is when you pull
down<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.180> trigger<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:22.049> rubber<00:04:22.169> bands<00:04:22.620> push

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
down the trigger the rubber bands push

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.300 
down the trigger the rubber bands push
forward<00:04:24.030> this<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.720> it<00:04:24.960> takes<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.830> bullet<00:04:26.130> with

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
forward this and it takes a bullet with

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.820 
forward this and it takes a bullet with
it<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.970> then<00:04:27.870> just<00:04:29.060> blasts<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.360> out<00:04:31.169> the<00:04:31.530> front

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
it and then just blasts it out the front

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.339 
it and then just blasts it out the front
like<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:33.080> so<00:04:35.330> yeah<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.360> hope<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:36.870> guys<00:04:37.050> got

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
like that so yeah I hope you guys got

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.290 
like that so yeah I hope you guys got
that<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:37.949> bullets<00:04:38.340> cannot<00:04:38.760> fall<00:04:39.060> out<00:04:39.210> the

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
that and bullets cannot fall out the

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.510 
that and bullets cannot fall out the
barrel<00:04:39.630> because<00:04:39.960> they'll<00:04:40.199> just<00:04:40.410> fall<00:04:40.889> George

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
barrel because they'll just fall George

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.740 
barrel because they'll just fall George
this<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.060> they<00:04:42.180> have<00:04:42.330> pretty<00:04:42.630> good

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
this and they have pretty good

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.180 
this and they have pretty good
resistance<00:04:43.530> in<00:04:43.710> here<00:04:45.020> and<00:04:46.020> that's<00:04:46.830> pretty

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
resistance in here and that's pretty

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.730 
resistance in here and that's pretty
much<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.760> whole<00:04:47.789> mechanism<00:04:48.479> right<00:04:49.110> there<00:04:49.380> so

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
much the whole mechanism right there so

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.310 
much the whole mechanism right there so
and<00:04:50.190> then<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:51.090> just<00:04:51.360> put<00:04:51.599> it<00:04:51.720> all<00:04:51.870> in<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:52.110> body

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
and then you just put it all in a body

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.540 
and then you just put it all in a body
like<00:04:52.919> this<00:04:53.190> and<00:04:53.460> this<00:04:53.580> is<00:04:53.760> just<00:04:54.030> like<00:04:54.330> um

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
like this and this is just like um

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.790 
like this and this is just like um
hollow<00:04:56.550> thing<00:04:57.419> for<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.930> bullets<00:04:58.260> to<00:04:58.470> fly

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
hollow thing for the bullets to fly

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.409 
hollow thing for the bullets to fly
through<00:04:59.099> so<00:05:00.169> yeah<00:05:01.169> and<00:05:01.860> I<00:05:02.039> probably<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:03.030> the

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
through so yeah and I probably and the

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.330 
through so yeah and I probably and the
only<00:05:03.570> problem<00:05:03.960> I<00:05:04.260> have<00:05:04.530> with<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.830> mechanism

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
only problem I have with the mechanism

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.689 
only problem I have with the mechanism
so<00:05:05.669> far<00:05:06.030> is<00:05:06.599> that<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.900> rubber<00:05:07.050> bands<00:05:07.699> like

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
so far is that the rubber bands like

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.010 
so far is that the rubber bands like
when<00:05:08.880> they're<00:05:09.000> on<00:05:09.120> this<00:05:09.270> little<00:05:09.570> peg<00:05:09.780> right

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
when they're on this little peg right

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.969 
when they're on this little peg right
here<00:05:10.490> they'll<00:05:11.490> start<00:05:12.419> to<00:05:12.570> slip<00:05:12.990> off<00:05:13.199> and<00:05:13.590> then

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
here they'll start to slip off and then

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.290 
here they'll start to slip off and then
you'll<00:05:14.250> have<00:05:15.030> any<00:05:15.320> power<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:17.039> that<00:05:17.370> really

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
you'll have any power so that really

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.740 
you'll have any power so that really
sucks

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
sucks

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.140 
sucks
and<00:05:19.020> you<00:05:19.199> have<00:05:19.289> to<00:05:19.409> take<00:05:19.560> it<00:05:19.680> off<00:05:19.800> so<00:05:20.099> I<00:05:20.340> was

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
and you have to take it off so I was

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.890 
and you have to take it off so I was
gonna<00:05:21.770> so<00:05:22.770> in<00:05:22.979> my<00:05:23.220> future<00:05:23.610> gun<00:05:24.060> which<00:05:24.360> is<00:05:24.570> just

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
gonna so in my future gun which is just

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.629 
gonna so in my future gun which is just
my<00:05:25.050> first<00:05:25.289> one<00:05:25.590> I'll<00:05:25.770> probably<00:05:25.889> just<00:05:26.340> make

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
my first one I'll probably just make

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.760 
my first one I'll probably just make
this<00:05:26.849> rubber<00:05:27.300> band<00:05:27.539> just<00:05:27.810> connected<00:05:28.440> to<00:05:28.470> this

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
this rubber band just connected to this

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.080 
this rubber band just connected to this
whole<00:05:29.099> thing<00:05:29.159> and<00:05:30.800> yeah<00:05:31.800> I<00:05:31.830> will<00:05:32.340> have<00:05:32.820> a<00:05:32.880> lot

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
whole thing and yeah I will have a lot

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.540 
whole thing and yeah I will have a lot
of<00:05:33.120> upgrades<00:05:33.630> to<00:05:33.810> it<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:34.349> just<00:05:34.650> looks<00:05:35.070> it'll

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
of upgrades to it and just looks it'll

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.930 
of upgrades to it and just looks it'll
be<00:05:35.699> better<00:05:36.000> -<00:05:36.620> it<00:05:37.620> might<00:05:37.830> actually<00:05:38.010> be<00:05:38.250> all<00:05:38.610> of

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
be better - it might actually be all of

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.709 
be better - it might actually be all of
the<00:05:39.150> black<00:05:39.479> ones<00:05:39.900> these

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:40.719 
the black ones these

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.749 
the black ones these
I<00:05:40.749> don't<00:05:41.319> have<00:05:41.409> that<00:05:41.649> many<00:05:41.799> actual<00:05:42.309> building

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 
I don't have that many actual building

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.329 
I don't have that many actual building
bricks<00:05:43.089> left<00:05:43.689> from<00:05:44.319> all<00:05:44.439> the<00:05:44.589> machines<00:05:44.979> I'll

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:45.339 
bricks left from all the machines I'll

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:51.139 
bricks left from all the machines I'll
make<00:05:45.580> it<00:05:45.759> all<00:05:46.330> black<00:05:48.149> because<00:05:49.149> I<00:05:49.449> have<00:05:49.599> a<00:05:49.629> whole

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:51.149 
make it all black because I have a whole

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:57.209 
make it all black because I have a whole
a<00:05:52.379> whole<00:05:53.379> sorter<00:05:54.039> so<00:05:54.429> yeah<00:05:54.909> and<00:05:55.719> I<00:05:56.319> might<00:05:57.069> be

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:57.219 
a whole sorter so yeah and I might be

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.669 
a whole sorter so yeah and I might be
showing<00:05:57.639> you<00:05:57.789> guys<00:05:57.999> my<00:05:58.059> train<00:05:58.689> track<00:05:59.019> later<00:05:59.379> on

00:05:59.669 --> 00:05:59.679 
showing you guys my train track later on

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:03.419 
showing you guys my train track later on
which<00:05:59.979> I'm<00:06:00.309> sitting<00:06:00.909> inside<00:06:01.709> the<00:06:02.709> giant<00:06:02.979> dream

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:03.429 
which I'm sitting inside the giant dream

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:06.600 
which I'm sitting inside the giant dream
track<00:06:03.729> and<00:06:04.629> this<00:06:04.839> is<00:06:04.959> all<00:06:05.139> my<00:06:05.739> train<00:06:06.339> track

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
track and this is all my train track

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.479 
track and this is all my train track
that<00:06:06.879> was<00:06:06.999> custom<00:06:07.539> with<00:06:07.779> not<00:06:08.199> no<00:06:08.860> kits<00:06:09.249> or

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:09.489 
that was custom with not no kits or

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 
reloadable actually you don't have to

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.809

put everything back together to shoot it
but<00:06:25.089> I<00:06:25.300> think<00:06:26.139> you<00:06:26.229> guys<00:06:26.379> can<00:06:26.439> get<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:26.829> point

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:27.189 
but I think you guys can get the point

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:29.100 
but I think you guys can get the point
it<00:06:27.399> just<00:06:27.579> shoots<00:06:27.909> it<00:06:28.179> is<00:06:28.509> just<00:06:28.809> a<00:06:28.929> glow

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
it just shoots it is just a glow

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.969 
it just shoots it is just a glow
mechanism<00:06:29.679> I<00:06:30.129> just<00:06:31.089> made<00:06:31.269> this<00:06:31.449> in<00:06:31.659> like<00:06:31.869> a<00:06:32.229> few

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
mechanism I just made this in like a few

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.329 
mechanism I just made this in like a few
seconds<00:06:33.939> not<00:06:34.509> literally<00:06:34.869> but<00:06:35.259> like<00:06:35.339> literally

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:36.339 
seconds not literally but like literally

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:39.709 
seconds not literally but like literally
like<00:06:36.550> a<00:06:36.579> minute<00:06:37.029> I<00:06:37.209> just<00:06:37.269> put<00:06:37.599> this<00:06:37.719> better<00:06:38.610> so

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:39.719 
like a minute I just put this better so

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:42.899 
like a minute I just put this better so
it's<00:06:40.719> not<00:06:40.899> the<00:06:41.049> best<00:06:41.339> design<00:06:42.339> or<00:06:42.729> anything

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:42.909 
it's not the best design or anything

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:46.549 
it's not the best design or anything
it's<00:06:43.269> just<00:06:43.360> simple<00:06:44.199> I<00:06:44.519> mean<00:06:45.519> that's<00:06:46.059> like

00:06:46.549 --> 00:06:46.559 
it's just simple I mean that's like

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:51.140 
it's just simple I mean that's like
extremely<00:06:47.559> circles

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.779 

yeah<00:06:52.150> so<00:06:52.509> that's<00:06:53.160> much<00:06:54.160> it<00:06:54.490> right<00:06:54.819> there<00:06:55.060> or<00:06:55.240> so

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
yeah so that's much it right there or so

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:59.789 
yeah so that's much it right there or so
fine
