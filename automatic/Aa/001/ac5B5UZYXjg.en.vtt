00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.270
 good to all guys welcome six 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.040
 times your best a team bout go up 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.559
 your the world a team which leaves 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.480
 completely randomly phase 1 is an envelope 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.220
 which in that video a person outside of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.990
 the whole time it was TV versa was town 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.760
 put in for the comments by in 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.560
 comment 17 etc really in the envelope 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.720
 in the second phase to cousins in we will know 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.070
 the team that leaves completely at random 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.900
 through the comments that you put on the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.730
 phase 1 if you get lost do not worry about 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.160
 what are we going to do many more team versus 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.260
 the world and today I have a little more 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.059
 of them I show you that the strategy 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.589
 always wins the same team that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.180
 have if you get to make a good 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:41.610
 strategy in that combat because every 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.979
 combat is a world you get a good 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.989
 victory or a good combat of its effect 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.670
 so guys we go with the fight to 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.580
 see how the team has done this time 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.379
 his word verses let's go there he got one 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.269
 of the members of this team that is neither 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.530
 more or less than polio we can not 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.420
 we have already seen it in other battles that 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.670
 he is very dangerous with his angel and time 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.799
 lion my rival takes out to me to win not yet 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.600
 well win and does for the shadow wants 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.549
 test my special defense but 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.740
 we agreed that I in me on pole I have 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.170
 a little surprise red card any 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.340
 attack that hit me commanded out of that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.140
 combat at that time 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.969
 out that pokemon from the battlefield and 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.460
 change it for another totally random and 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.469
 I get garzón is still faster 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.759
 that I have been arrested combat but I 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.799
 I already use an attack that shift that 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.719
 is to climb and you are going to eat him 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.969
 it took half of life and did not burn it down 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.319
 little bit not burned it logically I'm going to 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.840
 eat an earthquake because it affects me 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.789
 very much the earth is water game car yo 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.319
 I am also to avenge this if that is me 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.299
 come is also in the super team 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:37.590
 according to totally random health makes me 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.600
 earthquake I dodge it with levitation 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.000
 I knew I was going to eat that sure store 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.920
 a pole in front invented a substitute 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.530
 I just got behind him now he can 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.599
 hit me with anger and here you remember 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.489
 what strategy says once that is that 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.469
 make consume all the anger of the 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:54.810
 pokemon that I have in front so that at 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.000
 the only sticking end tries to win a 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.439
 tour you will not see me cured with black mud 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.479
 bust substitute logically from 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.340
 angry and instead of canceling it because if not 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.469
 I would not be confused what I do is poke 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.179
 another in substitute I hide again and 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.709
 I say I do it again got angry you know 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.509
 that the third is confused can be 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.910
 hit the solo and take the turn to 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.250
 to finish off the sticks the psoe sticks 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.680
 affair again I'm bent on revenge 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.940
 come back to face one or you're not 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.950
 confused now I 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.170
 I have to play I have to hit him 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.850
 take advantage of new institute buttoning for 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.160
 hit him, finish him off, and that he 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.720
 paste the only I do pola shadow attacks 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.820
 very powerful to garzon will do 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.170
 enough damage to be neutral stays 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.020
 with a touch of low defense 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.640
 special and now if he sticks he just 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.940
 kill agree and a pokémon that I 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.740
 Remove from above but do not stick alone 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.600
 I have player I repeat come the player 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.090
 substitute right yes but I wanted to finish 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.610
 you do not hit just repeats anger another 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.830
 and bust me to avenge a chair 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.320
 it's a little bit too dangerous almost 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.790
 almost made of attention that comes out of hong 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.250
 kong chosen partner I'm faster 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.230
 that he and although he has rough skin I put him 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.460
 a chome finisher tap makes me 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.320
 complete is that I have done it makes me a 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.110
 little bit of damage but nothing happens 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.850
 pokémon less than my rival and he has left 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.160
 that link that we already know about me 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.680
 I raise the physical attack with self-esteem 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.630
 if they take me out I'm faster than him because 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.490
 I have chosen handkerchief do not know if it 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.710
 I would think or not because it has gained speed 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.390
 of that hook makes me ice wind still 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.010
 well I have good chosen qin gang follows 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.320
 being faster than me of course 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.210
 annoys a little much more despite 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.190
 attention as he leaves me 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.800
 I slow down but I get it 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.990
 put another cut a very powerful brightness not 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.540
 has that fucus band that faces so 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.820
 another pokemon that takes that with cross 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.020
 to pocket so alone and I'm going to upload 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.000
 physical attack thanks to the skill 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.920
 self-esteem I only have one pokémon left 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.390
 but even though he has Spanish he has 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.270
 chosen lowest speed with wind 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.760
 ice is left pikachu I retire it for 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.470
 regain speed and I repeat I think 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.990
 that I can be faster than that pikachu 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.760
 thanks to the chosen support we will see him pulled out 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.380
 a on pole on quite touched more than 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.610
 surprise gives me its also also very 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.320
 here is a little bit of life and there was no 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.810
 attacked this turn it is surprise that 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.540
 and pay attention because if they bite your will 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.340
 mete substitute takes advantage and hides 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.750
 but I 'm not going to let him 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.880
 be in transit so quietly 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.530
 scalding pond annoyed him so 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.600
 less this institute and that it stings its 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.850
 come back out with me pikachu with 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.070
 trampoline weakens fast if you want but 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.840
 I do not want you to hide behind your 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.200
 Tomato attack electric attack 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.420
 very powerful receives but has a 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.160
 defect that receives the record year and does not 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.290
 you are interested stop to pikachu go 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.470
 weakening half of life almost by the 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.480
 record and attention 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.340
 my last pokemon homeclub retrieves the 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.470
 speed thanks to veil removed you 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.130

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.380
 pikachu and weakened him to the last pokemon 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.180
 must rivals who jumps over 30% of 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.460
 static leticia paralyzes me but not 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.650
 matter was the last pokemon and john 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.300
 crowe gets the victory so 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.370
 guys that has been the fight with the 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.170
 this week's superbowl team I hope 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.430
 really enjoy this combat myself 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.350
 It happened to me great 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.210
 thanks to john crowe I have known 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.800
 handle it at the opportune moment 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.420
 should be left behind after that 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.480
 event of avenging spades would have ended 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.090
 with me I do not sacrifice aemp or lion pulled out 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.740
 home club and topped pikachu so that 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.270
 you see that hong I think that because this is 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.340
 a pokémon that for now I almost do not 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.890

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.510
 hongju is very good I have physical the 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.280
 truth is that it destroys with 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.720
 self-esteem skill and chosen cloth 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.090

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.220
