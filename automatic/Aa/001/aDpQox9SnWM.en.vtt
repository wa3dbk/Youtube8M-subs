presentation it's about the our new

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.509 
presentation it's about the our new
hardware<00:00:05.220> product<00:00:05.609> well<00:00:06.450> we<00:00:06.600> will<00:00:06.750> start<00:00:06.990> with

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
hardware product well we will start with

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.190 
hardware product well we will start with
with<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.550> des<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:09.179> 15<00:00:09.719> plus<00:00:10.410> as<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:11.880> see

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
with a des to 15 plus as you can see

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.780 
with a des to 15 plus as you can see
from<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.349> outside<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.889> same<00:00:14.099> level<00:00:14.519> just

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
from the outside the same level just

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.700 
from the outside the same level just
like<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.509> was<00:00:15.599> just<00:00:15.780> refurbished<00:00:16.410> from<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
like it was just refurbished from the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.849 
like it was just refurbished from the
inside<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.880> switch<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.810> computer<00:00:19.380> at<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
inside so we switch the computer at the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.019 
inside so we switch the computer at the
CPU<00:00:20.279> inside<00:00:20.699> now<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.359> dual<00:00:21.840> core<00:00:22.880> all<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
CPU inside now it's dual core all the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.620 
CPU inside now it's dual core all the
other<00:00:24.180> things<00:00:24.600> remain<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:24.960> same<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:26.010> has<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
other things remain the same so it has a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.030 
other things remain the same so it has a
22<00:00:27.630> Lamport<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.380> two<00:00:28.740> USB<00:00:29.039> 3<00:00:29.460> ports<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:31.289> we

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
22 Lamport and two USB 3 ports and we

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.040 
22 Lamport and two USB 3 ports and we
think<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.910> ideal<00:00:33.210> product<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
think that it's ideal product for the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.410 
think that it's ideal product for the
let's<00:00:34.320> say<00:00:34.469> home<00:00:34.739> enthusiastic<00:00:35.489> users<00:00:35.850> which

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
let's say home enthusiastic users which

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.930 
let's say home enthusiastic users which
which<00:00:37.170> require<00:00:37.590> who<00:00:37.890> require<00:00:38.190> high

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
which require who require high

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.220 
which require who require high
performance<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.300> next<00:00:42.480> product<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:43.110> we

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
performance so the next product as we

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.670 
performance so the next product as we
will<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.649> here<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.280> d/s<00:00:44.629> 7<00:00:45.629> 15<00:00:46.050> plus<00:00:46.320> if

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
will have here it's a d/s 7 15 plus if

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.930 
will have here it's a d/s 7 15 plus if
the<00:00:47.039> successor<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.879> vs<00:00:48.600> 7<00:00:48.930> 13<00:00:49.379> plus<00:00:49.940> what

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the successor of vs 7 13 plus what

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.270 
the successor of vs 7 13 plus what
changed<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.230> an<00:00:52.320> hour<00:00:52.469> twice<00:00:53.039> as

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
changed here so we have an hour twice as

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.740 
changed here so we have an hour twice as
much<00:00:53.430> RAM<00:00:53.910> memory<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.390> before<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.379> 2gb

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
much RAM memory as before so you get 2gb

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.290 
much RAM memory as before so you get 2gb
we<00:00:57.750> also<00:00:57.899> change<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> CPU<00:00:59.460> which<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.820> now<00:00:59.940> what

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
we also change the CPU which is now what

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.929 
we also change the CPU which is now what
core<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:02.239> you<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.390> still<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.719> dwell

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
core and you have still the dwell

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.640 
core and you have still the dwell
lamport's<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.450> from<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> from<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.290> from<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
lamport's so from the from the from the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.520 
lamport's so from the from the from the
back<00:01:07.950> side<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> same<00:01:09.080> it's<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.200> perfect

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
back side is the same it's a perfect

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.190 
back side is the same it's a perfect
solution<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:10.950> SMB<00:01:11.490> segment<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:13.020> can

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
solution for SMB segment because it can

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.340 
solution for SMB segment because it can

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
you know look to the future where the

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.830 
you know look to the future where the
synology<00:02:28.840> might<00:02:29.840> be<00:02:30.620> heading<00:02:31.450> this<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.630> our

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
synology might be heading this is our

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.200 
synology might be heading this is our
project<00:02:33.350> gemiini<00:02:33.770> so<00:02:34.250> we<00:02:34.550> might<00:02:34.760> wonder<00:02:34.940> why

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
project gemiini so we might wonder why

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.030 
project gemiini so we might wonder why
we<00:02:35.840> still<00:02:36.080> don't<00:02:36.260> have<00:02:36.290> any<00:02:36.500> normal<00:02:36.740> name

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
we still don't have any normal name

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.210 
we still don't have any normal name
while<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.430> name<00:02:37.610> wasn't<00:02:38.120> chosen<00:02:38.660> yet<00:02:39.220> however

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
while the name wasn't chosen yet however

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.310 
while the name wasn't chosen yet however
what<00:02:40.370> we<00:02:40.400> can<00:02:40.670> already<00:02:40.940> say<00:02:41.300> now<00:02:41.480> it's<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.959> will

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
what we can already say now it's a will

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.420 
what we can already say now it's a will
be<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.470> high-performance<00:02:43.750> rekt<00:02:44.750> rekt<00:02:45.200> model<00:02:45.620> my

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
be a high-performance rekt rekt model my

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.460 
be a high-performance rekt rekt model my
performance<00:02:46.970> will<00:02:47.240> be<00:02:47.390> brought<00:02:47.660> by<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.080> two

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
performance will be brought by the two

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.840 
performance will be brought by the two
powerful<00:02:48.950> xenon<00:02:49.670> six<00:02:50.180> core<00:02:50.450> cpus<00:02:51.850> together

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
powerful xenon six core cpus together

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.190 
powerful xenon six core cpus together
with<00:02:53.270> 32<00:02:54.610> ddr4<00:02:55.610> ram<00:02:55.880> memory<00:02:56.390> which<00:02:56.900> can<00:02:56.930> be

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
with 32 ddr4 ram memory which can be

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.390 
with 32 ddr4 ram memory which can be
expanded<00:02:57.680> up<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:59.050> 256<00:03:00.050> gigabytes<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:02.360> we<00:03:02.900> also

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
expanded up to 256 gigabytes and we also

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.150 
expanded up to 256 gigabytes and we also
very<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.940> let's<00:03:05.150> say<00:03:05.209> ricans<00:03:05.930> rib<00:03:06.620> design

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
very like let's say ricans rib design

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.930 
very like let's say ricans rib design
the<00:03:07.520> interior<00:03:08.530> deployment<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:10.310> can<00:03:10.459> see<00:03:10.670> we

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
the interior deployment you can see we

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.250 
the interior deployment you can see we
have<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.090> new<00:03:11.270> design<00:03:11.600> for<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.959> fans<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:13.209> also

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
have a new design for the fans and also

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.780 
have a new design for the fans and also
they<00:03:15.260> are<00:03:15.290> very<00:03:15.500> easy<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.860> they<00:03:16.370> are<00:03:16.459> very<00:03:16.610> easy

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
they are very easy to they are very easy

they are very easy to they are very easy
to<00:03:16.940> plug<00:03:17.510> or<00:03:17.840> take<00:03:18.110> out<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:18.590> we<00:03:19.220> have<00:03:19.340> also<00:03:19.520> now

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
to plug or take out and we have also now

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.360 
to plug or take out and we have also now
different<00:03:20.660> design<00:03:20.989> for<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.440> for<00:03:21.860> this<00:03:22.070> trace

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
different design for the for this trace

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.699 
different design for the for this trace
I<00:03:22.610> will<00:03:22.970> show<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.360> camera<00:03:23.480> as<00:03:23.750> well<00:03:23.810> you

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
I will show it to the camera as well you

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.520 
I will show it to the camera as well you
can<00:03:24.860> see<00:03:25.070> so<00:03:25.910> if<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.150> know<00:03:26.330> how<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.840> displace

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
can see so if you know how to displace

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.310 
can see so if you know how to displace
look<00:03:28.100> currently<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:29.600> has<00:03:29.660> been<00:03:29.870> changed<00:03:30.230> as

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
look currently it has been changed as

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.490 
look currently it has been changed as
well

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500
