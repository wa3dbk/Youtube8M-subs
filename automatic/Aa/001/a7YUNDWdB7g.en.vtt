00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
kind of food and when you stop doing it

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.930 
kind of food and when you stop doing it
your<00:03:25.019> mind<00:03:25.470> just<00:03:25.739> wants<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.370> back

but<00:03:27.870> what<00:03:28.079> really<00:03:28.350> helped<00:03:28.769> me<00:03:28.890> most<00:03:29.130> was<00:03:29.670> that

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
but what really helped me most was that

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.120 
but what really helped me most was that
I<00:03:29.970> knew<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:30.570> I<00:03:30.600> had<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:31.200> choose<00:03:31.410> between<00:03:31.680> two

with<00:03:34.850> my<00:03:35.850> previous<00:03:36.150> lifestyle<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.140> continue

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
with my previous lifestyle to continue

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.009 
with my previous lifestyle to continue
