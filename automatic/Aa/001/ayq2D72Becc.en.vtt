00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 good morning and welcome this new one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.640
 tutorial 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.529
 I am Michael d'etude and today I am here 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.849
 to teach you how to fold paper for 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.590
 making this rooster in origami is a 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.570
 simple oregano and only one is needed 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:26.460
 square paper sheet to get it right 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:28.980
 Let's start with a sheet of paper 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.560
 square obtained from a sheet a4 and like 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.219
 First let's do a kite base 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:43.469
 then fold the paper diagonally 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:46.739
 if not only we re-open the sheet e 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.160
 we carry this side and this side e 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.160
 in the center 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.309
 once you get to this point 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.049
 we ask for our paper and repeat 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.509
 the same thing with these two sides 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:30.229
 so we bring them to the center in this 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:34.679
 so the folded sheet complains 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.160
 keeping the folds inside in 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.020
 this way 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:42.890
 in short, on the agonistic customers who 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:47.039
 we had done at the beginning and now following 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.130
 this is this line or the line 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.960
 remembers the line of the shorter poles 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.710
 changes from the leaf side more 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.810
 short we have explained please 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.810
 the sheet then on this line 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:08.310
 we send and at this point reopen 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.780
 so let's invert our folds 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.230
 the folds must go inside 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.000
 this central valley from the valley becomes 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:22.860
 become a fold upstream and also the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:30.090
 other folds will be invested in 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:34.830
 this way so you get this 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.330
 in short, we have this part 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.220
 with this triangle the triangle 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.120
 entering the other 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.099
 triangle 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.680
 now we repeat the thing we did 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.530
 here with this part of the sheet then 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.319
 take note of our our tip 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.420
 the triangle we take her to the 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.420
 low even a little more than that 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:04.470
 then we reverse the folds and then 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.450
 we crush all done so that 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.950
 this part below is horizontal 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:15.549
 as much as possible at this point 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:20.650
 let's take the tip again and push it 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:24.790
 down and let's make sure that 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.519
 this part of the sheet overlaps a 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:34.379
 this part of sheets just then in 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:37.950
 this way we have this part 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.950
 overlying this 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.870
 now let 's take the model we turn it 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.599
 we must do the same with this 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:55.420
 triangle, but we only do one 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:57.670
 time then we take this tip and the 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:09.310
 we reverse it and we deserve this instead 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:11.739
 towards the interior so then we take of 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.299
 we bend our tip again on ourselves 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:17.289
 same then backwards 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.699
 in this way we reopen in reverse 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.799
 the folds just like we did for 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.799
 this big part 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:45.360
 in this way 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:49.110
 then take the sheet and turn it over again 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.030
 in short, if you are comfortable do not turn it over 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.539
 I do because I am comfortable we take 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.639
 this tip leaving it at the bottom e 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:02.430
 we bring it here at the intersection of these 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:05.000
 two triangles once this is done 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.310
 reopen we reverse the folds then 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.550
 we open here and push inside 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.199
 this part of leaves on criticism 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.129
 we have done before on the fold that 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.400
 we have done before 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:20.610
 this fold ends the central one 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.919
 bends in and the net and the 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.879
 remaining fold goes to match 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.879
 this one below 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:33.150
 turn the model and repeat with this 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:35.639
 corner remember to mark well 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.150
 otherwise since there is a lot of paper 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:42.680
 it will be difficult to reverse the folds 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.680
 reopen we reverse the folds 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:59.930
 we will have our tail of our cock 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:04.550
 if we want we can design ourselves 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:09.620
 look here this is the bill and 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.630
 you will have your rooster finished even today 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.280
 it all ended but if you want to stay

 paper a set of playlists for 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.849

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.169
 of origami you can subscribe to the channel 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.849
 from mike oldfield it's all for today thanks 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.120
