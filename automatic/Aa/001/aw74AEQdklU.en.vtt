right<00:00:31.310> here<00:00:31.780> then<00:00:32.780> your<00:00:33.050> secondary<00:00:34.720> knob

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
right here then your secondary knob

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.799 
right here then your secondary knob
which<00:00:36.800> would<00:00:36.980> control<00:00:37.370> your<00:00:37.760> aperture<00:00:38.180> half

megapixel<00:01:58.459> yes<00:01:59.209> it's<00:01:59.420> old<00:01:59.569> technology<00:02:00.250> but<00:02:01.250> I

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
megapixel yes it's old technology but I

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.889

got a really excellent deal on it I

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.330 
got a really excellent deal on it I
couldn't<00:02:06.709> pass<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:06.890> up<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:08.979> I<00:02:09.979> was<00:02:10.130> actually

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
couldn't pass it up and I was actually

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.319 
couldn't pass it up and I was actually
going<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.880> get<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.739> d7000<00:02:12.909> before<00:02:13.909> I<00:02:13.939> ran<00:02:14.150> into

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
going to get a d7000 before I ran into

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.229 
going to get a d7000 before I ran into
this<00:02:14.599> I<00:02:15.250> don't<00:02:16.250> know<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.370> might<00:02:16.610> trade<00:02:16.879> this<00:02:17.000> in

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
this I don't know I might trade this in

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.530 
this I don't know I might trade this in
on<00:02:17.439> d7000

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
on d7000

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.850 
on d7000
or<00:02:18.599> something<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.870> don't<00:02:19.049> know<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.230> even<00:02:19.500> keep<00:02:19.739> it

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
or something I don't know I even keep it

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.309 

but<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.439> of<00:02:25.769> course<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.220> lens<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.319> 70

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
but and of course the lens this is a 70

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:36.080 
but and of course the lens this is a 70
to<00:02:28.439> 300<00:02:29.010> millimeter<00:02:32.750> camera<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:35.879> with

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.690 
to 300 millimeter camera on and with
built-in<00:02:36.540> motor<00:02:36.950> there<00:02:37.950> we<00:02:38.040> go<00:02:38.129> seventy<00:02:38.489> three

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
built-in motor there we go seventy three

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.470 
built-in motor there we go seventy three
hundred<00:02:38.730> till<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> macro<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.730> like<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.120> said<00:02:42.180> so

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
hundred till a macro and like I said so

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.170 

which<00:04:16.019> that's<00:04:16.169> how<00:04:16.409> I<00:04:16.440> keep<00:04:16.680> my<00:04:16.859> camera<00:04:17.180> set

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
which that's how I keep my camera set

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.180 
which that's how I keep my camera set
both<00:04:18.359> of<00:04:18.389> them<00:04:18.690> or<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.810> can<00:04:19.049> just<00:04:19.079> switch<00:04:19.919> my

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
both of them or I can just switch my

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.820 
both of them or I can just switch my
focus<00:04:20.639> punch<00:04:20.849> around<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.479> think<00:04:22.380> that's<00:04:22.680> the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
focus punch around I think that's the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.000 
focus punch around I think that's the
only<00:04:22.889> difference<00:04:23.220> really<00:04:24.710> there<00:04:25.710> there's<00:04:25.889> a

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
only difference really there there's a

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.190 
only difference really there there's a
few<00:04:26.039> other<00:04:26.370> things<00:04:26.610> but<00:04:27.060> this<00:04:27.240> dat<00:04:27.659> has<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:27.930> few

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
few other things but this dat has a few

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.620 
few other things but this dat has a few
more<00:04:28.349> focus<00:04:28.740> points<00:04:29.219> Minna<00:04:29.849> d3000

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.480 
more focus points Minna d3000
like<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:32.720> said<00:04:32.900> it's<00:04:33.050> old<00:04:33.230> technology<00:04:33.410> but<00:04:34.070> I

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
like I said it's old technology but I

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.080 
like I said it's old technology but I
don't<00:04:35.120> care<00:04:35.410> it's<00:04:36.410> worked<00:04:36.650> great<00:04:36.740> for<00:04:36.980> me<00:04:37.310> and

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
don't care it's worked great for me and

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.140 
don't care it's worked great for me and
this<00:04:38.300> is<00:04:38.360> also<00:04:39.080> designed<00:04:39.980> for<00:04:40.190> internal<00:04:40.850> focus

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
this is also designed for internal focus

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:54.940 
this is also designed for internal focus
lenses<00:04:46.030> you<00:04:47.030> see<00:04:47.300> here<00:04:53.440> of<00:04:54.440> course<00:04:54.710> right

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
lenses you see here of course right

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.850 
lenses you see here of course right
there

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
there

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.610 
there
oops<00:04:57.940> you<00:04:58.940> can<00:04:59.120> see<00:04:59.450> that<00:05:00.110> is<00:05:00.350> the<00:05:00.830> focus<00:05:01.430> drive

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
oops you can see that is the focus drive

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.150 
oops you can see that is the focus drive
but<00:05:03.620> this<00:05:03.770> lens<00:05:04.040> right<00:05:04.160> here<00:05:05.560> has<00:05:06.560> a<00:05:06.590> built-in

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
but this lens right here has a built-in

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.480 
but this lens right here has a built-in
motor<00:05:07.430> so<00:05:07.790> it<00:05:07.880> doesn't<00:05:08.240> utilize<00:05:08.690> that<00:05:09.500> so<00:05:10.220> this

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
motor so it doesn't utilize that so this

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.360 
motor so it doesn't utilize that so this
will<00:05:10.640> use<00:05:10.850> just<00:05:11.000> about<00:05:11.150> any<00:05:11.420> lens<00:05:12.130> for<00:05:13.130> the<00:05:13.220> D

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
will use just about any lens for the D

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:23.550 
will use just about any lens for the D
3000<00:05:14.300> has<00:05:14.540> to<00:05:14.720> have<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.910> motorized<00:05:16.910> lens

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.160 

there<00:05:24.560> we<00:05:24.650> go

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
there we go

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.330 
there we go
but<00:05:27.170> overall<00:05:27.500> like<00:05:27.800> I<00:05:27.920> said<00:05:28.100> it's<00:05:28.190> a<00:05:28.250> good

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
but overall like I said it's a good

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
it as a trade-in and depending on the

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.280 
it as a trade-in and depending on the
mood<00:06:15.500> I'm<00:06:15.530> in<00:06:15.770> I<00:06:15.950> may<00:06:16.100> even<00:06:16.310> trade<00:06:16.670> this<00:06:16.910> one<00:06:17.090> in

mood I'm in I may even trade this one in
also<00:06:18.310> where<00:06:19.310> I'm<00:06:19.520> looking<00:06:19.880> to<00:06:20.000> get<00:06:20.180> a<00:06:20.210> 70<00:06:20.840> to
