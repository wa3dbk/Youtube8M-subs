00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.240
 hello guys and very good today I wanted 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.750
 tell you something something that I think 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.800
 some do not have it very clear and I wanted 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.560
 clarify it a little bit to the point of 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.050
 what good that difference between 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.410
 noise and grain let's start with the 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.480
 grain the grain are the little dots so 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.840
 call them that they had they had the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 photographic film 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.370
 the negatives in their time are still 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.910
 used and according to the grain size was more 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.790
 sensitive or less sensitive then the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.800
 movies that had more did more up 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.820
 that were more sensitive because they have a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.460
 bigger grain well and if it showed 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.680
 rather more now the fault is that today 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.900
 in day is related or is the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.910
 noise with it with grain what is not 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.360
 the same is real as photography 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.229
 digital 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.540
 we have noise is not grain is noise and if 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.910
 is generated with a bad exposure or a 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.910
 inadequate exposure or with a very iso 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.180
 elevated but it's not exactly grain is 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.130
 another thing is digital noise then to 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.170
 Sometimes people asked me today why 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.360
 what your photos have so much noise my 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.300
 photos do not usually have much noise my 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.920
 photos usually have grain because they are not 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.170
 they have it but I add it in light 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.720
 on because I like it and it's not noise 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.220
 grain gives a certain texture I have 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.770
 indeed some videos you 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.350
 appear here in on the cards in the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.350
 corner in which I explain how 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.880
 use the grain to recreate the look or 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.400
 the style of what was the movie 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.590
 photographic but do not make mistakes 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.330
 mix the noise with the grain because they are 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.000
 two different things in fact to the leyton 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.700
 We have noise control and control of 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.670
 We can choose grain grain remove grain 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.770
 add noise remove noise noise is a 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.100
 pixel level the grain we can 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.500
 control the grain size the up 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.500
 what point is pronounced and such but 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.170
 serves more than anything today and today another 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.180
 we add it to give it a texture 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.640
 of photography and give a look not so 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.920
 modern and not so perfect that purpose 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.430
 I understand that a lot of people out of fear 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.110
 to the noise when Belgrano is scared but 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.330
 is not the same 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.540
 in fact on video there is also noise and 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:35.180
 there is also grain sometimes also 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.180
 I add grain if you've seen the videos of 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.129
 60s own that are sexy from cannes 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.349
 own if you have noticed there are 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.849
 pretty grain there's a little bit of noise 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.159
 but there's also a lot of grain because 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.859
 I wanted to create a look of white and black 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.450
 authentic as if it were a movie that's why 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.549
 I've done it, you can use it from this 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.260
 do not be afraid because it is not then 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.930
 also do not be so scared noise 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.389
 because after all the customer never 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.760
 you will notice it like this is a client is not it is not 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.930
 great thing but more than anything I loved you 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.819
 clarify a little the difference between 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.260
 the grain and the noise I hope this 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.689
 video you liked if any 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.379
 question about the subject leave me a 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.040
 commentary 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.870
 I'm happy to answer you 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.969
 because I see that it is a subject that is a bit 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.519
 complicated sometimes to understand it but 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:22.379
 really are two different things the 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.620
 grain today its use as something 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.870
 artistic noise is something that can be 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.530
 consider negative not always but in 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.090
 Most of the cases are negative but 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.549
 but the grain is not negative the grain is 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.620
 something artistic of course depends on 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.299
 the amount but you do not see it as something 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.409
 negative in agreement we see ourselves in the 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.799
 next video guys and up to the 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.370
 next 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.370
 bye
