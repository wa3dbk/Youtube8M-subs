 Local eh this time the Internet 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.290
 this 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.290
 How 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.280
 With people all over the country 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.580
 Online can be Rutteyuu I just 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.330
 That's right, that frontier of PC 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:51.200
 I can do one in the whole country with that kind of feeling 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.820
 I will think whether not it attractions of this Hanechi number 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.950
 At ever ne familiar 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.190

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.150
 Re-appearance 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.400
 It is what seems Some pretty ne scene monster is quite interesting 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:10.250
 So there are two new weapons 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.520
 Insect control air bug 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.319
 I'm feeling like why just because it Well now now 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:22.719
 Oh, it's kind of like a three-season song or something like that 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.590
 Maybe I think that kind of thing After that, a weapon called Charge Ax is added and all 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.900
 rate 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.579
 14 types 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.420
 There has been a lot of increase a a charge ax is probably something 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.670
 I think I'm a guy who is Hinky 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.640

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:44.480
 Use the guy that well personal little Misao insect haltere 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.450
 I'm thinking I would like to say that the usual series is that 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.760
 The first monster hunter 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.599
 And the frontier 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.409
 Monster hunters and the number that I think I'm doing except 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.130

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.810
 Why 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.250
 I think that I want to take this of live animation 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.840
 However 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.950
 Of the 3 d s good if I 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.480
 There is no such thing 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:43.310
 I forgot a little bit but I'm not thinking about capture board capture 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:45.140
 I think because a this is probably the becomes immediately taken with this camera 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.770
 If it is okay 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:52.850

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:04.140
 If I could do it, but as a plan 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:09.170
 I hope that I can do something like that I already do the version with that audience 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.170
 Now do with this but I just think that Well 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.180
