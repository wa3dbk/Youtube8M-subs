all<00:00:11.400> right<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:12.059> here<00:00:12.539> we're<00:00:13.170> starting<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
all right so here we're starting the

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.590 
all right so here we're starting the
drawing<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.039> the<00:00:14.070> realistic<00:00:14.609> Apple<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.240> right

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
drawing of the realistic Apple and right

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.220 
drawing of the realistic Apple and right
now<00:00:15.750> I'm<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.619> tracing<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:18.090> kind<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.720> well

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
now I'm just tracing the kind of well

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.800 
now I'm just tracing the kind of well
I'm<00:00:19.350> not<00:00:19.439> tracing<00:00:19.830> I'm<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.160> drawing<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
I'm not tracing I'm just drawing the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.260 
I'm not tracing I'm just drawing the
kind<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.930> outside<00:00:22.890> contour<00:00:23.370> lines<00:00:23.610> of<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
kind of outside contour lines of the

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.210 
kind of outside contour lines of the
Apple<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.080> Red<00:00:25.260> Delicious<00:00:25.440> so<00:00:25.950> you<00:00:26.039> can

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
Apple it's a Red Delicious so you can

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.500 
Apple it's a Red Delicious so you can
see<00:00:26.400> kind<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.640> at<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.850> base<00:00:27.030> that's<00:00:27.210> more

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
see kind of at the base that's more

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.680 
see kind of at the base that's more
squared<00:00:27.900> off<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.440> they're<00:00:28.530> a<00:00:28.560> lot<00:00:28.740> taller<00:00:29.690> a

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
squared off and they're a lot taller a

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.189 
squared off and they're a lot taller a
lot<00:00:31.560> more<00:00:31.820> prominent<00:00:32.820> features<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:34.050> these

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
lot more prominent features on these

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.290 
lot more prominent features on these
apples<00:00:34.620> right<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.010> there<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.550> traced<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
apples right and there I just traced the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.660 
apples right and there I just traced the
highlights<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:38.160> indent<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
highlights and a little indent in the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.800 
highlights and a little indent in the
top<00:00:38.910> where<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.770> stem<00:00:40.770> would<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.810> that's

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810 
top where the stem would be and that's

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.200 
top where the stem would be and that's
basically<00:00:43.230> what<00:00:43.440> I'm<00:00:43.559> doing<00:00:43.590> right<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.210> just

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
basically what I'm doing right now just

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.940 
basically what I'm doing right now just
lightening<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.720> up<00:00:45.840> making<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.500> edges<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> bit

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
lightening it up making the edges a bit

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.080 
lightening it up making the edges a bit
more<00:00:47.220> crisp<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.180> way<00:00:48.390> get<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.380> lot<00:00:49.620> more<00:00:50.090> of

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
more crisp so that way get a lot more of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.010 
more crisp so that way get a lot more of
a<00:00:51.360> nice<00:00:52.309> shiny<00:00:53.309> surface<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:54.510> don't<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
a nice shiny surface I don't want it to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.470 
a nice shiny surface I don't want it to
be<00:00:55.140> too<00:00:55.410> dull<00:00:56.420> when<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:58.219> so<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.550> I'm

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
be too dull when I do that so here I'm

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.020 
be too dull when I do that so here I'm
using<00:01:00.629> an<00:01:00.840> 8b<00:01:01.200> graphite<00:01:01.800> lead<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:02.670> I'm<00:01:02.790> just

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
using an 8b graphite lead and I'm just

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.850 
using an 8b graphite lead and I'm just
adding<00:01:03.270> some<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> main<00:01:03.989> shading<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
adding some of the main shading in the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.889 
adding some of the main shading in the
back<00:01:05.039> now<00:01:05.339> usually<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.060> would<00:01:06.329> layer<00:01:06.600> these

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
back now usually I would layer these

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.649 
back now usually I would layer these
pencils<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:07.649> for<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.579> sake<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.850> time<00:01:09.240> for

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
pencils but for the sake of time for

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.480 
pencils but for the sake of time for
this<00:01:09.780> video<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
this video I'm just going to do it the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.240 
this video I'm just going to do it the
quicker<00:01:11.729> way<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.380> I'm<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.560> kind<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.890> adding

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
quicker way and I'm just kind of adding

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.550 
quicker way and I'm just kind of adding
the<00:01:14.369> shading<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.240> gonna<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.750> darkest<00:01:16.290> over

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the shading it's gonna be darkest over

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.830 
the shading it's gonna be darkest over
there<00:01:16.680> by<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.890> end<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.430> little<00:01:17.549> bit<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.540> little

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
there by the end a little bit a little

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.570 
there by the end a little bit a little
bit<00:01:19.080> lighter<00:01:19.260> there<00:01:19.560> because<00:01:20.040> that's<00:01:20.280> where

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
bit lighter there because that's where

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.370 
bit lighter there because that's where
the<00:01:20.760> large<00:01:21.030> bump<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.990> there's<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the large bump is and there's going to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.750 
the large bump is and there's going to
be<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.530> little<00:01:22.799> bit<00:01:23.010> of<00:01:23.100> reflective<00:01:23.580> light

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
be a little bit of reflective light

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.060 
be a little bit of reflective light
hitting<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.240> now<00:01:25.170> down<00:01:25.470> near<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.799> base

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
hitting there now down near the base

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.910 
hitting there now down near the base
don't<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.640> coloring<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.299> don't<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.930> shading

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
don't be coloring that don't be shading

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.850 
don't be coloring that don't be shading
that<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.310> too<00:01:30.180> much<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.900> you'll<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.650> why

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
that in too much because you'll see why

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.170 
that in too much because you'll see why
once<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.400> start<00:01:32.700> adding<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.030> shadow<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.909> here<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
once I start adding the shadow so here I

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.230 
once I start adding the shadow so here I
am<00:01:36.570> kind<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.020> filling<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> little<00:01:37.830> bit

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
am kind of filling it in a little bit

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.810 
am kind of filling it in a little bit
tracing<00:01:39.979> creating<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> darker

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
tracing creating more of a darker

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.820 
tracing creating more of a darker
outline<00:01:42.110> there's<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.530> little<00:01:43.710> bit

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
outline there's going to be a little bit

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.580 
outline there's going to be a little bit
of<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.979> shadow<00:01:44.220> near<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.390> other<00:01:45.570> edge<00:01:45.869> because

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
of a shadow near the other edge because

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.620 
of a shadow near the other edge because
of<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.549> way<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.850> light<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.570> be

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
of the way the light is going to be

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.760 
of the way the light is going to be
shining<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.290> Apple<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:51.439> so<00:01:52.439> here<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
shining on this Apple and so here you

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
shining on this Apple and so here you
can<00:01:53.009> kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.460> start<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.790> see<00:01:54.090> where<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
can kind of start to see where the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.899 
can kind of start to see where the
highlights<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> be<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.439> outline

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
highlights are going to be the outline

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.490 
highlights are going to be the outline
down<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.270> bottom<00:01:57.630> left<00:01:57.869> hand<00:01:57.990> corner<00:01:58.170> I

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
down in the bottom left hand corner I

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.200 
down in the bottom left hand corner I
just<00:01:58.710> added<00:01:58.860> some<00:01:59.130> lighter<00:01:59.460> shading<00:01:59.970> with<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
just added some lighter shading with the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.359 
just added some lighter shading with the
2h<00:02:00.600> pencil<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.619> get<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> cross<00:02:02.130> contour

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
2h pencil just to get the cross contour

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.670 
2h pencil just to get the cross contour
lines<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.939> there<00:02:03.060> make<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.450> look<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.470> very

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
lines in there make it look the very

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.130 
lines in there make it look the very
good<00:02:04.860> texture<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> Apple<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.780> up<00:02:06.930> and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
good texture of the Apple going up and

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.509 
good texture of the Apple going up and
down<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.560> don't<00:02:07.740> want<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.039> doing<00:02:08.340> like

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
down you don't want to be doing like

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:09.919 
down you don't want to be doing like
hatching<00:02:08.909> and<00:02:09.030> cross-hatching<00:02:09.060> with<00:02:09.810> these

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
hatching and cross-hatching with these

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.909 
hatching and cross-hatching with these
pencils<00:02:10.409> obviously<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:12.230> now<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.650> see

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:13.919 
pencils obviously so and now you can see

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.879 
pencils obviously so and now you can see
how<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.219> curve<00:02:14.879> of<00:02:15.239> that<00:02:15.349> of<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.590> part<00:02:16.829> of

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:16.889 
how the curve of that of that part of

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:18.140 
how the curve of that of that part of
the<00:02:16.950> Apple<00:02:17.400> there<00:02:17.700> is

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
the Apple there is

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.750 
the Apple there is
really<00:02:18.920> pronounced<00:02:19.920> it's<00:02:20.220> not<00:02:20.400> going<00:02:20.579> to<00:02:20.640> be

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
really pronounced it's not going to be

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.759 
really pronounced it's not going to be
so<00:02:21.120> much<00:02:21.360> pronounced<00:02:21.810> later<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.620> video

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
so much pronounced later in the video

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.030 
so much pronounced later in the video
but<00:02:23.370> right<00:02:24.090> now<00:02:24.329> I'm<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:25.290> trying<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.860> get<00:02:26.010> a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
but right now I'm just trying to get a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.949 
but right now I'm just trying to get a
feel<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.700> how<00:02:26.939> I'm<00:02:27.180> going<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.540> doing<00:02:27.689> this

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
feel of how I'm going to be doing this

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.929 
feel of how I'm going to be doing this
so<00:02:30.959> right<00:02:31.349> now<00:02:31.530> I'm<00:02:31.739> sharpening<00:02:32.129> my<00:02:32.280> pencil

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
so right now I'm sharpening my pencil

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.740 
so right now I'm sharpening my pencil
and<00:02:33.739> fiddling<00:02:34.739> with<00:02:34.859> the<00:02:35.069> sharpener<00:02:35.760> all

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
and fiddling with the sharpener all

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.300 
and fiddling with the sharpener all
right<00:02:36.959> I'm<00:02:37.109> back<00:02:37.319> now<00:02:37.349> I'm<00:02:37.590> adding<00:02:37.709> in<00:02:37.950> more<00:02:38.189> of

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
right I'm back now I'm adding in more of

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.960 
right I'm back now I'm adding in more of
those<00:02:38.900> craw<00:02:39.900> contour<00:02:40.349> lines<00:02:40.590> they're<00:02:40.970> adding

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
those craw contour lines they're adding

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.110 
those craw contour lines they're adding
in<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.180> highlight<00:02:43.819> basically<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.970> outline

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
in the highlight basically the outline

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.199 
in the highlight basically the outline
of<00:02:45.359> the<00:02:45.569> highlight<00:02:45.959> not<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.439> highlight<00:02:46.620> yet

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
of the highlight not the highlight yet

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.640 
of the highlight not the highlight yet
darkening<00:02:48.209> up<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.599> center<00:02:49.019> one<00:02:49.260> just<00:02:49.560> a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
darkening up that center one just a

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.129 
darkening up that center one just a
little<00:02:49.680> bit<00:02:49.980> adding<00:02:50.819> in<00:02:50.970> some<00:02:51.000> texture<00:02:51.989> with

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
little bit adding in some texture with

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.349 
little bit adding in some texture with
the<00:02:52.260> kneaded<00:02:52.530> eraser<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.489> rubber<00:02:53.700> eraser

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
the kneaded eraser and the rubber eraser

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.610 
the kneaded eraser and the rubber eraser
and<00:02:55.639> here<00:02:56.639> is<00:02:56.819> my<00:02:57.090> 2b<00:02:57.510> pencil<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:58.170> I'm<00:02:58.319> adding

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
and here is my 2b pencil that I'm adding

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.009 
and here is my 2b pencil that I'm adding
in<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.220> outside<00:02:59.879> lines<00:03:00.329> of<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:00.810> little

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
in the outside lines of the little

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.750 
in the outside lines of the little
indent<00:03:01.379> at<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.560> top<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.889> the<00:03:01.950> Apple<00:03:02.280> with<00:03:02.459> and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
indent at the top of the Apple with and

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.979 
indent at the top of the Apple with and
using<00:03:03.629> a<00:03:03.739> 2b<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.129> 2h<00:03:05.579> pencil<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.480> add<00:03:06.510> the

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
using a 2b and a 2h pencil to add the

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.280 
using a 2b and a 2h pencil to add the
little<00:03:08.120> texture<00:03:09.120> lines<00:03:09.359> there<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.170> are

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
little texture lines there that are

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.410 
little texture lines there that are
aiming<00:03:10.799> inward<00:03:11.370> can't<00:03:11.909> really<00:03:12.120> see<00:03:12.239> in<00:03:12.329> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
aiming inward can't really see in the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.539 
aiming inward can't really see in the
video<00:03:12.629> very<00:03:12.900> well<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:15.709> now<00:03:16.709> I'm<00:03:16.980> just<00:03:17.220> making

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
video very well and now I'm just making

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.059 
video very well and now I'm just making
the<00:03:17.639> edges<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.000> little<00:03:18.060> more<00:03:18.329> crisp<00:03:18.720> and

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
the edges a little more crisp and

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.740 
the edges a little more crisp and
remember<00:03:20.069> apples<00:03:20.549> are<00:03:20.700> not<00:03:20.849> symmetrical<00:03:21.569> so

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
remember apples are not symmetrical so

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.119 
remember apples are not symmetrical so
don't<00:03:21.930> make<00:03:22.049> your<00:03:22.260> Apple<00:03:22.500> symmetrical

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
don't make your Apple symmetrical

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.129 
don't make your Apple symmetrical
because<00:03:23.280> because<00:03:23.970> if<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.419> that<00:03:24.720> really

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
because because if it is that really

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.960 
because because if it is that really
takes<00:03:25.379> away<00:03:25.560> from<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.859> realistic<00:03:26.340> quality<00:03:26.819> of

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
takes away from the realistic quality of

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.180 
takes away from the realistic quality of
the<00:03:27.090> drawing<00:03:27.349> so<00:03:28.349> here<00:03:28.530> I'm<00:03:28.620> using<00:03:28.650> the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
the drawing so here I'm using the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.979 
the drawing so here I'm using the
blending<00:03:29.609> stump<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.060> little<00:03:30.299> bit<00:03:30.389> just<00:03:30.629> to<00:03:30.720> make

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
blending stump a little bit just to make

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.720 
blending stump a little bit just to make
everything<00:03:31.290> look<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.590> little<00:03:31.739> more<00:03:31.919> shiny<00:03:32.340> so

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
everything look a little more shiny so

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.379 
everything look a little more shiny so
it's<00:03:32.849> not<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.060> dull<00:03:33.629> boring<00:03:33.959> surface<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.389> now

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
it's not a dull boring surface and now

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:41.119 
it's not a dull boring surface and now
making<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.290> highlight<00:03:37.919> not<00:03:38.519> too<00:03:39.560> crisp<00:03:40.560> kind

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
making the highlight not too crisp kind

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.339 
making the highlight not too crisp kind
of<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.400> little<00:03:41.609> bit<00:03:41.819> of<00:03:41.849> a<00:03:42.150> lighter<00:03:42.750> shading

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
of a little bit of a lighter shading

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.770 
of a little bit of a lighter shading
around<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.919> just<00:03:44.099> to<00:03:44.280> make<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.489> look<00:03:44.879> a<00:03:45.120> little

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
around it just to make it look a little

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.509 
around it just to make it look a little
bit<00:03:46.019> more<00:03:46.230> of<00:03:46.349> a<00:03:46.440> dull<00:03:46.620> surface<00:03:46.889> but<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.250> don't

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
bit more of a dull surface but I don't

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.030 
bit more of a dull surface but I don't
want<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.849> to<00:03:48.000> look<00:03:48.209> like<00:03:48.569> a<00:03:48.870> glass<00:03:49.409> surface

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
want it to look like a glass surface

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.610 
want it to look like a glass surface
because<00:03:50.400> apples<00:03:50.849> are<00:03:51.090> not<00:03:51.269> this<00:03:52.049> Apple<00:03:52.409> is<00:03:52.500> not

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
because apples are not this Apple is not

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.219 
because apples are not this Apple is not
supposed<00:03:52.949> to<00:03:53.010> look<00:03:53.129> like<00:03:53.340> glass<00:03:53.569> now<00:03:54.569> here<00:03:55.199> I

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:55.229 
supposed to look like glass now here I

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:56.689 
supposed to look like glass now here I
just<00:03:55.560> took<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.829> little<00:03:55.919> bit<00:03:56.099> away<00:03:56.430> with<00:03:56.609> the

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
just took a little bit away with the

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.280 
just took a little bit away with the
kneaded<00:03:56.970> eraser<00:03:57.030> because<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.930> didn't<00:03:58.139> really

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
kneaded eraser because I didn't really

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.469 
kneaded eraser because I didn't really
like<00:03:58.409> how<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.650> was<00:03:58.919> looking<00:03:59.310> I'm<00:04:00.120> just<00:04:00.359> gonna

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:00.479 
like how that was looking I'm just gonna

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.599 
like how that was looking I'm just gonna
fill<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:00.780> back<00:04:01.109> in<00:04:01.319> again<00:04:01.560> make<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.310> look<00:04:02.579> a

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
fill that back in again make it look a

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.949 
fill that back in again make it look a
little<00:04:02.760> bit<00:04:02.940> better<00:04:03.919> and<00:04:05.569> here<00:04:06.569> I'm<00:04:06.750> just

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
little bit better and here I'm just

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.170 
little bit better and here I'm just
making<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.799> base<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.609> Apple<00:04:08.940> look<00:04:09.090> a

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
making the base of the Apple look a

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.979 
making the base of the Apple look a
little<00:04:09.419> cleaner<00:04:11.120> so<00:04:12.120> now<00:04:12.329> that<00:04:12.389> everything's

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
little cleaner so now that everything's

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.229 
little cleaner so now that everything's
smudged<00:04:13.440> here<00:04:13.799> I'm<00:04:14.810> gonna<00:04:15.810> start<00:04:16.289> adding<00:04:16.919> in

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
smudged here I'm gonna start adding in

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.210 
smudged here I'm gonna start adding in
making<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:18.389> stem<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.709> dent<00:04:19.949> there<00:04:20.190> a

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
making that stem and the dent there a

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.939 
making that stem and the dent there a
little<00:04:20.400> bit<00:04:20.549> more<00:04:20.609> detailed<00:04:21.470> just<00:04:22.470> kind<00:04:22.740> of

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
little bit more detailed just kind of

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.150 
little bit more detailed just kind of
blending<00:04:23.880> things<00:04:24.919> do

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
blending things do

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.790 
blending things do
in<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.730> last<00:04:27.000> last<00:04:27.750> kind<00:04:28.050> of<00:04:28.260> things<00:04:28.440> aside

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
in the last last kind of things aside

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.900 
in the last last kind of things aside
from<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.100> shadow<00:04:30.860> so<00:04:31.860> here<00:04:32.220> making<00:04:32.760> it<00:04:32.850> a

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
from the shadow so here making it a

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.270 
from the shadow so here making it a
little<00:04:33.060> bit<00:04:33.210> more<00:04:33.480> asymmetrical<00:04:34.280> just

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
little bit more asymmetrical just

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.190 
little bit more asymmetrical just
because<00:04:35.670> it<00:04:36.150> makes<00:04:36.480> it<00:04:36.690> look<00:04:36.840> a<00:04:36.900> little<00:04:37.020> bit

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
because it makes it look a little bit

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.029 
because it makes it look a little bit
more<00:04:37.350> realistic

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.549 

and<00:04:44.550> now<00:04:44.819> I'm<00:04:45.270> making<00:04:45.599> the<00:04:45.869> edges<00:04:46.110> crisper

00:04:46.549 --> 00:04:46.559 
and now I'm making the edges crisper

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:50.029 
and now I'm making the edges crisper
again<00:04:47.300> now<00:04:48.300> here<00:04:48.509> I'm<00:04:48.629> using<00:04:48.839> an<00:04:49.050> 8b<00:04:49.499> graphite

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
again now here I'm using an 8b graphite

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.429 
again now here I'm using an 8b graphite
lead<00:04:50.339> to<00:04:50.580> make<00:04:50.789> in<00:04:50.999> it<00:04:51.119> to<00:04:51.330> make<00:04:51.509> the<00:04:51.839> darkest

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
lead to make in it to make the darkest

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.339 
lead to make in it to make the darkest
parts<00:04:52.770> of<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:52.979> shadow<00:04:53.360> which<00:04:54.360> are<00:04:54.689> going<00:04:55.229> to

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
parts of the shadow which are going to

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:56.899 
parts of the shadow which are going to
be<00:04:55.439> at<00:04:55.559> the<00:04:55.680> base<00:04:55.860> of<00:04:55.889> the<00:04:56.189> Apple<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:56.699> and

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:56.909 
be at the base of the Apple and and

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:58.670 
be at the base of the Apple and and
shadows<00:04:57.389> start<00:04:57.779> to<00:04:57.930> become<00:04:58.229> a<00:04:58.259> little<00:04:58.589> bit

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
shadows start to become a little bit

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.510 
shadows start to become a little bit
less<00:04:58.860> crisp<00:04:59.219> and<00:04:59.460> a<00:04:59.969> little<00:05:00.270> bit<00:05:00.389> more<00:05:01.520> lighter

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
less crisp and a little bit more lighter

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.879 
less crisp and a little bit more lighter
as<00:05:02.939> they<00:05:03.389> go<00:05:03.869> farther<00:05:04.289> away<00:05:04.409> from<00:05:04.589> the

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
as they go farther away from the

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.549 
as they go farther away from the
original<00:05:05.009> object<00:05:05.629> so<00:05:06.629> you<00:05:06.689> can<00:05:06.930> see<00:05:07.229> there

00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:07.559 
original object so you can see there

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:11.029 
original object so you can see there
that's<00:05:07.919> what<00:05:08.249> I've<00:05:08.399> done<00:05:08.729> and<00:05:09.619> I'm<00:05:10.619> blending

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
that's what I've done and I'm blending

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.189 
that's what I've done and I'm blending
it<00:05:11.369> to<00:05:11.460> make<00:05:11.639> it<00:05:11.789> look<00:05:11.999> very<00:05:12.029> nice<00:05:12.659> and<00:05:12.960> clean

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
it to make it look very nice and clean

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.820 
it to make it look very nice and clean
with<00:05:13.469> the<00:05:14.629> blending<00:05:15.629> stump<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.229> you<00:05:16.439> can<00:05:16.589> see

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
with the blending stump and you can see

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.709 
with the blending stump and you can see
why<00:05:16.979> the<00:05:17.039> base<00:05:17.759> of<00:05:17.939> the<00:05:17.999> Apple<00:05:18.270> was<00:05:18.389> just<00:05:18.599> a

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
why the base of the Apple was just a

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:20.269 
why the base of the Apple was just a
little<00:05:18.930> bit<00:05:19.110> lighter<00:05:19.319> there<00:05:19.589> just<00:05:19.860> so<00:05:19.979> you<00:05:20.039> can

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:20.279 
little bit lighter there just so you can

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:22.459 
little bit lighter there just so you can
really<00:05:20.759> see<00:05:20.969> the<00:05:21.120> shadow<00:05:21.419> there<00:05:21.779> it's<00:05:22.289> not

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:22.469 
really see the shadow there it's not

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:23.989 
really see the shadow there it's not
going<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:22.830> stay<00:05:23.009> that<00:05:23.039> light<00:05:23.520> because<00:05:23.759> that's

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:23.999 
going to stay that light because that's

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:25.790 
going to stay that light because that's
a<00:05:24.180> bit<00:05:24.360> too<00:05:24.719> dramatic<00:05:24.960> there<00:05:25.439> I'm<00:05:25.589> going<00:05:25.710> to

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
a bit too dramatic there I'm going to

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.299 
a bit too dramatic there I'm going to
darken<00:05:26.189> that<00:05:26.309> up<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.669> little<00:05:26.909> bit<00:05:27.379> and<00:05:28.379> now<00:05:28.919> back

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:29.309 
darken that up a little bit and now back

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:32.869 
darken that up a little bit and now back
to<00:05:29.339> work<00:05:29.879> near<00:05:30.509> the<00:05:30.870> top<00:05:31.169> again<00:05:31.620> you'll<00:05:32.490> see<00:05:32.729> me

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:32.879 
to work near the top again you'll see me

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.029 
to work near the top again you'll see me
doing<00:05:33.210> in<00:05:33.389> a<00:05:33.479> couple<00:05:33.779> of<00:05:33.899> minutes<00:05:34.199> in<00:05:34.589> a<00:05:34.649> little

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
doing in a couple of minutes in a little

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.199 
doing in a couple of minutes in a little
while<00:05:35.159> here<00:05:36.020> just<00:05:37.020> making<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:37.800> top<00:05:38.039> a<00:05:38.370> little

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:39.209 
while here just making the top a little

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:42.859 
while here just making the top a little
bit<00:05:39.360> more<00:05:40.550> realistic<00:05:41.550> and<00:05:42.089> I'm<00:05:42.270> signing<00:05:42.629> it

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:42.869 
bit more realistic and I'm signing it

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:45.499 
bit more realistic and I'm signing it
and<00:05:42.959> with<00:05:43.379> a<00:05:43.409> few<00:05:43.649> finished<00:05:44.009> touches<00:05:44.430> this<00:05:45.300> is

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
and with a few finished touches this is

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:46.369 
and with a few finished touches this is
what<00:05:45.719> we'll<00:05:45.899> get

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
what we'll get

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.369 
what we'll get
thank<00:05:47.219> you
