00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.329
 their for are long periods in the 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.090
 sedentary activity and flight that I say 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.270
 many times he is not playing v but yes 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.459
 you stop and jazz and can have a 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.459
 drink water and all that and then you 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.820
 Your body is already making a 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.430
 movement and that makes the truth 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.010
 cold blood tucked between the veins and 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.410
 He says 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.210
 He would spend hours sitting in front of the 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.760
 screen of your xbox where he played 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.280
 programs like hey do not love me what 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.280
 halloween or apple as he commented his 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.290
 54 year old father lived for this game 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.020
 I never thought I was in danger 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.420
 as a parent you think that your children do not 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.360
 risk because you know what 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.650
 is doing agreed man because if 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.390
 see many times dads do not tell you 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.070
 nothing but you're in the locked room 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.860
 nothing more playing than the ok what is not 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.920
 news nothing but 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.000
 and there comes a time I'm going to you can 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.960
 pass like this 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.380
 So be careful what you say 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.410
 but the long but the long marathons 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.560
 from staniforth 30 his horror xbox and 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.050
 Aaron deteriorated his physical performance 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.440
 and the young man came to complain with a friend 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.350
 that her chest hurt not mames but 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.900
 that urges them but that after their 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.570
 heartbeat returned to normal 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.610
 the victim collapsed during that 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.160
 talk in the middle of the street in front of a 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.350
 work center where he had just had 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.140
 an interview and a barely sharp hand 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.150
 but not a web interview to work 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.920
 in what happened to him and he dropped a 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.800
 pack of chewing gum and when he crouched down to 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.040
 looking for him he sat up and grabbed him 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.810
 attack described his father to the press 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.700
 British and good mom you have to have 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.590
 be careful as we are gamer 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.970
 web or that we did not spend anything else 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.170

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.270
 like me 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.940
 and well, the same thing can happen to us 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.130
 you have to be very careful friends 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.840
 can give us a punctual attack not just 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.940
 because we are young people who believe that 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.230
 this good thing will happen to us, not just to 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.260
 the old passes had the young 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.540
 like this that those who did not do any 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.440

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.680

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.239
