00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
heard of it before so it may just be one

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.580 
heard of it before so it may just be one
of<00:01:53.310> those<00:01:53.369> stores<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.509> only<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:55.350> only

i<00:02:03.990> guess<00:02:04.310> um<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.939> yeah<00:02:06.090> i<00:02:06.840> guess<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.799> don't

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
i guess um but yeah i guess if you don't

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.219 
i guess um but yeah i guess if you don't
know<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.489> symbolism<00:02:09.270> behind<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.899> it's

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
know that the symbolism behind it it's

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.760 
know that the symbolism behind it it's
like<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.739> guess<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.099> Irish

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
like I guess in the Irish

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.370 
like I guess in the Irish
um<00:02:13.250> if<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.180> wear<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.510> like<00:02:14.630> this<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:15.260> means

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
um if you wear it like this it means

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.050 
um if you wear it like this it means
you're<00:02:15.620> single<00:02:16.040> or<00:02:16.220> like<00:02:16.400> you're<00:02:16.550> looking<00:02:16.880> for

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
you're single or like you're looking for

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.520 
you're single or like you're looking for
love<00:02:17.300> or<00:02:17.510> something<00:02:17.720> I'm<00:02:18.140> not<00:02:18.230> really<00:02:18.380> looking

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
love or something I'm not really looking

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.900 
love or something I'm not really looking
for<00:02:18.860> love<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.250> guess<00:02:19.460> that's<00:02:19.490> what<00:02:19.790> it's

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
for love but I guess that's what it's

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.910 
for love but I guess that's what it's
supposed<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.270> symbolize<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:21.080> it's<00:02:21.560> like<00:02:21.740> out

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
supposed to symbolize if it's like out

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.950 
supposed to symbolize if it's like out
it<00:02:22.190> means<00:02:22.310> your<00:02:22.520> heart<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.820> open<00:02:23.030> i<00:02:23.450> guess<00:02:23.660> and

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
it means your heart is open i guess and

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.060 
it means your heart is open i guess and
then<00:02:24.620> if<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.280> change<00:02:25.820> it<00:02:26.120> around<00:02:27.910> like<00:02:28.910> this

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
then if you change it around like this

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.870 
then if you change it around like this
then<00:02:31.070> it<00:02:31.190> means<00:02:31.310> like<00:02:31.490> you're<00:02:31.670> married

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
then it means like you're married

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.780 
then it means like you're married
relationship<00:02:32.360> or<00:02:32.870> something<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.800> i<00:02:34.160> mean<00:02:34.460> i

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
relationship or something so i mean i

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.250

top of that it's a turtleneck so you

since I'm wearing a turtleneck it
