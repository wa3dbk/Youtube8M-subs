 Gamers Review: Forza Horizon 2 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.400
 Welcome to the most prestigious festival 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.990
 of motoring in Europe, where they can drive the fastest and most powerful cars 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.939
 of the world by the most beautiful landscapes of southern Europe. All this while you tune in 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.550
 radio stations with spectacular music. This is how we could summarize the new Forza 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.329
 Horizon 2, which arrives on the Xbox consoles to please speed lovers. 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.750
 The Turn 10 studio again offers us one of the best motorsport experiences 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.090
 in a video game. Mixing the arcade style with simulation tones, it's a game that 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.440
 can be enjoyed by all types of players. It is not just a simple game of 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.170
 racing. It all revolves around the Horizon Motorsport Festival, which is a 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.200
 meeting for those in love with speed. Here you can prove your skills in different 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.979
 challenges and goals to become the best driver. 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.270
 The game takes place on a huge map that simulates southern France and northern Italy. You 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.659
 you have the freedom to travel the paths you want, and you will find challenges 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.340
 off it. In some races you will have to leave the tracks 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.340
 and enter the village streets, and even compete in open fields and plantations 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.170
 of vid. The challenges are booed. In some you will have 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.860
 who get the first place in the race, in other competitions against time and there will be 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.409
 some you need to get the best score. It's easy to activate the challenges, 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.610
 you just have to get to the exit point and push a button to start the event. 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.659
 When you finish each goal, you'll earn credits to upgrade or buy cars, and points 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.340
 of experiences with those who have risen. And just like in the game of Forza 5, its rivals 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.040
 are not the simple artificial intelligence of other games, if not the drivatars 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.930
 of other players and their friends who have the game. 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.349
 Driving each vehicle feels natural and easy. You must be very careful in the corners 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.680
 to get out of the way, plus you have the traditional rewind option 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.680
 the game if you hit. And you can practically feel the ground with the vibrations of your 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.819
 control. And how can you handle it, the presentation 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.470
 It's still spectacular. The vehicles are very detailed both outside and in view 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.349
 interior while driving. At the end of each race, you will see the damage your car received, plus 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.700
 when starting another event will be like new at no cost. 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.590
 For the very dedicated, there are options to customize the tuning of your favorite car, 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.590
 more if you just want to play, you will not have to enter this menu. 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.720
 Forza Horizon 2 is an excellent game that is simple to play, more time consuming to play 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.700
 be an expert. It has around 200 vehicles and you will need a couple of hours to enter 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.400
 complete in your style of play. 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.600
 We highly recommend you if you are in search of a cool and fun racing game. 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.000
