00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
a really good unit I like it may be the

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.660 
a really good unit I like it may be the
only<00:01:29.600> one<00:01:29.840> downfall<00:01:30.050> is<00:01:30.560> it<00:01:30.710> is<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:31.070> when

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
only one downfall is it is that when

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.490 
only one downfall is it is that when
you're<00:01:31.790> doing<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.060> vacuum<00:01:32.479> sealing<00:01:32.720> stuff<00:01:33.140> v

you're doing the vacuum sealing stuff v
you<00:01:33.890> got<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.520> use<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.640> little<00:01:34.909> bit<00:01:35.000> more<00:01:35.150> of<00:01:35.210> the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
you got to use a little bit more of the

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.530 
you got to use a little bit more of the
more<00:01:36.530> bag<00:01:36.830> than<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.640> really<00:01:37.940> need<00:01:37.970> in<00:01:38.420> order

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
more bag than you really need in order

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.660 
more bag than you really need in order
to<00:01:38.720> have<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.290> distance<00:01:39.950> that<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:40.220> takes<00:01:40.369> to<00:01:40.550> go

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
to have the distance that it takes to go

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.450 
to have the distance that it takes to go
to<00:01:41.119> do<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.990> but<00:01:42.440> just<00:01:42.710> run<00:01:42.950> through<00:01:43.159> it<00:01:43.250> just

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
to do it but just run through it just

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.920 
to do it but just run through it just
give<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:43.729> an<00:01:43.820> idea<00:01:43.909> if<00:01:44.240> no<00:01:44.420> one's<00:01:44.600> ever<00:01:44.720> done

the machine here and what's nice about
this<00:03:40.480> is<00:03:40.540> its<00:03:40.780> automatic<00:03:41.140> so<00:03:41.830> i<00:03:41.860> just<00:03:42.510> pop<00:03:43.510> it

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
this is its automatic so i just pop it

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.090 
this is its automatic so i just pop it
in<00:03:43.750> far<00:03:44.020> enough<00:03:44.050> for<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.500> machine<00:03:44.770> to<00:03:44.800> click

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
in far enough for the machine to click

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.390 
in far enough for the machine to click
on

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.220 

seal<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:52.600> on<00:03:52.750> its<00:03:52.900> own<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:55.600> I<00:03:55.870> guess<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.140> whole

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
seal it on its own and I guess the whole

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.410 
seal it on its own and I guess the whole
process<00:03:56.470> probably<00:03:56.950> takes<00:03:57.250> out<00:03:57.460> know<00:03:57.700> 15<00:03:58.300> 20

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
process probably takes out know 15 20

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.200 
process probably takes out know 15 20
seconds<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:58.960> guess<00:03:59.170> maybe<00:03:59.470> even<00:03:59.680> less<00:04:03.210> then

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
seconds I guess maybe even less then

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.190 
seconds I guess maybe even less then
that's<00:04:04.990> about<00:04:05.290> it<00:04:05.320> so<00:04:05.890> it's<00:04:06.100> a<00:04:06.400> pretty<00:04:07.270> little

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
that's about it so it's a pretty little

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.740 
that's about it so it's a pretty little
compact<00:04:08.710> meal<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.280> basically<00:04:10.210> I<00:04:10.330> just<00:04:10.540> keep

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
compact meal and basically I just keep

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.300 
compact meal and basically I just keep

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
doing as many as you need and put them

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.440 
doing as many as you need and put them
in<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.430> box<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:17.109> once<00:04:17.590> i'm<00:04:17.709> all<00:04:17.829> done<00:04:18.040> and<00:04:18.450> pans

use their master sheet it'll pretty much

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.380 
use their master sheet it'll pretty much

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
through for a certain number of days I

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.860 
through for a certain number of days I
think<00:04:36.190> this<00:04:36.280> one's<00:04:36.490> probably<00:04:36.640> good<00:04:36.940> for<00:04:36.970> maybe

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
think this one's probably good for maybe

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.210 
think this one's probably good for maybe
three<00:04:39.210> okay<00:04:40.290> three<00:04:41.290> that's<00:04:41.740> good<00:04:41.860> about<00:04:41.950> four

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
three okay three that's good about four

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.190

three<00:04:42.400> or<00:04:42.460> five<00:04:42.640> days<00:04:42.850> so<00:04:43.210> that's<00:04:43.900> kind<00:04:44.169> of

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
three or five days so that's kind of
