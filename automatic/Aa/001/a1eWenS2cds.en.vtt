the next morning after I've done taking

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.570 
the next morning after I've done taking
that<00:05:13.419> bath<00:05:13.630> in<00:05:13.870> epsom<00:05:14.169> salt<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:14.650> my<00:05:15.310> skin

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
that bath in epsom salt and my skin

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.730 
that bath in epsom salt and my skin
feels<00:05:15.789> a<00:05:15.909> lot<00:05:16.060> tighter<00:05:16.360> and<00:05:16.870> it<00:05:17.169> seems<00:05:17.590> like

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
feels a lot tighter and it seems like

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.980 
feels a lot tighter and it seems like
the<00:05:17.860> water<00:05:18.070> has<00:05:18.280> been<00:05:18.430> drawn<00:05:18.849> out<00:05:19.060> and<00:05:19.330> then

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
the water has been drawn out and then

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.170 
the water has been drawn out and then
when<00:05:20.110> you<00:05:20.199> cut<00:05:20.680> that<00:05:20.860> water

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
when you cut that water

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.390 
when you cut that water
