 vehicle created in the field 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.100
 the kind of fertile ground on the naked man 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.260
 from then on the facts and the party car activity turns into a jeep 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
 in synonyms of off-road vehicles 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.820

 square reporter if you pick up that older car 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.220
 forward you will see the technological revolution you will see a 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.780
 comfort in terms of stability suspension 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.650
 Comfort while driving comfort for travel 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.650
 but never losing capacity 4

 and within 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.310
 I'm looking for a very moderate focus. 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.740
 so today it offers the electronic stability program 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.400
 electronic anti-shock program traction control in any 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.399
 velocity 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
 with the internal space in addition the work 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.009
 in the trunk in April 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.009
 the sport until the 'special 40 minutes of mud 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.410
 for those who like to live life to keep an eye on the tire size due to 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.949
 you can show the beauties prove in practice was a goal 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:12.230
 the census of the house shows that the damage caused by the rains as 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.819
 things when entering the tarmac 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.819
 is to calibrate the legs pro rains 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.499
 top chile takes advantage 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.419
 the whole tradition of today

 john ashe at level 3 format 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.819
 a more technical track 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.089
 with erosion 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:32.139
 we are going to affect a lot of gravel 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:32.849

 beyond 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.840
 on the descents world all holy help 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.810
 the automatic braking system when following in inclined situations 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.810
 accentuated 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.219
 when it comes to climbing is also a hand of technology 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:00.669
 the piece goes up and down 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:04.039
 it becomes evident is a retraction of secaucus one year 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.870
 the car 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.930
 is practically scaled a wall and continues to rise as security 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.930
 comfort 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.589
 he has a May system 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:19.799
 I playing strong support from one hour to another without the car will be surprised if 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.879
 decelerate too much 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.189
 using 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:26.959
 again as in the first gear reduced 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.409
 where I can stand in the middle of the climb 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.449
 two seconds and the car has not been accelerated it follows it keeps the car 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:38.449
 in the middle of the climb safely without any problem 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:45.089
 This makes life easier on the trails. 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:50.609
 even those who do not have experience can venture among the most challenging 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.969
 At these times, we forget everything to focus on the car and the 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.969
 trail jipeiro that is of iron always has a doubt 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:06.930
 the road was decided
