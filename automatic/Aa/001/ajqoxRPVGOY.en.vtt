 package wrapped from China came in this form 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.830
 it says that there was damage to the act 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.840

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.550

 that there is likely fate there 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.130
 toy hilt something is not very valuable and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.480
 so it didn't bother me much 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.290
 because the track number there is Russian 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.140
 it means sending without 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:01:07.170
 international track was nothing 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:18.540

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.409
 is indicated 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.560
