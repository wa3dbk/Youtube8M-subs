00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
to start off on our close position then

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.330 
to start off on our close position then
ascendant<00:00:25.320> partner<00:00:25.619> out<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> end<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
slot doing the end one two three and one

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.999 
slot doing the end one two three and one
then<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:30.869> going<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> cut<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.650> basic

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
then I'm going to do a cut in basic

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.200 
then I'm going to do a cut in basic
which<00:00:32.099> means<00:00:32.309> I'm<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.610> change<00:00:32.910> hands

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
which means I'm going to change hands

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.610 
which means I'm going to change hands
and<00:00:33.329> now<00:00:33.450> she<00:00:33.510> passes<00:00:34.079> me<00:00:34.110> I'm<00:00:34.260> going<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.410> back

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
into the hand so this counts to three

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.650 
into the hand so this counts to three
and<00:00:37.829> one<00:00:38.489> I'm<00:00:38.730> catching<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.210> my<00:00:39.329> left<00:00:39.570> hand

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660

her<00:00:40.050> left<00:00:40.230> hand<00:00:40.469> I'm<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.219> pour<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.610> into

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
her left hand I'm going to pour it into

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.900 
her left hand I'm going to pour it into
shadow<00:00:42.059> as<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.390> stay<00:00:42.629> here<00:00:42.960> two<00:00:43.559> three<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.730> then

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
shadow as I stay here two three and then

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.279 
shadow as I stay here two three and then
as<00:00:45.030> she<00:00:45.059> dances<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.570> next<00:00:45.780> break<00:00:45.930> will<00:00:46.110> be<00:00:46.230> in

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
as she dances the next break will be in

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.470 
as she dances the next break will be in
shadow<00:00:46.530> position<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:47.760> will<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
shadow position and one will do the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.029 
shadow position and one will do the
footwork<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> left<00:00:49.230> turning<00:00:49.530> basic<00:00:49.739> while

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
footwork of a left turning basic while

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.569 
footwork of a left turning basic while
she<00:00:50.190> turns<00:00:50.370> under<00:00:50.730> count<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.870> three<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.860> one

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
she turns under count to three and one

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.979 
she turns under count to three and one
then<00:00:53.850> she'll<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> sliding<00:00:54.539> door<00:00:54.660> release

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
then she'll do a sliding door release

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.150 
then she'll do a sliding door release
which<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.350> means<00:00:55.530> an<00:00:55.649> underarm<00:00:55.920> release

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
which just means an underarm release

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.979 
which just means an underarm release

and we're back in an open position

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.770 
and we're back in an open position
real<00:01:23.159> nice<00:01:23.369> pattern<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> good<00:01:24.180> easy<00:01:24.390> flow

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
real nice pattern for a good easy flow

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.420 
real nice pattern for a good easy flow
let's<00:01:25.200> take<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> look<00:01:25.590> at<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.770> without<00:01:25.860> stopping

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
let's take a look at it without stopping

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.520 
let's take a look at it without stopping
I'm<00:01:26.630> one<00:01:27.630> two<00:01:28.320> three<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.280> one<00:01:29.850> two<00:01:30.290> three<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
I'm one two three and one two three and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.620 
I'm one two three and one two three and
one<00:01:32.070> two<00:01:32.570> three<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.780> one<00:01:34.290> two<00:01:34.729> three<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.939> one

one two three and one two three and one

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.050 
one two three and one two three and one
turn<00:01:37.290> around<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.759> two<00:01:39.420> three<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.350> one

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
turn around and one two three and one

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.190 
turn around and one two three and one
let's<00:01:42.060> go<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> little<00:01:42.329> faster<00:01:42.659> because<00:01:43.049> in

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
let's go a little faster because in

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.330 
let's go a little faster because in
reality<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.740> hustles<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> little<00:01:44.220> bit

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
reality that hustles a little bit

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.450 
reality that hustles a little bit
quicker<00:01:44.460> than<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.380> one<00:01:46.380> two<00:01:46.860> three

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
quicker than that and one two three
