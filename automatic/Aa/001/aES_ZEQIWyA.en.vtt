in<00:05:09.600> carbohydrates<00:05:10.560> that<00:05:10.620> I<00:05:10.710> could<00:05:10.950> find<00:05:11.250> there

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
in carbohydrates that I could find there

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.710 
in carbohydrates that I could find there
are<00:05:11.790> only<00:05:11.880> 17<00:05:12.750> net<00:05:12.960> carbs<00:05:13.380> in<00:05:13.620> each<00:05:14.330> so<00:05:15.330> maybe

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
are only 17 net carbs in each so maybe

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.850
