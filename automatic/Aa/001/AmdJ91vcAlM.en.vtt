00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
role a little bit in black ops because

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.590 
role a little bit in black ops because
you<00:01:44.700> can't<00:01:45.000> cap<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.570> flag<00:01:46.700> when<00:01:47.700> your<00:01:48.060> flag<00:01:48.360> is

not<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.960> its<00:01:49.110> base<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.310> defenders<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.790> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
not in its base so the defenders have to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.940 
not in its base so the defenders have to
sit<00:01:51.210> back<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.600> make<00:01:51.750> sure<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.799> other

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
defenders usually they push up a little

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.750 
defenders usually they push up a little
higher<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:13.870> try<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.860> clear<00:02:15.130> out<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.460> enemy

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.480 
higher and try to clear out the enemy
spawn<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.510> we<00:02:16.840> push<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.260> enemy<00:02:17.740> spawn<00:02:18.100> as<00:02:18.250> far

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
spawn so we push the enemy spawn as far

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.090 
spawn so we push the enemy spawn as far
back<00:02:18.670> as<00:02:18.730> possible<00:02:18.940> out<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:19.750> their<00:02:19.900> base<00:02:20.140> so

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
back as possible out of their base so

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.800 
back as possible out of their base so
the<00:02:21.460> runners<00:02:21.760> can<00:02:21.940> have<00:02:22.150> an<00:02:22.480> easier<00:02:22.780> time

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
the runners can have an easier time

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.680 
the runners can have an easier time
grabbing<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.500> flag<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.790> running<00:02:25.600> it

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.740 
they can run straight up the middle of
the<00:04:04.690> fire<00:04:04.930> path<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.860> other<00:04:06.010> team

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
the fire path and the other team

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.610 
the fire path and the other team
probably<00:04:07.750> won't<00:04:08.080> see<00:04:08.350> them<00:04:08.760> and/or<00:04:10.620> chase

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
probably won't see them and/or chase

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.080 
probably won't see them and/or chase
them<00:04:11.860> through<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.310> path<00:04:12.489> because<00:04:12.880> obviously

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
them through the path because obviously

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.090 
them through the path because obviously
they'll<00:04:13.600> die

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
they'll die

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.680 
they'll die
but<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.400> basic<00:04:16.820> thing<00:04:17.060> that<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.419> need<00:04:17.660> to

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
but the basic thing that you need to

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.569 
but the basic thing that you need to
remember<00:04:18.019> with<00:04:18.440> capture-the-flag<00:04:18.949> is<00:04:19.400> just

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
remember with capture-the-flag is just

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.969 
remember with capture-the-flag is just
constant<00:04:20.060> communication<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:20.900> that<00:04:21.620> kind<00:04:21.889> of

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
constant communication and that kind of

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.120 
constant communication and that kind of
holds<00:04:22.220> true<00:04:22.460> with<00:04:22.699> all<00:04:22.910> objective<00:04:23.449> game<00:04:23.630> types

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
holds true with all objective game types

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.100 
holds true with all objective game types
but<00:04:25.130> especially<00:04:25.760> with<00:04:26.180> this<00:04:26.419> because<00:04:26.780> you<00:04:26.960> got

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
but especially with this because you got

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.129 
but especially with this because you got
a<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.970> know<00:04:29.060> people<00:04:29.360> have<00:04:29.449> to<00:04:29.570> be<00:04:29.660> calling<00:04:29.990> out

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
a you know people have to be calling out

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.750 
a you know people have to be calling out
which<00:04:30.350> side<00:04:30.560> of<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.770> map<00:04:30.949> the<00:04:31.130> other<00:04:31.250> teams<00:04:31.520> on

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
which side of the map the other teams on

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.760 
which side of the map the other teams on
you<00:04:32.120> know<00:04:32.240> clear<00:04:32.660> routes<00:04:32.960> for<00:04:33.289> the<00:04:33.350> runners<00:04:33.740> to

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
you know clear routes for the runners to

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.939 
you know clear routes for the runners to
return<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.370> flag<00:04:34.639> and<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:36.500> know<00:04:36.590> things<00:04:36.860> of

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
return the flag and you know things of

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.820 
return the flag and you know things of
that<00:04:37.039> nature<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:37.720> it's<00:04:38.720> a<00:04:38.870> lot<00:04:39.050> easier<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.680> play

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
that nature so it's a lot easier to play

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.409 
that nature so it's a lot easier to play
with<00:04:40.160> a<00:04:40.190> group<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:40.580> six<00:04:40.789> people<00:04:40.850> that<00:04:41.270> you

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
with a group of six people that you

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.060 
with a group of six people that you
already<00:04:41.570> know<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.169> look<00:04:42.650> at<00:04:42.740> this<00:04:42.860> right<00:04:43.039> here

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
already know and look at this right here

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.490 
already know and look at this right here
that<00:04:43.220> was<00:04:43.520> so<00:04:44.510> much<00:04:44.690> of<00:04:44.840> a<00:04:44.900> tease<00:04:45.139> I<00:04:45.169> was

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
that was so much of a tease I was

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.900 
that was so much of a tease I was
getting<00:04:45.740> ready<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.949> go<00:04:46.100> into<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.490> dolphin

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
getting ready to go into the dolphin

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.950 
getting ready to go into the dolphin
dive<00:04:47.120> straight<00:04:47.990> into<00:04:48.340> our<00:04:49.340> flag<00:04:50.150> but<00:04:50.479> for<00:04:50.810> our

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
dive straight into our flag but for our

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.920 
dive straight into our flag but for our
base<00:04:51.860> but<00:04:52.250> I<00:04:52.280> got<00:04:52.669> sniped<00:04:52.970> at<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.270> last<00:04:53.449> moment

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
base but I got sniped at the last moment

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.900 
base but I got sniped at the last moment
I<00:04:54.229> think<00:04:54.680> Moxie<00:04:55.160> got<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.550> return<00:04:57.669> this<00:04:58.669> game

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
I think Moxie got that return this game

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.710 
I think Moxie got that return this game
isn't<00:04:59.270> particularly<00:04:59.900> spectacular<00:05:00.620> in<00:05:01.720> kill

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
isn't particularly spectacular in kill

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.170 
isn't particularly spectacular in kill
death<00:05:02.900> ratio<00:05:03.020> I<00:05:03.620> think<00:05:04.070> I<00:05:04.130> go<00:05:04.280> like<00:05:04.550> 12<00:05:04.850> and<00:05:04.970> 5

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
death ratio I think I go like 12 and 5

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.540 
death ratio I think I go like 12 and 5
or<00:05:05.419> something<00:05:05.690> like<00:05:05.810> that<00:05:05.870> but<00:05:06.260> that<00:05:06.919> wasn't

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
or something like that but that wasn't

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.260 
or something like that but that wasn't
my<00:05:07.760> role<00:05:08.000> my<00:05:08.479> role<00:05:08.510> in<00:05:09.020> this<00:05:09.229> was<00:05:09.560> to<00:05:09.949> run<00:05:10.880> flags

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
my role my role in this was to run flags

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.320 
my role my role in this was to run flags
and<00:05:11.630> to<00:05:12.020> stay<00:05:12.380> alive<00:05:12.710> and<00:05:13.039> I<00:05:13.130> think<00:05:13.400> I<00:05:13.520> had<00:05:13.699> I

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
and to stay alive and I think I had I

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.050 
and to stay alive and I think I had I
don't<00:05:14.870> remember<00:05:14.990> how<00:05:15.199> many<00:05:15.260> caps<00:05:15.590> I<00:05:15.740> had<00:05:15.919> but<00:05:16.220> I

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
don't remember how many caps I had but I

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.180 
don't remember how many caps I had but I
think<00:05:17.870> I<00:05:17.960> fulfilled<00:05:18.350> my<00:05:18.410> role<00:05:18.710> pretty<00:05:18.979> well

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
think I fulfilled my role pretty well

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.810 
think I fulfilled my role pretty well
and<00:05:20.440> you<00:05:21.440> know<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.770> role<00:05:21.949> of<00:05:21.979> the<00:05:22.460> Slayer<00:05:22.789> is

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
and you know the role of the Slayer is

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.000 
and you know the role of the Slayer is
left<00:05:23.510> to<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:23.780> defender<00:05:24.229> like<00:05:24.380> I<00:05:24.530> was<00:05:24.680> talking

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
left to the defender like I was talking
