00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello I have an out we do here in the 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.589
 mobile world congress on the last day and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.540
 We have here a white ford car with 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.150
 your lights your turn signals your wheels 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.670
 relevant as good car that is asia 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.289
 I hope it stands out for having almost four 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.029
 little candles on top that do not 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.100
 they stop touring design elements 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.199
 basically good a little more than 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.000
 designing the theme is that it's a car 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.220
 autonomous or at least that's what 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.710
 try to make us are explaining a 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.019
 little how it works and it really is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.399
 interesting to know about someone 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.640
 who is working on the subject 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.950
 a boy here we can not talk about 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.570
 but he explained to us that the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.360
 running a little bit of the car 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.879
 basically the car works like 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.030
 when driving anyone with three 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.760
 factors have the field of vision that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.059
 we have and understand the field of vision 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.610
 process it 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.949
 what we are seeing and finally as 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.270
 execute the actions we want to do 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.160
 when we are driving that is to say they are 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.359
 three very important factors that all 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.740
 we have to carry out when 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.230
 we drive 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.600
 then this system works if 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.310
 it works then in the first part with 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.290
 the sensors let's say you have four 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.340
 laser sensors that do not stop rotating that 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.410
 they have cameras inside is what they do and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.510
 what it does is pull the arms and 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.520
 bounce then it is determining the 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.220
 environment and on the other hand it also has 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
 some gps that we see them there redondito there 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.870
 one in the front and one in the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.340
 back are two basically for 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.590
 know which direction we are going 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.540
 we are locating that is if we are 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.070
 going to one street towards the other to 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.320
 know where is our 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.940
 location and what is our sense and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.500
 otherwise it has cameras that 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.500
 They are also located around the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.630
 car and finally a radio radars that 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.180
 they also serve to understand the environment 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.000
 that surrounds this vehicle in total are 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.250
 32 lasers some have commented that 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.990
 make a total of 2.8 million 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.610
 operations per second that is to say for 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.250
 know everything we have on the environment 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.810
 and to be able to avoid obstacles or 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.760
 follow the instructions if we want 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.190
 get to a place because all that what 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.080
 conglomerate in be in these many 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.830
 operations that he performs passing to 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.320
 next step 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.460
 the process of processing the information here is 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.140
 where we find that fort is 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.240
 complicates a little more and that in this case 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.180
 google is one step ahead 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.620
 second we understand because it's easy to have 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.540
 the sensors let's say when we get 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.280
 sensors and others but the code that 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.320
 process all that information you receive 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.670
 it's really good complicated and we 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.990
 comment before sports totally 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.390
 different surely to the one that has 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.010
 google would be here is where good 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.500
 we understand that the greatest 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.960
 handicap for the other companies google 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.250
 handles information very well and good 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.110
 surely ours but but good 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.390
 we already understand that there is one of the 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.860
 handicaps and that all that part is handled 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.740
 in the back of the car in the 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.910
 exact trunk that has all the 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.580
 computers to process information 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.290
 what it receives is where it is processed 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.640
 all this information on the other hand I 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.680
 I wanted to emphasize also that it is a car 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.630
 hybrid I do not know if we have commented or not 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.180
 so obviously it works in a way 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.130
 electric and also with gasoline and by 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.410
 another side to emphasize that they have commented to us 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.240
 that works then at various speeds 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.740
 quite high we have asked the 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.269
 guys is not taking care says that 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.040
 he runs pretty fast he does not want to tell me 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.730
 how many kilometers but so that 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.330
 It seems 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.190
 quickly and quietly on the highway 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.459
 last good we were commenting how 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:27.150
 it is related to the environment 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.650
 around what you are seeing this and 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.510
 this is where good told us that 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.069
 good principle works well but that 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.049
 at certain times still them 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.610
 it costs for example when there is rain not 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.980
 of the sensors are a little complicated 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.180
 determine the environment and also by 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.500
 example when there is a policeman giving 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.569
 signs and others that are the steps 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.519
 following necessary for this 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.390
 car really ends up working for 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.700
 true 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.440
 Having said that I think it's because if you do not 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.030
 we have nothing more to comment the os 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.129
 we will say that you subscribe our channel 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.480
 what do you like this video that 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.190
 share with your friends that 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.170
 visit each and every one of the videos 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.400
 of the list and that we have prepared the 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.859
 playlist of this bad walk 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.340
 on the 2014 and nothing else until the next 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.340
 video
