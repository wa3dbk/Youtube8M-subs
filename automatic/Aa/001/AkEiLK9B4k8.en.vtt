Bozak's<00:02:36.129> NHL<00:02:36.790> career<00:02:37.000> now<00:02:37.420> looking<00:02:37.750> at

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
Bozak's NHL career now looking at

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.420 
Bozak's NHL career now looking at

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
analytics not looking at any of that it

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.680 
analytics not looking at any of that it
might<00:02:39.610> have<00:02:39.700> been<00:02:39.730> really<00:02:39.970> good<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.299> don't<00:02:40.569> know

might have been really good I don't know
but<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.830> me<00:02:42.010> was<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.489> best<00:02:42.819> game<00:02:43.180> of

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
but that to me was the best game of

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.180 
but that to me was the best game of
bozek's<00:02:43.780> career<00:02:44.140> because<00:02:44.410> he<00:02:44.560> had<00:02:44.769> three
