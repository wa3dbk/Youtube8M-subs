00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.280
 ah 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.800
 or the laws that are welcome again 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.139
 to my channel today I bring you unister axis in 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.480
 the map of nu that is a 2025 in black 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.730
 ops 2 the truth is awesome I think 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.590
 that until today is the best interest 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.029
 what's going to be on channel 1 this 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.550
 interest what will allow us is 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.860
 play mini games on a machine 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.810
 recreational type those arcade games that 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.970
 there were a few years ago and for that 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.160
 we will simply have to shoot at 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.800
 head of all the mannequins that there are in 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.510
 the map remember that in black ops 2 there 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.210
 some elements of the maps that go 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.860
 changing location then no no 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.750
 you'll find the mannequins in the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.100
 same site that you will see in my video 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.870
 you will have to look for them and 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.370
 shoot them in the head one by one 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.840
 with which you leave one alone and we are going to 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.690
 leave the clichÃ© then you will have to 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.610
 make sure that we have none left 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.380
 by shooting action so you see that it does not come out 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.630
 the itcj may be because you are missing 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.420
 one that is off the map is the last 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.000
 that fired me and I did it to post 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.710
 that you notice well because it is the most 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.939
 hard to find good yes we have 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.729
 done well we will see on the screen 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.409
 central that puts activision to play 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.420
 we will have to give the X or the 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.140
 square in case of the play and we can 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.270
 alternate 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.490
 between four types of games and good 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.290
 so there are no doubts to tell you that the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.180
 manikins does not matter with what weapon 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.070
 we shoot and that also if we are with 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.960
 friends will see us play this minigame 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.600
 so you can invite our 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.880
 friends teach you what to stay 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.190
 overwhelmed and good yes I would like 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.290
 ask you this time I never do it but 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.790
 well I would like you to share and if 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.250
 this video with your friends or 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.590
 acquaintances is valid and that you leave your like 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.540
 your comment since I think it is 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.159
 the best glitch that there is until the day of 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.930
 today in the channel, yes, I would like 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.640

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.140

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.810
 a lot and good people I hope that I have 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:57.380

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.380

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.799
 less 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.970
 and who does not 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.930

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.000
 to die 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.950
 What is it 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.500
 where 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.560
