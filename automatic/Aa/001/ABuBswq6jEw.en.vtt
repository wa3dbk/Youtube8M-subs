00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.190 
paraffin is expensive and I'm using
kerosene<00:01:59.460> here<00:02:00.000> which<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.420> cheaper<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.960> works

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
kerosene here which is cheaper it works

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.780 
kerosene here which is cheaper it works
at<00:02:01.380> about<00:02:01.530> 77<00:02:02.369> thought<00:02:02.579> into<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
at about 77 thought into the

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.000 
at about 77 thought into the
this<00:02:04.450> will<00:02:04.720> dissolve<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.170> grease<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:05.890> this

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
this will dissolve the grease and this

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.560 
this will dissolve the grease and this
is<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.190> whole<00:02:06.340> idea<00:02:06.370> of<00:02:06.760> a<00:02:06.880> wash<00:02:07.090> tank<00:02:07.330> is<00:02:07.540> a

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
is the whole idea of a wash tank is a

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.710 
is the whole idea of a wash tank is a
degreasing<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:09.070> smaller<00:02:09.399> 15<00:02:10.119> litre<00:02:10.390> wash

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
degreasing the smaller 15 litre wash

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.780 
degreasing the smaller 15 litre wash
tank<00:02:11.020> will<00:02:11.200> not<00:02:11.230> take<00:02:11.800> large<00:02:12.040> components<00:02:12.640> like

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
tank will not take large components like

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.630 
tank will not take large components like
cylinder<00:02:13.300> heads<00:02:13.480> or<00:02:13.660> crank<00:02:14.020> shafts<00:02:14.640> whereas

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
cylinder heads or crank shafts whereas

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.120 
cylinder heads or crank shafts whereas
the<00:02:15.790> larger<00:02:16.180> 20<00:02:16.480> gallon<00:02:16.870> one<00:02:17.050> will<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.770> this

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
the larger 20 gallon one will and this

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.930 
the larger 20 gallon one will and this
is<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.520> best<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:19.600> have<00:02:19.750> in<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.930> workshop

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
is the best to have in a workshop

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.790 
is the best to have in a workshop
however<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.330> smaller<00:02:22.630> one<00:02:22.900> will<00:02:23.200> take<00:02:23.530> the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
however the smaller one will take the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.250 
however the smaller one will take the
small<00:02:24.040> components<00:02:24.820> it<00:02:25.030> very<00:02:25.270> much<00:02:25.420> depends<00:02:26.200> on

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
small components it very much depends on

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.600 
small components it very much depends on
what<00:02:26.770> you're<00:02:26.920> doing<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.460> your<00:02:27.490> workshop<00:02:29.610> if

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
what you're doing in your workshop if

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.100 
what you're doing in your workshop if
you're<00:02:30.790> doing<00:02:30.910> wheel<00:02:31.180> bearings<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.720> need<00:02:31.960> to

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
you're doing wheel bearings you need to

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.290 
you're doing wheel bearings you need to
remove<00:02:32.470> as<00:02:32.650> much<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.250> grease<00:02:33.490> as<00:02:33.700> possible

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
remove as much of the grease as possible

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.890 
remove as much of the grease as possible
before<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.110> go<00:02:35.410> ahead<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:35.920> wash<00:02:36.900> basically

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
before you go ahead and wash basically

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.630 
before you go ahead and wash basically
this<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.260> what<00:02:38.410> happens<00:02:38.860> when<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.220> do<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.370> few

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
this is what happens when you do a few

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.310 
this is what happens when you do a few
sets<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:40.000> wheel<00:02:40.180> bearings<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.990> few<00:02:41.170> other

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
sets of wheel bearings and a few other

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.340 
sets of wheel bearings and a few other
components<00:02:42.010> with<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.400> small<00:02:42.760> tank<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.510> lot<00:02:44.260> of

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
components with a small tank a lot of

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.820 
components with a small tank a lot of
sludge<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:46.150> light<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.660> tank<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.410> longer

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
sludge the light of the tank the longer

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.160 
sludge the light of the tank the longer
the<00:02:47.920> fluids<00:02:48.340> going<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.760> last<00:02:49.120> as<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.630> dilutes

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
the fluids going to last as it dilutes

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.320 
the fluids going to last as it dilutes
the<00:02:50.320> dirt<00:02:50.620> that's<00:02:50.890> in<00:02:51.040> there<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.490> I<00:02:52.150> think

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
the dirt that's in there and I think

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.820 
the dirt that's in there and I think
this<00:02:52.420> will<00:02:52.540> get<00:02:52.660> changed<00:02:53.050> probably<00:02:53.200> after<00:02:53.800> a

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
this will get changed probably after a

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.210 
this will get changed probably after a
year<00:02:54.430> or<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:56.200> one<00:02:56.410> here<00:02:56.650> we've<00:02:56.800> acquired

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
year or so this one here we've acquired

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.720 
year or so this one here we've acquired

tank<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.210> of<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.510> size<00:03:08.570> is<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.140> cost<00:03:09.500> of

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
tank that is of this size is the cost of
