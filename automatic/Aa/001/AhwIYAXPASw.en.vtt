00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
what's going on everyone welcome to your

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.030 
what's going on everyone welcome to your
26th<00:00:03.090> java<00:00:03.480> tutorial<00:00:03.720> and<00:00:04.170> in<00:00:04.799> this<00:00:04.830> tutorial

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
26th java tutorial and in this tutorial

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.340 
26th java tutorial and in this tutorial
i'm<00:00:05.790> going<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.060> be<00:00:06.120> building<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.690> random<00:00:07.109> number

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
i'm going to be building a random number

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.890 
i'm going to be building a random number
generator<00:00:08.120> we're<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.330> be<00:00:09.389> importing

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
generator we're going to be importing

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.680 
generator we're going to be importing
that<00:00:10.050> from<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.320> class<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.920> i'm<00:00:11.160> going<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.370> be

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
that from a class and i'm going to be

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.539 
that from a class and i'm going to be
showing<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.870> how<00:00:12.929> can<00:00:13.230> use<00:00:13.469> random<00:00:14.250> number

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
showing you how can use random number

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.880 
showing you how can use random number
generators<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.990> guess<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.199> generate

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
generators to you guess that generate

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.340 
generators to you guess that generate
random<00:00:17.100> numbers<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.510> let's<00:00:18.779> go<00:00:18.930> ahead<00:00:19.140> and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
random numbers so let's go ahead and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.830 
random numbers so let's go ahead and
pretend<00:00:19.590> we<00:00:19.980> were<00:00:20.130> building<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.670> program<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.689> we

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
pretend we were building a program so we

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.160 
pretend we were building a program so we
could<00:00:21.960> roll<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> dice<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:23.720> whatever<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
could roll a dice and whatever the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.950 
could roll a dice and whatever the
outcome<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:26.220> dice<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:27.029> just<00:00:27.300> outputted<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.840> our

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
outcome of dice it just outputted on our

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.980 
outcome of dice it just outputted on our
screen<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.640> whenever<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.939> want<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.210> use<00:00:30.269> random

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
screen so whenever we want to use random

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.810 
screen so whenever we want to use random
numbers<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.529> need<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> import<00:00:32.279> something<00:00:32.520> like

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
numbers we need to import something like

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.450 
numbers we need to import something like
we<00:00:32.940> did<00:00:33.120> scanner<00:00:33.559> but<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.770> one<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.100> called<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
we did scanner but this one is called a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.080 
we did scanner but this one is called a
random<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.120> go<00:00:36.300> ahead<00:00:36.510> put<00:00:36.750> import<00:00:38.090> java.util

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
random so go ahead put import java.util

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.880 
random so go ahead put import java.util
in<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:40.590> name<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.340> random<00:00:42.590> well<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
in the name for this is random well a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.880 
in the name for this is random well a
smoker's<00:00:44.670> cough<00:00:44.760> or<00:00:45.090> something<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:46.320> let's<00:00:46.739> go

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
smoker's cough or something so let's go

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.010 
smoker's cough or something so let's go
ahead<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.309> import<00:00:47.700> random<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.420> now<00:00:48.660> just

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
ahead and import random and now just

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.350 
ahead and import random and now just
like<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.500> scanner<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.250> need<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.579> make<00:00:51.239> an

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
like the scanner we need to make an

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.240 
like the scanner we need to make an
object<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.590> I'm<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> name<00:00:53.219> my

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
object for it so I'm going to name my

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.189 
object for it so I'm going to name my
dice<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.120> name<00:00:54.449> yours<00:00:54.660> whatever<00:00:54.899> you

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
dice you can name yours whatever you

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.610 
dice you can name yours whatever you
want<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:56.340> course<00:00:56.579> that's<00:00:56.789> equal<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.149> nu

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
want and of course that's equal to nu

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.099 
want and of course that's equal to nu
naught<00:00:58.620> R<00:00:58.649> atom<00:00:59.359> random<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.840> empty

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
naught R atom random with empty

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.189 
naught R atom random with empty
parameters<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:02.670> now<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.539> got<00:01:03.690> our<00:01:03.899> dice

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
parameters so now that we got our dice

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.730 
parameters so now that we got our dice
object<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:05.010> can<00:01:05.159> use<00:01:05.220> random<00:01:06.030> numbers<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
object we can use random numbers so the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.130 
object we can use random numbers so the
other<00:01:08.010> thing<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.340> need<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.140> temporary

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
other thing we need is a temporary

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.859 
other thing we need is a temporary
variable<00:01:10.710> called<00:01:11.130> number<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:12.450> doesn't<00:01:12.780> need

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
variable called number it doesn't need

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.969 
variable called number it doesn't need
to<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:12.990> called<00:01:13.229> number<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
to be called number but I'm going to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.499 
to be called number but I'm going to
call<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.280> number<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
call it number and this is going to

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.649 
call it number and this is going to
store<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> number<00:01:16.610> that<00:01:17.610> outputs<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
store the number that outputs on the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.539 
store the number that outputs on the
dice<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.740> example<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.340> store

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
dice so for example it's going to store

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.230 
dice so for example it's going to store
1<00:01:20.820> 2<00:01:20.939> 6<00:01:21.150> depending<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.720> what<00:01:21.960> number<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.409> roll

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
1 2 6 depending on what number you roll

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.480 
1 2 6 depending on what number you roll
so<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.740> don't<00:01:25.890> want<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.189> roll<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> dice

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
so I just don't want to roll the dice

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.880 
so I just don't want to roll the dice
once<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.299> want<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> roll<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.869> 10<00:01:28.140> times<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.710> for

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
once I want to roll it 10 times so for

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.469 
once I want to roll it 10 times so for
that<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> need<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:30.000> loop<00:01:30.240> so

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
that I'm going to need a for loop so

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.679 
that I'm going to need a for loop so
let's<00:01:31.049> go<00:01:31.350> ahead<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.590> put<00:01:31.829> forward<00:01:32.130> in

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
let's go ahead and put forward in

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.649 
let's go ahead and put forward in
counter<00:01:33.689> let's<00:01:34.470> start<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.890> at<00:01:35.009> 1<00:01:35.570> let's<00:01:36.570> say

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
counter let's start it at 1 let's say

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.319 
counter let's start it at 1 let's say
well<00:01:36.900> counter<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.590> less<00:01:37.920> than<00:01:38.130> or<00:01:38.280> equal<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> 10

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
well counter is less than or equal to 10

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.870 
well counter is less than or equal to 10
less<00:01:39.810> than<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.110> equal<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> 10<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.880> let's

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
less than or equal to 10 and let's

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.859 
less than or equal to 10 and let's
increment<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.420> by<00:01:42.450> 1<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:44.310> now<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.630> loop

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
increment it by 1 so now we have a loop

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.020 
increment it by 1 so now we have a loop
that's<00:01:46.079> executing<00:01:46.649> 10<00:01:46.890> times<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.640> now<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.880> got

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that's executing 10 times so now we got

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.330 
that's executing 10 times so now we got
to<00:01:48.119> give<00:01:48.240> some<00:01:48.450> instruction<00:01:49.020> well<00:01:49.950> since<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
to give some instruction well since the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.249 
to give some instruction well since the
number<00:01:50.579> doesn't<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> value<00:01:51.299> yet<00:01:51.630> let's<00:01:52.079> go

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
number doesn't have a value yet let's go

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.760 
number doesn't have a value yet let's go
ahead<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.649> give<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.130> value<00:01:54.110> now<00:01:55.110> what<00:01:55.649> you

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
ahead and give it a value now what you

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.039 
ahead and give it a value now what you
would<00:01:55.920> usually<00:01:56.159> do<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.850> use<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.360> object<00:01:57.840> like

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
would usually do is use your object like

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.370 
would usually do is use your object like
this<00:01:58.259> number<00:01:58.710> equals<00:01:59.310> dice<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.240> then<00:02:00.990> put

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
this number equals dice and then put

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.100 
this number equals dice and then put
your<00:02:01.469> dot<00:02:01.680> separator<00:02:02.189> next<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.420> because

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
your dot separator next in because

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.260 
your dot separator next in because
you're<00:02:04.290> getting<00:02:04.439> an<00:02:04.680> integer<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.219> then<00:02:06.000> type

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you're getting an integer and then type

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.029 
you're getting an integer and then type
in<00:02:06.450> how<00:02:06.659> many<00:02:06.869> options<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.439> want<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.860> have

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
in how many options you want it to have

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.999 
in how many options you want it to have
and<00:02:08.310> since<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.060> dice<00:02:09.360> has<00:02:09.599> options<00:02:10.140> 1<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.530> 6<00:02:10.800> I'm

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
and since a dice has options 1 to 6 I'm

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.500 
and since a dice has options 1 to 6 I'm
going<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.310> go

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
going to go

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.679 
going to go
and<00:02:11.629> +6<00:02:12.140> right<00:02:12.319> there<00:02:12.819> now<00:02:13.819> this<00:02:14.120> would<00:02:14.420> work

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:14.689 
and +6 right there now this would work

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.449 
and +6 right there now this would work
right<00:02:15.319> here<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.829> let<00:02:15.980> me<00:02:16.010> show<00:02:16.129> you<00:02:16.250> guys<00:02:16.340> what

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
right here and let me show you guys what

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.140 
right here and let me show you guys what
this<00:02:16.819> does<00:02:17.379> let's<00:02:18.379> just<00:02:18.530> go<00:02:18.650> ahead<00:02:18.739> and

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.199 

system.out.print<00:02:23.150> line<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:24.909> this<00:02:25.909> is<00:02:26.180> a

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
system.out.print line and this is a

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.000 
system.out.print line and this is a
going<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.780> work<00:02:26.930> fine<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:27.650> can<00:02:27.860> pay

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
going to work fine so you can pay

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.509 
going to work fine so you can pay
attention<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.549> number<00:02:28.940> plus<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:31.280> we

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
attention to this number plus and we

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.020 
attention to this number plus and we
don't<00:02:31.700> need<00:02:31.819> that<00:02:31.879> other<00:02:32.150> one<00:02:32.360> right<00:02:32.540> there<00:02:32.780> so

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
don't need that other one right there so

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.850 
don't need that other one right there so
look<00:02:35.030> good

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
look good

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.289 
look good
let's<00:02:36.860> go<00:02:37.010> enough<00:02:37.250> let's<00:02:37.819> run<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.209> see

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
let's go enough let's run it and see

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:46.330 
let's go enough let's run it and see
what<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.569> does<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:40.010> says<00:02:41.859> 3<00:02:42.859> 2<00:02:43.099> 3<00:02:43.129> 4<00:02:43.519> 5<00:02:44.060> 0<00:02:44.450> 1<00:02:44.569> 1<00:02:45.440> 2<00:02:45.799> 1

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
what it does it says 3 2 3 4 5 0 1 1 2 1

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.580 
what it does it says 3 2 3 4 5 0 1 1 2 1
those<00:02:46.879> look<00:02:47.060> like<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.269> random<00:02:47.629> numbers<00:02:47.959> but<00:02:48.470> the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
those look like a random numbers but the

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.949 
those look like a random numbers but the
problem<00:02:49.069> is<00:02:49.250> all<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.790> these<00:02:50.239> random<00:02:50.480> numbers

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
problem is all of these random numbers

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.860 
problem is all of these random numbers
if<00:02:51.139> you<00:02:51.230> couldn't<00:02:51.500> tell<00:02:51.680> they<00:02:52.609> go<00:02:52.790> from<00:02:53.030> 0<00:02:53.389> to<00:02:53.480> 5

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
if you couldn't tell they go from 0 to 5

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.280 
if you couldn't tell they go from 0 to 5
and<00:02:54.250> why<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.549> well<00:02:56.389> I'm<00:02:56.659> about<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.139> show

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
and why is that well I'm about to show

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.640 
and why is that well I'm about to show
you<00:02:57.319> guys<00:02:57.560> right<00:02:57.829> now<00:02:58.450> whenever<00:02:59.450> you<00:02:59.930> use<00:03:00.230> the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
you guys right now whenever you use the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.979 
you guys right now whenever you use the
sarandon<00:03:01.159> number<00:03:01.430> generator<00:03:01.909> and<00:03:02.209> you<00:03:02.810> give

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
sarandon number generator and you give

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.530 
sarandon number generator and you give
it<00:03:03.139> 6<00:03:03.470> options<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.459> options<00:03:04.909> that<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.299> takes

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
it 6 options the options that it takes

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.220 
it 6 options the options that it takes
by<00:03:05.720> default<00:03:05.780> are<00:03:06.379> 0<00:03:07.129> through<00:03:08.030> 5<00:03:08.269> if<00:03:08.629> you<00:03:08.750> use<00:03:08.930> 6

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
by default are 0 through 5 if you use 6

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.069 
by default are 0 through 5 if you use 6
again<00:03:10.010> that's<00:03:10.370> 6<00:03:10.670> numbers<00:03:11.060> but<00:03:11.750> when<00:03:11.959> it

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
again that's 6 numbers but when it

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.140 
again that's 6 numbers but when it
includes<00:03:12.440> 0<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:13.549> only<00:03:13.819> goes<00:03:14.090> 0<00:03:14.510> 1<00:03:14.989> 2<00:03:15.230> 3<00:03:15.260> 4<00:03:15.889> 5<00:03:16.190> so

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
includes 0 it only goes 0 1 2 3 4 5 so

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.930 
includes 0 it only goes 0 1 2 3 4 5 so
what<00:03:17.480> if<00:03:17.629> instead<00:03:17.870> of<00:03:18.169> 0<00:03:18.560> through<00:03:18.919> 5<00:03:19.160> is<00:03:19.519> your<00:03:19.699> 6

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
what if instead of 0 through 5 is your 6

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.199 
what if instead of 0 through 5 is your 6
options<00:03:20.359> you<00:03:20.900> wanted<00:03:21.290> 1<00:03:21.530> through<00:03:21.919> 6<00:03:22.250> which<00:03:23.000> we

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
options you wanted 1 through 6 which we

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.059 
options you wanted 1 through 6 which we
do<00:03:23.389> want<00:03:23.690> since<00:03:23.989> it's<00:03:24.139> the<00:03:24.260> dice<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.889> dice

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
do want since it's the dice and the dice

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.330 
do want since it's the dice and the dice
doesn't<00:03:25.370> have<00:03:25.459> 0<00:03:25.760> well<00:03:26.750> what<00:03:27.379> will<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:27.739> do<00:03:28.069> in

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
doesn't have 0 well what will you do in

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.530 
doesn't have 0 well what will you do in
this<00:03:28.639> case<00:03:28.910> is<00:03:29.329> simply<00:03:29.660> put<00:03:30.049> 1<00:03:30.349> plus<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.699> then

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
this case is simply put 1 plus and then

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.869 
this case is simply put 1 plus and then
use<00:03:32.900> our<00:03:33.199> dice<00:03:33.530> object<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.160> call<00:03:34.340> this<00:03:34.549> and

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
use our dice object to call this and

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.390 
use our dice object to call this and
what<00:03:35.419> this<00:03:35.569> does<00:03:35.870> is<00:03:36.079> it<00:03:36.260> still<00:03:36.560> uses<00:03:37.069> the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
what this does is it still uses the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.330 
what this does is it still uses the
number<00:03:37.549> 0<00:03:38.090> through<00:03:38.359> 5<00:03:38.540> in<00:03:38.780> this<00:03:38.959> but<00:03:39.680> adds<00:03:39.919> 1<00:03:40.310> to

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
number 0 through 5 in this but adds 1 to

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.280 
number 0 through 5 in this but adds 1 to
them<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:41.299> what<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:41.599> does<00:03:41.750> is<00:03:41.959> give<00:03:42.169> the

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
them so what it does is give the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.680 
them so what it does is give the
illusion<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:43.099> we're<00:03:43.970> getting<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.359> numbers

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
illusion that we're getting the numbers

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.920 
illusion that we're getting the numbers
1<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.199> 6<00:03:45.500> 1<00:03:46.040> through<00:03:46.280> 6<00:03:46.579> excuse<00:03:46.970> me<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:47.780> now

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
1 to 6 1 through 6 excuse me so now

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.599 
1 to 6 1 through 6 excuse me so now
let's<00:03:48.199> run<00:03:48.379> this<00:03:48.560> again<00:03:48.859> and<00:03:48.889> we'll<00:03:49.280> see<00:03:49.459> what

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
let's run this again and we'll see what

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.539 
let's run this again and we'll see what
we<00:03:49.699> get<00:03:49.849> as<00:03:50.199> you<00:03:51.199> can<00:03:51.349> see<00:03:51.620> there's<00:03:51.859> no<00:03:52.099> zeroes

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
we get as you can see there's no zeroes

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.430 
we get as you can see there's no zeroes
and<00:03:52.819> you<00:03:52.910> get<00:03:53.060> 4<00:03:53.389> 1<00:03:53.780> 6<00:03:54.139> 2<00:03:54.859> 2<00:03:55.069> 4<00:03:55.459> 3<00:03:55.669> 1<00:03:55.790> 1<00:03:56.269> 2<00:03:56.329> and<00:03:56.750> all

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
and you get 4 1 6 2 2 4 3 1 1 2 and all

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.770 
and you get 4 1 6 2 2 4 3 1 1 2 and all
of<00:03:57.590> these<00:03:57.769> numbers<00:03:58.010> are<00:03:58.250> in<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.909> range<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.359> 1

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
of these numbers are in the range of 1

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.770 
of these numbers are in the range of 1
to<00:03:59.810> 6<00:04:00.169> and<00:04:00.409> that's<00:04:00.620> what<00:04:00.799> we<00:04:00.949> want<00:04:01.159> so<00:04:01.510> again<00:04:02.510> if

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
to 6 and that's what we want so again if

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.960 
to 6 and that's what we want so again if
you<00:04:03.049> want<00:04:03.199> to<00:04:03.349> do<00:04:03.500> this<00:04:03.709> all<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.489> have<00:04:04.669> to<00:04:04.790> do

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
you want to do this all you have to do

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.740 
you want to do this all you have to do
is<00:04:05.239> list<00:04:05.659> however<00:04:06.049> many<00:04:06.680> numbers<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:08.150> want<00:04:08.629> in

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
is list however many numbers you want in

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.140 
is list however many numbers you want in
your<00:04:08.840> range<00:04:09.169> and<00:04:09.470> if<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.099> put<00:04:10.310> 6<00:04:10.579> by<00:04:10.760> default

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
your range and if you put 6 by default

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.750 
your range and if you put 6 by default
it's<00:04:11.359> going<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:11.599> give<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.870> 0<00:04:12.260> through<00:04:12.650> 5<00:04:12.979> since

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
it's going to give you 0 through 5 since

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.509 
it's going to give you 0 through 5 since
all<00:04:13.970> computer<00:04:14.479> counting<00:04:14.870> starts<00:04:15.109> at<00:04:15.290> 0<00:04:15.590> but<00:04:16.400> if

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
all computer counting starts at 0 but if

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.310 
all computer counting starts at 0 but if
we<00:04:16.669> want<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:16.970> numbers<00:04:17.269> 1<00:04:17.539> to<00:04:17.659> 6<00:04:17.930> we<00:04:18.079> have<00:04:18.169> to

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
we want the numbers 1 to 6 we have to

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.680 
we want the numbers 1 to 6 we have to
add<00:04:18.440> this<00:04:18.590> little<00:04:18.650> 1<00:04:19.180> addition<00:04:20.180> sign<00:04:20.389> and<00:04:20.659> that

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
add this little 1 addition sign and that

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.680 
add this little 1 addition sign and that
takes<00:04:21.500> 0<00:04:21.769> through<00:04:22.010> 5<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:22.490> adds<00:04:22.789> 1<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.419> them<00:04:23.510> or

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
takes 0 through 5 and adds 1 to them or

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.680 
takes 0 through 5 and adds 1 to them or
increments<00:04:24.349> um

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
increments um

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.810 
increments um
or<00:04:24.810> pushes<00:04:25.200> them<00:04:25.380> all<00:04:25.500> over<00:04:25.770> by<00:04:25.950> one<00:04:26.220> so

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
or pushes them all over by one so

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.410 
or pushes them all over by one so
instead<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.150> 0<00:04:27.720> through<00:04:27.990> 5<00:04:28.200> you<00:04:28.650> get<00:04:28.770> 1<00:04:29.010> to<00:04:29.130> 6<00:04:29.420> so

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
instead of 0 through 5 you get 1 to 6 so

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.180 
instead of 0 through 5 you get 1 to 6 so
