00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
doesn't have to go in your Applications

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.590 
doesn't have to go in your Applications
folder<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:09.060> go<00:01:09.650> anywhere<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.010> choose

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
folder it can go anywhere you choose

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.230 
folder it can go anywhere you choose
because<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:12.810> soon<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.290> unzip<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.240> it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
because as soon as you unzip it and it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.060 
because as soon as you unzip it and it
spits<00:01:15.570> out<00:01:17.420> dududu<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.290> spits<00:01:19.590> out<00:01:19.710> that

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
spits out dududu and it spits out that

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.880 
spits out dududu and it spits out that
file<00:01:20.430> right<00:01:20.729> there<00:01:21.320> that<00:01:22.320> means<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.860> is

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
file right there that means it is

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.770 
file right there that means it is
installed<00:01:23.520> essentially<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.570> your<00:01:24.720> computer

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
installed essentially on your computer

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.749 
installed essentially on your computer
the<00:01:27.780> reason<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.770> apps<00:01:29.340> are

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the reason for this is apps are

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.920 
the reason for this is apps are
contained<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:31.080> icon<00:01:31.850> essentially<00:01:32.930> so

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
contained and the icon essentially so

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.670 
contained and the icon essentially so
there's<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.890> content<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.060> app<00:01:36.680> right

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
there's the content of the app right

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.300 
there's the content of the app right
there<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:40.080> you<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.770> an<00:01:40.920> icon<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.580> it<00:01:41.850> is

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
there so if you have an icon and it is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.520 
there so if you have an icon and it is
the<00:01:44.310> app<00:01:44.460> itself<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.570> installed<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.350> your

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the app itself it is installed on your

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.230 
the app itself it is installed on your
computer<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:48.439> then<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.470> only<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.240> place

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
computer and then you only have to place

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.429 
computer and then you only have to place
it<00:01:51.650> excuse<00:01:52.650> me<00:01:52.829> where<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.430> want<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:54.259> hope<00:01:55.259> this

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
it excuse me where you want I hope this

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.569 
it excuse me where you want I hope this
helps<00:01:55.829> have<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> good<00:01:56.970> evening<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.600> day<00:01:58.549> have<00:01:59.549> a

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
helps have a good evening or day have a

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.820 
helps have a good evening or day have a
good<00:01:59.759> one
