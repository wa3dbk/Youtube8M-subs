00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and I ordered these two particular skins

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.019 
and I ordered these two particular skins
for<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.260> reason<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.769> one<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.070> silver<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.550> so

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
for a reason this one is silver and so

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
gets up close it kind of looks

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.310 
gets up close it kind of looks
transparent<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.570> don't<00:01:30.990> know<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.170> that'll

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
transparent so don't know if that'll

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.410 
transparent so don't know if that'll
matter<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:32.159> terms<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.579> will<00:01:32.759> be<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.119> final

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
matter in terms of will be the final

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.450

look<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.659> finish<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:34.770> I'd<00:01:34.920> point<00:01:35.369> that

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
look and finish but but I'd point that

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.890 
look and finish but but I'd point that
out<00:01:35.549> before<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.119> ahead<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.360> apply<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.580 
out before we go ahead and apply to the
phone<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.240> wouldn't<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.659> applied<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.259> in

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
