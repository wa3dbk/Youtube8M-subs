00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello how about a presents 2000 new 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.379
 video that we are going to do in this case 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.080
 let's make some California wicks 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.860
 that had extended us a lot that talks 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.759
 make half of the ear down 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.670
 we will try to do it work 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.980
 taxing wicks you will see in explanation 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.289
 we will do paw formation and still not 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.550
 I want to get it to stand out well 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.250
 I will not have a color price is 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.429
 natural now we have less a tone 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.890
 Blonde like mine is worth saying that 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.170
 we started to work 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.000
 since we have prepared the model the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.100
 we have plotted for them and not be 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.440
 spoil your clothes with everything that is 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.750
 product and that we have already done 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.180
 made some partitions in the whole head 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.390
 separating the front part of the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.400
 back and as you see here so that 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.650
 for this, to be able to work freely 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.050
 moment the back and then 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.300
 continue with the front that 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.309
 we have prepared as you see I have prepared 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.700
 some papers of square and a decoration 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.640
 as I put 10 centimeters of powder 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.369
 to decorate and 20 centimeters of water 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.100
 oxygenated to 20 volumes is not necessary 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.350
 more volumes not for more volumes we 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.429
 will go up more not what we have to 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.250
 to do is that the hair does not stay 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:22.590
 punished we were textured and take us 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.240
 a nice color ok let's start with 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.340
 the area below you see that it is the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.530
 final partition and what I'm not going to do 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.390
 is to color everything because as 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.510
 We have said we will make the wicks 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.270
 California wick 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.430
 let's give him a tricot that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.830
 some and some but that is not very little 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.830
 and some thick and some do not 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.020
 here we do not leave it down and what if 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:53.649
 we pick up in this case I will not prepare 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.420
 or anything because as you will see me at 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.130
 put the product you have already 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.619
 selecting more pieces shelters chunks 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.929
 below so I can not be seen where 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.600
 begins and where it ends with the tip of the 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:08.330
 brush and start be higher than 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:13.360
 lower is higher 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.360
 and now yes applied we already do 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.379
 and so we will do it successively 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.849
 in the goals to the height of the ear 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.220
 at the height of the ear where we have 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.860
 to watch and do it in a different way 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.190
 As we will see later on, come this 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.470
 next partition we will leave it also 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.490
 little hair down but we'll leave 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.470
 some free piece without catching 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.300
 so that we mix a little color 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.640
 with the color you also want to do 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.490
 I want to say with this that now in 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.090
 this next partition I will leave 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.140
 all that free hair strip and here I 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.140
 I'm going to put the color 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.000
 we mean a system of before 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.260
 do not see everything equally 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.120
 but a little bit here around here 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.470
 is not everything starting from the 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.830
 same 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.480
 up is down up 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.490
 you always consider the height of the 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:19.090
 ear can not raise us anymore 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.090
 under the towers to all 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.430
 that does not make you here because if you play here 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.160
 down and this without dirty stain and ice 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:37.140
 above always here pull the hair to 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:37.140
 up a little bit here up down 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:45.750
 and we also mark 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.930
 if not we do up 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.579
 we just got this side 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.579
 we will mark the next 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.720
 that we will do the same the next 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:03.120
 leaving also another free finny lock 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.120
 and taking the following whole 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.570
 when we arrived at the cone since already 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.840
 We are half ear what we will do 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.060
 is for although we make the separation with 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.459
 the brush to say 1 yes or no we're going to 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.859
 slightly prepare the root 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.960
 so that we still have a little more 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.710
 unequal 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.890
 and with the rest and with the rest what 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.890
 will 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.030
 is to put pots of taiwan and go back to 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.620
 apply to what is the good product 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.560
 as you see now we are already in the part 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.200
 higher and here we're not going to go up 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.800
 I repay up slightly each time 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.660
 let's have more root chunk and less 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.760
 of tip because because what we 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:54.890
 interesting is to get here until the 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.930
 cheekbone and earbone cheekbone not 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.130
 climb up here up 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.250
 and in this first one we will be staying 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.930
 the root of dark and the clear tip and 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.930
 as you see unevenly 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.599
 well we have all the assembly done and 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.550
 as we see we have been leaving some of 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.490
 the loose things but what we're going 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.139
 to do now is with the same comb 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.750
 let's go a little bit so that 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:23.169
 give us a little light so far 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:27.569
 On top of that, give us a little light 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.569
 we just run out of color 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:35.630
 and once this is done we will put five or 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:39.770
 seven minutes of heat 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:42.140
 and wait to go down well 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.410
 you see here here we have our result 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:48.470
 end and teach you not to lengthen 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:52.040
 the video and when doing it unscrew as 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:55.100
 you see you do not see the cut of a line 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.780
 color or another but that in a very 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.060
 natural that we have been degrading 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.080
 devastate not so clear because we have not 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.379
 left so long 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.629
 the California wicks what a difference 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.939
 there is with the color Californian with 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:11.219
 color calzones we are all shined by 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:14.550
 equal and in return if he knew record 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:18.419
 diana we have her color mixed with the 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:23.030
 we've done to me I love me 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.030
 It looks great and you think 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.900
 wait
