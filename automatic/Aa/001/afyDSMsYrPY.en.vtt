00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.560
 What is the secret of nature 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.929
 slim people 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.150
 We recognize people in ours 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.870
 environment that can seemingly eat what 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.480
 You want 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.010
 and still slim I stay mine 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.640
 So not the super slim models 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.720
 your figure is anorexic or 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.180
 but depended on tablet dependence 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.970
 the people the natural way 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.800
 I was slim years ago 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.349
 this is exactly the question asked and me 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.719
 Wanted to know why there are people 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.660
 can seemingly eat what they want 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.219
 and still stay slim 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.100
 yes, not always dieting or 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.200
 feed on air and apples and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.280
 then you ask yourself the question how 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.489
 they just do it 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.780
 I wanted to know what to do 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.520
 normal-weight people better or 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.710
 different 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.530
 normal weight are on the objects 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.899
 coveted by people 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.829
 weight problems probably right because of 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.359
 you can learn to eat normal weight 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.369
 if you look at the eating habits of 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.130
 people owns it 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.100
 naturally, you are slim 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.200
 eat what you want and want to hike 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.650
 and you would not even have a diet 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.619
 if you want to lose weight after 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.780
 i have many study books and 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.990
 have read experiments on this topic 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.670
 I decided with these people more 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.430
 to enter the dialogue 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.409
 many talks followed, I have them 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.720
 asked questions and their eating habits 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.140
 repeatedly questioned 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.229
 I came to the following result of the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.420
 nature of slim people have one 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.520
 natural and healthy eating habits 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.950
 the secret is not waived 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.549
 or bans but he hungry and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.110
 satiety which from the brain 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.740
 are still unconsciously controlled 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.290
 intact 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.780
 That means these people are starting to 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.149
 eat if they are real physical 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.789
 feel hunger and listen to the food 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.869
 on as soon as she is physically sick and 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.950
 feel satisfied 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.019
 they distinguish very well between 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.900
 emotional and physical hunger im 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.120
 the opposite to emotional hunger can be 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.900
 physical hunger with food provided 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.480
 become 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.060
 and i have exactly those strategies of 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.390
 By nature, slim people make you 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.330
 unconsciously followed compiled and 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.880
 to develop a method with the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.610
 really everyone very easily and effortlessly 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.319
 chamber weight can reduce and thereby 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.720
 can eat what he wants 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.959
 I am convinced that everyone 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.450
 man these simple principles to 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.769
 a healthy and natural 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.510
 Conduct behavior and thereby the 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.109
 can reduce body weight 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.049
 should heed regardless of whether 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:55.079
 someone wants to lose weight because it only 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.620
 I want to feed healthy and I invite everyone 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.420
 Here are a few of these principles that I 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.160
 in my seminars in detail 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.530
 discuss 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.709
 practice a few days for yourself 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.410
 feel results on your own body 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.660
 what I want to introduce you now 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.060
 activates your own body 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.470
 resources and enable me to do so 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.890
 eat what when and how much you want 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.430
 Firstly, everyone is aware and involved 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.760
 enjoyment 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.840
 I invite you to let everyone know you 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.840
 to make aware 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.900
 do not change anything on your dining-making 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.310
 just like before 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.530
 others, nothing at first 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.170
 But from now on, meet the 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.280
 decision that you are then if you 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.940
 want to eat 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:49.030
 then make you aware that you are one 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.680
 very important note is the fifth 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.390
 Plate of chocolate with knife and fork 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.280
 and enjoy every know 2 do.com everyone 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.380
 Bite at least 30 times 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.500
 and while you are aware of everyone's knowledge 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.950
 and enjoy this may concentrate 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.090
 you have to please everyone on the women 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:13.209
 and enjoy doing so after each 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.239
 Bite your cutlery or your food 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.930
 just take you aside from everyone 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.950
 have to chew completely as you 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:27.880
 target you for at least 30 to 40 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.490
 chewing movements do you pont close 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.070
 your eyes while you eat higher 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.880
 while eating on your body 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.760
 When you are really tired I recommend 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.520
 everyone's eyes during the meal 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.200
 when I do these exercises 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.550
 example in my seminars with the 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.090
 make seminar participants 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.220
 set to their astonishment how 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.550
 quickly they are full and at the same time 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.390
 Do you know more than half still 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.520
 lying on your plate 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.660
 every child every woman and every man 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.850
 should stick to these principles 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.830
 because that is my experience after the 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.310
 basis for a healthy and slim 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.830
 Life 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.889
 So I speak to the parents now 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.860
 mothers and fathers would rather have to 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.770
 Make sure your children eat at all times 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.200
 If you feel hungry and you are allowed to 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.490
 not regimented or fixed 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.720
 bind times 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:31.180
 this leaves the teachers in the tracks 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.250
 Rather, schools should be the cau technique 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.070
 and the taste training with the 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.020
 Students practice instead of the children 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.420
 food and ingredients to him 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.000
 to confront and overburden them 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.600
 You should have children eat as long 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.670
 until they are real and they are not 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.490
 force your plate to eat empty 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.540
 they should also be allowed to eat what they eat 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.540
 want 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.690
 Do not believe me child or no 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.060
 human will only nibble maybe 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.000
 initially, however, with the time arises 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.120
 natural healthy balance and 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.360
 so everyone is designed ahead of all 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.410
 our kids if you let them 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.300
 Simple principles help everyone 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.760
 unhealthy foods from the healthy 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.590
 to distinguish food and the 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.520
 industrial in food too 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.550
 expose 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.400
 I want to invite you to this 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.720
 in the next days this simple 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.360
 rules to follow 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.840
 you are amazed which positive 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:39.110
 changes in your body 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.240
 and your health was beside it 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:45.590
 By doing so you will create new eating habits 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:48.910
 and you would automatically be less and 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.910
 eat healthy food
