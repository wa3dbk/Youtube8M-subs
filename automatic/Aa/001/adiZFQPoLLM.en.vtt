00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.019 
time with my volume turned down but the
track<00:00:16.590> still<00:00:16.830> slide<00:00:17.100> down<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.850> use

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
track still slide down so you can use

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.090

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.820 

okay<00:01:19.880> doesn't<00:01:20.840> look<00:01:20.930> out<00:01:21.110> for<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.440> very<00:01:21.530> first

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
okay doesn't look out for the very first

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.410 
okay doesn't look out for the very first
file<00:01:22.130> two<00:01:22.250> counts<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.700> little<00:01:22.820> unusual<00:01:23.150> because

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
file two counts a little unusual because

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.090 
file two counts a little unusual because
it<00:01:23.630> comes<00:01:23.780> in<00:01:23.870> on<00:01:23.930> beat<00:01:24.140> two<00:01:24.470> rather<00:01:24.770> than<00:01:24.860> beat

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
it comes in on beat two rather than beat

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.460 
it comes in on beat two rather than beat
one<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.000> when<00:01:26.120> you've<00:01:26.210> got<00:01:26.240> your<00:01:26.390> count<00:01:26.630> is<00:01:26.900> one

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
one so when you've got your count is one

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.670 
one so when you've got your count is one
to<00:01:28.340> one<00:01:29.150> but<00:01:29.690> on<00:01:29.930> them<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.260> you<00:01:30.320> come<00:01:30.470> in<00:01:30.590> on

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
to one but on them and you come in on

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.790 
to one but on them and you come in on
the<00:01:30.770> two<00:01:30.980> so<00:01:31.250> it's<00:01:31.370> one<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:33.020> one

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.700 

right<00:01:36.800> on<00:01:37.490> bar<00:01:37.760> three<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.840> timings<00:01:39.260> slightly

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
right on bar three the timings slightly

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.260 
right on bar three the timings slightly
different<00:01:40.010> don't<00:01:40.280> don't<00:01:40.820> miss<00:01:40.970> that<00:01:41.150> out

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
different don't don't miss that out

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.360 
different don't don't miss that out
you've<00:01:41.540> got<00:01:41.720> an<00:01:42.200> extra<00:01:42.530> rest<00:01:42.800> in<00:01:42.980> there<00:01:43.160> so

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
you've got an extra rest in there so

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.900 
you've got an extra rest in there so
first<00:01:44.120> time<00:01:44.330> when<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:44.480> come<00:01:44.660> in<00:01:44.780> well<00:01:45.380> -<00:01:46.420> one

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
first time when you come in well - one

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.219 
first time when you come in well - one
second<00:01:49.910> time<00:01:50.030> most<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:50.390> notice<00:01:50.600> would<00:01:50.690> pinch

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
second time most you notice would pinch

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.830 
second time most you notice would pinch
together<00:01:51.410> a<00:01:51.620> little<00:01:51.800> bit<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:52.130> it's<00:01:52.250> one<00:01:52.820> two

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:05.810 

tap<00:01:56.840> my<00:01:56.960> foot<00:01:57.140> first<00:01:57.800> time

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.950 

that's<00:02:06.820> slightly<00:02:07.090> different<00:02:07.329> timing<00:02:07.840> look

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
that's slightly different timing look

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.529 
that's slightly different timing look
out<00:02:08.110> for<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:09.030> what<00:02:10.030> else<00:02:10.179> is<00:02:10.330> interesting

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
out for that what else is interesting

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.089 
out for that what else is interesting

timing<00:02:14.380> is<00:02:14.650> one<00:02:15.099> two<00:02:15.880> three

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
timing is one two three

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.290

00:05:14.950 --> 00:06:24.650 
now so you can use this as a backing
track

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660
