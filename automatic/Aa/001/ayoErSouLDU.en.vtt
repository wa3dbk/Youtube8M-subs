want to push play it's going to open up

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.980 
want to push play it's going to open up
a<00:01:50.540> browser<00:01:51.100> open<00:01:52.100> up<00:01:52.220> be<00:01:52.520> browser<00:01:52.820> and

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.960 

it's<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> try<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.189> play<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> video<00:01:59.490> now<00:01:59.939> I

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
it's going to try to play a video now I

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.510 
it's going to try to play a video now I
see<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.720> all<00:02:01.350> automatically<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:02.460> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
see it's all automatically going to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
see it's all automatically going to
auto-rotate<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:03.689> how<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.020> might

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
auto-rotate so I can see how this might

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.780 
auto-rotate so I can see how this might
affect<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.649> browser<00:02:07.849> the<00:02:08.849> video<00:02:10.430> but<00:02:11.430> I'm

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
affect the browser the video but I'm

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.370 
affect the browser the video but I'm
going<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.030> try<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.270> without<00:02:12.810> letting<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
going to try this without letting the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.620 
going to try this without letting the
video<00:02:13.620> because<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.860> takes<00:02:14.010> like<00:02:14.190> almost<00:02:14.630> two

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
video because it takes like almost two

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.729 
video because it takes like almost two
minutes<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:17.400> I'm<00:02:17.489> pushing<00:02:17.819> home<00:02:18.680> going<00:02:19.680> to

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
minutes so I'm pushing home going to

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:36.590 
minutes so I'm pushing home going to
menu<00:02:24.500> applications<00:02:26.750> manage

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.890 

we<00:02:37.200> go<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.380> browser<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.130> clear<00:02:38.670> data<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.810> if

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
we go to browser and clear data so if

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.830 
we go to browser and clear data so if
you<00:02:39.990> know<00:02:40.940> if<00:02:41.940> you're<00:02:42.150> very<00:02:42.360> fond<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.720> your
