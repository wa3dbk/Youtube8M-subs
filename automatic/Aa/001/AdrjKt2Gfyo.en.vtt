and shadowy so I've got a few different

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.520 
and shadowy so I've got a few different
options<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.969> one<00:02:00.420> really<00:02:00.990> standard<00:02:01.320> thing<00:02:01.469> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
options a one really standard thing to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.990 
options a one really standard thing to
do<00:02:01.649> would<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.950> throw<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.159> fill<00:02:02.399> light<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.759> on

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
do would be to throw a fill light on on

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.030 
do would be to throw a fill light on on
her<00:02:03.210> opposite<00:02:03.540> side<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.740> try<00:02:04.979> to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
her opposite side but I like to try to

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.350 
her opposite side but I like to try to
add<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> hair<00:02:05.460> light<00:02:05.640> first<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.090> see<00:02:06.210> how<00:02:06.299> that

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
add a hair light first and see how that

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.320 
add a hair light first and see how that
looks<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.409> over<00:02:08.280> here<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> back<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:09.030> have<00:02:09.060> an

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
looks so over here in the back I have an

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.119 
looks so over here in the back I have an
area<00:02:09.660> 1:50<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.649> same<00:02:10.800> kind<00:02:11.069> of

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
area 1:50 so it's the same kind of

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.860 
area 1:50 so it's the same kind of
lighter<00:02:11.310> Fornell<00:02:11.670> light<00:02:11.879> but<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.150> 150<00:02:12.720> watt

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
lighter Fornell light but it's 150 watt

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.610 
lighter Fornell light but it's 150 watt
so<00:02:13.020> it's<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> little<00:02:13.260> bit<00:02:13.410> less

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
so it's a little bit less

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.490 
so it's a little bit less
powerful<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.879> essentially<00:02:15.450> I'm<00:02:16.200> going<00:02:16.440> to

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500

little bit on her shoulders I'm gonna

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.690 
little bit on her shoulders I'm gonna
use<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.840> barn<00:02:51.989> door<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.170> cut<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.500> off<00:02:54.560> good

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
use the barn door I cut it off good

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.960 
use the barn door I cut it off good
alright<00:02:56.700> let's<00:02:56.940> take<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.060> peek<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:58.879> first<00:02:59.879> I'm

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
alright let's take a peek so first I'm

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.130 
alright let's take a peek so first I'm
going<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.150> observe<00:03:00.390> with<00:03:00.540> my<00:03:00.659> eyes<00:03:00.810> because

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
going to observe with my eyes because

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.449 
going to observe with my eyes because
I'm<00:03:01.200> using<00:03:01.349> hot<00:03:01.560> lights<00:03:01.799> that's<00:03:02.040> really<00:03:02.310> nice

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
I'm using hot lights that's really nice

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.500 
I'm using hot lights that's really nice
I<00:03:02.549> can<00:03:02.670> actually<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:02.970> kind<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.150> look<00:03:03.329> at<00:03:03.450> it

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
I can actually just kind of look at it

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.690 
I can actually just kind of look at it
and<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.959> see<00:03:04.650> what<00:03:04.829> it<00:03:04.920> looks<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.459> it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
and and see what it looks like and it

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.789 
and and see what it looks like and it
looks<00:03:06.000> pretty<00:03:06.299> good<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.540> me<00:03:06.780> now<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.290> true

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
looks pretty good to me now the true

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.250 
looks pretty good to me now the true
test<00:03:08.010> will<00:03:08.040> be<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.220> camera<00:03:08.640> good<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.480> see<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.140> my

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
test will be the camera good I see to my

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.140 
test will be the camera good I see to my
eye<00:03:10.290> it<00:03:10.709> looked<00:03:10.920> pretty<00:03:11.190> cut<00:03:11.519> out<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:11.909> here<00:03:12.120> I

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
eye it looked pretty cut out but here I

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.369 
eye it looked pretty cut out but here I
think<00:03:12.390> it's<00:03:12.510> still<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.750> little<00:03:12.900> bit<00:03:13.079> too<00:03:13.200> dark

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
think it's still a little bit too dark

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.710 
think it's still a little bit too dark
there<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:13.890> there's<00:03:14.730> two<00:03:14.940> things<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.390> could<00:03:15.569> do

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
there so there's two things I could do

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.170 
there so there's two things I could do
here<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.709> first<00:03:17.220> thing<00:03:17.430> would<00:03:17.700> be<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:18.030> move

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
here the first thing would be to move

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.729 
here the first thing would be to move
the<00:03:18.329> light<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.569> closer<00:03:18.840> or<00:03:19.109> switch<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.590> more

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
the light in closer or switch to a more

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.129 
the light in closer or switch to a more
powerful<00:03:19.859> light<00:03:20.250> or<00:03:20.489> I'll<00:03:21.239> go<00:03:21.419> to<00:03:21.480> stage<00:03:21.900> two

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
powerful light or I'll go to stage two

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.210 
powerful light or I'll go to stage two
which<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.349> was<00:03:22.440> going<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.620> do<00:03:22.739> anyways<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.099> add

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
which I was going to do anyways and add

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.530 
which I was going to do anyways and add
a<00:03:23.250> little<00:03:23.430> diffusion<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.000> my<00:03:24.120> front<00:03:24.389> light

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
a little diffusion to my front light

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.180 
a little diffusion to my front light
diffusion<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.440> great<00:03:25.650> because<00:03:25.919> it<00:03:26.010> helps

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
diffusion is great because it helps

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.289 
diffusion is great because it helps
bring<00:03:26.280> down<00:03:26.430> your<00:03:26.489> highlights<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.120> when<00:03:27.209> you

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
bring down your highlights and when you

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.119 
bring down your highlights and when you
have<00:03:27.419> somebody<00:03:27.599> has<00:03:27.870> very<00:03:28.109> fair<00:03:28.680> skin<00:03:28.950> like

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
have somebody has very fair skin like

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.020 
have somebody has very fair skin like
cadence<00:03:29.459> it's<00:03:29.609> nice<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.849> have<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> little

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
cadence it's nice to have a little

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.750 
cadence it's nice to have a little
diffusion<00:03:30.480> on<00:03:30.569> your<00:03:30.720> on<00:03:31.290> your<00:03:31.349> source<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.609> I<00:03:32.639> do

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
diffusion on your on your source so I do

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.970 
diffusion on your on your source so I do
have<00:03:33.060> some<00:03:35.900> some<00:03:36.900> spun<00:03:37.230> here<00:03:37.470> this<00:03:37.620> is<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.739> light

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
have some some spun here this is a light

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.190 
have some some spun here this is a light
spun<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.419> going<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.599> do<00:03:39.690> two<00:03:39.840> things<00:03:40.049> for

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
spun so it's going to do two things for

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.479 
spun so it's going to do two things for
me<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:40.470> diffusion<00:03:40.859> is<00:03:40.950> going<00:03:41.099> to<00:03:41.160> cut<00:03:41.340> down

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
me the diffusion is going to cut down

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.949 
me the diffusion is going to cut down
the<00:03:41.639> highlights<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:42.269> kind<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.569> neutralize<00:03:42.930> a

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
the highlights so kind of neutralize a

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:43.970 
the highlights so kind of neutralize a
little<00:03:43.169> bit<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.379> also<00:03:43.470> it's<00:03:43.650> going<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.829> lower

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
little bit and also it's going to lower

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.830 
little bit and also it's going to lower
my<00:03:44.069> exposure<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.549> little<00:03:44.669> bit<00:03:44.879> so<00:03:45.030> I'm<00:03:45.510> going<00:03:45.599> to

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
my exposure a little bit so I'm going to

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.400 
my exposure a little bit so I'm going to
I<00:03:46.169> think<00:03:46.349> double<00:03:46.829> it<00:03:46.919> up<00:03:48.109> it<00:03:49.109> looks<00:03:49.230> pretty

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
I think double it up it looks pretty

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.470 
I think double it up it looks pretty
good<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.590> my<00:03:49.739> eye<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:50.069> what<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.060> want<00:03:51.329> to<00:03:51.419> be

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
good to my eye and what I want to be

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.670 
good to my eye and what I want to be
careful<00:03:51.690> about<00:03:51.810> doing<00:03:52.109> is<00:03:52.199> I<00:03:52.260> don't<00:03:52.319> want<00:03:52.590> to

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
careful about doing is I don't want to

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.110 
careful about doing is I don't want to
just<00:03:52.829> spread<00:03:53.069> it<00:03:53.129> all<00:03:53.310> out<00:03:53.340> like<00:03:53.760> this<00:03:53.910> because

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
just spread it all out like this because

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.309 
just spread it all out like this because
it's<00:03:54.209> going<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.359> make<00:03:54.480> my<00:03:54.599> source<00:03:54.840> larger

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
it's going to make my source larger

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.990 
it's going to make my source larger
which<00:03:55.440> will<00:03:55.590> make<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.799> less<00:03:56.010> hard<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:56.699> want<00:03:56.879> to

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
which will make it less hard I want to

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.520 
which will make it less hard I want to
keep<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.209> soft<00:03:57.419> so<00:03:57.540> I'm<00:03:57.660> going<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:57.840> make<00:03:58.379> sure

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
keep it soft so I'm going to make sure

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.580 
keep it soft so I'm going to make sure
my<00:03:58.560> diffusion<00:03:59.040> stays<00:03:59.989> pretty<00:04:00.989> much<00:04:01.079> within<00:04:01.470> my

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
my diffusion stays pretty much within my

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.849 
my diffusion stays pretty much within my
barn<00:04:01.799> doors<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:04.230> I'm<00:04:04.319> just<00:04:04.440> going<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.590> clip<00:04:04.829> it

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
barn doors and I'm just going to clip it

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:12.890 
barn doors and I'm just going to clip it
on<00:04:05.040> here<00:04:06.620> with<00:04:07.620> these<00:04:08.569> clothes<00:04:09.569> pins

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.780 

[Music]

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
[Music]

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.090 
[Music]
and<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.209> think<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:16.870> looks<00:04:17.139> good<00:04:17.590> let's<00:04:17.889> take<00:04:18.040> a

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
and I think that looks good let's take a

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.409 
and I think that looks good let's take a
peek

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.550 

okay<00:04:21.419> that's<00:04:21.629> good<00:04:21.780> now<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.959> know<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.139> lowered<00:04:22.470> my

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
okay that's good now I know I lowered my
