00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.400
 I'm totally sleepy. 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.350
 I haven't even turned my eyes all night. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.700
 You wouldn't believe what noise those frogs were making. 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.300
 You would say, such a small, cute frog it is. 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.150
 But the frogs ... 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.100
 ... there are tons! 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.150
 And they whine and chuckle all night, 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.000
 so you can't sleep. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.900
 I tried counting sheep, 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.100
 however, you know to… 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.650
 But even the sheep began to squeal! 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.500
 I'll tell you, it's crazy. 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.150
 And since when? 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.000
 Ever since they strike me on the pyramid. 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.350
 No no no. 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.650
 Oh, they don't demand higher wages. 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.950
 They want to leave! 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.350
 Home! Back! 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.700
 That they were told by God. 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.950
 Even temporary workers are no longer what they used to be. 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.400
 And their two leaders. 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.250
 Now I don't know if they're from unions or what? 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.800
 They always come with sticks and sticks, 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.950
 so sometimes I have a little fear of what will be. 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.600
 M… Moses and… 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.850
 Á… ar… 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.050
 Ah… Aaron? 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.750
 What do I know ?! 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.550
 But not. I won't let them go 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.800
 because I'm not stupid. 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.550
 So cheap they won't be found right away. 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.000
 Just… All bitten here. 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.350
 From mosquitoes, 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.100
 so it all itches to me. 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.300
 And I have an allergy to it. 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.550
 And not that it would just itch but it burns a hundred and six. 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.400
 And I'm thirsty. 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.000
 I'd like some water. 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.250
 For a glass of plain water, I'd give half a business. 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.700
 That's how I've been drinking Bloody Mary all week. 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.050
 Yes, Bloody Mary. 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.300
 Well, at the beginning it was great, but when you were 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.400
 drunk for three days, then your head is getting sick. 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.400
 I'd like some water, normal water. 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.250
 Neperlivou. 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.400
 And now it's even flies! 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.250
 This is unreal! 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.600
 The plague on you !!!
