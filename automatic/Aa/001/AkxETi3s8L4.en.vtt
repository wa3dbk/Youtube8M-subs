00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.719
 I think America neither of the two 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.050
 Benitez has reached the figure of this one 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.599
 soccer that is cristian benítez the america with the same doubts of always 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:22.949
 I'm watching 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.150
 football and soccer system or its players every bird how they work 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:32.960
 I loreto step on benitez after a lousy america cup I'm not like how 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.100
 arrive or alan benítez even south as always pose mokoena questions and 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.929
 conflicts three contributions 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:40.370
 what I eat 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.890
 to vary always linked to and immediate is not questionable sanin the 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.890
 sport is jealous 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.000
 Well yes I think we're both because consultants are 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.530
 every bad habit that they have the last years after arriving final 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.270
 but to win them cross between a pressure this and nobody was the tournament come on I think 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.810
 that America has it without a doubt because it is a team that is spending a lot 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.790
 money 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.140
 because it is a team that has much more reflectors than blue cross 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.490
 I believe that the American dea of ​​the consul 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.070
 angel reyna we are talking about who is the last scoring champion so I 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.619
 I think in that sense the law that has the most potential 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.619
 the data reveals ipso an accident that was champion scorer 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.350
 but if it comes to comparing what weighs more the america 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.880
 the tournament is such a mediocre gray tournament you can give away csc or more and 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.229
 absolutely nothing happens 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.719
 the two absences are 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.099
 really important are two types that weigh I think that adaptation already exist 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:53.060
 Consul was incrusted nothing more certain is that without Americans 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.970
 in america they will have to wall bracket to be a american century trocar 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.970
 I note 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.220
 if the championship is not achieved and the two teams have to be assumed as 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.019
 a failure if they have to face consequences 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.290
 I'm not America you have to understand that if you do not win the championship it's a failure 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.019
 very clear and that they are not for any side mili managers 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.579
 coaches or players 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.109
 and if they dread saying the word failure in their managers 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.109
 Well, the reality is that 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.269
 they are designed percent 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.890
 and in the investments that the support of the psoe imprisoned to be champion this 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:31.989
 season
