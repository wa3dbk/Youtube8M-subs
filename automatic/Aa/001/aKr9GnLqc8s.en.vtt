an<00:00:03.270> idea<00:00:03.659> that<00:00:04.020> i<00:00:04.049> discovered<00:00:04.589> by<00:00:05.370> just

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
an idea that i discovered by just

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.670 
an idea that i discovered by just
noodling<00:00:06.299> around<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.080> idea<00:00:07.290> can<00:00:07.589> be

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
noodling around and this idea can be

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.390 
noodling around and this idea can be
taken<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.300> expanded<00:00:09.300> too<00:00:09.840> flashy<00:00:10.139> ed<00:00:10.440> yep<00:00:10.710> but

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
taken and expanded too flashy ed yep but

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.509 
taken and expanded too flashy ed yep but
you<00:00:11.580> can<00:00:11.790> use<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.139> very<00:00:13.320> melodic<00:00:13.519> context

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
you can use it in a very melodic context

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.369 
you can use it in a very melodic context
by<00:00:14.670> simply<00:00:15.120> changing<00:00:15.509> some<00:00:15.690> intervals<00:00:16.139> and

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
by simply changing some intervals and

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.060 
by simply changing some intervals and
and<00:00:16.560> using<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:18.060> as<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.539> smart<00:00:18.990> way<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.320> expand

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
and using this as a smart way to expand

based<00:00:22.830> was<00:00:23.820> born<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.199> minor<00:00:25.380> pentatonic

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
based was born on the minor pentatonic

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.580 
based was born on the minor pentatonic
scale<00:00:26.330> let's<00:00:27.330> consider<00:00:27.660> an<00:00:28.019> E<00:00:28.199> minor

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
scale let's consider an E minor

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.009 
scale let's consider an E minor
pentatonic<00:00:28.800> scale<00:00:29.640> if<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.420> take<00:00:30.630> an<00:00:30.779> E<00:00:30.869> minor

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
pentatonic scale if I take an E minor

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.100 
pentatonic scale if I take an E minor
pentatonic<00:00:31.439> scale<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.820> consider<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
pentatonic scale and I consider the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.370 
pentatonic scale and I consider the
fourth<00:00:35.030> position<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.050> minor

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
fourth position of that a minor

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.500 
fourth position of that a minor
pentatonic<00:00:37.649> scale<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.730> fourth<00:00:39.030> position

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
pentatonic scale that fourth position

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.290 
pentatonic scale that fourth position
has<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.440> root<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.640> string

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
has the the root on the a string

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.090 
has the the root on the a string
here's<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.020> fourth<00:00:43.290> position<00:00:43.469> played

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
here's that fourth position played

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.340 
here's that fourth position played
altogether

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.610 

now<00:00:49.350> I'm<00:00:49.590> gonna<00:00:49.710> take<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.100> position<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
now I'm gonna take that position and

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:59.599 
now I'm gonna take that position and
only<00:00:52.620> play<00:00:52.920> strings<00:00:53.399> five<00:00:54.500> three<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:58.609> let

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
only play strings five three and one let

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.639 
only play strings five three and one let
me<00:00:59.699> use<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> same<00:01:00.000> concept<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.260> time

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
me use the same concept but this time

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.090 
me use the same concept but this time
with<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.789> fifth<00:01:03.480> position<00:01:04.320> here's<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.860> fifth

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
with the fifth position here's the fifth

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740 
with the fifth position here's the fifth
position<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.700> E<00:01:05.790> minor<00:01:05.939> pentatonic<00:01:06.060> all

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
position of E minor pentatonic all

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.140 
position of E minor pentatonic all
together<00:01:09.830> if<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.950> only<00:01:11.130> play<00:01:11.430> strings<00:01:11.790> five

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
together if I only play strings five

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.780 
together if I only play strings five
three<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.500> what<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:16.640> now<00:01:17.640> if

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
three and one this is what I have now if

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.429 
three and one this is what I have now if
I<00:01:17.880> combine<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.420> notes<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.320> I've

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
I combine the notes that I that I've

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.710 
I combine the notes that I that I've
found<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.729> fourth<00:01:20.909> position<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
found on the fourth position in the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.300 
found on the fourth position in the
fifth<00:01:21.960> position<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.530> will<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> three<00:01:23.130> note

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
fifth position it will have a three note

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.450 
fifth position it will have a three note
per<00:01:23.340> string<00:01:23.930> position<00:01:24.930> shape<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:26.340> will

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
per string position shape and I will

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.399 
per string position shape and I will
play<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.790> shape<00:01:27.060> only<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.630> strings<00:01:28.140> five

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
play that shape only on strings five

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.740 
play that shape only on strings five
three<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.579> one<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.479> what<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> have

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.480 

there's<00:01:36.750> an<00:01:36.990> extension<00:01:37.710> here<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.159> if<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.310> get

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
there's an extension here but if I get

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.460 
there's an extension here but if I get
used<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.780> could<00:01:39.840> speed<00:01:40.200> up<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
used to that I can I could speed up the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
used to that I can I could speed up the
process<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:40.979> play<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.759> legato<00:01:43.280> by<00:01:44.280> just

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
process and play this legato by just

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.609 
process and play this legato by just
altering<00:01:44.939> one<00:01:45.180> note<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.780> make<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.200> look<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
altering one note I can make this look a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.560 
altering one note I can make this look a
lot<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:46.950> Mladic<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.700> fitting<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.390> a

particular mode for instance if I look

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.910 
particular mode for instance if I look
at<00:01:51.570> what's<00:01:51.750> happening<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> first<00:01:52.500> string

as<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.590> major<00:02:06.920> 6th<00:02:07.460> so<00:02:08.119> this<00:02:08.420> would<00:02:08.569> work<00:02:08.720> over<00:02:09.050> a

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
as a major 6th so this would work over a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.720 
as a major 6th so this would work over a
Dorian<00:02:09.819> progression<00:02:10.819> I<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.950> expand<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.489> by

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
Dorian progression I can expand this by

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.699 
Dorian progression I can expand this by
adding<00:02:13.970> some<00:02:14.330> tabs<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.940> lot<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.840> new<00:02:17.989> ideas<00:02:18.140> can

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
adding some tabs a lot of new ideas can

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.190 
adding some tabs a lot of new ideas can
can<00:02:19.040> be<00:02:19.160> born<00:02:19.430> from<00:02:19.760> just<00:02:20.090> expanding<00:02:20.900> on<00:02:21.020> this

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
can be born from just expanding on this

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.410 
can be born from just expanding on this
concept<00:02:21.739> we<00:02:22.310> just<00:02:22.520> started<00:02:22.790> with<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.209> minor

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420
