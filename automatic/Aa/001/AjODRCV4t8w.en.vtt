00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
even can't really explain it but there's

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.220 
even can't really explain it but there's
this<00:02:21.740> very<00:02:22.430> special<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.810> very<00:02:24.700> very<00:02:25.700> large

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
this very special and very very large

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.630 
this very special and very very large
portion<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.290> my<00:02:27.440> heart<00:02:27.710> dedicated<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.280> Meg<00:02:28.460> man

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
portion of my heart dedicated to Meg man

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.120 
portion of my heart dedicated to Meg man
maybe<00:02:29.420> it's<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.750> fact<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.080> I'm<00:02:30.230> 11<00:02:30.890> months

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
maybe it's the fact that I'm 11 months

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.870 
maybe it's the fact that I'm 11 months
older<00:02:31.670> than<00:02:31.700> megaman<00:02:32.120> thus<00:02:33.100> he's<00:02:34.100> nearly<00:02:34.370> 26

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
older than megaman thus he's nearly 26

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.490 
older than megaman thus he's nearly 26
and<00:02:35.330> that's<00:02:35.660> going<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.960> make<00:02:36.020> him<00:02:36.170> as<00:02:36.260> old<00:02:36.410> as

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
and that's going to make him as old as

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.470 
and that's going to make him as old as
me<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.710> maybe<00:02:37.460> that's<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:38.000> part<00:02:38.030> of<00:02:38.330> my

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
me and maybe that's a part of my

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.940 
me and maybe that's a part of my
connection<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.930> him<00:02:39.080> or<00:02:39.230> maybe<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.590> has<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.710> do

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
connection to him or maybe it has to do

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.730 
connection to him or maybe it has to do
with<00:02:40.510> nostalgia<00:02:41.510> maybe<00:02:42.200> has<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.440> do<00:02:42.530> with<00:02:42.650> the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
with nostalgia maybe has to do with the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.010 
with nostalgia maybe has to do with the
fact<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.820> Mega<00:02:44.120> Man<00:02:44.300> games<00:02:44.600> have<00:02:44.900> the
