00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello everyone is welcome 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.830
 for christmas video on call of duty and 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.330
 today we find ourselves on black ops 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.280
 2 to talk a little bit more about 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.080
 black ops 3 detail precisely because 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.880
 for those who do not know black ops 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.320
 3 will be the next call of duty that goes 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.730
 to leave in November 2015 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.809
 so I will not go into the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.130
 details I know that there are a lot of 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.449
 people who have already made very videos 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.250
 detailed which I really not at all 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.230
 go into details but I tell you 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.269
 basically what we know what we do not know 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.699
 in those on this next call of duty 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.930
 for the moment then what we give away 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.689
 it's just called black ops 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.460
 3 that's for sure it will be developed by 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.890
 treyarch that's for sure we already knew 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.149
 but months already it reassures me 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.590
 a lot to know that the next 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.760
 colloquium of the title developed by treyarch 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.190
 although I knew it for a long time 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.690
 like everyone else at that to me 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.550
 it makes me hot in the heart we will say that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.480
 at least I want to see her there 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.300
 while I know that for example 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.500
 next infinity ward good here's a hundred 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.640
 more a game it's not even we know 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.260
 not even what it will be but 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.360
 Thursday without any more right now that one 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.770
 do we know a little bit what we know 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.750
 we're going to have now with treyarch 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.190
 it's pretty good because in general 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.020
 abbas and those who do the best 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.820
 call of duty especially on pc and it is 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.510
 see so much so that makes me 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.430
 really happy 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.540
 is what we know is that in fact we 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.549
 has no information about the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.810
 multiplayer for now it's normal 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.189
 multi-player information arrives 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.970
 much later in general it is 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.530
 rather in August 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.430
 so I do not know maybe this 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.439
 year as they seem to be a 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.960
 little bit early he could 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.700
 maybe afford to do a little 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.130
 little trick like that on multiplayer 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.200
 on the 3 which is in June which is mid June 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.280
 if I'm wrong then that would be 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.750
 really well I do not know if they're going 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.360
 to do but it's true that anyway 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.460
 in general we only have solo at 7o 1 and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.409
 lens what we have on the solo actually 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.729
 it's just things that are very, very 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.560
 basic that is to say that we know that the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.030
 solo will happen for example particular 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.369
 in Egypt will happen in the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.930
 70s among others because we know 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.659
 that black ops and black ops two have a 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.159
 little of the timeline bottoms that are a 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.450
 little bit everywhere a stere that you have 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.920
 you go in the future you go in 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.509
 the past or not announced too much finally 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.549
 that's it there are already back and forth 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.540
 like that black ops 3 a priori it would be 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.610
 a little bit the same because 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.229
 as we see on some images that has 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.520
 for example soldiers who have 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.560
 the futuristic air anyway with 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.119
 armor that's enough that some have 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.560
 taken for exoskeletons so guys 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.090
 who are completely inflamed on it 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.229
 they said yes there armor is a 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.759
 exoskeleton no but you guys have to 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.100
 stop a guy that sledgehammer games 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.450
 you're going to make exoskeletons 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.000
 not even need to ask the question 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.010
 it's 100% sure there will be no exodus 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.060
 know about black ops 3c there is even 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.060
 no question to ask what these 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.350
 taxes it's impossible but suddenly 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.220
 there will be armor so I do not know 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.390
 maybe they will integrate the 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.320
 armor in the game is what now 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.120
 it will only be in the solo 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.740
 only in the multi we do not know 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.930
 nothing I think it might be 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.000
 in the solo but that a faller 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.680
 salary to improve a little bit 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.540
 anyway so anyway I'm doing 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.980
 trust to treyarch 1 it's clear that 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.570
 there's no there's no picture on it 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.830
 I think they're really going to go 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.740
 really do something good I 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.750
 trust them 100% and that's it 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.130
 so basically that's pretty much everything 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.480
 we know that there are people who 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.800
 get to blabber for 30 minutes 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.420
 on it but honestly I'm doing two 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.040
 minutes already there you see I play I 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.750
 loose we can already more than that 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.890
 we know anything we know we know these 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.300
 land we know nothing we know who we 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.400
 know who's going to be called blackhawks 3 on 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.050
 know it's going to be a little bit 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.340
 egypt a little bit maybe a little in russia 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.230
 also we saw things a little 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.460
 little to russia 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.570
 we know that there will be a little bit of 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.590
 future a little bit of passes and 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.930
 maybe a little second war 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.860
 world also we saw also 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.000
 it would surprise me that the multi will be in 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.140
 the second world war I think 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.970
 that they will do something a little 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.870
 little of the same style as black ops 2 it's 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.220
 to say that I had a little bit left 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.050
 in the futuristic but without going too much 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.680
 far to keep something from a 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.210
 little bit a little bit how to say for 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.590
 to stay in the natural if we are 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.690
 in quotation marks to stay for not 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.310
 was going to fly to the greens of 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.510
 delusions a little bit complicated like the 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.030
 exoskeletons so I'm not saying that the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.740
 exoskeletons it's bad but the problem 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.390
 is that exoskeletons carry too much 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.030
 of too much mobility in the game which 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.960
 makes the game engine not too 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.920
 what is this a small problem 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.170
 I hope they go a little bit changed 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.550
 that in the next I think that's it 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.990
 anyway they will not change the 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.180
 engine of the game that's clear there is no 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.380
 there is no there is no picture so here it is 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.490
 that's about all I wanted 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.840
 tell you then I would like to see each other 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.070
 have your opinion that you think of 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.570
 what you have seen so far 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.130
 I invite you to see the videos 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.270
 others at all afraid to know I 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.430
 think you've already seen that of 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.020
 skyrock for example others others 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.940
 people who put all that in 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.080
 detail so here's this word I wanted 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.040
 that's it, do not hesitate to tell me 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.150
 what you think of the next 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.960
 blackhawks 3 months I know it's been 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.430
 really happy 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.540
 I will wish you as usual 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.950
 a good day a good evening then 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.280
 we'll meet again next time 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.280
 ciao
