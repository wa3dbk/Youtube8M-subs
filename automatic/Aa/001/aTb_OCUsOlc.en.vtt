thought<00:01:37.770> was<00:01:37.950> interesting<00:01:38.159> too<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.180> kind

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
thought was interesting too is to kind

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
thought was interesting too is to kind
of<00:01:39.900> give<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.170> an<00:01:40.259> idea<00:01:40.380> how<00:01:40.650> his<00:01:41.159> eyes<00:01:41.340> really

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
of give you an idea how his eyes really

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.969 
of give you an idea how his eyes really
are<00:01:42.000> versus<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.079> ball<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.740> draw<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
are versus the ball so if I draw a

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.190 
are versus the ball so if I draw a
straight<00:01:44.340> line<00:01:44.369> down<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:44.880> you'll<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.780> his

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
straight line down here you'll see his

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.910 
straight line down here you'll see his
eyes<00:01:46.470> are<00:01:46.890> somewhat<00:01:47.490> outside<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.720> ball<00:01:48.899> or<00:01:49.439> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
eyes are somewhat outside the ball or I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.770 
eyes are somewhat outside the ball or I
think<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.490> could<00:01:50.670> say<00:01:50.850> pretty<00:01:51.090> much<00:01:51.180> over<00:01:51.600> it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
think we could say pretty much over it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.170 
think we could say pretty much over it
now<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.020> understood<00:01:52.740> people<00:01:53.520> had<00:01:53.850> their<00:01:54.000> eyes

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
now I understood people had their eyes

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.819 
now I understood people had their eyes
on<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.509> inside<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.259> ball<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.619> thought

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
on the inside of the ball so I thought

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.499 
on the inside of the ball so I thought
that<00:01:55.950> was<00:01:56.100> kind<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.430> interesting<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.329> that

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that was kind of interesting that that

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.270 
that was kind of interesting that that
his<00:01:58.079> eyes<00:01:58.290> were

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
his eyes were

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.039 
his eyes were
anything<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.790> little<00:01:59.820> bit<00:02:00.180> outside<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.659> ball

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
anything a little bit outside the ball

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.780 
anything a little bit outside the ball
and<00:02:01.350> now<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> thought<00:02:02.040> I'd<00:02:02.190> take<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.549> through

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and now I thought I'd take you through

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.490 
and now I thought I'd take you through
his<00:02:02.970> stroke<00:02:03.299> from<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.720> angle<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.380> of

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
his stroke from this angle and one of

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.990 
his stroke from this angle and one of
the<00:02:04.590> things<00:02:04.650> I<00:02:04.950> do<00:02:05.010> want<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.400> note<00:02:05.460> here<00:02:05.850> is

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
the things I do want to note here is

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.870 
the things I do want to note here is
there<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.659> some<00:02:07.140> room<00:02:07.440> between<00:02:07.710> his<00:02:08.130> body<00:02:08.429> in

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
there is some room between his body in

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.930 
there is some room between his body in
his<00:02:09.000> arms<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:10.110> he<00:02:10.259> has<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> gap<00:02:10.890> there<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.459> then

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
his arms so he has a gap there and then

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.880 
his arms so he has a gap there and then
as<00:02:12.120> we<00:02:12.300> go<00:02:12.510> through<00:02:12.780> his<00:02:12.810> stroke<00:02:13.350> will<00:02:13.620> kind<00:02:13.830> of

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
as we go through his stroke will kind of

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.040 
as we go through his stroke will kind of
get<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.250> lined<00:02:14.490> up<00:02:14.700> with<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:14.940> hole<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:15.540> you

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
get this lined up with the hole so you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.290 
get this lined up with the hole so you
get<00:02:16.260> an<00:02:16.350> idea<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:17.010> his<00:02:17.340> putting<00:02:17.760> stroke<00:02:17.790> what

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
get an idea of his putting stroke what

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.840 
get an idea of his putting stroke what
he's<00:02:18.420> actually<00:02:18.690> doing<00:02:18.900> with<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.590> his<00:02:20.520> putter

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
he's actually doing with it his putter

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.809 
he's actually doing with it his putter
blade<00:02:21.060> comes<00:02:21.450> slightly<00:02:22.350> inside<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.489> I'm<00:02:23.640> going

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
blade comes slightly inside so I'm going

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.240 
blade comes slightly inside so I'm going
to<00:02:23.850> say<00:02:24.060> ever<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:24.600> slightly<00:02:24.959> but<00:02:25.950> nevertheless

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
to say ever so slightly but nevertheless

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.370 
to say ever so slightly but nevertheless
I<00:02:26.670> think<00:02:26.700> that's<00:02:27.030> pretty<00:02:27.239> evident<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:28.140> that

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
I think that's pretty evident that that

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.380 
I think that's pretty evident that that
putter<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.800> coming<00:02:29.130> slightly<00:02:29.640> inside<00:02:30.060> and

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
putter is coming slightly inside and

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.600 
putter is coming slightly inside and
then<00:02:30.930> he<00:02:31.020> goes<00:02:31.200> right<00:02:31.470> down<00:02:31.530> his<00:02:31.920> target<00:02:32.430> line

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
then he goes right down his target line

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.810 
then he goes right down his target line
and<00:02:32.910> again<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.050> guy's<00:02:34.290> gone<00:02:34.560> 285<00:02:35.489> holes

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
and again this guy's gone 285 holes

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.790 
and again this guy's gone 285 holes
without<00:02:35.970> missing<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.570> putt<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.380> thought<00:02:37.620> he'd

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
without missing a putt so I thought he'd

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.729 
without missing a putt so I thought he'd
be<00:02:37.920> kind<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.400> good<00:02:39.239> good<00:02:39.810> critique<00:02:40.260> here<00:02:40.500> so

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
be kind of a good good critique here so

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.400 
be kind of a good good critique here so
couple<00:02:41.459> ideas<00:02:41.640> hear<00:02:42.180> from<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.930> down<00:02:43.140> the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
couple ideas hear from you the down the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.620 
couple ideas hear from you the down the
line<00:02:43.620> here<00:02:44.069> we're<00:02:44.489> going<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.700> change<00:02:44.970> his<00:02:45.120> grip

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
line here we're going to change his grip

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.229 
line here we're going to change his grip
a<00:02:45.840> little<00:02:46.019> bit<00:02:46.319> get<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.010> more<00:02:47.280> up<00:02:47.459> in<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
a little bit get it more up in the the

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.420 
a little bit get it more up in the the
palm<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.540> your<00:02:48.780> left<00:02:48.930> hand<00:02:49.530> get<00:02:50.010> your<00:02:50.220> eyes

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
palm of your left hand get your eyes

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.759 
palm of your left hand get your eyes
over<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> putt<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.540> then<00:02:52.050> it's<00:02:52.200> okay<00:02:52.709> to

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
over the putt and then it's okay to

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.100 
over the putt and then it's okay to
swing<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.430> putter<00:02:53.670> blade<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:54.300> little<00:02:54.959> bit

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
swing the putter blade a little bit

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.990 
swing the putter blade a little bit
inside<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.830> then<00:02:55.950> down<00:02:56.220> your<00:02:56.250> target<00:02:56.970> line

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
inside and then down your target line

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.270 
inside and then down your target line
and<00:02:57.420> I'll<00:02:57.780> have<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.019> few<00:02:58.350> more<00:02:58.530> critiques<00:02:59.010> of

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
and I'll have a few more critiques of

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.520 
and I'll have a few more critiques of
Justin's<00:03:00.120> putting<00:03:00.540> stroke<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:00.989> our<00:03:01.050> next<00:03:01.230> one

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
Justin's putting stroke and our next one

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.750 
Justin's putting stroke and our next one
here<00:03:01.709> but<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:01.890> thought<00:03:02.069> this<00:03:02.220> would<00:03:02.370> be<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.550> good

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
here but I thought this would be a good

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.970 
here but I thought this would be a good
start<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.750> get<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.110> making<00:03:04.410> some<00:03:04.590> more<00:03:04.739> putts

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
start to get you making some more putts

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.500 
start to get you making some more putts
so<00:03:05.160> hopefully<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.820> helps<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.360> we'll

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
so hopefully that helps you and we'll

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.130 
so hopefully that helps you and we'll
look<00:03:06.720> forward<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.110> doing<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.470> next<00:03:07.709> one<00:03:07.890> soon
