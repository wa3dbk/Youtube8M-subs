00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.300 
have the map view and to have the Terran
view<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:19.600> right<00:03:19.870> now<00:03:20.080> this<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:20.860> satellite

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
view and right now this is the satellite

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.460 
view and right now this is the satellite
view<00:03:21.930> enabled<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:25.750> actually<00:03:25.959> doesn't

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
view enabled but it actually doesn't

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.550

look<00:03:26.680> like<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.040> proper<00:03:27.370> satellite<00:03:27.970> view<00:03:28.239> as<00:03:28.560> we

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
look like a proper satellite view as we

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.229 
look like a proper satellite view as we
also<00:03:29.739> noticed<00:03:30.400> in<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:32.489> ipad<00:03:33.489> app<00:03:33.640> of<00:03:33.880> this
