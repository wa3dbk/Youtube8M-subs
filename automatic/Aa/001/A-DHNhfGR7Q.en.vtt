00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
protect large gate as a wire so they

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.130

the red wires and your kids are
protected<00:01:21.030> by<00:01:21.060> these<00:01:21.360> fuses<00:01:21.840> again<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.619> is

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
protected by these fuses again this is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.249 
protected by these fuses again this is
very<00:01:22.799> important<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.549> couple<00:01:23.820> reasons

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
very important for a couple reasons

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.390 
very important for a couple reasons
let's<00:01:25.259> say<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.439> get<00:01:25.650> into<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> collision<00:01:26.310> or

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
let's say you get into a collision or

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.340 
let's say you get into a collision or
some<00:01:26.549> kind<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.790> accident<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.080> those

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
some kind of accident in one of those

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.499 
some kind of accident in one of those
again<00:01:29.159> an<00:01:29.310> 8<00:01:29.430> gauge<00:01:29.610> wire<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> large<00:01:30.210> wire

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
again an 8 gauge wire is a large wire

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.980 
again an 8 gauge wire is a large wire
one<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.470> those<00:01:31.590> wires<00:01:31.920> gets<00:01:32.250> broken<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.670> ground

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
one of those wires gets broken to ground

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.480 
one of those wires gets broken to ground
this<00:01:33.990> fuse<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.650> going<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.829> open<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
this fuse is going to open up and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.219 
this fuse is going to open up and
essentially<00:01:36.180> keep<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.630> wire<00:01:36.840> from<00:01:37.020> bursting

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
essentially keep that wire from bursting

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.969 
essentially keep that wire from bursting
into<00:01:37.500> flames<00:01:37.770> or<00:01:38.540> let's<00:01:39.540> say<00:01:39.689> over<00:01:39.990> time<00:01:40.259> that

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
into flames or let's say over time that

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.160 
into flames or let's say over time that
wire<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.700> rubbing<00:01:42.270> against<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.630> piece<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.840> metal

wire is rubbing against a piece of metal

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.810 
wire is rubbing against a piece of metal
and<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.619> break<00:01:43.920> through<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> insulation

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and you break through the insulation

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.780 
and you break through the insulation
this<00:01:45.570> fuse<00:01:45.930> again<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.350> designed<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.250> open<00:01:47.460> up

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
this fuse again is designed to open up

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.139 
this fuse again is designed to open up
and<00:01:47.970> protect<00:01:48.780> from<00:01:49.380> short<00:01:49.619> circuits<00:01:50.149> now

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
and protect from short circuits now

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.200 
and protect from short circuits now
again<00:01:51.890> that<00:01:52.890> fuse<00:01:53.340> holders<00:01:53.729> made<00:01:53.939> up<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.149> these

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.230 
you these little bus bars that
essentially<00:01:58.560> jump<00:01:58.860> them<00:01:59.009> together<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.969> if<00:02:00.119> you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
essentially jump them together so if you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.510 
essentially jump them together so if you
wanted<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.750> split<00:02:00.990> these<00:02:01.200> holders<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.829> they

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
wanted to split these holders up they

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.249 
wanted to split these holders up they
come<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:03.000> click<00:02:03.240> apart<00:02:03.540> they<00:02:03.840> kind<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.049> click

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
come they click apart they kind of click

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.620 
come they click apart they kind of click
together<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.799> legos<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.329> take<00:02:06.509> these

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
together like legos you can take these

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.029 
together like legos you can take these
bus<00:02:06.869> bars<00:02:07.170> essentially<00:02:07.649> put<00:02:07.829> them<00:02:07.950> in

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
bus bars essentially put them in

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.130 
bus bars essentially put them in
whatever<00:02:08.160> combinations<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.090> need<00:02:09.360> depending

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
whatever combinations you need depending

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.300 
whatever combinations you need depending
on<00:02:10.200> where<00:02:10.349> you're<00:02:10.500> putting<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.800> fuse<00:02:11.039> holders

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
on where you're putting the fuse holders

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.830 
on where you're putting the fuse holders
in<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.489> car

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
in the car

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.990 
in the car
so<00:02:12.620> we<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:13.310> want<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.519> show<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.700> some<00:02:13.879> of<00:02:13.910> the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
so we just want to show you some of the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.059 
so we just want to show you some of the
details<00:02:14.330> on<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.720> mega<00:02:14.900> fuse<00:02:15.110> holder<00:02:15.440> again

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
details on the mega fuse holder again

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.470 
details on the mega fuse holder again
those<00:02:16.250> are<00:02:16.280> very<00:02:16.550> important<00:02:17.090> because<00:02:17.180> they

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
those are very important because they

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.660 
those are very important because they
protect<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.260> primary<00:02:18.709> feeds<00:02:19.010> ultimately

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
protect the primary feeds ultimately

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.449 
protect the primary feeds ultimately
from<00:02:19.879> the<00:02:20.000> battery<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.420> your<00:02:21.050> power<00:02:21.230> cells<00:02:21.530> so

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
from the battery to your power cells so
