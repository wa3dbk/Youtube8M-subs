00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
it compared to this i also i'll close

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:18.840 
it compared to this i also i'll close
and<00:02:08.769> let<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.700> see<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:10.030> from<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.989> bottom

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.820 

and<00:02:19.420> both<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.660> them<00:02:19.840> together<00:02:20.020> can<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.650> see

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
and both of them together can you see

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.920 
and both of them together can you see
how<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:23.260> primer<00:02:24.210> makes<00:02:25.210> my<00:02:25.360> lashes<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.690> little

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
how the primer makes my lashes a little

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.670 
how the primer makes my lashes a little
bit<00:02:26.020> longer<00:02:26.760> ok<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.960> now<00:02:29.080> I'm<00:02:29.140> going<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.350> put<00:02:29.530> on

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
bit longer ok so now I'm going to put on

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.640 
bit longer ok so now I'm going to put on
the<00:02:29.860> mascara<00:02:30.310> on<00:02:30.610> my<00:02:31.330> other<00:02:31.570> I<00:02:31.630> supposed<00:02:32.590> to

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
the mascara on my other I supposed to

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.520 
the mascara on my other I supposed to
let<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.920> primer<00:02:33.160> dry<00:02:34.320> before<00:02:35.320> you<00:02:35.470> put

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
let the primer dry before you put

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.559 
let the primer dry before you put
anything<00:02:35.800> on<00:02:35.950> top<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.280> it

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:03:00.840 

so<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:43.409> is<00:02:43.579> just<00:02:45.859> mascara

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.920 

I'll<00:03:01.850> probably<00:03:02.030> go<00:03:02.240> back<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.600> one<00:03:02.750> and

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
I'll probably go back to that one and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.960 
I'll probably go back to that one and
put<00:03:03.080> another<00:03:03.170> coat<00:03:03.500> after<00:03:03.680> i<00:03:03.860> put<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.490> mascara

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
put another coat after i put the mascara

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.310 
put another coat after i put the mascara
on<00:03:05.650> that<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:07.480> eyelash<00:03:08.480> with<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.810> primer<00:03:09.050> so

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
on that the eyelash with the primer so

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.710 
on that the eyelash with the primer so
i'm<00:03:09.380> going<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.620> put<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:10.910> on<00:03:11.030> now<00:03:11.240> with<00:03:11.600> the

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
i'm going to put it on now with the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.920 
i'm going to put it on now with the
primer<00:03:11.960> I<00:03:15.820> seem<00:03:16.820> she<00:03:16.970> had<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.240> work<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.660> little

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
primer I seem she had to work a little

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.020 
primer I seem she had to work a little
bit<00:03:18.080> more<00:03:18.380> um<00:03:19.340> with<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.210> mascara<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:22.700> get<00:03:22.880> the

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
bit more um with the mascara to get the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.030 
bit more um with the mascara to get the
eyelashes<00:03:23.480> coated<00:03:23.810> because<00:03:24.110> since<00:03:24.950> the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
eyelashes coated because since the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.910 
eyelashes coated because since the
primer<00:03:25.340> comes<00:03:25.700> out<00:03:25.880> white<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:27.530> got<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.770> try

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
primer comes out white you got to try

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
primer comes out white you got to try
really<00:03:28.160> hard<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.520> cover<00:03:28.850> up<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:30.230> white<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:31.010> the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
really hard to cover up the white of the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.580 
really hard to cover up the white of the
primer<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:33.410> cover<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.740> with<00:03:33.800> mascara<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:36.470> it

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
primer to cover it with mascara so it

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.260 
primer to cover it with mascara so it
takes<00:03:36.740> a<00:03:36.890> couple<00:03:37.040> coats<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.550> mascara<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:38.150> be

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
takes a couple coats of mascara to be

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.500 
takes a couple coats of mascara to be
able<00:03:38.330> to<00:03:38.540> do<00:03:38.690> that<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:40.030> then<00:03:41.030> knowing<00:03:41.330> me<00:03:41.480> I

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
able to do that and then knowing me I

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.000 
able to do that and then knowing me I
still<00:03:41.870> probably<00:03:42.080> won't<00:03:42.350> have<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:42.590> coated<00:03:42.800> all

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
still probably won't have it coated all

00:03:43.010 --> 00:04:07.930 
still probably won't have it coated all
the<00:03:43.130> way
