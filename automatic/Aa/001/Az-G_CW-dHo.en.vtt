00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.050
 I'm clear 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.000
 for example the one who is sweeping is going to 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.170

 I have a lot of applause for these young people 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.889
 tremendous actors god bless 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.479
 much 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:56.300
 thank you very much to be said thank you 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:59.439
 but it is exactly what happens when 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.439
 use something 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.780
 in what is different for the purpose 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.010
 for which it was created there was a young 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.770
 trying to comb with the 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.940
 instructions 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.940
 And that's very good 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.199
 they only saw you as 160 nations of the 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.199
 land 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:25.139
 but this happens in reality when 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:28.169
 we take our lives and use them in 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.070
 a purpose in a different design for 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.880
 which we were created 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.890
 this generation needs good models 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.950
 he needs people who really challenge him 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:41.140
 to be better to challenge you to be different 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.360
 that when they see you they can see in days of 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.100
 inspiration of Jesus in your look in your 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.110
 way to speak on your way 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.200
 express yourself to act in your way of 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.840
 dress all these things these patterns 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.340
 they will say who you are a child of the day 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.740
 the word of God will teach you your 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.690
 true identity and listen to me when 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.180
 your life begins to be in Christ the 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.180
 true peace blessing the 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:07.560
 true joy the true purpose 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.560
