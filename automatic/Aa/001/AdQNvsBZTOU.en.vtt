 my daughter 's birthday today 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.560
 I want to make it with my own hands 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.880
 now I am going to leave to congratulate in the morning 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.359
 I usually 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.130
 early in the morning and and congratulations are not always 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.130
 nice to congratulate her one of the first 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.200
 made in the style of decoupage or method 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.290
 decoupage 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.739
 I tried to depict this course mural 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.320
 see the roughness is me specifically 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.360
 did 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.690
 I have such a picture of course 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.120
 errors that I see now and you 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.309
 probably deity so do not judge strictly 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.219
 I don't do very often 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.460
 decoupage it's just we like that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.550
 a little hobby is necessary more often of course 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.220
 then you will do better than the best 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.229
 get because one of the mistakes I thought 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.140
 in the corner this frame will be beautiful 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.250
 look it on the contrary spoils everything and 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.830
 It is clear that this is a napkin retort nko 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:22.250
 such a frame you are a little worn for a latte with 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:27.360
 gilding I did it like she 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.909
 old so this table looks like I think 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.900
 she will like it from this side 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.900

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.630

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.729
 such fillers in order here with 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.729

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.459
 I made such a very beautiful tray 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.120
 because I didn't fit his dishes 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:49.900
 make big two servings it turned out 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.799
 the big one didn't fit anything on the dish 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.700
 the most important thing was to be tasty but 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.150
