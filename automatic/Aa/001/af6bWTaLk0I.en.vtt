00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
put my finger on how they kept it

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.490 
put my finger on how they kept it
looking<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.520> car<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.180> think<00:03:24.510> if<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.200> side

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.800 
looking like a car I think if the side
window<00:03:26.070> arc<00:03:26.430> were<00:03:26.670> arched<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.510> would<00:03:27.660> look

window arc were arched it would look

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.750 
window arc were arched it would look
just<00:03:27.840> like<00:03:28.110> an<00:03:28.320> infinity<00:03:28.770> FX<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.490> then<00:03:29.610> be

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
just like an infinity FX and then be

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.090 
just like an infinity FX and then be
