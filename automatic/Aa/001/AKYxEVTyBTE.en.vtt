00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:05.990 

in<00:00:04.220> this<00:00:05.220> video<00:00:05.490> we're<00:00:05.640> gonna<00:00:05.700> look<00:00:05.850> at

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
in this video we're gonna look at

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.280 
in this video we're gonna look at
rounding<00:00:06.270> numbers<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.839> nearest<00:00:06.960> whole

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
rounding numbers to the nearest whole

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.740 
rounding numbers to the nearest whole
number<00:00:07.319> so<00:00:07.770> round<00:00:08.639> seven<00:00:09.030> point<00:00:09.240> four<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.540> the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
number so round seven point four to the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.480 
number so round seven point four to the
nearest<00:00:09.990> whole<00:00:10.170> number<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:10.650> here<00:00:11.250> we've<00:00:11.340> got<00:00:11.370> a

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
nearest whole number so here we've got a

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.400 
nearest whole number so here we've got a
number<00:00:11.790> line<00:00:11.940> look<00:00:12.210> at<00:00:12.330> seven<00:00:12.719> I'm<00:00:12.929> gonna<00:00:13.290> get

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
number line look at seven I'm gonna get

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.350 
number line look at seven I'm gonna get
it<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.950> we'll<00:00:14.160> get<00:00:14.280> seven<00:00:14.610> point<00:00:14.849> five<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
it and we'll get seven point five in the

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.480 
it and we'll get seven point five in the
middle<00:00:15.650> seven<00:00:16.650> point<00:00:16.920> four<00:00:17.220> would<00:00:17.460> be

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
middle seven point four would be

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.920 
middle seven point four would be
somewhere<00:00:17.910> like<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.660> number<00:00:18.900> line

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
somewhere like here on the number line

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.679 
somewhere like here on the number line
seven<00:00:19.439> point<00:00:19.680> four<00:00:19.890> as<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.210> see<00:00:21.330> seven

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
seven point four as you can see seven

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.420 
seven point four as you can see seven
point<00:00:21.869> four<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.140> closer<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.590> seven<00:00:23.010> thana<00:00:23.250> is

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
point four is closer to seven thana is

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.910 
point four is closer to seven thana is
to<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.060> seven<00:00:24.840> point<00:00:25.050> four<00:00:25.260> centers<00:00:25.710> whole

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
to it so seven point four centers whole

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.050 
to it so seven point four centers whole
number<00:00:26.160> would<00:00:26.460> be<00:00:26.640> seven<00:00:28.730> this<00:00:29.730> time<00:00:29.939> we're

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
number would be seven this time we're

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.820 
number would be seven this time we're
gonna<00:00:30.179> surround<00:00:30.510> forty<00:00:30.869> three<00:00:31.140> point<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.560> to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
gonna surround forty three point it to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.200 
gonna surround forty three point it to
the<00:00:31.949> nearest<00:00:32.130> whole<00:00:32.309> number<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.700> again<00:00:33.059> we've

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the nearest whole number so again we've

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.459 
the nearest whole number so again we've
got<00:00:33.239> 43<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.200> 44<00:00:35.630> 145<00:00:36.630> three<00:00:37.079> point<00:00:37.350> eight

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
got 43 and 44 145 three point eight

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.350 
got 43 and 44 145 three point eight
would<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.710> somewhere<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.090> number<00:00:39.329> line

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
would be somewhere on the number line

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.110 
would be somewhere on the number line
around<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.110> region<00:00:40.350> forty<00:00:40.829> three<00:00:41.100> point<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
around this region forty three point it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.869 
around this region forty three point it
I<00:00:42.420> think<00:00:43.350> C<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.559> closer<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.190> forty<00:00:44.489> four<00:00:44.700> that

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
I think C is closer to forty four that

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.450 
I think C is closer to forty four that
is<00:00:44.940> 243<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.350> runs<00:00:46.530> at<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> nurse'll<00:00:47.190> number

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
is 243 so it runs at the nurse'll number

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.729 
is 243 so it runs at the nurse'll number
counts<00:00:47.789> would<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.090> forty<00:00:48.690> four<00:00:51.620> here<00:00:52.620> we've

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
counts would be forty four here we've

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.990 
counts would be forty four here we've
got<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> number<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.370> hundred<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.699> twenty

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
got a number one hundred and twenty

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.260 
got a number one hundred and twenty
three<00:00:54.300> point<00:00:54.750> six<00:00:55.050> seven<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.550> stands<00:00:57.090> for

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
three point six seven the one stands for

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.049 
three point six seven the one stands for
100<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> hundreds<00:00:58.710> column<00:00:59.059> two

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
100 so this is the hundreds column two

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.849 
100 so this is the hundreds column two
stands<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.539> twenty<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> tens

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
stands for twenty so it's in the tens

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.490 
stands for twenty so it's in the tens
column<00:01:02.039> twenty<00:01:02.879> will<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:04.019> three<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
column twenty will have three in the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.980 
column twenty will have three in the
unit's<00:01:04.920> column<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.600> then<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.630> look<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
unit's column and then you look at the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.080 
unit's column and then you look at the
decimal<00:01:07.200> point<00:01:07.680> after<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.580> decimal<00:01:08.760> point

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
decimal point after the decimal point

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.960 
decimal point after the decimal point
next<00:01:09.420> comes<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.930> temps<00:01:10.350> column<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.700> six

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
next comes a temps column so we get six

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.120 
next comes a temps column so we get six
temps<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.780> then<00:01:13.170> after<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.680> you've<00:01:13.890> got<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
temps and then after that you've got the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.640 
temps and then after that you've got the
hundreds<00:01:14.549> column<00:01:14.869> next<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> thousand

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
hundreds column next to be the thousand

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.050 
hundreds column next to be the thousand
four<00:01:16.799> column<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.400> when<00:01:17.909> you're

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
four column and so on when you're

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.460 
four column and so on when you're
rounding<00:01:18.240> through<00:01:18.570> their<00:01:18.840> whole<00:01:19.170> number<00:01:19.439> you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
rounding through their whole number you

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.499 
rounding through their whole number you
only<00:01:19.799> need<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.220> look<00:01:20.400> at<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.670> temps<00:01:21.180> column

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
only need to look at this temps column

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.539 
only need to look at this temps column
this<00:01:22.080> number<00:01:22.470> here<00:01:22.650> will<00:01:22.860> make<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.220> help<00:01:23.460> you

this number here will make it help you

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.770 
this number here will make it help you
decide<00:01:23.909> wherever<00:01:24.180> you're<00:01:24.270> going<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.450> round<00:01:24.600> up

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
decide wherever you're going to round up

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.030 
decide wherever you're going to round up
or<00:01:25.049> round<00:01:25.110> down<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.820> number<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.450> zero<00:01:28.229> one

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040

we're<00:01:54.689> gonna<00:01:54.810> run<00:01:54.990> all<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.259> them<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
we're gonna run all of them to the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.010 
we're gonna run all of them to the
nearest<00:01:56.159> whole<00:01:56.340> number<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.820> we've<00:01:57.719> got<00:01:57.840> eight

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
nearest whole number so we've got eight

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.260 
nearest whole number so we've got eight
point<00:01:58.409> nine<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.250> temps<00:01:59.610> column<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.119> in

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
point nine in the temps column is in

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.730 
point nine in the temps column is in
nine<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.840> means<00:02:00.990> we're<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> round<00:02:01.530> up

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
nine that means we're going to round up

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.289 
nine that means we're going to round up
so<00:02:02.460> we're<00:02:02.579> going<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.759> go<00:02:02.820> up<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> next

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
so we're going to go up to the next

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.499 
so we're going to go up to the next
whole<00:02:03.509> number<00:02:03.570> which<00:02:04.020> would<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.259> nine

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
whole number which would be nine

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.969 
whole number which would be nine
this<00:02:06.509> time<00:02:06.780> we've<00:02:06.930> got<00:02:07.079> fourteen<00:02:07.590> point<00:02:07.920> two

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
this time we've got fourteen point two

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.969

in the temps column is a 2 that means

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.500 
in the temps column is a 2 that means
we're<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> round<00:02:11.580> down<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.300> we're<00:02:12.390> gonna

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
we're going to round down so we're gonna

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.589 
we're going to round down so we're gonna
run<00:02:12.720> down<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.959> 14

columnist<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.160> six<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:42.000> means<00:02:42.060> we're<00:02:42.330> gonna

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
columnist is six that means we're gonna

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.420 
columnist is six that means we're gonna
round<00:02:42.690> up<00:02:43.019> well<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> next<00:02:43.709> one<00:02:43.800> over<00:02:44.040> would<00:02:44.280> be

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
round up well the next one over would be

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.910 
round up well the next one over would be
one<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.780> that's<00:02:45.959> how<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.170> run<00:02:46.290> numbers<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.830> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
one so that's how you run numbers to the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.459 
one so that's how you run numbers to the
nearest<00:02:47.100> whole<00:02:47.400> number
