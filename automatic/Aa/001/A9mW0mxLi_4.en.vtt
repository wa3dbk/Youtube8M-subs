00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.500 

I<00:00:04.380> was<00:00:05.380> really<00:00:05.529> fascinated<00:00:05.859> by<00:00:06.460> the<00:00:06.520> idea<00:00:07.000> that

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:07.510 
I was really fascinated by the idea that

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.500 
I was really fascinated by the idea that
some<00:00:07.930> people<00:00:08.639> value<00:00:09.639> being<00:00:09.880> excessively

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.510 
some people value being excessively

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.510 
some people value being excessively
wealthy<00:00:10.990> over<00:00:11.230> anything<00:00:11.500> else<00:00:11.770> and<00:00:12.160> don't

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:12.520 
wealthy over anything else and don't

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.020 
wealthy over anything else and don't
care<00:00:12.959> about

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
care about

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.330 
care about
how<00:00:15.570> they<00:00:15.809> have<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.170> achieve<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.130> who

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
how they have to achieve that and who

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.529 
how they have to achieve that and who
they<00:00:17.490> have<00:00:17.610> to<00:00:17.760> hurt<00:00:17.939> along<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.210> way<00:00:18.390> they

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
they have to hurt along the way they

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.150 
they have to hurt along the way they
don't<00:00:18.689> even<00:00:18.779> consider<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.710> know<00:00:19.740> so

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
don't even consider that you know so

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.100 
don't even consider that you know so
that<00:00:21.029> was<00:00:21.090> really<00:00:21.270> interesting<00:00:21.720> about<00:00:21.779> both

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
that was really interesting about both

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.720 
that was really interesting about both
the<00:00:22.289> story<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.949> Donnie<00:00:23.669> to<00:00:24.000> me

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.960 

well<00:00:30.690> I<00:00:30.720> think<00:00:30.960> now<00:00:31.560> after<00:00:31.950> seeing<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
well I think now after seeing it and

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.310 
well I think now after seeing it and
being<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> part<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.630> making<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.989> don't<00:00:34.170> think

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
being a part of making it I don't think

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.050 
being a part of making it I don't think
anyone<00:00:34.620> else<00:00:34.770> could<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.190> directed<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.880> with

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
anyone else could have directed it with

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.320 
anyone else could have directed it with
the<00:00:38.120> aggressiveness<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:40.400> ferocity<00:00:41.400> that

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
the aggressiveness and ferocity that

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.979 
the aggressiveness and ferocity that
that<00:00:42.950> you<00:00:43.950> know<00:00:44.070> Martin<00:00:44.640> Scorsese<00:00:45.030> Scorsese

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
that you know Martin Scorsese Scorsese

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.540

rather have Scorsese directed than
anyone<00:00:53.340> else<00:00:53.489> I'd<00:00:53.640> say<00:00:53.820> yes

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.240 

I<00:00:59.240> just<00:00:59.810> think<00:00:59.990> he<00:01:00.560> I<00:01:01.100> mean<00:01:01.850> he's<00:01:02.150> just<00:01:02.360> so

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
I just think he I mean he's just so

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.250 
I just think he I mean he's just so
insanely<00:01:04.250> gifted<00:01:05.030> as<00:01:05.239> an<00:01:05.420> actor<00:01:05.780> he's<00:01:05.900> so

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
insanely gifted as an actor he's so

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.550 
insanely gifted as an actor he's so
brilliant<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:07.190> it's<00:01:07.700> just<00:01:08.030> it's<00:01:09.020> shocking

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
brilliant that it's just it's shocking

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.090 
brilliant that it's just it's shocking
and<00:01:09.740> I<00:01:09.950> think<00:01:10.220> that<00:01:10.700> Jordan<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.479> character

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
and I think that Jordan the character

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.010 
and I think that Jordan the character
you<00:01:13.100> know<00:01:13.250> is<00:01:13.790> this<00:01:14.090> guy<00:01:14.270> doing<00:01:14.540> these<00:01:14.660> awful

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
you know is this guy doing these awful

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.410 
you know is this guy doing these awful
things<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.729> swindling<00:01:16.729> people<00:01:16.760> out<00:01:17.119> of<00:01:17.240> money

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
things and swindling people out of money

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.450 
things and swindling people out of money
and<00:01:17.600> doing<00:01:17.810> these<00:01:17.990> horrible<00:01:18.320> things<00:01:18.590> but<00:01:18.800> the

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
and doing these horrible things but the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.280 
and doing these horrible things but the
point<00:01:19.729> is<00:01:19.820> that<00:01:19.940> he's<00:01:20.090> charismatic<00:01:20.900> as<00:01:21.050> well

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
point is that he's charismatic as well

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.830 
point is that he's charismatic as well
and<00:01:21.560> I<00:01:21.619> think<00:01:21.680> Leo<00:01:22.580> just<00:01:22.760> pulled<00:01:23.060> off<00:01:23.300> all<00:01:23.540> of

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
and I think Leo just pulled off all of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:32.570 
and I think Leo just pulled off all of
the<00:01:23.960> deviousness<00:01:24.410> with<00:01:24.890> such<00:01:25.690> charm<00:01:26.690> as<00:01:27.050> well

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.040 

basically<00:01:33.580> because<00:01:34.120> this<00:01:34.570> is<00:01:34.690> what<00:01:34.840> really

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
basically because this is what really

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.930 
basically because this is what really
happened<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:35.830> what<00:01:35.950> these<00:01:36.040> guys<00:01:36.100> really<00:01:36.520> did

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
happened and what these guys really did

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.060 
happened and what these guys really did
that's<00:01:37.510> what<00:01:37.690> makes<00:01:37.930> it<00:01:38.110> funny<00:01:38.470> in<00:01:38.650> any<00:01:38.770> way<00:01:39.010> so

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
that's what makes it funny in any way so

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.300 
that's what makes it funny in any way so
because<00:01:39.670> they're<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:41.380> cannot<00:01:41.680> believe<00:01:42.040> that

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
because they're you cannot believe that

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.920 
because they're you cannot believe that
this<00:01:42.430> is<00:01:42.580> how<00:01:42.700> they<00:01:42.850> behaved<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.540> treated

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
this is how they behaved and treated

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:51.690 
this is how they behaved and treated
people<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:45.070> actions<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:45.610> they<00:01:45.790> did

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.300 

probably<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:53.090> scene<00:01:53.509> where<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:54.619> meet<00:01:55.040> Donnie

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.130 
probably the scene where you meet Donnie
