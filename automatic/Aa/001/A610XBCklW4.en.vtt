how it plays how it feels it kind of
feels<00:01:23.759> pretty<00:01:24.210> similar<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.689> Red<00:01:25.140> Death<00:01:25.470> it's

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.710 
feels pretty similar to Red Death it's
that<00:01:26.009> same<00:01:26.369> kind<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.790> play<00:01:27.030> style<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that same kind of play style it's a

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
that same kind of play style it's a
slower<00:01:28.110> rate<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> fire<00:01:28.560> than<00:01:28.979> other<00:01:29.189> pulse

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
slower rate of fire than other pulse

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.749 
slower rate of fire than other pulse
rifles<00:01:29.970> but<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> packs<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:31.220> ridiculous<00:01:32.220> punch

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
rifles but it packs a ridiculous punch

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.760

them because of that to burst kill

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.390 
them because of that to burst kill
they're<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.840> not<00:01:40.079> expecting<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.310> you

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.810 
they're just not expecting it and if you
land<00:01:41.670> those<00:01:41.939> shots<00:01:42.240> they're<00:01:42.930> gonna<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.380> down

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
medium to long range which is actually

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.310 
medium to long range which is actually
perfect<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.369> trials<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.970> Osiris<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.659> took<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
perfect for trials of Osiris I took it

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.170 
perfect for trials of Osiris I took it
into<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.590> trials<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.920> Osiris<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.610> since<00:01:57.030> I've

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
got it I honestly haven't used any other

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.789 
got it I honestly haven't used any other
weapon<00:02:00.270> occasionally<00:02:01.140> when<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.320> come<00:02:01.500> across<00:02:01.590> a

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
weapon occasionally when I come across a

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.639 
weapon occasionally when I come across a
super-awesome<00:02:02.430> crazy<00:02:03.270> group<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.079> will<00:02:04.439> switch

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
super-awesome crazy group I will switch

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.980 
super-awesome crazy group I will switch
the<00:02:04.860> thorn<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.490> combat<00:02:05.969> all<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.299> their<00:02:06.630> thorns

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the thorn to combat all of their thorns

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.080 
the thorn to combat all of their thorns
but<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.920> most<00:02:08.099> part<00:02:08.250> I've<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.940> been

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
but for the most part I've just been

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.669 
but for the most part I've just been
using<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.539> pulse<00:02:09.840> rifle<00:02:10.050> because<00:02:10.440> it

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
using the pulse rifle because it

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.400 
using the pulse rifle because it
competes<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:11.310> pretty

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
competes with pretty

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.830 
competes with pretty
every<00:02:12.950> weapon<00:02:13.190> so<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:13.940> want<00:02:14.210> to<00:02:14.300> stay<00:02:14.450> at<00:02:14.630> that

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
every weapon so you want to stay at that

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.200 
every weapon so you want to stay at that
medium<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.260> long<00:02:15.650> range<00:02:16.010> for<00:02:16.340> sure<00:02:16.640> because<00:02:16.970> in

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
medium to long range for sure because in

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.660 
medium to long range for sure because in
close<00:02:17.420> range<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.930> do<00:02:18.170> shoot<00:02:18.560> very<00:02:18.860> slowly<00:02:19.280> if

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
close range you do shoot very slowly if

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.520 
close range you do shoot very slowly if
you<00:02:19.760> get<00:02:20.030> used<00:02:20.210> to<00:02:20.360> landing<00:02:20.720> those<00:02:20.840> precision

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
you get used to landing those precision

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.440 
you get used to landing those precision
shots<00:02:21.890> then<00:02:22.280> being<00:02:22.550> close<00:02:22.760> range<00:02:23.030> is<00:02:23.210> not

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
shots then being close range is not

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.990 
shots then being close range is not
gonna<00:02:23.690> really<00:02:23.930> be<00:02:24.140> an<00:02:24.260> issue<00:02:24.440> for<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:25.040> but<00:02:25.790> you

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
gonna really be an issue for you but you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.330 
gonna really be an issue for you but you
definitely<00:02:26.810> have<00:02:27.050> more<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.650> success<00:02:27.860> rate

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
definitely have more of a success rate

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.550 
definitely have more of a success rate
in<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.820> medium<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.510> long<00:02:29.720> range<00:02:30.020> which<00:02:30.260> like<00:02:30.470> I

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
in the medium to long range which like I

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.440 
in the medium to long range which like I
said<00:02:30.800> it's<00:02:31.250> perfect<00:02:31.760> for<00:02:31.820> trials<00:02:32.270> I've

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
said it's perfect for trials I've

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.190 
said it's perfect for trials I've
probably<00:02:32.870> done<00:02:33.290> about<00:02:33.770> four<00:02:34.250> trials<00:02:34.640> runs

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
probably done about four trials runs

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.990 
probably done about four trials runs
exclusively<00:02:36.200> using<00:02:36.710> this<00:02:36.860> pulse<00:02:37.160> rifle<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.790> a

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
exclusively using this pulse rifle and a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.630 
exclusively using this pulse rifle and a
lot<00:02:38.210> of<00:02:38.330> people<00:02:38.630> like<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.810> push<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.530> side<00:02:39.980> so

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
lot of people like to push the side so

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.580 
lot of people like to push the side so
we<00:02:40.880> would<00:02:41.030> usually<00:02:41.180> push<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.750> other<00:02:41.930> side<00:02:42.260> and

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
we would usually push the other side and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.500 
we would usually push the other side and
if<00:02:42.770> we're<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.010> an<00:02:43.250> engagement<00:02:43.640> from<00:02:44.120> across

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
if we're in an engagement from across

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.960 
if we're in an engagement from across
the<00:02:44.810> map<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.380> can<00:02:45.830> take<00:02:46.010> them<00:02:46.160> down<00:02:46.340> with<00:02:46.700> two

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
the map I can take them down with two

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.420 
the map I can take them down with two
bursts<00:02:47.360> very<00:02:47.870> very<00:02:48.140> very<00:02:48.410> easily<00:02:48.740> a<00:02:49.100> lot<00:02:49.310> of

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
across the map when I got to close range

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.830 
across the map when I got to close range
I've<00:03:21.200> had<00:03:21.680> mixed<00:03:22.100> results<00:03:22.430> because<00:03:23.150> I'm<00:03:23.330> still

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
I've had mixed results because I'm still

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.600 
I've had mixed results because I'm still
kind<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.200> getting<00:03:24.440> used<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.830> being<00:03:25.250> in<00:03:25.520> a

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
kind of getting used to being in a

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.640 
kind of getting used to being in a
close-range<00:03:25.940> situation<00:03:26.660> with<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.260> weapon

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
close-range situation with the weapon

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.770 
close-range situation with the weapon
and<00:03:27.890> so<00:03:28.040> when<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.280> first<00:03:28.520> get<00:03:28.820> it<00:03:28.970> try<00:03:29.480> and

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
and so when you first get it try and

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.480 
and so when you first get it try and
adjust<00:03:29.840> your<00:03:30.170> play<00:03:30.380> style<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.830> be<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.010> little

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
adjust your play style to be a little

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.240 
adjust your play style to be a little
bit<00:03:31.730> more<00:03:32.030> standoffish<00:03:32.690> because<00:03:33.560> that's<00:03:33.950> your

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
bit more standoffish because that's your

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.130 
bit more standoffish because that's your
perfect<00:03:34.640> place<00:03:35.060> your<00:03:35.270> perfect<00:03:35.690> place<00:03:35.870> is<00:03:36.020> the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
perfect place your perfect place is the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.080 
perfect place your perfect place is the
medium<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.530> long<00:03:36.710> range<00:03:36.950> like<00:03:37.490> I<00:03:37.610> said<00:03:37.850> it's

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
medium to long range like I said it's

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.480 
medium to long range like I said it's
very<00:03:38.180> similar<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.900> Red<00:03:39.230> Death<00:03:39.470> or<00:03:39.710> something

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
very similar to Red Death or something

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.270 
very similar to Red Death or something
like<00:03:40.970> three<00:03:41.600> little<00:03:41.810> words<00:03:42.020> it's<00:03:42.709> kind<00:03:43.130> of

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
like three little words it's kind of

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.650 
like three little words it's kind of
similar<00:03:43.520> to<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.850> but<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.120> would<00:03:44.270> say<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.570> it

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
similar to that but I would say that it

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.030 
similar to that but I would say that it
packs<00:03:44.870> more<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.620> punch

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
packs more of a punch

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.460 
packs more of a punch
because<00:03:46.580> Red<00:03:46.760> Death<00:03:46.940> for<00:03:47.180> example<00:03:47.600> does<00:03:47.870> 38

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
because Red Death for example does 38

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.770 
because Red Death for example does 38
damage<00:03:48.800> headshots<00:03:49.250> this<00:03:49.880> weapon<00:03:50.330> does<00:03:50.540> that

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
damage headshots this weapon does that

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.960 
damage headshots this weapon does that
too<00:03:51.110> but<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:51.830> also<00:03:52.010> has<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.490> perk<00:03:52.700> we're

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
too but it also has the perk we're

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.550 
too but it also has the perk we're
landing<00:03:53.450> body<00:03:53.690> shots<00:03:53.959> it<00:03:54.110> does<00:03:54.260> more<00:03:54.500> damage

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
landing body shots it does more damage

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.280 
landing body shots it does more damage
so<00:03:55.280> you're<00:03:55.610> gonna<00:03:55.760> be<00:03:55.970> doing<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.690> most<00:03:56.959> damage

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
so you're gonna be doing the most damage

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.860 
so you're gonna be doing the most damage
of<00:03:57.590> any<00:03:57.650> pulse<00:03:58.010> rifle<00:03:58.400> I'm<00:03:58.490> pretty<00:03:58.880> sure<00:03:59.209> that

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
of any pulse rifle I'm pretty sure that

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.870 
of any pulse rifle I'm pretty sure that
with<00:04:00.080> that<00:04:00.260> damage<00:04:00.590> increase<00:04:01.220> that<00:04:01.459> damage

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
with that damage increase that damage

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.820 
with that damage increase that damage
buff<00:04:02.240> on<00:04:02.510> your<00:04:02.660> precision<00:04:02.930> shots<00:04:03.290> you're

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
buff on your precision shots you're

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.860 
buff on your precision shots you're
gonna<00:04:04.070> be<00:04:04.220> doing<00:04:04.490> the<00:04:04.640> most<00:04:04.940> damage<00:04:05.270> that<00:04:05.660> any

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
gonna be doing the most damage that any

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.350 
gonna be doing the most damage that any
pulse<00:04:06.200> rifle<00:04:06.709> can<00:04:07.010> do<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.610> if<00:04:07.940> you<00:04:08.030> decide<00:04:08.330> to

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
pulse rifle can do and if you decide to

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.540 
pulse rifle can do and if you decide to

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
run extended mags that's gonna be

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.130
