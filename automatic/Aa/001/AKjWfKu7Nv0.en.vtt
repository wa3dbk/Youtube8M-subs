00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
so in my test I was using an iPad 3 and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.350 
so in my test I was using an iPad 3 and
I<00:00:45.149> was<00:00:45.329> using<00:00:45.719> Autodesk<00:00:46.710> Sketchup<00:00:47.399> I've<00:00:48.059> used

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
I was using Autodesk Sketchup I've used

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.600 
I was using Autodesk Sketchup I've used
brushes<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.140> paint<00:00:49.410> before<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.280> takes<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
brushes for paint before and it takes a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.040 
brushes for paint before and it takes a
little<00:00:50.730> getting<00:00:50.820> used<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> using<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.690> brush<00:00:51.870> on

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
little getting used to using a brush on

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.959 
little getting used to using a brush on
a<00:00:52.140> touchscreen<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.920> once<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.579> kind<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.850> get

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
a touchscreen but once you kind of get

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.700 
a touchscreen but once you kind of get
the<00:00:54.090> hang<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.989> lot<00:00:55.170> more<00:00:55.379> intuitive

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the hang of it it's a lot more intuitive

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.200 
the hang of it it's a lot more intuitive
than<00:00:56.250> trying<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> use<00:00:56.850> your<00:00:57.210> finger<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:59.210> trying

than trying to use your finger or trying
to<00:01:00.270> use<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.870> rubber<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.500> standard<00:01:02.070> rubber<00:01:02.280> stylus

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
to use a rubber a standard rubber stylus

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.390 
to use a rubber a standard rubber stylus
like<00:01:03.449> there<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> back<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.470> sensu

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
like there is on the back of this sensu

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.550 
like there is on the back of this sensu
and<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.119> most<00:01:06.299> situations<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:07.020> works<00:01:07.229> really

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and in most situations it works really

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.859 
and in most situations it works really
well<00:01:07.680> once<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.640> get<00:01:08.880> your<00:01:09.060> brush<00:01:09.360> settings

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
well once you get your brush settings

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.810 
well once you get your brush settings
kind<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.170> dialed<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.280> practice<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
kind of dialed in and you practice a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.960 
kind of dialed in and you practice a
little<00:01:11.970> bit<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.439> would<00:01:14.310> definitely

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
little bit with it I would definitely

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.780 
little bit with it I would definitely
would<00:01:15.270> recommend<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.020> for<00:01:16.369> someone<00:01:17.369> who's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
would recommend it for someone who's

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.450 
would recommend it for someone who's

Pro is definitely the brush alone that

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.210 
Pro is definitely the brush alone that
is<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.060> big<00:01:48.689> feature<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.439> little<00:01:49.740> stylus

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
is the big feature on this little stylus

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.660 
is the big feature on this little stylus
and<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.880> works<00:01:51.090> really<00:01:51.450> well<00:01:51.600> with<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and it works really well with all the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.850 
and it works really well with all the
touch<00:01:53.880> interfaces<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.229> I've<00:01:55.350> used<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.829> with

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
touch interfaces that I've used it with

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.459 
touch interfaces that I've used it with
and<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.369> feels<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:57.060> lot<00:01:57.689> more<00:01:57.750> natural<00:01:57.899> than

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and it feels a lot more natural than

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.859 
and it feels a lot more natural than
using<00:01:58.860> typical<00:01:59.430> stylus

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
using typical stylus

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.289 
using typical stylus
another<00:02:01.590> pro<00:02:01.860> would<00:02:02.070> be<00:02:02.189> its<00:02:02.369> design<00:02:02.790> it's

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
another pro would be its design it's

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.319 
another pro would be its design it's
really<00:02:03.659> simple<00:02:04.100> not<00:02:05.100> much<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:05.969> it's

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
really simple not much to it but it's

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.300 
really simple not much to it but it's
pretty<00:02:06.780> elegant<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.920> got<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> good

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
pretty elegant and it's got a good

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.669 
pretty elegant and it's got a good
weight<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.879> if<00:02:09.209> you're<00:02:09.390> used<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.020> using<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
weight to it if you're used to using the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.580 
weight to it if you're used to using the
typical<00:02:11.099> brush<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:12.120> paint

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
typical brush to paint

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.510 
typical brush to paint
and<00:02:12.739> now<00:02:13.250> for<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.580> cons<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.900> stylus<00:02:15.319> is<00:02:15.500> okay

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
and now for the cons the stylus is okay

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.850 
and now for the cons the stylus is okay
but<00:02:17.330> it's<00:02:17.540> really<00:02:17.750> outshined<00:02:18.260> by<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.530> brush

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
but it's really outshined by the brush

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.820 
but it's really outshined by the brush
on<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:20.090> gets<00:02:20.510> by<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:21.410> have<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.680> do

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
on this and it gets by you have to do

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.800 
on this and it gets by you have to do
apply<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.160> little<00:02:22.550> bit<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.790> pressure<00:02:23.030> before<00:02:23.540> a

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
apply a little bit of pressure before a

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.199 
apply a little bit of pressure before a
lot<00:02:24.050> of<00:02:24.170> multi-touch<00:02:24.920> devices<00:02:25.340> will<00:02:25.730> sense<00:02:26.030> it

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
lot of multi-touch devices will sense it

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.900 
lot of multi-touch devices will sense it
but<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.380> still<00:02:27.650> works<00:02:27.830> good<00:02:28.099> so<00:02:28.670> there's<00:02:28.819> the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
but it still works good so there's the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.880 
but it still works good so there's the
sense<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.300> brush<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:29.720> stylus<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.410> bio<00:02:30.590> try<00:02:30.830> or

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
sense of brush and stylus a bio try or

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.089 
sense of brush and stylus a bio try or

eye I like using the brush a lot for any
of<00:02:37.760> those<00:02:37.880> art<00:02:38.120> programs<00:02:38.599> and<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.930> works<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.200> lot

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
of those art programs and it works a lot

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.600 
of those art programs and it works a lot
