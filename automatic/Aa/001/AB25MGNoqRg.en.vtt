is that when you're actually playing
inside<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> stadium<00:00:59.670> unlike<00:01:00.420> know<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.230> beta

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
inside the stadium unlike know the beta

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.979 
inside the stadium unlike know the beta
where<00:01:01.949> we're<00:01:02.100> playing<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.730> exact<00:01:03.300> map<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
where we're playing this exact map on a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.810 
where we're playing this exact map on a
spot<00:01:04.409> where<00:01:04.559> you're<00:01:04.739> playing<00:01:05.010> outside<00:01:05.640> you're

playing<00:01:06.060> inside<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> stadium<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.710> spawn

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
playing inside a stadium so the spawn

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.130 
playing inside a stadium so the spawn
points<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.700> inside<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.510> buildings<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
points are inside the buildings and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.929 
points are inside the buildings and
there's<00:01:10.380> only<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.920> many<00:01:11.100> ways<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.729> get

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
there's only so many ways you can get

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.690 
there's only so many ways you can get
inside<00:01:12.689> no<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> building<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.549> really

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
inside no the building so it is really

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.760 
inside no the building so it is really
turns<00:01:15.030> into<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.270> cat<00:01:15.570> fest<00:01:15.869> but<00:01:16.290> overall<00:01:16.590> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
turns into a cat fest but overall I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.010 
turns into a cat fest but overall I
would<00:01:16.950> say<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.430> pretty<00:01:17.610> cool<00:01:17.970> map<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.720> does

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
would say it's a pretty cool map it does

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.469 
would say it's a pretty cool map it does
have<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> lot<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.680> medium<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.640> close<00:01:20.880> quarter<00:01:21.210> no

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
have a lot of medium to close quarter no

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.710 
have a lot of medium to close quarter no
combat<00:01:22.049> scenarios<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.280> also<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.299> does<00:01:24.479> have

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
combat scenarios but also it does have

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.420 
combat scenarios but also it does have
these<00:01:24.900> long<00:01:25.080> range<00:01:25.380> scenarios<00:01:25.860> as<00:01:26.009> well<00:01:26.159> so

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
these long range scenarios as well so

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.370 
these long range scenarios as well so
it's<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.700> pretty<00:01:26.880> cool<00:01:27.119> map<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.170> hate

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
it's a pretty cool map but I just hate

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.780 
it's a pretty cool map but I just hate
how<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.890> bonds<00:01:29.130> are<00:01:29.340> inside<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
how all this bonds are inside the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.460 
how all this bonds are inside the
buildings<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.450> because<00:01:30.689> people<00:01:31.290> just

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
buildings like this because people just

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.039 
buildings like this because people just
can't<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:31.979> can't<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:33.000> anyways<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.750> wanted<00:01:33.990> to

there now so this lets me believe that
okay<00:03:26.600> they're<00:03:26.870> actually<00:03:27.380> at<00:03:27.530> least<00:03:27.769> looking

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
okay they're actually at least looking

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.520 
okay they're actually at least looking
into<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.580> so<00:03:28.940> we<00:03:29.150> may<00:03:29.330> actually<00:03:29.570> get<00:03:30.110> snow<00:03:30.500> so

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
into it so we may actually get snow so

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.860 
into it so we may actually get snow so
support<00:03:31.160> action<00:03:31.489> bus<00:03:31.700> which<00:03:32.030> will<00:03:32.269> be<00:03:32.450> great

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
support action bus which will be great

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.170 
support action bus which will be great
so<00:03:33.350> then<00:03:33.709> people<00:03:33.920> started<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.549> variety<00:03:34.940> said

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
so then people started to variety said

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.270 
so then people started to variety said
