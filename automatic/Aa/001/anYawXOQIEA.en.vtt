one<00:01:53.280> side<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:54.750> don't<00:01:55.049> do<00:01:55.259> both<00:01:55.500> wings

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
one side you don't do both wings

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.800 
one side you don't do both wings
otherwise<00:01:56.189> they<00:01:56.460> will<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:57.180> as<00:01:57.390> nimble

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
otherwise they will be just as nimble
