another member of our duo we're thinking

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.889 
another member of our duo we're thinking
that<00:00:42.860> why<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.100> earth<00:00:44.480> people<00:00:45.480> are<00:00:45.600> still

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that why on earth people are still

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.900 
that why on earth people are still
cutting<00:00:46.770> their<00:00:47.160> vinyl<00:00:47.579> records<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.719> needles

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
cutting their vinyl records with needles

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.700 
cutting their vinyl records with needles
because<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.270> these<00:00:51.420> modern<00:00:51.719> times<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.440> makes

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
because in these modern times it makes

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.220 
because in these modern times it makes
sense<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.280> use<00:00:53.489> more<00:00:53.850> modern<00:00:54.270> technology<00:00:54.690> with

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
sense to use more modern technology with

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.729 
sense to use more modern technology with
the<00:00:56.059> cutting<00:00:57.059> process<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> then<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.079> figured

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the cutting process so then we figured

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.880 
the cutting process so then we figured
out<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.309> could<00:01:02.340> replace<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.359> needle

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
out that we could replace the needle

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.969 
out that we could replace the needle
with<00:01:04.890> something<00:01:05.280> more<00:01:05.519> modern<00:01:06.770> which<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
with something more modern which is a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.710 
with something more modern which is a
bit<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.760> pocket<00:01:09.090> laser<00:01:09.770> but<00:01:10.770> much<00:01:11.100> much

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
bit like this pocket laser but much much

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:19.899 
bit like this pocket laser but much much
stronger<00:01:12.799> more<00:01:13.799> powerful<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.500> its

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
stronger more powerful so this is its

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.440 
stronger more powerful so this is its
groundbreaking<00:01:21.229> laser<00:01:22.229> cut<00:01:23.060> plexi<00:01:24.060> album

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
groundbreaking laser cut plexi album

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.130

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
with aids continuous loops so what does
