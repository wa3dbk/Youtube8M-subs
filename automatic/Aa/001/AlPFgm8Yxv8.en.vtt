 routine of the videos here the staff the name 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.329
 of today's blog is called surfing show 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.129
 exactly has nothing to do with keeping 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.730
 It is more beauty that let's let's then pro 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.410
 mod 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.570
 Good people, this motto that I think 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.070
 Nice because it helps a lot until 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.110
 for who wants to make an intro be 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.750
 something of boyne craft or a 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.380
 kinematic machine male who is male but 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.140
 because you do not know is short footage and etc. 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.820
 on the larger craft right guys this mold 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.130
 which basically adds you can give 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.200
 a f 5e you have a camera a bit 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.540
 more free of so much as of back 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.000
 you tighten f5 here and look at it 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.340
 squeezing and we can haja it's kind of 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.350
 adjusting the camera further is 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.570
 our character tighten the case to us 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.790
 You can return him to leave far it only 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.829
 you can see mountains and mountains 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.119
 the trees that are below the 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.070
 trees or roses 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.110
 we also have the jota here is that the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.850
 we can to the left and helium us 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.049
 can right then for example if the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.610
 people put a little more here 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.530
 just a little bit farther to the right 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.689
 and we did for example to do 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.280
 one type plus one intro I do not know any 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.299
 thing like for example walking here from 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.799
 good and here in front of me for example 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.360
 there on the left side acting in my 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.100
 front for some images maybe 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.229
 something like fusion 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.640
 That's a good thing, at least I thought 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.110
 this motto here a little bit more for the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.719
 left now not to be that 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.000
 Strange thing to push far away here. 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.060
 and we're going to go some far 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.849
 leave far 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.920
 beauty and let's kind of do it to the 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.410
 left or right 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.420
 Rba and right here and we're going 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.310
 so I was doing the really cool things 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.170
 for example let us so is 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.260
 closer to the left that touched 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.420
 run away from everything here I'll be honest 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.459
 for us it was the right foot here the O 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.160
 People can do business well. 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.620

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.360
