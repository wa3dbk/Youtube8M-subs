00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.190
 run about the application google dry maps 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.930
 so percent have perfectly integrated the 6th to the device 

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:13.709
 with a young peasant girl or 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.179
 using gps since gps integrated in its age it's magic 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.039
 always the same, we found the possibility to search for an address 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.529
 and then had also 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.060
 entrance 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.760
 my position then the way to 'the internet building rather sure it's a 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.250
 working very very well but a priori 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.250
 I have six authors and it was a man be his walker 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.900
 a memorable position can not determine 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.800
 then the world has to do the phone test actually out in the 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.480
 nature it does not eat much better 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.500
 then we had the opportunity to choose its mode 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.990
 so me this plan we want satellites as to traffic is reduced or 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.760
 and here we have a 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.780
 access to google street view 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.050
 so with the motion may 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.690
 even if we look for a marker somewhere just put his finger there 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.660
 or 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.900
 have a street view button 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.630
 and that's these rich areas in support suncor displayed a function style 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.820
 street view 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.530
 so there I can but I'm going to have 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.530
 access 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.530
 alain duran in 360 degrees and in all directions in photographic awakening 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.080
 I can also go into mode 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.800
 in landscape mode it's a bit longer because m 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.760
 the calculation 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.010
 deltell's landscape mode is a little bit higher in order to lift many 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.140
 details 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.990
 so there was a circulation would be the world also very fluid 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.510
 really great 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.390
 possibility of payment you play panoramic in water by esterra 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.090
 and then 6% the possibility of having 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.420
 directly on the screen 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.660
 that's it for the mode 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.660
 street view mode 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.260
 we had a chance to come back 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.200
 we vote more round p 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.009
 here to pass 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.439
 directly 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:11.309
 in this summer's mode
