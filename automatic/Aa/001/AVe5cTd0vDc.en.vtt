00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 then hello to everyone this my first 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.180
 video on facebook and I would like to talk to you 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.700
 of my echoes lose even just 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.719
 buy facebook as soon as they arrive 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.780
 at home 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:18.300
 you will have the receipt two receipts and then 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.100
 freedman in the event of factory errors 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.949
 or they break before the warranty 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.840
 to send them back and the nike yes 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.490
 will take to give you a new pair of 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.809
 equal shoes then these shoes 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.640
 cost 135 euros from the nike store not 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.989
 above the size 40 in fact these 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.020
 this year 42 and a half or so 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.360
 attentive 56 imperials to 40 colors though 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.579
 are there are many more colors you can 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.340
 customize only in disputes 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.899
 25 instead that 105 can be taken 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.590
 it only seems to me that there are two three 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.510
 models then it is a city thing it is in 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.000
 these shoes to school on their own fact 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.129
 unlike the old editions it is 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.880
 much much better even if you go to 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.590
 you should not play outdoors 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.960
 should become smooth however the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.500
 I always recommend playing with these 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.680
 shoes only indoors and use the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.689
 old basketball shoes play i 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.619
 campetti those you already have for two 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.180
 years 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.909
 oh yes for 23 years a lot 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.450
 important these shoes to know too 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.990
 for those who don't like it, they keep their feet 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.990
 it is pulled down tight and even if you do n't 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.820
 let's not have to tighten you don't 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.490
 tightens is not one squeezes so much because 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.590
 however thanks to these laces these and 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.020
 especially the guardians who are both 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.259
 share even if you do n't fasten for 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.380
 no tv the foot beat tight 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.899
 also the house 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.630
 to me and from a lot of comfort instead there are 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.100
 but the people who don't like it and 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.950
 so one thing to consider 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.950
 however unlike other shoes do not 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.280
 holds tight on the tip does not give any 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.280
 discomfort 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.790
 but I strongly advise you to buy 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.860
 so shoes because they are very comfortable and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.060
 if you want 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.830
 there is also a plus version that is yes 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.370
 together with these scraps you get a 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.709
 meaning that first under the one and thanks to 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.890
 these connected we are smartphone 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.799
 possibly an iphone an ipad or a 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.920
 ipod touch is a film where one is 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.319
 find for example to crush you can 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.049
 see the maximum elevation that followed 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:48.099
 in the jump or if you do something yes 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:50.799
 watch the race you can see or the 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.360
 resistance at maximum speed yes 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.660
 however , imports can change 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.730
 for example who wants to say you will receive 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.819
 definitely with settings set for 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.450
 thumbs up and you had to 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.400
 change in centimeters and precisely 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.850
 complete advice is rejected because a 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.549
 my opinion they are very comfortable and they say 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.030
 well that to tasks of the action but they are 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.030
 points of view 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:22.660
 it could also be but I don't have 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:25.569
 found there is city â€‹â€‹support 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:30.340
 support the leg and foot very much in the 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:32.210
 I jump to jump but I don't know if we tend 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.020
 that we are part 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.500
 even to most people, however, there is more if yes 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.910
 they wanted to take three maser shoes 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.650
 I also recommend the nike air massi for 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.100
 strength that I had never found 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.050
 however, tracing my friends is a lot 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.770
 well they are also cheaper too 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.240
 they are super just 80 euros 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.120
 thanks for viewing this 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.860
 my first video just commented though 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.860
 you have any request to make
