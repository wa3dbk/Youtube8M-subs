out and blow up a battery within 10
miles<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.709> buying<00:03:03.920> it

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
miles of buying it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.220

clean them to inspect but this buy

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.300 
clean them to inspect but this buy
cleaned<00:03:40.069> up<00:03:40.190> would<00:03:40.340> be<00:03:40.489> just<00:03:40.760> just<00:03:41.299> incredible

cleaned up would be just just incredible
just<00:03:43.310> like<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.609> bug<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.959> I've<00:03:45.470> only<00:03:45.620> had<00:03:45.859> one

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
just like the bug so I've only had one

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:55.089 
just like the bug so I've only had one
nicer<00:03:47.859> FLH<00:03:49.660> or<00:03:50.660> even<00:03:50.959> FL<00:03:51.319> under<00:03:51.739> 55<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:53.019> 57<00:03:54.099> era

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
nicer FLH or even FL under 55 to 57 era

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.710 
nicer FLH or even FL under 55 to 57 era
and<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.940> bug<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.419> the<00:03:57.790> was<00:03:58.790> on<00:03:59.329> a<00:03:59.389> par<00:03:59.690> with

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
and the bug and the was on a par with

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.720 
and the bug and the was on a par with
this<00:04:00.019> it's<00:04:00.290> just<00:04:00.349> a<00:04:00.560> bug<00:04:00.739> was<00:04:00.919> breathed<00:04:01.340> on<00:04:01.549> and

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
this it's just a bug was breathed on and

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.990 
this it's just a bug was breathed on and
this<00:04:01.790> is<00:04:02.000> not<00:04:02.180> in<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:03.310> 57<00:04:04.310> FF<00:04:04.549> some<00:04:04.819> of<00:04:04.910> you

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
this is not in the 57 FF some of you

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.509 
this is not in the 57 FF some of you
might<00:04:05.180> remember<00:04:05.299> the<00:04:05.900> black<00:04:06.349> one<00:04:06.590> was

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
might remember the black one was

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.150 
might remember the black one was
certainly<00:04:07.849> nicer<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.449> had<00:04:08.629> all<00:04:09.109> of<00:04:09.290> 1389

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
certainly nicer that had all of 1389

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.210 
certainly nicer that had all of 1389
miles<00:04:10.549> on<00:04:10.819> it<00:04:10.849> so<00:04:11.359> a<00:04:11.799> chance<00:04:12.799> of<00:04:12.949> me<00:04:13.040> finding

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
miles on it so a chance of me finding

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.980 
miles on it so a chance of me finding
another<00:04:13.459> one<00:04:13.639> of<00:04:13.760> those

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
another one of those

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.890 
another one of those
