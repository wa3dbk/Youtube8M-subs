something<00:00:27.779> goes<00:00:28.050> fairly<00:00:28.349> long<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> lot<00:00:29.550> of

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
something goes fairly long not a lot of

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.560 
something goes fairly long not a lot of
motion<00:00:29.970> if<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.179> need<00:00:30.359> it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
motion if I need it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.749 
motion if I need it
I<00:00:30.779> feel<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> go-to<00:00:32.460> ball

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
I feel this is going to be a go-to ball

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.979 
I feel this is going to be a go-to ball
in<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.000> lanes<00:00:33.180> when<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.450> front<00:00:33.600> start<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> go

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
in the lanes when the front start to go

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.690 
in the lanes when the front start to go
away<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.320> burn<00:00:34.500> up<00:00:34.530> I'm<00:00:35.040> still<00:00:35.340> gonna<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.640> able

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
away and burn up I'm still gonna be able

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.920 
away and burn up I'm still gonna be able
to<00:00:35.790> throw<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:35.969> ball<00:00:36.059> through<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.360> front<00:00:36.630> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
to throw the ball through the front and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.150 
to throw the ball through the front and
still<00:00:37.200> get<00:00:37.320> around<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.620> corner<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.070> I'm

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
still get around the corner so I'm

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.600 
still get around the corner so I'm
excited<00:00:38.430> about<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> hard<00:00:38.879> ball<00:00:40.280> as<00:00:41.280> well<00:00:41.579> I

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
excited about the hard ball as well I

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.190 
excited about the hard ball as well I
really<00:00:42.329> enjoyed<00:00:42.360> throwing<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.020> ball

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
really enjoyed throwing that ball

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.110 
really enjoyed throwing that ball
obviously<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> fresh<00:00:44.340> lane<00:00:44.550> condition<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
obviously on a fresh lane condition you

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.459 
obviously on a fresh lane condition you
might<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.390> little<00:00:45.539> difficulty<00:00:45.960> throwing

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
might have little difficulty throwing

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.709 
might have little difficulty throwing
this<00:00:46.559> ball<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:48.030> when<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.300> go

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
this ball but for you know when you go

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.880 
this ball but for you know when you go
performance<00:00:49.140> ball<00:00:49.320> you're<00:00:49.530> looking<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
performance ball you're looking for a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.680 
performance ball you're looking for a
little<00:00:50.010> more<00:00:50.100> friction<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> lane<00:00:51.000> or<00:00:51.480> beat

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
little more friction on the lane or beat

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.319 
little more friction on the lane or beat
up<00:00:51.809> surface<00:00:52.350> definitely<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> ball<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.550> go<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.730> we

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
up surface definitely a ball to go to we

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.959 
up surface definitely a ball to go to we
need<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.600> both<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.870> long<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.590> strong<00:00:55.969> what

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
need to both be long and strong what

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:57.860 
need to both be long and strong what
about<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.210> curveball

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
about the curveball

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.240 
about the curveball
well<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> curveball<00:00:58.559> again<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
well the curveball again with the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.849 
well the curveball again with the
stronger<00:00:59.489> covered<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.719> allowed<00:01:00.989> me<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
stronger covered it allowed me to have a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.529 
stronger covered it allowed me to have a
little<00:01:01.949> bit<00:01:02.100> wetter<00:01:02.309> angle<00:01:02.699> again<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.359> just

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
little bit wetter angle again and just

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.359 
little bit wetter angle again and just
like<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.809> says<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.140> curveball<00:01:04.350> made<00:01:05.100> around

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
like it says the curveball made around

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.789 
like it says the curveball made around
the<00:01:05.460> corner<00:01:05.760> much<00:01:06.240> much<00:01:06.450> better<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.990> again

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the corner much much better so again

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.810 
the corner much much better so again
when<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.010> angles<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> little<00:01:08.549> wider<00:01:08.700> I

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
when the angles get a little wider I

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.010 
when the angles get a little wider I
have<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.000> go<00:01:09.090> further<00:01:09.270> away<00:01:09.420> from<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> pocket

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
have to go further away from the pocket

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.390 
have to go further away from the pocket
it's<00:01:10.350> gonna<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> ball<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:11.100> go<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it's gonna be the ball I can go to a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.920 
it's gonna be the ball I can go to a
little<00:01:11.820> over<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.360> lane<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:12.750> more

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
little over the lane a little bit more

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.330 
little over the lane a little bit more
and<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.590> they're<00:01:13.740> around<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> corner<00:01:14.250> over

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
and so they're around the corner over

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.770 
and so they're around the corner over
they<00:01:14.549> kick<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.790> at<00:01:14.909> end<00:01:15.090> every<00:01:15.210> time<00:01:15.240> right

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
they kick up at end every time right

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.240 
they kick up at end every time right
right<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.259> with<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.470> light<00:01:16.650> bulb<00:01:16.920> shaped

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
right and with the light bulb shaped

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.120 
right and with the light bulb shaped
core<00:01:17.520> design<00:01:17.820> very<00:01:18.630> easy<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.170> drill<00:01:19.439> we've<00:01:19.979> had

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
core design very easy to drill we've had

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.130 
core design very easy to drill we've had
balls<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> past<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.210> core<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:21.990> it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
balls in the past with this core in it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.350 
balls in the past with this core in it
and<00:01:22.549> probably<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.670> my<00:01:23.820> favorite<00:01:24.180> core

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and probably one of my favorite core

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.630 
and probably one of my favorite core
design<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:24.780> well<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:24.960> Kelly's<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:26.009> really

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
design as well as Kelly's just really

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.160 
design as well as Kelly's just really
easy<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.150> about<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.630> both<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
easy to go about they both have a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.230 
easy to go about they both have a
perfect<00:01:28.590> spot<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.979> our<00:01:29.130> line<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.210> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
perfect spot in our line you know that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.969 
perfect spot in our line you know that
you<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.750> go<00:01:30.869> from<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.200> Falbo<00:01:31.380> line<00:01:31.710> down<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
you can go from the Falbo line down to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.800 
you can go from the Falbo line down to
the<00:01:32.100> bottom<00:01:32.400> line<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.790> still<00:01:33.240> inspect<00:01:33.630> great
