00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
if the touch screen was meant to be like

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.310 
if the touch screen was meant to be like
our<00:02:49.120> radar<00:02:49.570> or<00:02:49.780> something<00:02:50.080> on<00:02:50.200> your

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
controller but it's basically a

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.180 
controller but it's basically a
microsoft<00:02:52.630> taking<00:02:53.080> connect<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.740> being<00:02:54.010> like

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
microsoft taking connect and being like

seems<00:03:00.820> like<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:01.030> great<00:03:01.330> idea<00:03:01.360> or<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.440> could<00:03:02.590> be<00:03:02.620> a

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
seems like a great idea or it could be a

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.510 
seems like a great idea or it could be a
horrible<00:03:03.730> idea<00:03:03.930> now<00:03:04.930> basically<00:03:05.530> it's<00:03:05.950> taking

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
horrible idea now basically it's taking

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.320

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
a snowy map snow will be falling along

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.170 
a snowy map snow will be falling along
your<00:03:26.380> wall<00:03:26.530> on<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.770> projection<00:03:27.130> it's<00:03:27.880> pretty

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
your wall on a projection it's pretty

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.600 
your wall on a projection it's pretty
cool<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.660> provides<00:03:29.020> an<00:03:29.230> environment<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.190> I

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
cool it provides an environment and I

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.310 
cool it provides an environment and I
guess<00:03:30.820> it<00:03:30.970> really<00:03:31.060> sets<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.600> tone<00:03:31.630> for<00:03:31.840> games

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
guess it really sets the tone for games

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.340 
guess it really sets the tone for games
but<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.040> feel<00:03:33.340> like<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:34.300> maybe<00:03:34.540> saving<00:03:34.870> Thomas

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
but I feel like and maybe saving Thomas

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.740 
but I feel like and maybe saving Thomas
for<00:03:35.590> games<00:03:35.830> would<00:03:36.130> not<00:03:36.340> be<00:03:36.520> that<00:03:36.670> good<00:03:36.880> but

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
for games would not be that good but

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.360 
for games would not be that good but
third<00:03:38.740> party<00:03:39.250> could<00:03:39.610> take<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.830> idea<00:03:41.830> the<00:03:42.310> you

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
piece of junk it's really just like an

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.360 
piece of junk it's really just like an
okay<00:03:58.900> phone<00:03:59.860> piece<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.430> hardware<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:02.370> these

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
okay phone piece of hardware and these

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
than Apple ever thought it could be and

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.990
