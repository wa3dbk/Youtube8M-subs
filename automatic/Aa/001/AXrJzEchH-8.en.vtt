practice this possibly in front of a
mirror<00:03:26.569> I<00:03:26.780> mean<00:03:26.989> this<00:03:27.080> there's<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.500> lot<00:03:27.680> of<00:03:27.830> good

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
mirror I mean this there's a lot of good

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.229 
mirror I mean this there's a lot of good
shooters<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.430> practice<00:03:28.760> in<00:03:28.880> front<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.150> a

shooters that practice in front of a

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.970 
shooters that practice in front of a
mirror<00:03:29.420> so<00:03:29.540> they<00:03:29.750> can<00:03:29.900> critique<00:03:30.260> themselves

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
mirror so they can critique themselves

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.759 
mirror so they can critique themselves
they<00:03:31.040> can<00:03:31.190> look<00:03:31.310> at<00:03:31.430> their<00:03:31.549> technique<00:03:32.000> and

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
they can look at their technique and

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.009 
they can look at their technique and
kind<00:03:33.769> of<00:03:33.830> figure<00:03:34.040> things<00:03:34.250> out<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.610> way<00:03:34.790> so

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
kind of figure things out that way so

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.839 
kind of figure things out that way so
the<00:03:36.019> best<00:03:36.230> thing<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.440> do<00:03:36.680> is<00:03:37.250> get<00:03:37.519> in<00:03:37.580> front<00:03:37.730> of

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
the best thing to do is get in front of

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.350 
the best thing to do is get in front of
a<00:03:37.910> mirror<00:03:38.090> with<00:03:38.569> an<00:03:38.720> unloaded<00:03:39.349> gun<00:03:39.500> of<00:03:39.799> course

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
a mirror with an unloaded gun of course

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.390 
a mirror with an unloaded gun of course
always<00:03:41.360> keep<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.630> finger<00:03:41.930> off<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.080> trigger

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
always keep that finger off the trigger

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.199 
always keep that finger off the trigger
always<00:03:43.400> keep<00:03:43.580> it<00:03:43.700> pointed<00:03:43.940> in<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.090> safe

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
always keep it pointed in a safe

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.100 
always keep it pointed in a safe
direction<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:46.660> you're<00:03:47.660> going<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.810> have<00:03:47.959> that

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
direction so you're going to have that

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.820 
direction so you're going to have that
holster<00:03:49.360> where<00:03:50.360> you<00:03:50.510> want<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:50.989> that's
