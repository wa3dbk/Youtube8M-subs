00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.800
 The world of "Reminent" a dangerous place ... 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.680
 Especially for humans. 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.240
 During the countless years in which humans roamed the planet, civilizations grew and others fell. 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:38.620
 But only four were able to pass the time test: "Atlas", "Mastral", "Fakioo", "Phil". 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.620
 These four kingdoms were able to help with natural barriers and human stubbornness 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.760
 Demonstrate their ability to survive and survive. 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.920
 Each kingdom is governed by a council representing its people and needs. 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.960
 Then comes the army. While some kingdoms call members of their people to serve the Kingdom in time of need 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.820
 That some others make caution ... of the necessities. 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.280
 There are some who might prefer to risk and live outside the walls of the kingdoms. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.120
 Mobile travelers and small villages are not common. 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.720
 They tend to disappear and fade at night. 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.380
 Finally, fishermen's academies. Those institutions are their ultimate goal 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.920
 Education and training of the new generation of fishermen. The new generation defender who will live and die ... 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.020
 To defend the life they have long cherished. 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.700
 Yes ... The world of Rimant is definitely a dangerous place. 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.880
 But the four kingdoms stood as a beacon of hope ... as a safe haven away from the darkness that besieged it. 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.200
 Are the key to living creatures survive ... only if they stand and stay united.
