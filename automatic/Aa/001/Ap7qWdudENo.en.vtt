paint<00:02:13.170> looks<00:02:13.440> good<00:02:13.740> but<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.580> way<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
paint looks good but it's the way the

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.610 
paint looks good but it's the way the
skins<00:02:15.120> applied<00:02:15.480> there<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:16.020> like<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> deco

of<00:02:18.540> hard<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.750> see<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.440> know<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:19.830> person

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
of hard to see but you know in person

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.590 
of hard to see but you know in person
you<00:02:20.220> could<00:02:20.340> really<00:02:20.460> see<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.730> crackling<00:02:21.390> right

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
you could really see it crackling right

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.180 
you could really see it crackling right
there<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:22.050> don't<00:02:22.110> really<00:02:22.470> like<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
there and I don't really like that the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.559 
there and I don't really like that the
crackling<00:02:23.610> thing<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:23.970> happening<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
crackling thing is happening on the

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.600 
crackling thing is happening on the
forearms<00:02:25.020> too<00:02:25.350> but<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.770> hands<00:02:25.980> are<00:02:26.130> separate

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
forearms too but the hands are separate

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.640 
forearms too but the hands are separate
and<00:02:26.790> they're<00:02:26.970> actually<00:02:27.260> removable<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.620> you

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
and they're actually removable so you

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.380 
and they're actually removable so you
can<00:02:28.920> detach<00:02:29.220> these<00:02:29.730> kind<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.090> like<00:02:30.210> that

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
can detach these kind of like that

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.880 
can detach these kind of like that

like<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.629> moonstone<00:03:05.140> body<00:03:05.470> which<00:03:05.769> I'm<00:03:05.980> very

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
like the moonstone body which I'm very

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.530 
like the moonstone body which I'm very
happy<00:03:06.700> with<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.120> then<00:03:07.209> they<00:03:07.299> gave<00:03:07.420> her<00:03:07.510> to

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
happy with and then they gave her to

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.819 
happy with and then they gave her to
these<00:03:07.720> platform<00:03:08.140> shoes<00:03:08.379> which<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.650> think

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
these platform shoes which I think

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.349 
these platform shoes which I think
really<00:03:08.950> work<00:03:09.220> out<00:03:09.430> they<00:03:09.670> help<00:03:09.879> her<00:03:09.970> stand<00:03:10.180> in

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
really work out they help her stand in

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:11.729 
really work out they help her stand in
everything<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.810> like<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.079> Marvel<00:03:11.319> Legends<00:03:11.620> toy

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
this skull yeah I'm surprised the head

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.229 
this skull yeah I'm surprised the head
can<00:03:17.109> look<00:03:17.260> up<00:03:17.379> as<00:03:17.500> much<00:03:17.620> as<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:17.889> does<00:03:18.129> it<00:03:19.060> would

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
can look up as much as it does it would

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.759 
can look up as much as it does it would
be<00:03:19.389> able<00:03:19.569> to<00:03:19.629> go<00:03:19.720> further<00:03:19.959> back<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.290> wasn't

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
be able to go further back that wasn't

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:21.869 
be able to go further back that wasn't
for<00:03:20.889> this<00:03:20.980> sculpt<00:03:21.310> right<00:03:21.430> here<00:03:21.639> if<00:03:21.730> they'd

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
for this sculpt right here if they'd

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.970 
for this sculpt right here if they'd
used<00:03:21.909> a<00:03:22.239> softer<00:03:22.599> plastic<00:03:22.720> for<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.290> Mohawk<00:03:23.650> but

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
used a softer plastic for the Mohawk but

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.289 
used a softer plastic for the Mohawk but
that's<00:03:24.159> as<00:03:24.280> far<00:03:24.459> as<00:03:24.519> her<00:03:24.730> head<00:03:24.879> can<00:03:25.030> move<00:03:25.090> up

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
that's as far as her head can move up

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.300 
that's as far as her head can move up
which<00:03:25.690> actually<00:03:26.170> isn't<00:03:26.379> too<00:03:26.590> bad<00:03:26.920> her<00:03:27.159> head

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
which actually isn't too bad her head

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.309 
which actually isn't too bad her head
can<00:03:27.430> move<00:03:27.489> very<00:03:27.849> far<00:03:28.090> forward<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.599> it<00:03:28.959> rotates

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
can move very far forward and it rotates

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.410 
can move very far forward and it rotates
side<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.889> side<00:03:30.159> and<00:03:30.670> get<00:03:30.849> shoulders<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.239> move

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
side to side and get shoulders that move

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.030 
side to side and get shoulders that move
outward<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:31.930> can<00:03:32.049> rotate<00:03:32.170> them<00:03:32.440> forward<00:03:32.920> and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
outward you can rotate them forward and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.339 
outward you can rotate them forward and
she<00:03:33.489> has<00:03:33.670> an<00:03:33.849> elbow<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.450> bends<00:03:34.659> 90<00:03:35.049> degrees

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
she has an elbow that bends 90 degrees

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.629 
she has an elbow that bends 90 degrees
or<00:03:35.530> a<00:03:35.560> little<00:03:35.769> bit<00:03:35.920> more<00:03:36.129> than<00:03:36.280> that<00:03:36.400> that's

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
or a little bit more than that that's

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.009 
or a little bit more than that that's
cool<00:03:36.849> and<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.090> rotates<00:03:37.239> side<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.690> side<00:03:37.840> at<00:03:37.930> the

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
cool and it rotates side to side at the

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.539 
cool and it rotates side to side at the
elbow<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.440> wrist<00:03:38.470> moves<00:03:38.889> side<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.069> side<00:03:39.340> and

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
elbow the wrist moves side to side and

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.460 
elbow the wrist moves side to side and
they<00:03:39.670> hinge<00:03:39.909> up<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.209> down<00:03:40.359> I<00:03:40.569> really<00:03:41.109> like<00:03:41.290> the

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
they hinge up and down I really like the

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.020 
they hinge up and down I really like the
choice<00:03:41.739> of<00:03:41.949> hand<00:03:42.220> scopes<00:03:42.549> for<00:03:42.760> this<00:03:42.879> it

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
choice of hand scopes for this it

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.000 
choice of hand scopes for this it
actually<00:03:43.209> works<00:03:43.690> out<00:03:43.870> very<00:03:43.900> very<00:03:44.230> well<00:03:44.440> and

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
actually works out very very well and

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.500 
actually works out very very well and
she<00:03:45.099> has<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.250> great<00:03:45.519> diaphragm<00:03:46.090> joint<00:03:46.389> that

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510

moves<00:03:46.660> side<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:46.840> side<00:03:47.199> it<00:03:47.500> pivots<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:48.099> it<00:03:48.190> does

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
moves side to side it pivots and it does

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.189 
moves side to side it pivots and it does
crunch<00:03:48.639> forward<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.209> back<00:03:49.449> which<00:03:49.660> is<00:03:49.780> good<00:03:49.959> so

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
crunch forward and back which is good so

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.569 
crunch forward and back which is good so
you<00:03:50.260> can<00:03:50.349> really<00:03:50.650> make<00:03:50.859> her<00:03:50.949> fly<00:03:51.190> which<00:03:51.430> is
