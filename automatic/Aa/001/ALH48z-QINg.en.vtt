00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
jigsaw and then I ground on the grooves

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.609 
jigsaw and then I ground on the grooves
as<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> show<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:12.110> look<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> show<00:01:13.590> and

use my other camera like I say the HD

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.190 
use my other camera like I say the HD
one<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.220> takes<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.610> long<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.390> upload<00:01:27.840> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
one but it takes a long to upload and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
but I did pull up a lot of pictures from

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.999 
but I did pull up a lot of pictures from
the<00:01:41.790> website<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> show<00:01:42.750> stills<00:01:43.649> what<00:01:43.920> we

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
the website for the show stills what we

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
do now is make the handle smaller so cut

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.870 
do now is make the handle smaller so cut
along<00:01:51.420> there<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.490> depending<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> length

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
along there and depending on the length

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.209 
along there and depending on the length
of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> handle<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.780> did<00:01:55.409> get<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.890> from<00:01:56.070> my

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.679 
of the handle I did get this from my
dad's<00:01:56.460> house<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:57.570> antler<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.570> what<00:02:00.570> I'm<00:02:00.659> going

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
dad's house in antler and what I'm going

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.080

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
here so I'm all that in silicon and then

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.240 
here so I'm all that in silicon and then
that<00:02:07.350> way<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.469> don't<00:02:07.619> actually<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.129> use

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250

that way I don't actually have to use
this<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.179> cut<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.360> off<00:02:09.509> or<00:02:09.720> anything<00:02:09.899> I

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
this I have to cut it off or anything I

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.890 
this I have to cut it off or anything I
can<00:02:10.770> just<00:02:10.950> measure<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.660> mix<00:02:12.660> up<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.870> batch

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
can just measure it and mix up a batch

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.580 
can just measure it and mix up a batch
of<00:02:13.050> silica

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
of silica

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.610 
of silica
own<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.060> pop<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.239> in<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.780> maybe<00:02:16.349> tie<00:02:16.560> this

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
own and pop this in and maybe tie this

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.229 
own and pop this in and maybe tie this
off<00:02:16.920> somewhere<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.550> hangs<00:02:17.670> perfectly<00:02:17.910> in

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
off somewhere so it hangs perfectly in

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.540 
off somewhere so it hangs perfectly in
the<00:02:18.330> center<00:02:18.360> once<00:02:19.349> I<00:02:19.500> cares<00:02:19.830> i<00:02:20.069> could<00:02:20.250> pop<00:02:20.400> it

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
the center once I cares i could pop it

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.059 
the center once I cares i could pop it
out<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:22.220> cast<00:02:23.220> them<00:02:23.489> catch<00:02:24.120> them<00:02:24.269> with<00:02:24.390> uh<00:02:24.420> i

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
out and cast them catch them with uh i

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.670 
out and cast them catch them with uh i
use<00:02:26.069> or<00:02:26.400> i<00:02:26.430> usually<00:02:27.090> use<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:28.260> thing<00:02:28.440> called

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
when it when it sets it looks just like

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.770 
when it when it sets it looks just like
bone<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.950> that's<00:02:59.700> what<00:02:59.819> it<00:02:59.910> used<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.329> actually

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
bone and that's what it used to actually

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.330 
bone and that's what it used to actually
cast<00:03:01.049> on<00:03:01.260> my<00:03:01.379> iron<00:03:01.590> man<00:03:01.799> heads<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:03.420> armor

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
cast on my iron man heads the armor

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.289 
cast on my iron man heads the armor
pretty<00:03:05.340> much<00:03:05.430> anything<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.970> then<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.180> can

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
pretty much anything and then you can

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.240 
pretty much anything and then you can
paint<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.629> but<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:06.989> this<00:03:07.110> case<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.560> will<00:03:07.860> paint

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250

it or I could use leather dyes to look
like<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:13.079> make<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.319> look<00:03:13.410> like<00:03:13.470> bowling<00:03:14.390> I'm
