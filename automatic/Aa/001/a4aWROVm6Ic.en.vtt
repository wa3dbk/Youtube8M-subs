iPad Mini obviously after four is the
biggest<00:00:37.390> now<00:00:38.390> I<00:00:38.420> now<00:00:38.780> see<00:00:39.110> what<00:00:39.470> the

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
biggest now I now see what the

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.829 
biggest now I now see what the
difference<00:00:40.339> between<00:00:40.580> the<00:00:40.879> dimension<00:00:41.659> is

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
difference between the dimension is

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.630 
difference between the dimension is
exactly<00:00:42.799> as<00:00:43.330> we<00:00:44.330> can<00:00:44.510> see<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.710> height<00:00:46.010> of<00:00:46.280> I

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
exactly as we can see the height of I

two millimeters thinner and I care for
here<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.810> got<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:39.290> scare
