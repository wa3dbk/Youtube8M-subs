 today's video I want to show you how to power 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.670
 better handle the fatigue of your 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.099
 players that some people say that 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.290
 is very accused then I want to teach you 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.419
 how can they better manage 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.940
 the fatigue of all your staff 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.500
 in the matches set the first 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.030
 advice would be when the male has the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.830
 rival have the ball here we do not 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.380
 we must go running there in no 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.090
 case we are simply adding veis 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.740
 We are struggling holding on, we change 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.780
 player, we can stand peacefully 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.640
 there's no hurry we're just going 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.160
 holding on and you 'll see how tired of the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.050
 players when you get to reach 70 minute 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.190
 it's going to be drastically different than 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.289
 it is now that he put the button 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.699
 to run, it's worth, here you see, here comes the 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.410
 rival well here here we go 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.480
 pushing it crazy there so here we go 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.679
 running between playing all here go to what 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.390
 crazy because if not the rival can not 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.480
 make a goal so here yes until a 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.190
 half guys you see calmly we started 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.679
 struggling without any problem nor 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.940
 Hurry here once you get to that area of 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.620
 field then there is already when you 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.479
 we enter but while it is by the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.579
 midfield and more or less in that area 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.559
 for his field for his defense and all that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.940
 we do not press the button to run to 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.220
 absolutely nothing 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.660
 there's no need to give it and obviously if 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.550
 we're losing and we have to come back 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.440
 Well, it will have to be given that is very clear 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.880
 but as long as the rival has the 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.550
 value there's no need to go to press 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.310
 we simply hold position and 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.410
 simply we add to our rival 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.760
 without doing anything but gifts if 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.410
 we want to go to press you have to do it 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.670
 at specific moments and key by 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.990
 example now I want to decide 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.460
 press now it's worth because it's coming 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.200
 well and because the ball is in a 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.510
 moment when he could steal value worth 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.430
 so let's go with everyone there we will be 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.630
 as a double player you have seen that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.220
 the end basile pretty well of the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.560
 pressure to which it has been a failure 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.690
 absolute but if we want to go the pressure 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.610
 eye is important this we have to 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.020
 decide when it's not always worth it 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.000
 always if for example there is a moment in 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.290
 the party that stays a rejects what 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.640
 that the rival you see that can have some 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.470
 problem to get out with the ball was to 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.910
 attack then we press go with everything 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.040
 we lose double player if we want 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.229
 double pressure for everyone there like crazy 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.150
 but the important thing is to do this 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.800
 not only at peak times 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.290
 always not always because if we do 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.450
 this always our equipment will be exhausted and 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.580
 get to minute 70 and the players 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.929
 they are totally dead physically as well 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.069
 that if we want to press it has to be 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.540
 specific moments 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.819
 except that we lose, we want to 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.069
 go up the game but if that does not happen 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.090
 if we are winning or going 0-0 there is no 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.099
 what to do that so if we want 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.900
 press punctual moments and that 's it 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.730
 simply that that is the advice and for 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.819
 supposed to fight in the midfield without going 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.560
 to pressure but with the sprint button 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.379
 good to see that we have already reached 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.819
 75 minute and look at the fatigue of 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.079
 our players is obviously 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.579
 red because we have already reached a 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.010
 moment of the match that is very high 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.829
 but you are going to realize that the majority 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.079
 it's not in total black it's worth if we run 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.340
 all the game you ladis account that yes 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.750
 that is almost all black 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.639
 players do not have any resistance 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.620
 but here you are watching that look 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.569
 fix you schweinsteiger has even 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.819
 green line ribéry still has a minute 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.460
 61 and you still have to ribéry fixos 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.260
 lewandowski energy is also still 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.030
 here is Xabi Alonso who is the poor 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.000
 it's shattered mario götze even you 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.580
 is roben is already very tired but that 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.140
 already 185 but if you are covering 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.330
 continuously with all the players 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.620
 you will arrive at minute 70 and right now 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.110
 as you see my players right now in 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.280
 the minute 90 practically then these 70 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.690
 will be already so be careful with the 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.950
 short advice and also regarding this 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.480
 when you have played that is very 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.530
 tired as in robben for example and is 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.380
 such an important player 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.940
 computer schema not because one end 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.830
 it is very important then that we can 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.660
 change we can change and really 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.670
 it shows a lot a lot with being 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.230
 a cool player is a revolution 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.180
 total so it's important too 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.650
 do the changes well let's dedicate 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.960
 a little bit of time to make changes 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.220
 Even if it's lazy and say what laziness 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.360
 change but it is really noticeable 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.100
 is that it can be the difference in a 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.980
 match if we win or lose 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.019
 a very important changes that kind 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.330
 so let's say that winning a game in 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.860
 this country is quite complicated in the 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.510
 sense that it is quite realistic of 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.489
 tiredness issue you have to be careful 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.870
 do not jog with the players and 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.730
 when we see that a key player of 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.019
 our team is tired changing it and 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.640
 replace it with another that is totally 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.650
 really cool that the football change 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.930
 it shows a lot and will help you win 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.129
 more games still so I do not expect anything 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.930
 that you liked the video guys 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.489
 learn a little bit of this topic from 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.010
 tiredness that is very complex in this 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.449
 best and now a little hello and see you in 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.449
 the next video chao
