00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
just the end little bit here hanging

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.860 
just the end little bit here hanging
down<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:34.370> as<00:00:34.519> you<00:00:34.640> know<00:00:34.760> you're<00:00:35.449> asked<00:00:35.750> it

in<00:00:43.070> position<00:00:43.299> by<00:00:44.299> a<00:00:44.330> locator<00:00:45.140> all<00:00:45.920> that

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
in position by a locator all that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.680 
in position by a locator all that
happens<00:00:46.580> you<00:00:46.670> tell<00:00:46.850> your<00:00:47.059> Lord<00:00:47.210> character

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
happens you tell your Lord character

happens you tell your Lord character
through<00:00:48.199> here<00:00:48.500> this<00:00:49.159> particular<00:00:49.339> one<00:00:49.879> is<00:00:50.059> just

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
through here this particular one is just

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.719 
through here this particular one is just
a<00:00:50.780> connector<00:00:51.320> you<00:00:51.830> just<00:00:52.040> put<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.339> elastic

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
a connector you just put the elastic

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.920 
a connector you just put the elastic
through<00:00:53.080> tie<00:00:54.080> a<00:00:54.110> knot<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:55.150> as<00:00:56.150> you<00:00:56.239> can<00:00:56.390> see<00:00:56.629> it

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
through tie a knot and as you can see it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.649 
through tie a knot and as you can see it
traps<00:00:57.440> back<00:00:57.979> into<00:00:58.250> position<00:00:58.400> so<00:00:59.269> now<00:00:59.420> you've

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
traps back into position so now you've

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.020 
traps back into position so now you've
got<00:00:59.690> the<00:01:00.589> end<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:00.860> your<00:01:00.949> line<00:01:01.129> coming<00:01:01.549> out<00:01:01.760> of

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
got the end of your line coming out of

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.950 
got the end of your line coming out of
the<00:01:02.680> locator<00:01:03.680> this<00:01:04.549> then<00:01:04.850> just<00:01:05.360> nice<00:01:05.659> and

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
the locator this then just nice and

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.410 
the locator this then just nice and
neatly<00:01:06.140> fit<00:01:06.890> against<00:01:07.220> this<00:01:07.490> when<00:01:08.270> you'll

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
neatly fit against this when you'll

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.120 
neatly fit against this when you'll
under<00:01:08.750> large<00:01:08.960> fishing<00:01:09.380> you're<00:01:09.650> playing<00:01:09.920> it

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
under large fishing you're playing it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.950 
under large fishing you're playing it
and<00:01:10.280> you've<00:01:10.670> brought<00:01:10.910> your<00:01:11.150> topic<00:01:11.540> section

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
and you've brought your topic section

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.690 
and you've brought your topic section
down<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.350> you're<00:01:12.440> playing<00:01:12.620> the<00:01:12.890> fish<00:01:13.100> with

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
down and you're playing the fish with

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.700 
down and you're playing the fish with
this<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:14.480> can<00:01:14.630> actually<00:01:14.780> adjust<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.470> tension

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
this you can actually adjust the tension

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.180 
this you can actually adjust the tension
of<00:01:16.100> your<00:01:16.160> elastic<00:01:16.730> just<00:01:17.150> by<00:01:17.420> using<00:01:18.140> this<00:01:18.620> again

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
of your elastic just by using this again

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.010 
of your elastic just by using this again
whilst<00:01:19.610> you're<00:01:19.850> playing<00:01:19.880> if<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.840> fish<00:01:20.990> is

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
whilst you're playing if the fish is

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.260 
whilst you're playing if the fish is
running<00:01:21.500> you're<00:01:21.890> eating<00:01:22.250> letting<00:01:22.520> go<00:01:22.610> back<00:01:22.790> so

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
running you're eating letting go back so

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.300 
running you're eating letting go back so
you<00:01:23.330> can<00:01:23.450> talk<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:23.870> control<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.800> tension<00:01:25.040> of

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
you can talk to control the tension of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.550 
you can talk to control the tension of
the<00:01:25.430> elastic<00:01:25.850> all<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.360> time<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.110> these<00:01:27.260> pull

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
the elastic all the time so these pull

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.350 
the elastic all the time so these pull
of<00:01:27.680> bonds<00:01:27.830> are<00:01:28.130> really<00:01:28.670> really<00:01:28.940> popular<00:01:29.300> now

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
of bonds are really really popular now

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.770 
of bonds are really really popular now
and<00:01:29.990> on<00:01:30.140> top<00:01:30.350> of<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:31.400> get<00:01:31.640> two<00:01:32.150> different

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
and on top of that you get two different

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.860 
and on top of that you get two different
at<00:01:33.230> two<00:01:33.590> end<00:01:33.770> caps<00:01:33.860> just<00:01:34.340> in<00:01:35.000> case<00:01:35.270> that<00:01:35.659> one

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
at two end caps just in case that one

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.620 
at two end caps just in case that one
gets<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.200> little<00:01:36.290> warm<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:38.030> same<00:01:38.300> with<00:01:38.510> the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
gets a little warm and the same with the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.720 
gets a little warm and the same with the
other<00:01:38.780> end<00:01:38.810> or<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.409> lose<00:01:39.590> them<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.280> get<00:01:40.430> to

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
other end or you lose them you get to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.050 
other end or you lose them you get to
spur<00:01:41.150> end<00:01:41.390> caps<00:01:41.659> with<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.760> with<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:43.880> bunk

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
spur end caps with the with the bunk

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.550 
spur end caps with the with the bunk
itself<00:01:44.540> so<00:01:44.840> you've<00:01:44.960> got<00:01:45.110> two<00:01:45.290> end<00:01:45.470> caps

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
itself so you've got two end caps

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.500 
itself so you've got two end caps
Spurling<00:01:46.550> caps<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:48.700> elastic<00:01:49.700> connector

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
Spurling caps the elastic connector

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.340 
Spurling caps the elastic connector
which<00:01:50.630> acts<00:01:51.080> as<00:01:51.290> a<00:01:52.060> bunk<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.300> then<00:01:54.200> you've

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
which acts as a bunk and then you've

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.190 
which acts as a bunk and then you've
also<00:01:54.530> got<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.390> Bunge<00:01:56.690> itself<00:01:56.990> which

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
also got the the Bunge itself which

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.690 
also got the the Bunge itself which
again<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.590> can<00:01:57.620> cut<00:01:57.890> down<00:01:58.070> you<00:01:58.280> can<00:01:58.400> see<00:01:58.550> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
again you can cut down you can see the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.850 
again you can cut down you can see the
ridges<00:01:58.909> and<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.270> can<00:01:59.450> cut<00:01:59.630> down<00:01:59.659> to<00:02:00.380> fit<00:02:00.620> your

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
ridges and you can cut down to fit your

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.039 
ridges and you can cut down to fit your
particular<00:02:01.070> top<00:02:01.610> edge<00:02:01.790> set<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:02.540> a<00:02:02.570> great

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
particular top edge set so a great

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.750 
particular top edge set so a great
product<00:02:03.500> from<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.770> Grand<00:02:04.010> Slam<00:02:04.190> advanced<00:02:04.520> and
