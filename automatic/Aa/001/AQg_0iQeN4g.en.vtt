00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
circle no apparent problems and then the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.249 
circle no apparent problems and then the
boss<00:02:00.810> tactics<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.590> really<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.369> simple<00:02:02.820> as

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
boss tactics are really really simple as

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.950 
boss tactics are really really simple as
you<00:02:04.259> see<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.710> minute<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.689> other<00:02:06.869> ones

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
you see in a minute so the other ones

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.029 
you see in a minute so the other ones
that<00:02:07.710> are<00:02:07.799> possible<00:02:07.979> are<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:09.420> one<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that are possible are a one we have to

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.030 
that are possible are a one we have to

here<00:04:31.840> sped<00:04:32.440> up<00:04:32.590> some<00:04:32.800> of<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:32.980> screen<00:04:33.220> shaking

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
here sped up some of the screen shaking

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.220 
here sped up some of the screen shaking
stupidly<00:04:34.300> a<00:04:34.450> lot<00:04:34.720> horribly<00:04:35.170> but<00:04:35.890> basically

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
stupidly a lot horribly but basically

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.560 
stupidly a lot horribly but basically
well<00:04:38.230> I<00:04:38.260> I<00:04:38.410> never<00:04:38.890> Bank<00:04:39.130> pedal<00:04:39.490> so<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.150> was<00:04:40.510> just

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
well I I never Bank pedal so I was just

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.900 
well I I never Bank pedal so I was just
going<00:04:40.930> straight<00:04:41.650> thing<00:04:41.920> backwards<00:04:42.220> left<00:04:42.700> and

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
going straight thing backwards left and

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.270 
going straight thing backwards left and
right<00:04:43.060> there<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.510> kill<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.320> mob<00:04:44.470> you<00:04:44.980> need<00:04:45.160> to

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
right there to kill the mob you need to

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.730 
right there to kill the mob you need to
do<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.450> because<00:04:46.450> then<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.810> frees<00:04:47.020> up<00:04:47.200> a<00:04:47.350> gap

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
do that because then it frees up a gap

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.800 
do that because then it frees up a gap
in<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.190> circle<00:04:48.700> that<00:04:48.880> you<00:04:49.030> can<00:04:49.210> then<00:04:49.390> run<00:04:49.630> out

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
in the circle that you can then run out

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.100 
in the circle that you can then run out
of<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.350> oh<00:04:51.070> my<00:04:51.280> god<00:04:51.580> that<00:04:51.850> is<00:04:51.880> gonna<00:04:52.210> be<00:04:52.450> making

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
of and oh my god that is gonna be making

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.960 
of and oh my god that is gonna be making
you<00:04:53.200> dizzy<00:04:53.470> that<00:04:53.740> is<00:04:53.830> like<00:04:53.980> on<00:04:54.160> shrooms<00:04:54.669> or

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
you dizzy that is like on shrooms or

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.830 
you dizzy that is like on shrooms or
something<00:04:55.300> there<00:04:55.480> and<00:04:56.280> then<00:04:57.330> usually<00:04:58.330> you'll

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
something there and then usually you'll

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.440 
something there and then usually you'll
only<00:04:59.350> have<00:04:59.710> two<00:04:59.980> of<00:05:00.100> those<00:05:00.280> phases<00:05:00.669> but<00:05:01.120> as<00:05:01.300> I

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
only have two of those phases but as I

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.870 
only have two of those phases but as I
said<00:05:01.510> this<00:05:01.810> group<00:05:02.050> is<00:05:02.230> really<00:05:03.040> really<00:05:03.550> quite

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
said this group is really really quite

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.760 
said this group is really really quite
bad<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.540> so<00:05:05.320> we<00:05:05.890> end<00:05:06.100> up<00:05:06.310> with<00:05:06.340> a<00:05:06.580> third<00:05:06.910> phase

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
bad and so we end up with a third phase

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.680 
bad and so we end up with a third phase
during<00:05:08.770> which<00:05:08.890> the<00:05:09.160> boss<00:05:09.310> is<00:05:09.430> immune<00:05:09.820> so<00:05:10.270> you

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
during which the boss is immune so you

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.630 
during which the boss is immune so you
can't<00:05:10.960> really<00:05:11.050> a<00:05:11.290> bypass<00:05:12.220> it<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:14.740> there<00:05:15.430> we<00:05:15.520> go

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
can't really a bypass it and there we go

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.130 
can't really a bypass it and there we go
run<00:05:15.910> around<00:05:15.940> to<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.419> side<00:05:16.630> trying<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.050> avoid

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
run around to the side trying to avoid

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.780 
run around to the side trying to avoid
that<00:05:17.350> purple<00:05:17.770> crap<00:05:18.220> on<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.400> ground<00:05:18.580> because

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
that purple crap on the ground because

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.219

that's<00:05:19.240> not<00:05:19.419> tasty<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:20.020> then<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.770> boss<00:05:20.890> dies

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
that's not tasty and then the boss dies

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.560 
that's not tasty and then the boss dies
