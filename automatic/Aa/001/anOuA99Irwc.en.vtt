why i wanteth jirachi comes in and it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.990 
why i wanteth jirachi comes in and it
through<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> nice<00:01:16.950> bunch<00:01:17.189> which<00:01:17.340> does<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> ton

more<00:01:18.150> than<00:01:18.299> i<00:01:18.360> expected<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.960> because<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
more than i expected it to because it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.070

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
Breeland could take it out because you

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.650

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
switching at this turn but I don't Lee

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.509 
switching at this turn but I don't Lee
have<00:03:53.019> anything<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.440> take<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.709> sigh<00:03:54.010> shocked<00:03:54.370> at

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519

have anything to take a sigh shocked at
this<00:03:54.639> stage<00:03:54.880> so<00:03:55.750> I'm<00:03:56.109> pretty<00:03:56.620> much<00:03:56.920> forced<00:03:57.280> to

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
this stage so I'm pretty much forced to

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.390 
this stage so I'm pretty much forced to
leave<00:03:57.579> in<00:03:57.760> ferrothorn<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:59.280> that's<00:04:00.280> really

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
leave in ferrothorn and that's really

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.039 
leave in ferrothorn and that's really
all<00:04:00.519> I<00:04:00.639> got<00:04:00.819> so<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:01.060> go<00:04:01.180> first<00:04:01.359> I<00:04:01.540> just<00:04:01.780> out<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:01.989> my

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
all I got so I go first I just out of my

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.150 
all I got so I go first I just out of my
rocks<00:04:02.290> because<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:02.620> nothing<00:04:02.859> else<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.040> do

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
rocks because that nothing else to do

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.900 
rocks because that nothing else to do
anding<00:04:04.090> was<00:04:04.209> Magnezone<00:04:04.690> so<00:04:05.019> I'm<00:04:05.350> thinking<00:04:05.910> you

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
anding was Magnezone so I'm thinking you

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.699 
anding was Magnezone so I'm thinking you
know<00:04:07.060> I<00:04:07.359> don't<00:04:07.750> really<00:04:07.930> care<00:04:08.350> that<00:04:08.410> I'm

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
dies that turn and you know I'm kind of

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.290 
dies that turn and you know I'm kind of
in<00:05:39.270> it<00:05:39.419> I'm<00:05:39.719> kind<00:05:39.960> of<00:05:40.050> worst<00:05:40.259> off<00:05:40.469> but<00:05:40.800> you<00:05:40.830> know

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
in it I'm kind of worst off but you know

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.200 
in it I'm kind of worst off but you know
I<00:05:43.039> that's<00:05:44.039> what<00:05:44.250> I<00:05:44.279> went<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.610> it<00:05:44.759> for<00:05:44.969> any<00:05:45.089> way

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
I that's what I went to it for any way

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.930 
I that's what I went to it for any way
it's<00:05:45.690> meant<00:05:45.839> to<00:05:46.020> die<00:05:46.169> so<00:05:46.979> income<00:05:47.400> taxes<00:05:47.819> now

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
it's meant to die so income taxes now

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.189 
it's meant to die so income taxes now
and<00:05:48.089> I<00:05:48.150> could<00:05:48.270> either<00:05:48.360> taught<00:05:48.690> you<00:05:48.839> to<00:05:48.930> prevent

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
and I could either taught you to prevent

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.529 
and I could either taught you to prevent
it<00:05:49.259> from<00:05:49.319> dding<00:05:49.949> up<00:05:50.159> but<00:05:50.610> then<00:05:51.029> it<00:05:51.150> still<00:05:51.360> gets

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
it from dding up but then it still gets

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.320 
it from dding up but then it still gets
to<00:05:51.629> attack<00:05:51.779> me<00:05:52.229> so<00:05:52.259> I<00:05:52.849> figured<00:05:53.849> my<00:05:53.969> best<00:05:54.089> chance

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
to attack me so I figured my best chance

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.939 
to attack me so I figured my best chance
of<00:05:54.479> dealing<00:05:54.719> with<00:05:54.750> this<00:05:55.349> thing<00:05:55.560> would<00:05:55.680> be<00:05:55.800> to

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
of dealing with this thing would be to

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.589 
of dealing with this thing would be to
hit<00:05:56.279> it<00:05:56.339> with<00:05:56.430> a<00:05:56.460> brave<00:05:56.699> bird<00:05:56.969> while<00:05:57.330> it<00:05:57.479> Dee

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
hit it with a brave bird while it Dee

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:00.200 
hit it with a brave bird while it Dee
Dee's<00:05:57.779> up<00:05:57.960> and<00:05:58.199> then<00:05:58.500> when<00:05:59.430> I<00:05:59.460> die<00:05:59.580> go<00:05:59.879> to<00:05:59.939> Bree

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
Dee's up and then when I die go to Bree

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.640 
Dee's up and then when I die go to Bree
loom<00:06:00.360> and<00:06:00.509> hope<00:06:00.689> that<00:06:00.870> i<00:06:00.930> mock<00:06:01.110> punch<00:06:01.319> can<00:06:01.500> take

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
loom and hope that i mock punch can take

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.439 
loom and hope that i mock punch can take
it<00:06:01.740> out<00:06:01.830> I<00:06:01.949> think<00:06:02.370> a<00:06:02.550> mock<00:06:02.789> punch<00:06:03.060> can<00:06:03.300> do

around<00:06:04.439> fifty<00:06:05.009> percent<00:06:05.279> to<00:06:05.430> a<00:06:05.460> Haxorus<00:06:06.029> so

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:06.439 
around fifty percent to a Haxorus so

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:08.570 
around fifty percent to a Haxorus so
that's<00:06:07.439> the<00:06:07.589> game<00:06:07.770> plan<00:06:07.800> at<00:06:08.129> this<00:06:08.189> point<00:06:08.279> his
