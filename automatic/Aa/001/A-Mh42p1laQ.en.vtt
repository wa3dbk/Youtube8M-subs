stitch<00:01:10.270> now<00:01:11.270> we're<00:01:11.480> going<00:01:11.690> to<00:01:11.810> change<00:01:12.140> it<00:01:12.380> to

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
stitch now we're going to change it to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.610 
stitch now we're going to change it to
once<00:01:13.010> every<00:01:13.490> six<00:01:13.820> stitches<00:01:14.090> by<00:01:15.050> lifting<00:01:15.320> the

arm and moving it over one slot and

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.550 
arm and moving it over one slot and
we'll<00:01:19.610> tighten<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.030> screw<00:01:20.510> to<00:01:21.020> deepen<00:01:21.440> the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
we'll tighten the screw to deepen the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.210 
we'll tighten the screw to deepen the
pleats<00:01:22.840> feed<00:01:23.840> your<00:01:24.050> fabric<00:01:24.470> through<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.920> slit

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
pleats feed your fabric through the slit

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.820 
pleats feed your fabric through the slit
and<00:01:25.490> now<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.750> machine<00:01:27.200> makes<00:01:27.470> it<00:01:27.620> gather

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
and now the machine makes it gather

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.570 
and now the machine makes it gather
every<00:01:28.370> six<00:01:28.730> stitches<00:01:29.030> at<00:01:30.130> this<00:01:31.130> distance

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
every six stitches at this distance

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.790 
every six stitches at this distance
apart<00:01:32.090> these<00:01:32.480> would<00:01:32.780> be<00:01:32.930> considered<00:01:33.080> pleats

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
apart these would be considered pleats

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.680 
apart these would be considered pleats
rather<00:01:34.460> than<00:01:34.730> gathers<00:01:36.640> now<00:01:37.640> we'll<00:01:37.880> change<00:01:38.240> to

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
rather than gathers now we'll change to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.200 
rather than gathers now we'll change to
one<00:01:38.900> gather<00:01:39.230> every<00:01:39.680> twelve<00:01:40.040> stitches<00:01:40.310> by

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
one gather every twelve stitches by

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.200 
one gather every twelve stitches by
moving<00:01:41.510> this<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.410> third<00:01:42.650> slot<00:01:43.210> will

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
moving this to the third slot will

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.780 
moving this to the third slot will
deepen<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.660> gathers<00:01:45.080> even<00:01:45.440> more<00:01:45.710> by<00:01:46.340> turning

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
deepen the gathers even more by turning

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.350 
deepen the gathers even more by turning
the<00:01:46.910> screw<00:01:47.950> feed<00:01:48.950> your<00:01:49.130> fabric<00:01:49.550> into<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.030> slit

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
the screw feed your fabric into the slit

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.950 
the screw feed your fabric into the slit
and<00:01:50.540> begin<00:01:51.350> sewing<00:01:51.850> your<00:01:52.850> pleats<00:01:53.240> are<00:01:53.480> set

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
and begin sewing your pleats are set

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.100 
and begin sewing your pleats are set
even<00:01:54.260> further<00:01:54.770> apart
