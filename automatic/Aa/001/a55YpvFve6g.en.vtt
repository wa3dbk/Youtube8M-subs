00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.200
 and very good to all people here say more 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.050
 serious is a small video of my games 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.450
 of xbox as this may be 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.000
 little but it took me many hours 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.550
 here when I love these are 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.929
 some games the newest and the most 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.550
 preferred to say so except one 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.550
 but well, let's start 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.900
 resident evil 5 a great game what 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.100
 I just bought 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.290
 yesterday this great game I think that the here 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.980
 of this a guide 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.370
 with the same cross I'm not thinking 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.010
 I probably think I would in 2.0 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.070
 but no 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.930
 I do not like it either, because it's also 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.260
 very difficult would have to do this time 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.010
 what are the 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.710
 one in the morning here in mexico 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.769
 well this great game the truth is that 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.860
 I love how little the player 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:10.960
 I really like the story is very good 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.110
 detailed many things although I am of 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.810
 the others that had previously 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.649
 this is like 4 the enclosure and 4 for 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.649
 those who have played 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.700
 it's not like him neither the one nor the 2 and the 3 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.490
 nor the zero 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.770
 this was one of the great changes this 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.490
 it's like third person 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.490
 and well 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.409
 call of duty modern warfare 3 this is a 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.810
 My favorite game when not so much 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.270
 Well exactly my favorite but well 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.780
 it could be said that they are one of those who 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.850
 more game this how I see I am 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.060
 doing the campaign and nothing else I have 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.579
 like mission or mission two 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.890
 Cantillo or book I'm going up little 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.810
 a little bit because I like we get a 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.709
 video recorder for those who did not know 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.500
 I record on a VCR or is 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:11.140
 record it directly to the TV and the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.769
 tele I have to pass and then what he recorded 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.579
 I have to go to DVD with a disc and 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:24.129
 Well, I have to clean it and when it comes out 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:26.769
 from here this is the campaign is for you 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:31.239
 you think I did not like it that much good yes 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:33.069
 like but not so much I like this one 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.340
 it looks good expression what is 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.129
 with desire and the multiplayer because although 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.410
 the reappearances are crap this 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.190
 but because the game is very good 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.190
 following 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:52.060
 the credible edition of gears of war is my 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:55.580
 favorite my favorite my favorite is not 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.360
 the self I keep is not the 2 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.400
 I will definitely never change it 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:06.569
 is the voice software 100 my favorite me 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.700
 love this for the story for the 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.560
 campaign for the multiplayer although the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.489
 multiplayer sometimes stays too 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.010
 but my favorite favorite rather the 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:21.930
 gears of war were the first with the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.890
 which I played the xbox 360 a great pass 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.319
 I recommend this triple edition 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:33.550
 well it comes with him with gears of war 2 and 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.980
 apart from the ones from the 2 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.400
 I've had a great time of this though 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.610
 originally when I bought it I had 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.650
 I got the disc of the 2 decomposed so 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.260
 I had to go back to the purchase so that 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.260
 see how much I liked it and so good 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.710
 let's continue 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.200
 I'm this 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.290
 major league baseball although this is what 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.220
 I bought rather by filling do not fill 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.700
 This is what my dad bought. 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.530
 to play with him well then this 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.680
 I do not have it as a filler I will not create 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.330
 no gameplay of this game ever nor 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.330
 I miss the idea 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.900
 although my channel is dedicated only 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.530
 shooters reuters reuters percent of 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.650
 these crap crap 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.290
 but good the truth this for 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.250
 entertain you then when not to grow then 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.250
 I recommend it to you 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.889
 gears of war 3 this I bought it to egg 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.319
 egg I wanted to buy it yes yes or 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.680
 yes yes I do want to buy me what 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.960
 I bought how you do not have the dialogue 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.479
 where it says totally in Spanish so 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.700
 He is in English because mine comes 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.670
 of 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.790
 the north of the US so if not the 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.950
 costs that I have from there as I am 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.110
 very cord I had to buy it in 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.660
 line 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.450
 I liked 20 dollars and how cheap 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.940
 cheap that you find it in usa I said 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.880
 I do not care if he is not in Spanish I 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.840
 I just want to play it because those of 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.910
 when the campaign is too good 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.300
 the only sad thing that I put on was this 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.750
 way this monkey is a little monkey and he 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.440
 llama dominique santiago my regards 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.140
 for him I cried when he died 200 and he 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.230
 hey very corny or very sissy but here and 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:42.529
 now and when he died this but then 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:45.139
 well this is the story the mamona 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:48.889
 but well 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.990
 excellent graphics improved a lot 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.900
 after 22 although there appeared about three 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.630
 years later 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.570
 in 10 it was saved 2 exit in 2008 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.699
 this one comes out in 2011 had beta even 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:05.220
 a very good game I do not like 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.220
 lambent but this concludes the story 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:15.150
 manual shit just a lower sheet 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.150
 fuck what shit 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.470
 conchos 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.560
 and this even if he does not have this ass 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.380
 box 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.680
 well the original pasta is where it comes from 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.600
 the monkey is that of modern warfare2 as 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.849
 come 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.629
 focus 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:41.330
 good is modern warfare 2 does not have the 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:44.089
 box origin does not have the thing be 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:48.319
 original or simply because it is 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:51.979
 As you can see, the game stop is from the USA 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:54.499
 from the USA, how do I live there where the 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:57.040
 border is easy to cross and then 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:59.380
 you find very cheap everything 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.320
 as you see here is modern warfare 2 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:05.650
 I do not have the original because if it came to me 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:09.090
 I asked for it on the internet ebay 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:12.460
 it cost me 7 dollars this very good game 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:15.790
 it is sometimes I play it to get me out 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:18.370
 the nuclear and then I'm still under construction 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:21.220
 for taking bad I do not think to make a road 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:24.850
 to new simply is not because no 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.270
 struggled enough and it's only in 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:31.780
 kitchen that is champion but well 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:35.940
 good good here for last last sight 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.940
 my games are 7 

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:43.780
 I am selling and buying not knowing 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.780
 games and with that with the money 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:51.289
 almost in 5 modern warfare 3 know 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:53.569
 and here is gears of war 

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:59.539
 the credible major league baseball edition 

00:07:53.569 --> 00:08:01.400
 mlb 29 and use wordpress and modern warfare 

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:05.169
