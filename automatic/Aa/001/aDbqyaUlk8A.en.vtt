surfing usually involves the use of a

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
God made wave but there are places where

a<00:00:09.960> man-made<00:00:10.650> wave<00:00:10.950> can<00:00:11.250> provide<00:00:11.849> some<00:00:12.090> great

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
design of the ship and you can see a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.150 
design of the ship and you can see a
visible<00:00:45.360> wake<00:00:45.870> coming<00:00:46.680> from<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.950> ship

visible wake coming from that ship

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.380 
visible wake coming from that ship
that's<00:00:47.340> going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.670> make<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> surfable<00:00:48.270> wave

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
that's going to make a surfable wave

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.360 
that's going to make a surfable wave
somewhere<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.219> wave

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
somewhere and you can see the wave

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.889 
somewhere and you can see the wave
breaking<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> front<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.449> ship<00:00:51.750> if

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
breaking on the front of that ship if

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.360 
breaking on the front of that ship if
you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.170> see<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.649> then<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.039> know<00:00:53.160> you're

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you can see that then you know you're

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.130 
you can see that then you know you're
going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> surfable<00:00:54.210> wave<00:00:54.300> when<00:00:55.020> it

going to have a surfable wave when it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900 
going to have a surfable wave when it
reaches<00:00:55.469> shallow<00:00:55.649> water<00:00:56.010> some<00:00:56.520> other<00:00:56.670> things

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
reaches shallow water some other things

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.729 
reaches shallow water some other things
to<00:00:57.059> consider<00:00:57.149> also<00:00:57.570> are<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.050> tides<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.559> low

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
to consider also are the tides a low

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.740 
to consider also are the tides a low
tide<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.190> better<00:00:59.370> than<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> high<00:00:59.820> tide<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.420> wind

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
tide is better than a high tide and wind

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.200 
tide is better than a high tide and wind
a<00:01:01.020> light<00:01:01.260> wind<00:01:01.559> 5<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.399> 10<00:01:02.550> miles<00:01:02.699> per<00:01:02.850> hour<00:01:02.969> or

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
a light wind 5 to 10 miles per hour or

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.070 
a light wind 5 to 10 miles per hour or
less<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.600> ideal<00:01:05.390> once<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.479> find<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.750> good<00:01:06.780> spot

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
less is ideal once you find a good spot

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.140 
less is ideal once you find a good spot
get<00:01:07.470> your<00:01:07.619> boards<00:01:07.950> ready<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.880> helps<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
get your boards ready and it helps to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.850 
get your boards ready and it helps to
have<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.360> boat<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.840> has<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> fairly<00:01:10.260> low<00:01:10.500> side

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
have a boat that has a fairly low side

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.429 
have a boat that has a fairly low side
on<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.549> easy<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.000> jump<00:01:12.720> off<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.200> get

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
on it so it's easy to jump off and get

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
on it so it's easy to jump off and get
ready<00:01:13.619> for<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.950> wave<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.909> about<00:01:15.060> 50

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
ready for that wave and get about 50

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.060 
ready for that wave and get about 50
yards<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.750> front<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.950> get

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
yards in front of it so you can get

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.310 
yards in front of it so you can get
yourself<00:01:17.130> ready<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.689> give<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> boat<00:01:19.110> time

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
yourself ready and to give the boat time

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.570 
yourself ready and to give the boat time
to<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.619> out<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> way<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.400> wave

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
to get out of the way and this wave

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.399 
to get out of the way and this wave
actually<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:21.390> surfable<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> little

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
actually is not surfable it's a little

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.899 
actually is not surfable it's a little
bit<00:01:22.530> too<00:01:22.740> small<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.340> you'll<00:01:23.820> eventually

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
bit too small but you'll eventually

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.850 
bit too small but you'll eventually
catch<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.020> surfable<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.650> you'll<00:01:25.740> be

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
catch one that is surfable and you'll be

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:39.950 
catch one that is surfable and you'll be
surprised<00:01:26.250> how<00:01:26.400> long<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.090> serve

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.300 

now<00:01:40.960> one<00:01:41.140> thing<00:01:41.170> surprising<00:01:41.800> about<00:01:41.890> tanker

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
now one thing surprising about tanker

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.370 
now one thing surprising about tanker
surfing<00:01:42.700> is<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.120> wave<00:01:43.390> that<00:01:43.900> Kenny<00:01:44.200> and

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
surfing is the wave that Kenny and

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.840 
surfing is the wave that Kenny and
Ashley<00:01:44.680> are<00:01:44.800> riding<00:01:45.010> here<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.370> made<00:01:45.550> by<00:01:45.700> that

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
Ashley are riding here is made by that

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.670 
Ashley are riding here is made by that
ship<00:01:46.150> that's<00:01:46.420> way<00:01:46.600> off<00:01:46.630> in<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:46.990> distance<00:01:47.110> now

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
ship that's way off in the distance now

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.560 
ship that's way off in the distance now
and<00:01:48.070> that's<00:01:48.610> usually<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.970> case<00:01:49.210> because<00:01:49.450> it
