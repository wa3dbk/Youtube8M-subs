blame the cheap Chinese radio so as I

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.210 
blame the cheap Chinese radio so as I
discovered<00:03:14.240> a<00:03:14.300> week<00:03:14.450> ago<00:03:14.690> your<00:03:15.110> running<00:03:15.410> speed

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
discovered a week ago your running speed

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.430 
discovered a week ago your running speed

a<00:03:20.360> good<00:03:20.390> idea<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.750> stick<00:03:20.930> them<00:03:21.050> on<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.230> outside

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
a good idea to stick them on the outside

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:34.210 
a good idea to stick them on the outside
they<00:03:22.580> can<00:03:22.700> get<00:03:22.910> more<00:03:23.030> ear<00:03:32.980> what's<00:03:33.980> wrong<00:03:34.160> with

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
they can get more ear what's wrong with

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.120 
they can get more ear what's wrong with
it<00:03:34.400> in<00:03:35.140> those<00:03:36.140> divers

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
it in those divers

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.760 
it in those divers
all<00:03:37.370> right<00:03:37.640> disconnected<00:03:38.210> yeah<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.590> nice

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
all right disconnected yeah so it nice

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.500 
all right disconnected yeah so it nice
to<00:03:39.920> impact<00:03:40.220> not<00:03:40.640> actually<00:03:40.880> a<00:03:40.940> hell<00:03:41.240> of<00:03:41.270> a<00:03:41.360> lot

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
to impact not actually a hell of a lot

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.160 
to impact not actually a hell of a lot
or<00:03:41.570> all<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.810> plane<00:03:41.990> is<00:03:42.140> here<00:03:43.240> it<00:03:44.240> has<00:03:44.390> survived

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
or all the plane is here it has survived

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.960 
or all the plane is here it has survived
remarkably<00:03:45.530> intact<00:03:46.040> but<00:03:46.430> it's<00:03:46.550> putting<00:03:46.760> down

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
remarkably intact but it's putting down

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.690 
remarkably intact but it's putting down
the<00:03:47.120> front<00:03:47.300> here<00:03:47.620> at<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.830> one<00:03:49.400> point<00:03:49.550> of

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
the front here at the one point of

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.320 
the front here at the one point of
landing<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:51.850> composite<00:03:52.850> rod<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.270> the

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
landing and the composite rod and the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.210 
landing and the composite rod and the
tail<00:03:53.510> seems<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:53.960> come<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.710> little<00:03:54.800> bit<00:03:54.950> undone

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
tail seems to come a little bit undone

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.710 
tail seems to come a little bit undone
so<00:03:55.340> look<00:03:55.460> a<00:03:55.490> bit<00:03:55.640> more<00:03:55.760> twisting<00:03:56.330> in<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.480> title

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
so look a bit more twisting in the title

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.050 
so look a bit more twisting in the title
of<00:03:56.810> meteors<00:03:57.230> but<00:03:57.440> all<00:03:58.040> in<00:03:58.190> all<00:03:58.310> quite<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.850> tough

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
of meteors but all in all quite a tough

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:11.440 
of meteors but all in all quite a tough
plane<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.420> Skywalker<00:04:09.790> very<00:04:10.790> good<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.060> did<00:04:11.090> it

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
plane the Skywalker very good you did it

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.170 
plane the Skywalker very good you did it
first

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
first

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.810 
first
wouldn't<00:04:14.180> have<00:04:14.270> done<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.420> with<00:04:14.510> my<00:04:14.660> own
