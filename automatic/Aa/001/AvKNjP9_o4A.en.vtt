00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.199 
get 50 seconds of airtime in any Ford
car<00:00:13.960> so<00:00:14.170> you<00:00:14.260> can<00:00:14.410> do<00:00:14.530> this<00:00:14.679> as<00:00:14.950> a<00:00:14.980> racer<00:00:15.429> or<00:00:15.550> as

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
car so you can do this as a racer or as

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.579 
car so you can do this as a racer or as
a<00:00:16.239> cob<00:00:16.720> and<00:00:16.869> this<00:00:16.989> doesn't<00:00:17.169> mean<00:00:17.320> you<00:00:17.409> have<00:00:17.529> to

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:17.589 
a cob and this doesn't mean you have to

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.339 
a cob and this doesn't mean you have to
get<00:00:17.710> 50<00:00:18.220> consecutive<00:00:19.079> seconds<00:00:20.079> where<00:00:20.230> you're

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
get 50 consecutive seconds where you're

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:21.809 
get 50 consecutive seconds where you're
flying<00:00:20.529> through<00:00:20.769> the<00:00:20.890> air<00:00:20.919> for<00:00:21.159> 50<00:00:21.429> seconds

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:21.819 
flying through the air for 50 seconds

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:23.460 
flying through the air for 50 seconds
what<00:00:22.359> it<00:00:22.449> means<00:00:22.659> is<00:00:22.869> that<00:00:22.899> you<00:00:23.109> have<00:00:23.140> to<00:00:23.319> get<00:00:23.439> a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
what it means is that you have to get a

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.639 
what it means is that you have to get a
total<00:00:23.980> of<00:00:24.189> 50<00:00:24.640> seconds<00:00:25.089> of<00:00:25.179> the<00:00:25.269> air<00:00:25.419> time<00:00:25.749> in<00:00:25.989> a

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:26.649 
total of 50 seconds of the air time in a

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.509 
total of 50 seconds of the air time in a
Mustang<00:00:27.039> so<00:00:27.759> you<00:00:28.599> can<00:00:28.720> get<00:00:28.839> a<00:00:28.869> 5<00:00:29.140> second<00:00:29.619> jump

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
Mustang so you can get a 5 second jump

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.910 
Mustang so you can get a 5 second jump
or<00:00:31.179> a<00:00:31.239> 3<00:00:31.659> second<00:00:32.020> jump<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:32.380> it<00:00:32.439> all<00:00:32.590> kind<00:00:32.860> of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
or a 3 second jump and it all kind of

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.820 
or a 3 second jump and it all kind of
adds<00:00:33.130> up<00:00:33.430> to<00:00:33.460> be<00:00:33.730> that<00:00:33.940> 50<00:00:34.420> seconds<00:00:34.990> you<00:00:35.620> get<00:00:35.800> a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
adds up to be that 50 seconds you get a

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.890 
adds up to be that 50 seconds you get a
Mustang<00:00:36.280> relatively<00:00:36.910> early<00:00:36.940> as<00:00:37.300> a<00:00:37.330> racer<00:00:37.780> and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
Mustang relatively early as a racer and

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.810 
Mustang relatively early as a racer and
I<00:00:37.990> believe<00:00:38.170> you<00:00:38.290> get<00:00:38.440> this<00:00:38.740> particular<00:00:39.400> Shelby

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
I believe you get this particular Shelby

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.510 
I believe you get this particular Shelby
GT<00:00:40.210> at<00:00:40.690> around<00:00:40.990> level<00:00:41.170> 6<00:00:41.500> as<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.650> cop<00:00:41.920> so<00:00:42.430> you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
GT at around level 6 as a cop so you

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.560 
GT at around level 6 as a cop so you
can't<00:00:42.670> really<00:00:42.820> see<00:00:43.090> here<00:00:43.270> because<00:00:43.480> the

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
can't really see here because the

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.900 
can't really see here because the
quality<00:00:43.780> is<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.080> bit<00:00:44.410> lower<00:00:44.830> but<00:00:45.490> on<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.730> left

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
quality is a bit lower but on the left

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.880 
quality is a bit lower but on the left
is<00:00:46.060> Pacific<00:00:46.540> woods<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:47.080> on<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:47.500> right<00:00:47.680> is

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
is Pacific woods and on the right is

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.380 
is Pacific woods and on the right is
Riverside<00:00:48.370> Drive<00:00:48.550> so<00:00:48.820> I'm<00:00:48.910> right<00:00:49.120> in<00:00:49.270> between

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
Riverside Drive so I'm right in between

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.970 
Riverside Drive so I'm right in between
you<00:00:49.660> know<00:00:49.690> that's<00:00:49.900> where<00:00:50.080> this<00:00:50.260> location<00:00:50.830> is

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
you know that's where this location is

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.670 
you know that's where this location is
it's<00:00:51.490> this<00:00:51.760> kind<00:00:51.910> of<00:00:52.060> fancy<00:00:52.630> big<00:00:53.140> under

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
it's this kind of fancy big under

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.830 
it's this kind of fancy big under
construction<00:00:54.280> bridge<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:54.970> I<00:00:55.540> found<00:00:55.750> that

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
construction bridge and I found that

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.410 
construction bridge and I found that
this<00:00:55.960> was<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.260> best<00:00:56.410> place<00:00:56.710> to<00:00:56.950> get<00:00:57.220> those<00:00:57.579> 50

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
this was the best place to get those 50

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.569 
this was the best place to get those 50
seconds<00:00:58.810> of<00:00:58.930> airtime<00:00:59.170> as<00:00:59.680> you<00:01:00.250> can<00:01:00.340> see<00:01:00.430> I've

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
seconds of airtime as you can see I've

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.250 
seconds of airtime as you can see I've
got<00:01:00.700> about<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:00.940> two<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:01.450> a<00:01:01.510> half<00:01:01.600> three<00:01:01.750> second

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
got about a two and a half three second

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.169 
got about a two and a half three second
jump<00:01:02.500> there<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:02.920> so<00:01:03.310> like<00:01:03.460> I<00:01:03.550> said<00:01:03.610> that<00:01:03.910> kind

00:01:04.169 --> 00:01:04.179 
jump there and so like I said that kind

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:06.239 
jump there and so like I said that kind
of<00:01:04.239> contributes<00:01:04.929> to<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.350> 50<00:01:05.649> seconds<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.130> you

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:06.249 
of contributes to the 50 seconds and you

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:07.919 
of contributes to the 50 seconds and you
just<00:01:06.280> kind<00:01:06.579> of<00:01:06.609> do<00:01:06.819> this<00:01:07.030> until<00:01:07.509> you<00:01:07.689> reach

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:07.929 
just kind of do this until you reach

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:11.190 
just kind of do this until you reach
that<00:01:07.960> 50<00:01:08.619> second<00:01:09.069> total<00:01:09.520> of<00:01:09.759> jumps<00:01:10.539> you<00:01:10.929> will

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
that 50 second total of jumps you will

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.889 
that 50 second total of jumps you will
get<00:01:11.409> this<00:01:11.619> if<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:12.130> just<00:01:12.310> play<00:01:12.549> through<00:01:12.969> the

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
get this if you just play through the

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.050 
get this if you just play through the
the<00:01:14.259> missions<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.369> races<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:15.819> stuff

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
the missions and the races and stuff

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.279 
the missions and the races and stuff
you'll<00:01:16.270> just<00:01:16.420> get<00:01:16.509> it<00:01:16.630> eventually<00:01:16.990> by<00:01:17.049> going

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
you'll just get it eventually by going

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:18.510 
you'll just get it eventually by going
off<00:01:17.380> all<00:01:17.560> these<00:01:17.679> jumps<00:01:18.009> if<00:01:18.100> you're<00:01:18.219> driving<00:01:18.340> in

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
off all these jumps if you're driving in

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.010 
off all these jumps if you're driving in
a<00:01:18.579> Mustang<00:01:18.880> but<00:01:19.389> if<00:01:19.479> you<00:01:19.539> really<00:01:19.689> want<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:19.929> get

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
a Mustang but if you really want to get

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.179 
a Mustang but if you really want to get
this<00:01:20.079> trophy<00:01:20.259> now<00:01:20.530> like<00:01:20.710> I<00:01:20.799> did<00:01:20.950> if<00:01:21.069> you're

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
this trophy now like I did if you're

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.319 
this trophy now like I did if you're
just<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.399> trophy<00:01:21.700> hunter<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:21.999> want<00:01:22.179> to<00:01:22.240> get

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
just a trophy hunter you want to get

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:23.910 
just a trophy hunter you want to get
those<00:01:22.479> trophies<00:01:22.749> which<00:01:23.409> I<00:01:23.499> would<00:01:23.619> assume<00:01:23.679> you

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
those trophies which I would assume you

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.709 
those trophies which I would assume you
are<00:01:23.950> since<00:01:24.249> you're<00:01:24.369> watching<00:01:24.460> this<00:01:24.729> video<00:01:24.880> you

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
are since you're watching this video you

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.059 
are since you're watching this video you
just<00:01:25.990> want<00:01:26.109> to<00:01:26.139> get<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:26.350> now<00:01:26.469> this<00:01:26.829> is<00:01:26.979> probably

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069 
just want to get it now this is probably

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:28.440 
just want to get it now this is probably
the<00:01:27.280> best<00:01:27.340> place<00:01:27.549> to<00:01:27.639> do<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:27.969> you<00:01:28.060> switch<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.420> a

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
the best place to do it you switch to a

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.239 
the best place to do it you switch to a
Mustang<00:01:28.869> you<00:01:29.170> can<00:01:29.469> get<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.649> relatively<00:01:30.100> early

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:30.249 
Mustang you can get it relatively early

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:32.370 
Mustang you can get it relatively early
like<00:01:30.579> I<00:01:30.700> said<00:01:30.939> getting<00:01:31.719> your<00:01:31.810> Mustang<00:01:32.200> and

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
like I said getting your Mustang and

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.199 
like I said getting your Mustang and
just<00:01:32.560> kind<00:01:32.740> of<00:01:32.770> go<00:01:32.889> back<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.159> forth<00:01:33.700> on<00:01:33.939> this

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
just kind of go back and forth on this

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.480 
just kind of go back and forth on this
ramp<00:01:34.600> there's<00:01:35.109> two<00:01:35.499> really<00:01:35.799> big<00:01:35.979> ramps<00:01:36.369> here

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
ramp there's two really big ramps here

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.800 
ramp there's two really big ramps here
on<00:01:36.579> this<00:01:36.670> bridge<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.030> I<00:01:37.090> found<00:01:37.299> that<00:01:37.389> this<00:01:37.569> one

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
on this bridge and I found that this one

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.600 
on this bridge and I found that this one
and<00:01:37.929> I'm<00:01:38.020> going<00:01:38.170> off

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and I'm going off

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.820 
and I'm going off
now<00:01:38.790> was<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.690> one<00:01:39.870> that<00:01:39.990> was<00:01:40.170> better<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.680> air

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
now was the one that was better for air

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.770 
now was the one that was better for air
the<00:01:41.010> other<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.580> ahead<00:01:41.940> here<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> little

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the other one up ahead here is a little

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.510 
the other one up ahead here is a little
bit<00:01:42.900> smaller<00:01:43.260> that<00:01:43.470> one<00:01:43.620> on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.770> left<00:01:44.010> it's<00:01:44.460> a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
bit smaller that one on the left it's a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.590 
bit smaller that one on the left it's a
little<00:01:44.730> bit<00:01:44.820> small<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.150> you<00:01:45.210> don't<00:01:45.360> get<00:01:45.420> as

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
little bit small so you don't get as

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.960 
little bit small so you don't get as
much<00:01:45.750> air<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.280> just<00:01:47.280> gotta<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:47.760> back<00:01:47.940> and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
much air but just gotta go back and

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.420 
much air but just gotta go back and
forth<00:01:48.300> do<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.660> u-turn<00:01:48.870> like<00:01:49.260> this<00:01:49.500> keep<00:01:50.130> going

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
forth do a u-turn like this keep going

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.400 
forth do a u-turn like this keep going
up<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:50.760> off<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.120> ramps<00:01:51.600> use<00:01:51.780> some<00:01:51.930> moss<00:01:52.110> to

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
up and off the ramps use some moss to

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.290 
up and off the ramps use some moss to
get<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.710> bit<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.010> extra<00:01:53.100> boost<00:01:53.580> and<00:01:53.790> speed<00:01:54.090> as

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
get that bit of extra boost and speed as

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.140 
get that bit of extra boost and speed as
you<00:01:54.660> go<00:01:54.900> off<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.080> ramp<00:01:55.440> and<00:01:55.590> you'll<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.860> those

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
you go off the ramp and you'll get those

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.550 
you go off the ramp and you'll get those
generally<00:01:57.150> three<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.450> four<00:01:57.630> seconds<00:01:58.110> this

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
generally three to four seconds this

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.590 
generally three to four seconds this
trophy<00:01:58.860> took<00:01:59.130> me<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.280> under<00:01:59.760> five<00:02:00.180> minutes

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
trophy took me just under five minutes

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.540 
trophy took me just under five minutes
to<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.410> took<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:01.950> less<00:02:02.130> time<00:02:02.370> than<00:02:02.490> I

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
to get it took way less time than I

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.640 
to get it took way less time than I
thought<00:02:02.760> it<00:02:02.910> would<00:02:03.440> unfortunately<00:02:04.440> because

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
thought it would unfortunately because
