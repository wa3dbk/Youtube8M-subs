00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 clearly the team and I thank you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:11.429
 our fans for the support that 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.639
 that they are giving us would have been 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.639
 very beautifull 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.180
 and just to dedicate to our people not only to 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.380
 numerical level 700 800 600 fans that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.090
 there were turin 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.890
 a positive result because in one 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.579
 rival stage in an environment between 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.250
 hostile quotes have supported us for 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.040
 so the whole game of this 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.640
 surely we must take advantages 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.500
 because we have a huge fan base 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.570
 I think from fans it's understanding 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.420
 Malicious efforts results are not 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.910
 arrived the team's efforts and 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.149
 I believe this moment especially in 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.570
 this moment as we did 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.129
 on the other hand in the past season 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.170
 we must stay united, we must stay united 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.329
 if we want to overcome a delicate moment 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.270
 a difficult championship moment did 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.320
 the team two questions what is that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.220
 we must eliminate and what we must 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.659
 maintain and possibly improve 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.840
 what we have to eliminate seems to me 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.640
 quite clear enough we must 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.860
 certainly have more continuity in the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.369
 performance because it is still some 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.920
 Once we don't have this continuity 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.939
 to this consistency of 95 minutes really 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.890
 on the piece and more clarity in the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.630
 situations that we certainly have 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.369
 penalized to maintain and improve those 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.909
 values ​​that have allowed us 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.579
 I also repeat in the defeats of playing 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.880
 up to our opponents 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.680
 four consecutive defeats are 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.810
 enough are already too many 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.579
 quite even if it is true that 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.829
 in the last 4 defeats 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.360
 I think we met the three teams 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.049
 stronger than the league they are 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.390
 juventus inter and fiorentina because i believe 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.620
 that in the last two games 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.659
 my team has shown 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.989
 even in the defeats of having gods 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:19.860
 values ​​of values ​​to have character of 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.750
 have spirit and it is on this that 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.739
 especially right now we have to 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.019
 do a lot we have to build something 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.329
 and then I repeat now let's go meet 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.390
 cycle of matches from here the parking of 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.730
 Christmas is missing eight games a year 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.760
 last at the Christmas break on 22 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.620
 December we had 16 points in the standings 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.750
 16 points in the standings 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.120
 last year on the twelfth day 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.739
 in the championship we had ten points in 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.870
 Ranking 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.349
 we want to stop this 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.040
 hemorrhage we want from tomorrow to find again 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.040
 a positive result
