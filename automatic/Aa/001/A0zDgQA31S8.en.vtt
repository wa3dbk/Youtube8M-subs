elevator<00:02:57.540> there<00:02:57.810> may<00:02:57.900> be<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.050> few<00:02:58.230> other<00:02:58.470> ways

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
elevator there may be a few other ways

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.650 
elevator there may be a few other ways
obviously<00:02:58.890> they<00:02:59.250> haven't<00:02:59.370> explored<00:02:59.910> every

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
obviously they haven't explored every

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.810 
obviously they haven't explored every
different<00:03:01.050> way<00:03:01.140> within<00:03:01.350> this<00:03:01.650> map<00:03:01.950> we're

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
different way within this map we're

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.340 
different way within this map we're
going<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.030> be<00:03:03.120> having<00:03:03.210> new<00:03:03.540> builder<00:03:03.960> balls<00:03:04.140> but

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
going to be having new builder balls but

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.020 
going to be having new builder balls but
it<00:03:04.470> seems<00:03:04.770> from<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.280> article<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.910> it's

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
it seems from this article that it's

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.280 
it seems from this article that it's
going<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.210> be<00:03:06.330> harder<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.750> find<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.140> work

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
going to be harder to find the work

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.110 
going to be harder to find the work
benches<00:03:07.710> so<00:03:07.950> instead<00:03:08.460> of<00:03:08.520> having<00:03:08.700> loads<00:03:09.000> of

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
benches so instead of having loads of

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.660 
benches so instead of having loads of
work<00:03:09.270> benches<00:03:09.660> in<00:03:09.840> every<00:03:10.170> area<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:11.100> maybe<00:03:11.460> this

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
work benches in every area it maybe this

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.190 
work benches in every area it maybe this
time<00:03:11.850> it's<00:03:12.030> just<00:03:12.210> gonna<00:03:12.330> be<00:03:12.420> one<00:03:12.660> weight<00:03:12.900> bench

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
time it's just gonna be one weight bench

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.600 
time it's just gonna be one weight bench
and<00:03:13.410> it's<00:03:13.500> going<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.650> be<00:03:13.770> harder<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.130> get<00:03:14.430> to

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
and it's going to be harder to get to

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.590 
and it's going to be harder to get to
that<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.880> know<00:03:15.000> it's<00:03:15.210> going<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.450> actually

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
that you know it's going to actually

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.530 
that you know it's going to actually
make<00:03:15.780> people<00:03:16.200> want<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.860> do<00:03:17.070> because

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
make people want to do because

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.700 
make people want to do because
ingredient<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.660> felt<00:03:18.960> you<00:03:19.080> need<00:03:19.230> was<00:03:19.350> just<00:03:19.530> too

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
ingredient I felt you need was just too

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.380 
ingredient I felt you need was just too
easy<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.190> get<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.460> bill<00:03:20.670> doubles<00:03:20.970> anywhere

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
easy to get this bill doubles anywhere

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.000 
easy to get this bill doubles anywhere
every<00:03:21.570> part<00:03:21.840> was<00:03:21.990> it<00:03:22.140> wasn't<00:03:22.440> hard<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.680> get<00:03:22.890> and

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
every part was it wasn't hard to get and

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.650 
every part was it wasn't hard to get and
there<00:03:23.100> was<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.250> word<00:03:23.400> bench<00:03:23.640> right<00:03:24.180> next<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.630> it

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
there was a word bench right next to it

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.030 
there was a word bench right next to it
so<00:03:24.870> maybe<00:03:25.020> they've<00:03:25.260> made<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.590> bit<00:03:25.740> harder

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
so maybe they've made it a bit harder

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.800 
so maybe they've made it a bit harder
this<00:03:26.160> time<00:03:26.220> by<00:03:26.550> putting<00:03:26.880> only<00:03:27.150> one<00:03:27.330> workbench

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
this time by putting only one workbench

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.140 
this time by putting only one workbench
in<00:03:28.050> there<00:03:28.290> now<00:03:29.160> they<00:03:29.280> also<00:03:29.430> mentioned<00:03:29.820> these

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
in there now they also mentioned these

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.820 
in there now they also mentioned these
new<00:03:30.360> minions<00:03:30.810> I'm<00:03:30.960> so<00:03:31.140> glad<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.500> not<00:03:31.620> have<00:03:31.740> the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
new minions I'm so glad to not have the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.020 
new minions I'm so glad to not have the
denizens<00:03:32.280> but<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.550> know<00:03:32.670> they<00:03:32.820> weren't

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
denizens but you know they weren't

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.240 
denizens but you know they weren't
fondly<00:03:33.570> weren't<00:03:33.900> scary<00:03:34.260> in<00:03:34.500> any<00:03:34.740> way<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.130> was

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
fondly weren't scary in any way it was

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.920 
fondly weren't scary in any way it was
just<00:03:35.460> really<00:03:35.700> annoying<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.750> have

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
just really annoying so to have

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.120 
just really annoying so to have
something<00:03:37.320> you<00:03:37.410> was<00:03:37.560> really<00:03:37.860> really<00:03:38.010> awesome

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
something you was really really awesome

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.830 
something you was really really awesome
now<00:03:38.550> they've<00:03:38.700> actually<00:03:38.940> made<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.480> sound<00:03:39.780> like

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
now they've actually made it sound like

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.510 
now they've actually made it sound like
we're<00:03:40.350> going<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.530> be<00:03:40.620> having<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:40.950> Nova<00:03:41.280> sets

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
we're going to be having the Nova sets

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.550 
we're going to be having the Nova sets
crawlers<00:03:42.030> back<00:03:42.240> and<00:03:42.570> this<00:03:43.140> time<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.530> looks

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
crawlers back and this time it looks

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.990 
crawlers back and this time it looks
like<00:03:43.860> it's<00:03:44.040> going<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.220> be<00:03:44.340> more<00:03:44.520> than<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.820> boss

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
like it's going to be more than a boss

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.250 
like it's going to be more than a boss
you<00:03:45.150> know<00:03:45.180> I'm<00:03:45.300> not<00:03:45.420> definitely<00:03:45.870> saying<00:03:46.140> it's

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
you know I'm not definitely saying it's

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.540 
you know I'm not definitely saying it's
going<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.470> be<00:03:46.530> nervous<00:03:46.800> it's<00:03:46.950> cruise<00:03:47.310> because

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
going to be nervous it's cruise because

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.760 
going to be nervous it's cruise because
n<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.720> zombie<00:03:49.050> games<00:03:49.260> we<00:03:49.440> never<00:03:49.620> actually

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
n of the zombie games we never actually

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.650 
n of the zombie games we never actually
add<00:03:50.070> them<00:03:50.280> on<00:03:50.460> a<00:03:50.490> separate<00:03:51.000> round<00:03:51.240> the<00:03:51.450> only

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
add them on a separate round the only

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.480 
add them on a separate round the only
separate<00:03:52.050> around<00:03:52.290> like<00:03:52.560> all<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:53.160> minions

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
separate around like all the minions

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.450 
separate around like all the minions
we've<00:03:53.760> had<00:03:53.970> as<00:03:54.210> monkeys<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.870> dogs<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:56.280> like<00:03:56.430> I

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
we've had as monkeys and dogs so like I

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.620 
we've had as monkeys and dogs so like I
said<00:03:56.730> they've<00:03:56.910> put<00:03:57.090> they<00:03:57.210> only<00:03:57.360> come<00:03:57.510> at

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
said they've put they only come at

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.020 
said they've put they only come at
specific<00:03:58.140> waves<00:03:58.440> they<00:03:58.710> do<00:03:58.770> short<00:03:59.250> teleports

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
specific waves they do short teleports

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.730 
specific waves they do short teleports
around<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.510> environment<00:04:01.140> which<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.500> what<00:04:01.650> the

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
around the environment which is what the

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.190

Nova<00:04:02.010> 6<00:04:02.250> crawl<00:04:02.940> is<00:04:03.150> dead<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.660> they've<00:04:04.020> also

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
Nova 6 crawl is dead and they've also

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.960 
Nova 6 crawl is dead and they've also
put<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.800> look<00:04:04.980> similar<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.700> green

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
put that the look similar to the green

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.940 
put that the look similar to the green
Goblin's<00:04:06.480> or<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.930> denizens<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.620> again<00:04:07.830> I'm

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
Goblin's or the denizens and again I'm

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.050 
Goblin's or the denizens and again I'm
not<00:04:07.980> really<00:04:08.250> sure<00:04:08.400> if<00:04:08.610> I<00:04:08.790> could<00:04:08.940> actually

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
not really sure if I could actually

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.060 
not really sure if I could actually
compare<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.720> two<00:04:09.870> feel<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.320> same<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:10.980> it

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
compare the two feel the same but it

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.470 
compare the two feel the same but it
kind<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.280> sounds<00:04:11.550> like<00:04:11.610> a<00:04:11.730> nervous<00:04:11.970> it's<00:04:12.240> cool

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
kind of sounds like a nervous it's cool

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.910 
kind of sounds like a nervous it's cool
i'm<00:04:12.600> not<00:04:12.750> definitely<00:04:13.110> saying<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:13.470> is<00:04:13.620> if<00:04:13.830> you

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
i'm not definitely saying it is if you

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.800 
i'm not definitely saying it is if you
never<00:04:14.100> seen<00:04:14.400> one<00:04:14.520> there's<00:04:14.940> one<00:04:15.120> on<00:04:15.300> screen<00:04:15.660> now

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
never seen one there's one on screen now

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.300 
never seen one there's one on screen now
they<00:04:15.990> are<00:04:16.140> really<00:04:16.350> awesome<00:04:16.830> and<00:04:16.890> again<00:04:17.130> i

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
they are really awesome and again i

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.740 
they are really awesome and again i
guess<00:04:17.730> you<00:04:17.850> could<00:04:18.000> see<00:04:18.239> it's<00:04:18.450> going<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.690> be

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
guess you could see it's going to be

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.270 
guess you could see it's going to be
quite<00:04:18.870> easy<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.320> take<00:04:19.620> him<00:04:19.770> down<00:04:19.799> because<00:04:20.130> i

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
quite easy to take him down because i

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.099 
quite easy to take him down because i
think<00:04:20.400> they<00:04:20.670> would<00:04:20.850> be<00:04:20.910> on<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.630> earlier

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
think they would be on the earlier

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.740 
think they would be on the earlier

at<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.610> beginning<00:04:26.700> said<00:04:27.180> we<00:04:27.270> put

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
at the beginning said we put

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.030

our<00:04:27.650> eyes<00:04:27.889> the<00:04:28.160> name<00:04:28.520> may<00:04:28.820> induce<00:04:29.300> an<00:04:29.510> eye<00:04:29.720> roll

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040

but why is this important you know why

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.870 
but why is this important you know why
would<00:04:32.810> this<00:04:33.050> make<00:04:33.770> us<00:04:34.070> wonder<00:04:34.400> what<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:34.760> map

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
would this make us wonder what the map

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.159 
would this make us wonder what the map
name<00:04:35.060> is<00:04:35.210> we<00:04:35.330> already<00:04:35.449> know<00:04:35.690> what<00:04:35.840> this<00:04:36.020> says

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169

di Rhys we've been getting the hint all
along<00:05:25.039> that<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.580> maps<00:05:25.880> called<00:05:26.120> derives<00:05:26.510> but

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
along that the maps called derives but

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.240 
along that the maps called derives but
it<00:05:26.750> looks<00:05:26.960> like<00:05:27.050> them<00:05:27.260> the<00:05:27.590> gamer<00:05:27.889> is<00:05:28.039> going<00:05:28.190> to

be called Daraa and the maps going to be

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.529 
be called Daraa and the maps going to be
called<00:05:30.020> great<00:05:30.560> leap<00:05:30.830> forward<00:05:31.240> so<00:05:32.240> it<00:05:32.360> looks

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
called great leap forward so it looks

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.029 
called great leap forward so it looks
like<00:05:32.660> the<00:05:32.870> gamer<00:05:33.080> is<00:05:33.229> going<00:05:33.440> to<00:05:33.500> be<00:05:33.560> der<00:05:33.770> eyes
