00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.710
 it's spring if you want to grow aromatic plants 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.660
 in your apartment it is possible provided you respect certain rules 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.690
 it is on TV gas that reginald of the group unveils his vouchers 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.690
 tips for becoming a little gardener 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.839

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.710
 so do not be apprehensive about gardening it's not complicated 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.359
 gardening this technical breakdown 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.220
 e it's mostly a lot of players 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.680
 and that's a lot of common sense 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.339
 so that's what we'll try to see with today 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:35.460
 we can try to ask the question 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.230
 see under which conditions for men to push on the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.050
 Indices 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.640
 in his apartment it's not a good idea of â€‹â€‹kitschy mess but the 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.610
 beat outside your apartment on a window on a 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.100
 window sill on a hand 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.890
 fire on an underground parking 69 pleasure 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.600
 and after you have to measure the orientation 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.789
 among the aromatic plants we distinguish two sides the yamaha 6 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.250
 and the other on March 10 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.210
 and yet mix them up and dispose of the same way 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.130
 in the field of perennials and has a number that are in addition to 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.939
 tons of his ship 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.810
 like the time for the assault of savory to ogle rosemary 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.400
 automatically this before the 3 weeks 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.040
 we deserved very little water so automatically we will not allies 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.870
 with the past years which they are much more fragile plants and 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.430
 which raises l1 and a much more pronounced force of water 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.580
 and that also raises the fact of not being faced with the future we can 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.170
 find 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.200
 one an east-west orientation years per cent for herbaceous plants whereas 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.390
 we find going to submit to auckland suede for all they 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.740
 do not live the canes of the plantation how can we guarantee the 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.740
 longevity or aromatic plants 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.950
 we can have better real results in the field of 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.420
 deportation as for the depth behavior 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.510
 so we can not have one because we are within our reach we can 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.980
 do not have any because of poor maintenance 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.640
 by the planter it is better to roanne terracotta planters 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.979
 the growing planters and materials that will arrive and the root 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:02.730
 and fishing 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.590
 now we can very well have gardeners pretenders street is 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.240
 this team who are plastic to the residents a cape for us others 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.190
 materials 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.450
 therefore, it will have to be developed in such a way as to allow the planters 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.990
 to evolve quietly so we will finally put a duty we will put in 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.950
 take back elements for the textile 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.770
 which will allow to keep in moisture in any case it is necessary to put a 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.219
 material that drains so that the water does not stand up 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.480
 first because in fact the young roots are firefighters 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.899
 donald the plant ea if it drags in the water automatically it should 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.709
 and so savoie at the expense of the evolution of the plant a beautiful 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.639
 exhibition and a well-landscaped planter are therefore the first 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:45.690
 tips to follow 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.059
 but how to choose the soil 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.580
 Peru is the main 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.390
 we can have the most beautiful plants in the world if we will speak on behalf of groups 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.519
 Westerners do not do much 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.219
 so busy when you're in a gardener is first and foremost 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.189
 allow at least feed for six months because of 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.870
 even of rising of humidity there is no so of rossel has no 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.159
 mineral decomposition phenomenon of which career 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.019
 to order this year so we have to find a job 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.099
 drink that is sufficiently balanced 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.819
 naturally to allow men to live naturally this language 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:15.269
 pending 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.899
 the season and season 2 starts six months 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:21.670
 so apple what is important is to find in india 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.019
 for us it's because in our commercial soil environment 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.169
 it has the maximum of tournaments 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.600
 as proof the technical data sheet of the compost 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.769
 and we try to find a minimum of 20 25% back 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.840
 I did not know to read the datasheet or there is at least a dry way 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.889
 the geranium he needs this country will have so if you find questioned 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:41.619
 reversal 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:42.799
 you are good 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:43.809
 what consequences 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.309
 this call to daniel jarque 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:47.769
 lovers correct multiple mistakes 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.919

 these attacks why 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:01.979
 to one meter to do it 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.569
 that's all I can do about it 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:05.530
 not guilty 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.339
 it's a fact 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:09.959
 it's not so badly done in the end 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.189
 idactis that allows us both to improve rael international 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.030
 now you're talking about getting started in the health campaign 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.139
 haiti at the hearing yesterday
