00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
she only had a great game um was yeah I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.969 
she only had a great game um was yeah I
thought<00:01:55.049> he<00:01:55.170> had<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.500> good<00:01:55.710> game<00:01:55.799> for

thought he had a really good game for
Arsenal<00:01:56.399> um<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:57.240> think<00:01:58.140> he<00:01:58.439> was<00:01:58.560> one<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
Arsenal um I think he was one of the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.289 
Arsenal um I think he was one of the
liabilities<00:01:59.460> for<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> goal<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.030> was<00:02:00.119> scored

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299

against<00:02:00.659> them<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:01.110> uh<00:02:01.170> obviously<00:02:01.740> he<00:02:02.610> didn't

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
against them but uh obviously he didn't

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.480 
against them but uh obviously he didn't
