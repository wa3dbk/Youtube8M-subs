I've<00:00:35.370> created<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.789> really<00:00:36.059> weak<00:00:36.449> pathetic

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
I've created this really weak pathetic

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.919 
I've created this really weak pathetic
pop-up<00:00:37.710> menu<00:00:37.949> here<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.390> it's<00:00:39.390> important<00:00:39.839> to

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:39.929 
pop-up menu here and it's important to

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:42.709 
pop-up menu here and it's important to
know<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.769> background<00:00:41.159> is<00:00:41.789> not<00:00:42.030> significant<00:00:42.659> I

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
know the background is not significant I

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.720 
know the background is not significant I
would<00:00:42.870> love<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.230> add<00:00:43.379> some<00:00:43.649> pizzazz<00:00:43.829> here<00:00:44.609> as

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
would love to add some pizzazz here as

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.540 
would love to add some pizzazz here as
is<00:00:45.149> my<00:00:45.480> tendency<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.069> doesn't<00:00:47.370> matter

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
is my tendency but it doesn't matter

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.279 
is my tendency but it doesn't matter
because<00:00:47.789> all<00:00:48.149> that's<00:00:48.449> left<00:00:48.719> when<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.109> create

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
because all that's left when you create

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.130 
because all that's left when you create
a<00:00:49.319> pop-up<00:00:49.679> menu<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.339> pops<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.999> is<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
a pop-up menu and it pops up is the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.869 
a pop-up menu and it pops up is the
buttons<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:53.129> all<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.429> matters<00:00:53.729> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
buttons that's all that matters the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.119 
buttons that's all that matters the
background<00:00:54.389> is<00:00:54.629> irrelevant<00:00:54.929> and<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.829> card

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
background is irrelevant and on card

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.399 
background is irrelevant and on card
we'll<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.370> toss<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.789> away<00:00:56.999> so<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:57.929> our

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
we'll just toss it away so we have our

00:00:58.409 --> 00:00:59.930 
we'll just toss it away so we have our
pop-up<00:00:58.769> menu<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.219> let's<00:00:59.429> go<00:00:59.579> back<00:00:59.760> into

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.470 
time line so what's the deal where is
the<00:02:54.230> background<00:02:54.890> well<00:02:55.180> previewing<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.269> pop-up
