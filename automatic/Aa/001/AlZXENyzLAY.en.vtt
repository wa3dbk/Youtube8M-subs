there's more blue blue bits sticking out
from<00:00:48.600> his<00:00:48.840> armor<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:50.309> he<00:00:50.430> has<00:00:50.550> polished<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.120> up

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.590 
from his armor so he has polished it up
a<00:00:51.360> bit<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.719> here's<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.050> shot<00:00:52.739> from<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.100> series

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
a bit so here's a shot from this series

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.240 
a bit so here's a shot from this series
and<00:00:55.160> I<00:00:56.160> remember<00:00:57.000> he's<00:00:57.629> got<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:58.050> YouTube<00:00:58.469> has

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
and I remember he's got on YouTube has

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.700 
and I remember he's got on YouTube has
he<00:00:59.309> got<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> new<00:00:59.640> backpack<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
he got a new backpack and the the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.700 
he got a new backpack and the the
winning<00:01:02.309> Gundam<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.000> completely<00:01:03.780> redesigned

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
winning Gundam is completely redesigned

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.160 
winning Gundam is completely redesigned
so<00:01:05.040> maybe<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.760> one's<00:01:06.060> worth<00:01:06.299> getting<00:01:06.720> maybe

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
so maybe that one's worth getting maybe

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.920 
so maybe that one's worth getting maybe
a<00:01:07.320> backpack<00:01:07.740> though<00:01:08.150> mixed<00:01:09.150> feelings<00:01:09.630> about

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
a backpack though mixed feelings about

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.260 
a backpack though mixed feelings about
this<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:11.750> look<00:01:12.750> at<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.930> price<00:01:13.610> one<00:01:14.610> thousand

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
this one look at the price one thousand

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.420 
this one look at the price one thousand
eight<00:01:15.479> hundred<00:01:15.540> yen<00:01:16.200> vs.<00:01:16.740> was<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.250> one

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
eight hundred yen vs. was at one

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.950 
eight hundred yen vs. was at one
thousand<00:01:17.909> four<00:01:18.150> hundred<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.720> quite<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
thousand four hundred so it's quite a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.190 
thousand four hundred so it's quite a
bit<00:01:19.170> more<00:01:19.520> expensive<00:01:20.600> good<00:01:21.600> margin<00:01:22.049> more

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
bit more expensive good margin more

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.080 
bit more expensive good margin more

that's interesting it looks like the a
sprue<00:04:40.590> has<00:04:41.590> quite<00:04:42.190> a<00:04:42.220> lot<00:04:42.490> of<00:04:43.020> unused<00:04:44.040> parts

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
sprue has quite a lot of unused parts

I<00:05:05.470> would<00:05:05.680> say<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:05.950> this<00:05:06.100> is<00:05:06.400> exactly<00:05:06.610> the

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
I would say that this is exactly the

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.880 
I would say that this is exactly the
same<00:05:07.330> screw<00:05:07.870> as<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.910> original<00:05:10.570> build<00:05:11.230> burning

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
same screw as the original build burning

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.490 
same screw as the original build burning
is<00:05:12.310> ring<00:05:12.730> reuse<00:05:13.330> under<00:05:13.660> even<00:05:14.020> these<00:05:14.320> sprue<00:05:16.500> so

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
is ring reuse under even these sprue so

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.270 
is ring reuse under even these sprue so
white<00:05:17.830> one<00:05:18.310> yes<00:05:18.580> like<00:05:18.790> I<00:05:18.910> say<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.210> knuckles

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
white one yes like I say the knuckles

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.770 
white one yes like I say the knuckles
and<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.400> only<00:05:21.580> piece<00:05:21.820> that<00:05:22.000> isn't<00:05:22.180> used<00:05:22.570> as

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
and the only piece that isn't used as

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:33.120 
and the only piece that isn't used as
this<00:05:23.680> white<00:05:25.050> blanking<00:05:26.050> chest<00:05:26.590> piece<00:05:32.100> which<00:05:33.100> is

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
this white blanking chest piece which is

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.230 
this white blanking chest piece which is
here<00:05:33.640> so<00:05:34.000> this<00:05:34.470> be<00:05:35.470> sprue<00:05:35.830> is<00:05:36.040> an<00:05:36.160> entire<00:05:36.580> reuse

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
here so this be sprue is an entire reuse

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.550 
here so this be sprue is an entire reuse
as<00:05:37.510> well<00:05:37.750> what<00:05:37.960> about<00:05:38.140> them<00:05:38.410> see<00:05:40.110> that's<00:05:41.110> a<00:05:41.260> red

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
as well what about them see that's a red

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.080 
as well what about them see that's a red
one<00:05:42.660> so<00:05:43.660> yeah<00:05:43.810> the<00:05:43.990> red<00:05:44.170> sprue<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:44.680> C's<00:05:45.220> a<00:05:45.580> B

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
one so yeah the red sprue the C's a B

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.830 
one so yeah the red sprue the C's a B
and<00:05:46.240> C<00:05:46.510> they're<00:05:46.720> a<00:05:46.750> complete<00:05:47.170> reuse<00:05:47.800> of

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
and C they're a complete reuse of

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.990 
and C they're a complete reuse of
probably<00:05:49.840> these<00:05:50.110> poly<00:05:50.470> caps<00:05:50.830> are<00:05:51.070> of<00:05:51.340> reuse<00:05:51.760> as

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
probably these poly caps are of reuse as

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.900

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
identical to the build Verlin which I

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.590 
identical to the build Verlin which I
think<00:06:12.280> if<00:06:12.490> you<00:06:12.670> haven't<00:06:12.970> already<00:06:13.150> got<00:06:13.480> the

think if you haven't already got the

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.350 
think if you haven't already got the
build<00:06:13.810> burning<00:06:14.290> this<00:06:14.800> is<00:06:14.980> my<00:06:15.430> review

conclusion<00:06:17.020> already<00:06:17.350> if<00:06:17.590> you<00:06:17.620> haven't

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
conclusion already if you haven't

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.830 
conclusion already if you haven't
already<00:06:18.130> got<00:06:18.400> the<00:06:18.550> build<00:06:18.760> burning<00:06:19.240> original

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
already got the build burning original

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.910 
already got the build burning original
then<00:06:20.680> you<00:06:21.160> might<00:06:21.340> as<00:06:21.430> well<00:06:21.520> go<00:06:21.850> for<00:06:21.880> the<00:06:22.150> Tri

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:22.920 
then you might as well go for the Tri

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
burning a Gundam because they're pretty

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.280 
burning a Gundam because they're pretty
much<00:06:25.030> the<00:06:25.180> same<00:06:25.420> thing<00:06:25.660> apart<00:06:25.900> from<00:06:25.960> you<00:06:26.140> get

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
much the same thing apart from you get

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.480 
much the same thing apart from you get
extra<00:06:27.040> clear<00:06:27.780> sprues<00:06:28.780> more<00:06:29.260> clear<00:06:29.650> sprues<00:06:30.160> and

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
extra clear sprues more clear sprues and

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.890 
extra clear sprues more clear sprues and
the<00:06:31.420> major<00:06:32.370> change<00:06:33.370> is<00:06:33.730> this<00:06:34.060> white<00:06:34.450> sprue

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
the major change is this white sprue

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.720 
the major change is this white sprue
here<00:06:35.280> the<00:06:36.280> G<00:06:36.700> sprue<00:06:37.210> which<00:06:37.420> is<00:06:37.570> more<00:06:37.810> angular

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
here the G sprue which is more angular

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:45.510 
here the G sprue which is more angular
and<00:06:39.820> blocky<00:06:41.820> even<00:06:42.820> the<00:06:42.940> head<00:06:43.710> sculpt<00:06:44.710> that

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
and blocky even the head sculpt that

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.600 
and blocky even the head sculpt that
looks<00:06:45.960> exactly<00:06:46.960> the<00:06:47.590> same

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
looks exactly the same

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.310 
looks exactly the same
and<00:06:48.910> it's<00:06:49.090> definitely<00:06:49.630> using<00:06:50.020> the<00:06:50.110> same

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
and it's definitely using the same

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:57.590 
and it's definitely using the same
yellow<00:06:50.590> v<00:06:51.070> fin<00:06:51.400> sprues<00:06:52.270> as<00:06:52.600> well<00:06:53.250> mmm
