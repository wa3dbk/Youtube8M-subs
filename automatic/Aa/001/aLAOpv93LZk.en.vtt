00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
talking about this is I'm just like

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.650 
talking about this is I'm just like
talking<00:00:32.430> about<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.759> actual<00:00:32.910> map<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.510> comes

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
out with the mash-up pack and I think

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.880 
out with the mash-up pack and I think
that<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:35.460> they<00:00:35.579> made<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> scar<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> mash-up<00:00:36.510> pack

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
that if they made a scar a mash-up pack

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.440 
that if they made a scar a mash-up pack
what<00:00:37.890> would<00:00:38.010> be<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.340> cool<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.239> map

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
what would be really cool for the map

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.900 
what would be really cool for the map
that<00:00:39.780> they<00:00:40.020> they<00:00:40.710> sent<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.550> premade

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
that they they sent with it the premade

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.150 
that they they sent with it the premade
world<00:00:42.270> would<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.629> sort<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.110> on<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.739> pc

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the skyrim one if they made the world of

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.070 
the skyrim one if they made the world of
skyrim<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:11.580> only<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.970> couple<00:01:12.240> little<00:01:12.479> pounds

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the rohan like city i always forget what

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.130 
the rohan like city i always forget what
that<00:01:19.920> white<00:01:20.189> run<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.030> one<00:01:21.540> where<00:01:21.810> there's<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
that white run the one where there's the

dragon stone or whatever i don't know if

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.820 
dragon stone or whatever i don't know if
they<00:01:23.820> made<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:25.110> mountain<00:01:25.409> with

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
they made like that that mountain with

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.399 
they made like that that mountain with
that<00:01:25.979> place<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.460> top<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that place on top of it but for like the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.810 
that place on top of it but for like the
sky<00:01:28.650> arm<00:01:28.829> thing<00:01:29.130> i<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.280> it'd<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.549> cool<00:01:29.790> if

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
sky arm thing i think it'd be cool if

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.460 
sky arm thing i think it'd be cool if
they<00:01:30.030> actually<00:01:30.360> made<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.689> an<00:01:30.810> entire<00:01:31.140> map

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
they actually made like an entire map

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.350 
they actually made like an entire map
just<00:01:31.829> sort<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.159> altaria<00:01:32.700> islands<00:01:33.180> where

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
just sort of like altaria islands where

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.140 
just sort of like altaria islands where
it's<00:01:33.829> only<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> couple<00:01:35.070> actual<00:01:35.729> building

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
it's only a couple actual building

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.690 
it's only a couple actual building
things<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.840> towns<00:01:37.229> but<00:01:38.100> most<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.670> is

from the Mars station it turns into

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.139 
from the Mars station it turns into
normally<00:02:01.439> generated<00:02:01.590> world<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.460> don't<00:02:03.060> know

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
normally generated world I don't know

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.789 
normally generated world I don't know
all<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.570> stuff<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.229> I'm<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.500> bringing<00:02:04.649> it

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
all this stuff so I'm just bringing it

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.859 
all this stuff so I'm just bringing it
up<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.159> know<00:02:05.280> 4j<00:02:05.700> Studios<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.450> hear<00:02:06.750> this

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
up you know 4j Studios if you hear this

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.690 
up you know 4j Studios if you hear this
that'd<00:02:07.110> be<00:02:07.229> incredible<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.399> think

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
that'd be incredible but I think

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.520 
that'd be incredible but I think
something<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.360> Skyrim<00:02:09.929> adventure<00:02:10.349> map

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
something like a Skyrim adventure map

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.330 
something like a Skyrim adventure map
where<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:11.160> not

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
where it's not

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.040 
where it's not
early<00:02:11.519> an<00:02:11.580> adventure<00:02:11.940> map<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.660> know<00:02:12.780> how

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
early an adventure map but you know how

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.890 
early an adventure map but you know how
Jerry<00:02:13.709> islands<00:02:14.250> was<00:02:14.450> where<00:02:15.450> was<00:02:15.540> just<00:02:15.720> like<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
Jerry islands was where was just like a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.110 
Jerry islands was where was just like a
big<00:02:16.110> map<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.830> was<00:02:16.980> basically<00:02:17.220> like<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.550> survival

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
big map it was basically like a survival

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.580 
big map it was basically like a survival
map<00:02:18.300> but<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.690> would<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:18.989> look<00:02:19.170> really<00:02:19.410> cool

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
map but it would just look really cool

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.470 
map but it would just look really cool
and<00:02:19.769> if<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.010> replicated<00:02:20.730> some<00:02:21.030> Skyrim

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
and if you replicated some Skyrim

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.330 
and if you replicated some Skyrim
landscape<00:02:21.900> had<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.110> few<00:02:22.620> villages<00:02:22.980> somewhere

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
landscape had a few villages somewhere

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.920 
landscape had a few villages somewhere
but<00:02:23.519> if<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.849> whole<00:02:24.060> world<00:02:24.090> was<00:02:24.569> covered

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
but if the whole world was covered

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.869 
but if the whole world was covered
that'd<00:02:25.709> be<00:02:25.739> really<00:02:26.069> really<00:02:26.310> cool<00:02:26.640> for<00:02:26.819> a

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
that'd be really really cool for a

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.250 
that'd be really really cool for a
massive<00:02:27.090> hack<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.629> that's<00:02:27.750> something<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.140> I

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260
