and it comes on but so let's let's look

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.439 
and it comes on but so let's let's look
at<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.980> in<00:01:01.980> see<00:01:02.969> what's<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.270> box

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
at this one and in see what's in the box

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:20.640 
at this one and in see what's in the box
here

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.850 

pretty<00:01:21.650> simple<00:01:22.010> I<00:01:22.130> guess<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:24.590> know<00:01:24.740> as

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
pretty simple I guess and you know as

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.440 
pretty simple I guess and you know as
opposed<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.340> GPS<00:01:25.700> watches<00:01:26.120> and<00:01:26.240> all<00:01:26.300> that

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
opposed to the GPS watches and all that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.880 
opposed to the GPS watches and all that
yeah<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:26.810> don't<00:01:26.930> have<00:01:27.110> all<00:01:27.260> that<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.440> know

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
yeah you don't have all that you know

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.400 
yeah you don't have all that you know
ups<00:01:28.510> connections<00:01:29.510> and<00:01:29.600> stuff<00:01:29.690> like<00:01:29.900> that<00:01:30.080> so

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
ups connections and stuff like that so

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.340 
ups connections and stuff like that so
that's<00:01:32.650> what<00:01:33.650> it<00:01:33.740> looks<00:01:34.160> like

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
that's what it looks like

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.900 
that's what it looks like

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
from my run first off the chronograph on

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.050 
from my run first off the chronograph on
this<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:29.780> really<00:02:30.470> huge

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
this is really huge

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.560 
this is really huge
I<00:02:33.310> love<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.430> chronograph<00:02:34.820> it's<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.060> very<00:02:35.270> large

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
I love the chronograph it's a very large

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:44.080 
I love the chronograph it's a very large
display<00:02:36.820> when<00:02:37.820> you're<00:02:37.940> running<00:02:38.120> so

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.300 

mmm<00:02:44.900> that's<00:02:45.050> what<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.260> looks<00:02:45.380> like<00:02:45.620> when

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
mmm that's what it looks like when

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.309 
mmm that's what it looks like when
you're<00:02:46.370> running<00:02:46.520> I<00:02:46.760> can<00:02:47.000> see<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.239> but<00:02:47.540> it's

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
you're running I can see that but it's

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.130 
you're running I can see that but it's
typical<00:02:48.620> photograph<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:50.540> know<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:50.720> stop<00:02:50.959> it

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
typical photograph you know you stop it

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.990 
typical photograph you know you stop it
you<00:02:51.170> have<00:02:51.319> your<00:02:51.440> lap<00:02:51.590> time<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.640> store<00:02:52.849> is<00:02:52.940> up

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
you have your lap time the store is up

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.900 
you have your lap time the store is up
to<00:02:53.090> 100<00:02:53.390> laps<00:02:53.599> and<00:02:54.110> your<00:02:54.620> workouts<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.730> the

things<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:03.110> can<00:03:03.230> also<00:03:03.380> adjust<00:03:03.709> the

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
things that and you can also adjust the

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.160 
things that and you can also adjust the
display<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:05.300> that<00:03:05.330> when<00:03:05.599> you<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:05.930> can<00:03:06.050> also

have the chronograph and the time

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.449 
have the chronograph and the time
showing<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.319> same<00:03:09.500> time<00:03:09.709> which<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.040> like<00:03:10.220> when

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
showing the same time which I like when

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.300 
showing the same time which I like when
I'm<00:03:10.550> working<00:03:10.849> out<00:03:11.000> because<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:12.739> like<00:03:13.069> to<00:03:13.190> know

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
I'm working out because I like to know

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.800 
I'm working out because I like to know
how<00:03:13.459> long<00:03:13.519> I've<00:03:13.790> been<00:03:13.819> working<00:03:14.209> out<00:03:14.300> and<00:03:14.569> what

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
how long I've been working out and what

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.479 
how long I've been working out and what
time<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.290> because<00:03:15.739> I<00:03:15.769> work<00:03:15.950> out<00:03:16.100> over<00:03:16.190> lunch

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
time it is because I work out over lunch

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.550 
time it is because I work out over lunch
so<00:03:16.670> I<00:03:16.730> need<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:16.970> know<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.959> know<00:03:18.080> kind<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.380> what

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
so I need to know you know kind of what

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.930 
so I need to know you know kind of what
time<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:18.799> is<00:03:18.890> so<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.100> need<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.370> get<00:03:19.459> back<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.760> work

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
time it is so I need to get back to work

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.750 
time it is so I need to get back to work
but<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:21.410> best<00:03:21.650> thing<00:03:21.890> about<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.640> I

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
but the best thing about this that I

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.030 
but the best thing about this that I
figured<00:03:23.420> out<00:03:23.510> once<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.900> got<00:03:24.049> back<00:03:24.290> is<00:03:24.560> exactly

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
figured out once I got back is exactly

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.449 
figured out once I got back is exactly
what<00:03:25.220> I've<00:03:25.310> been<00:03:25.340> looking<00:03:25.549> for<00:03:25.700> is<00:03:26.269> it's<00:03:26.600> got<00:03:26.780> a

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.330 

interval<00:03:31.459> timer<00:03:31.790> on<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.239> so<00:03:33.099> because<00:03:34.099> a<00:03:34.130> lot<00:03:34.310> of

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
interval timer on it so because a lot of

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.030 
interval timer on it so because a lot of
my<00:03:35.140> workouts<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.500> know<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.620> have<00:03:36.769> thirty

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
my workouts you know I have thirty

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.500 
my workouts you know I have thirty
minutes<00:03:37.340> or<00:03:37.430> thirty<00:03:37.730> second<00:03:38.000> intervals<00:03:38.030> while

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
minutes or thirty second intervals while

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.500 
minutes or thirty second intervals while
jump<00:03:38.780> rope<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.140> then<00:03:39.260> I'll<00:03:39.319> do<00:03:39.410> push-ups<00:03:39.590> and

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
jump rope and then I'll do push-ups and

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.640 
jump rope and then I'll do push-ups and
and<00:03:41.510> use<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:41.870> just<00:03:42.080> have<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.349> watch<00:03:42.530> a

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
and use I just have to you to watch a

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
and use I just have to you to watch a
clock<00:03:42.860> all<00:03:43.130> right<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.640> polar<00:03:45.190> ff7<00:03:46.190> I<00:03:46.430> use<00:03:46.580> I

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
clock all right the polar ff7 I use I

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.039 
clock all right the polar ff7 I use I
just<00:03:46.700> kind<00:03:46.970> of<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.090> look<00:03:47.239> at<00:03:47.360> my<00:03:47.450> watch<00:03:47.660> but

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
just kind of to look at my watch but

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.140 
just kind of to look at my watch but
this<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:48.920> can<00:03:48.950> set<00:03:49.340> up<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.549> intervals<00:03:49.940> in

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
this you can set up the intervals in

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.849 
this you can set up the intervals in
advance<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.780> also<00:03:51.049> set<00:03:51.230> it<00:03:51.320> up<00:03:51.380> so<00:03:51.440> that<00:03:51.709> it

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
advance and also set it up so that it

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.330 
advance and also set it up so that it
goes<00:03:52.730> back<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.269> chronograph<00:03:54.100> so<00:03:55.100> for

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
goes back to the chronograph so for

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.620 
goes back to the chronograph so for
instance<00:03:55.640> I<00:03:55.700> just<00:03:55.730> set<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.180> up<00:03:56.239> for<00:03:56.450> five

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
instance I just set it up for five

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.380 
instance I just set it up for five
seconds<00:03:57.140> but<00:03:57.519> so<00:03:58.519> you<00:03:58.609> can<00:03:58.790> set<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.090> up<00:03:59.209> for

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
seconds but so you can set it up for

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.270 
seconds but so you can set it up for
five<00:03:59.660> seconds<00:04:00.109> or<00:04:00.290> however<00:04:00.560> many<00:04:00.829> intervals

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
five seconds or however many intervals

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.039 
five seconds or however many intervals
you<00:04:01.400> want<00:04:01.609> like<00:04:01.850> 30<00:04:02.150> seconds<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.720> then<00:04:02.810> five

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
you want like 30 seconds and then five

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.140 
you want like 30 seconds and then five
seconds<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:04.069> can<00:04:04.220> set<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.519> up<00:04:04.579> so<00:04:04.640> that<00:04:04.880> they

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
seconds you can set it up so that they

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.640 
seconds you can set it up so that they
at<00:04:05.359> the<00:04:05.540> end<00:04:05.870> of<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.049> interval

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
at the end of that interval

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.970 
at the end of that interval
whichever<00:04:07.190> one<00:04:07.430> it<00:04:07.700> stops<00:04:08.510> or<00:04:09.170> continues<00:04:09.829> on

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
whichever one it stops or continues on

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.890 
whichever one it stops or continues on
to<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.190> next<00:04:10.430> interval<00:04:10.760> or<00:04:11.030> returns<00:04:11.660> to<00:04:11.810> the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
to the next interval or returns to the

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.289 
to the next interval or returns to the
Coenen<00:04:12.200> cronograph<00:04:12.680> for<00:04:13.670> example<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.150> have

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
Coenen cronograph for example I have

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.970 
Coenen cronograph for example I have
this<00:04:14.480> one<00:04:14.540> just<00:04:14.810> set<00:04:15.019> up<00:04:15.139> for<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.350> five<00:04:15.590> second

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
this one just set up for a five second

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.599 
this one just set up for a five second
interval<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:18.560> know<00:04:18.650> for<00:04:18.829> simplicity<00:04:19.370> snakes

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
interval you know for simplicity snakes

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.150 
interval you know for simplicity snakes
but<00:04:19.910> if<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.900> can<00:04:21.019> see<00:04:21.260> then<00:04:21.500> it's<00:04:21.769> hopefully

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
but if you can see then it's hopefully

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.570 
but if you can see then it's hopefully
not<00:04:22.760> too<00:04:23.030> well<00:04:23.240> but<00:04:23.450> so<00:04:24.260> you<00:04:24.650> go<00:04:24.740> to<00:04:24.800> mode<00:04:25.039> Kota

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
not too well but so you go to mode Kota

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.469 
not too well but so you go to mode Kota
graph<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:26.479> then<00:04:26.630> you<00:04:26.720> have<00:04:26.900> your<00:04:27.050> timer<00:04:27.320> and

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
graph and then you have your timer and

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.400 
graph and then you have your timer and
then<00:04:29.479> an<00:04:30.050> interval<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:33.020> once<00:04:33.200> you<00:04:33.229> have<00:04:33.320> an

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
then an interval and so once you have an

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:44.200 
then an interval and so once you have an
interval<00:04:33.620> set

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:54.590 

you<00:04:45.210> know<00:04:49.550> wow<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:50.970> was<00:04:51.090> not<00:04:51.240> working<00:04:53.600> alarm

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
you know wow that was not working alarm

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:08.290 
you know wow that was not working alarm
timer<00:04:55.200> interval

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.680 

okay<00:05:09.050> done<00:05:09.760> there<00:05:10.760> so<00:05:11.060> once<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.420> interval

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
okay done there so once the interval

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.870 
okay done there so once the interval
starts<00:05:14.980> it<00:05:15.980> counts<00:05:16.280> down<00:05:16.310> to<00:05:16.460> there's<00:05:16.790> an

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
starts it counts down to there's an

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.680 
starts it counts down to there's an
alarm<00:05:17.120> a<00:05:17.900> lot<00:05:18.320> of<00:05:18.410> bull<00:05:18.530> display<00:05:19.600> noise<00:05:20.600> um

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
alarm a lot of bull display noise um

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.080 
alarm a lot of bull display noise um
that's<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.960> end<00:05:24.400> interval<00:05:25.400> sound<00:05:25.640> it<00:05:25.820> goes<00:05:25.940> on

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
that's the end interval sound it goes on

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.080 
that's the end interval sound it goes on
for<00:05:26.270> quite<00:05:26.420> a<00:05:27.010> what<00:05:28.010> a<00:05:28.040> while<00:05:28.220> sorry<00:05:28.670> I'm<00:05:28.850> tired
