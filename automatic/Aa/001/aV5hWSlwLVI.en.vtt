00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.310
 I am the doctor lakra I am an artist 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.099
 visual and we are in a studio in oaxaca 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.019
 in Mexico because one of the 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.279
 characteristics of my work is that 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:34.310
 they are limited to a certain technique 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.260
 watercolor tattoo interventions oil 5 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.540
 without albÃ¡n n murals I'm doing it 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.180
 always the same 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.220
 In my work, there are two elements 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.620
 old or old but at the same time 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.070
 hiring what already exists and you're 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.380
 putting as above a comment that 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.550
 transform that thing into another one 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.050
 transformation is very interesting when 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.270
 always to talk to me some 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.940
 project immediately since it will start 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.699
 how to work your head that makes you 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.220
 imagine how to translate it to a 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.140
 graphic language 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.380
 in my work if there have been things with 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.210
 Mayan elements the Mayan culture about 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.410
 everything graphically if you have like 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:21.220
 incredible traits that exist in 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.740
 all prehispanic cultures let's say 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.900
 that is the cult to that as all the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.000
 world believed in this god that gives the 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.230
 Mayan feathered serpent le 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.790
 as it is called violate alcoa 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.280
 and the jaguar is always like the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.030
 counterpart of the snake as good 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.070
 and evil not only in jaguar 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.010
 if one of the elements that was very 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.229
 important to translate and put here was the 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.750
 hurricane the hurricane is a word of 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:54.490
 Mayan origin then as very important 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.909
 put thunder clouds rain put all 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.909
 This elements 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.270
 there are many mexico do the same in 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.670
 mexico from the south than in north mexico 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.270
 but good with these elements I tried 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.560
 to do something very personal not something of what 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.560
 what I like most about mexico
