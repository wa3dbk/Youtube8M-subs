of making a house steal and I decided to

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.709 
of making a house steal and I decided to
make<00:00:32.890> it<00:00:33.040> out<00:00:33.129> of<00:00:33.160> aluminium<00:00:33.370> instead<00:00:34.000> but

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
make it out of aluminium instead but

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.569 
make it out of aluminium instead but
what<00:00:34.870> does<00:00:34.989> that<00:00:35.019> mean<00:00:35.260> well<00:00:35.949> whereas<00:00:36.309> the<00:00:36.430> old

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
what does that mean well whereas the old

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.220 
what does that mean well whereas the old

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
riveted which isn't and that means you

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.170
