00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.360
 Dear boys and girls 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.000
 What ever 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.850
 I will 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.029
 Carsten Scholz why 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.659
 one or the other identified 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.659
 I consider this maybe every now and then 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.300
 The world likes to keep stirring the ground with a glass of tea 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.279
 unimportant 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.809
 It may also have come to rumors that Jack Sparrow 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.540
 a crew adjusts 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.650
 not to leak the truth to the source of youth from the port 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.530
 but not the truth either 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.530
 Studying is going to be there or about 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.060
 burned there 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.390
 only on our way 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.540
 with concern 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.610
 the eternal youth 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.610
 during an expedition 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.630
 as it appears 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.210
 many can not RS anywhere 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.500
 Test your knowledge 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.500
 Windows and doors 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.009
 the search for the source of eternal youth 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.009
 it was not a good idea the source available 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.560
 an urban means 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.730
 it's about the source Henri Rousseau and way out of the way 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.990
 No, "If I wanted to try something just twelve weeks above that 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.520
 average 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.630
 Judge is 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.630
 Ulrich Rademacher in the report 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.570
 what was going on there? 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.259
 the journey is driven many 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.259
 first 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.890
 Sarkozy has the a4 a5 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.590
 the deadly accidents 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.590
 amazing 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:14.679
 all that 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.849
 a kind of 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.199

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:31.109
 "Why do you have to tighten again on nothing of your own video many US citizens 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.109
 Not 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.769
 Franziska KÃ¶hler emphasized Kurth 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:52.279
 I do not have it 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:57.399
 differently synonymous all seen because I have nothing again Baku
