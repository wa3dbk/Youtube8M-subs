00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
any means but it's not as good as the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.950 
any means but it's not as good as the
drummer<00:01:39.070> organics<00:01:39.640> are<00:01:39.820> not<00:01:40.060> oil<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.690> so<00:01:40.900> I

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
drummer organics are not oil and so I

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.020 
drummer organics are not oil and so I
can<00:01:41.170> definitely<00:01:41.560> feel<00:01:41.770> it<00:01:41.830> in<00:01:42.010> my<00:01:42.130> hair<00:01:42.430> is<00:01:42.790> I

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
wouldn't say sticky but it's definitely

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.149
