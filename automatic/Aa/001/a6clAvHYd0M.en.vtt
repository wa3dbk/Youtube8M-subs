00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
problem is we have zero evidence that

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.789 
problem is we have zero evidence that
there<00:02:45.389> was<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.569> game<00:02:45.810> called<00:02:46.139> the<00:02:46.319> needle<00:02:46.620> gate

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
gate existed one of the things that was

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.409 
gate existed one of the things that was
important<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:58.799> me<00:02:58.859> in<00:02:59.159> this<00:02:59.250> project<00:02:59.819> was<00:03:00.269> to

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
important to me in this project was to

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:01.550 
important to me in this project was to
make<00:03:00.599> sure<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:00.989> wasn't<00:03:01.260> just

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
make sure that I wasn't just

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.069 
make sure that I wasn't just
deconstructed<00:03:02.519> but<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:02.849> was<00:03:03.030> reconstructed<00:03:03.900> so

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
deconstructed but I was reconstructed so

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.199 
deconstructed but I was reconstructed so
I<00:03:04.319> try<00:03:04.799> to<00:03:04.829> take<00:03:05.159> down<00:03:05.189> the<00:03:05.609> legends<00:03:05.969> try<00:03:06.150> to

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
I try to take down the legends try to

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.089 
I try to take down the legends try to
show<00:03:06.510> all<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.959> reasons<00:03:07.319> that<00:03:07.379> I<00:03:07.500> can<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.010> in

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
show all the reasons that I can and in

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.179 
show all the reasons that I can and in
the<00:03:08.669> Miss<00:03:09.299> pace<00:03:09.480> provided<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.439> this<00:03:10.620> legend

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
the Miss pace provided that this legend

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.809 
the Miss pace provided that this legend
does<00:03:11.579> not<00:03:11.819> stand<00:03:12.299> against<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:14.489> weight<00:03:14.669> of

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
does not stand against the weight of

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.020 
does not stand against the weight of
evidence<00:03:15.349> but<00:03:16.349> then<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.859> reconstruct<00:03:17.609> what<00:03:17.819> the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
evidence but then I reconstruct what the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.699 
evidence but then I reconstruct what the
meaning<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.389> the<00:03:18.480> passage<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.439> I<00:03:19.500> try<00:03:19.680> to

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
meaning of the passage is and I try to

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.170 
meaning of the passage is and I try to
apply<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.129> to<00:03:20.340> our<00:03:20.370> contemporary<00:03:20.969> situation

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
apply it to our contemporary situation

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.349 
apply it to our contemporary situation
so<00:03:22.049> for<00:03:22.379> that<00:03:22.439> passage<00:03:22.889> for<00:03:23.099> example<00:03:23.549> really

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
so for that passage for example really

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.849 
so for that passage for example really
what's<00:03:24.510> going<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:24.930> it's<00:03:25.109> a<00:03:25.169> literary<00:03:25.439> device

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
what's going on it's a literary device

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.009 
what's going on it's a literary device
used<00:03:26.220> by<00:03:26.310> Jesus<00:03:26.579> very<00:03:27.239> frequently<00:03:27.780> called

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
used by Jesus very frequently called

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.170

exaggerated way to try to illustrate the
