you're<00:03:26.460> throwing<00:03:26.880> them<00:03:27.060> at<00:03:27.210> a<00:03:27.270> relatively

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
you're throwing them at a relatively

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.600 
you're throwing them at a relatively
small<00:03:27.990> target<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.880> don't<00:03:30.090> use<00:03:30.270> a<00:03:30.300> big

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
small target and I don't use a big

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.400 
small target and I don't use a big
plywood<00:03:32.610> sheet<00:03:32.910> just<00:03:33.150> because<00:03:33.330> I<00:03:33.450> didn't<00:03:34.320> have

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
plywood sheet just because I didn't have

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.430 
plywood sheet just because I didn't have
one<00:03:34.470> available<00:03:34.770> so<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.370> just<00:03:35.610> used<00:03:35.850> a

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
one available so I just used a

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.900 
one available so I just used a
relatively<00:03:37.440> small<00:03:37.620> target<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.460> target

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
relatively small target and the target

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.820 
relatively small target and the target
gets<00:03:39.060> pretty<00:03:39.360> crowded<00:03:39.690> when<00:03:40.140> these<00:03:40.320> are<00:03:40.500> all

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
gets pretty crowded when these are all

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.750 
gets pretty crowded when these are all
so<00:03:41.430> they'll<00:03:41.610> tend<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:42.000> hit<00:03:42.209> each<00:03:42.240> other<00:03:42.600> and

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
so they'll tend to hit each other and

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.150 
so they'll tend to hit each other and
they<00:03:44.760> get<00:03:44.970> dented<00:03:45.480> up<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.930> banged<00:03:46.140> up<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.830> you

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
they get dented up and banged up and you

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.410 
they get dented up and banged up and you
know<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.310> don't<00:03:47.370> know<00:03:47.580> if<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:48.030> can<00:03:48.150> see<00:03:48.390> it

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
know I don't know if you can see it

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.210 
know I don't know if you can see it
dented<00:03:48.990> up<00:03:49.280> but<00:03:50.900> that<00:03:51.900> damage<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:52.560> very<00:03:52.890> easy

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
dented up but that damage is very easy

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.760 
dented up but that damage is very easy
to<00:03:53.400> repair<00:03:53.970> I'll<00:03:54.360> just<00:03:54.870> put<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.200> couple<00:03:55.440> passes

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
to repair I'll just put a couple passes

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.670 
to repair I'll just put a couple passes
on<00:03:56.160> my<00:03:56.340> work<00:03:56.610> sharp<00:03:56.970> electric<00:03:57.930> sharpener<00:03:58.200> with

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
on my work sharp electric sharpener with

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.350 
on my work sharp electric sharpener with
a<00:03:58.709> very<00:03:59.040> smooth<00:03:59.400> belt<00:03:59.730> because<00:04:00.030> i'm<00:04:00.239> not

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
a very smooth belt because i'm not

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.120 
a very smooth belt because i'm not
trying<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.690> sharpen<00:04:01.170> these<00:04:01.350> i'm<00:04:01.680> just<00:04:01.890> trying

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
trying to sharpen these i'm just trying

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.060 
trying to sharpen these i'm just trying
to<00:04:02.220> get<00:04:02.850> rid<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.150> some<00:04:03.390> nicks<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:03.989> those<00:04:04.860> will

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
to get rid of some nicks and those will

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.090 
to get rid of some nicks and those will
be<00:04:05.100> good<00:04:05.430> as<00:04:05.489> new<00:04:05.989> all<00:04:06.989> right<00:04:07.170> so<00:04:07.380> yeah<00:04:07.650> they

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
be good as new all right so yeah they

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.580 
be good as new all right so yeah they
are<00:04:08.280> pretty<00:04:08.310> durable<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.510> mean<00:04:09.900> obviously<00:04:10.050> when

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
are pretty durable I mean obviously when

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.650 
are pretty durable I mean obviously when
they<00:04:10.709> hit<00:04:10.890> each<00:04:10.950> other<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.940> steel<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.630> steel

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
they hit each other it's steel on steel

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.590 
they hit each other it's steel on steel
so<00:04:13.440> there's<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.340> limit<00:04:14.730> means<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:15.270> know<00:04:15.360> it's

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
so there's a limit means you know it's

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.409 
so there's a limit means you know it's
equally<00:04:16.019> hard<00:04:16.579> so<00:04:17.579> of<00:04:17.790> course<00:04:17.970> they<00:04:18.239> can

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
equally hard so of course they can

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.560 
equally hard so of course they can
damage<00:04:18.780> each<00:04:18.930> other<00:04:19.230> but<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.070> general<00:04:20.570> right

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
damage each other but in general right

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.040 
damage each other but in general right
they're<00:04:22.260> pretty<00:04:22.500> durable<00:04:22.950> so<00:04:23.729> that's<00:04:23.970> good<00:04:24.360> as

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
they're pretty durable so that's good as

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.830 
they're pretty durable so that's good as
far<00:04:25.290> as<00:04:25.320> actually<00:04:25.950> throwing<00:04:26.310> these<00:04:26.840> not

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
far as actually throwing these not

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.100 
far as actually throwing these not
really<00:04:28.410> for<00:04:28.740> beginners<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.610> would<00:04:29.820> say<00:04:30.060> very

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
really for beginners I would say very

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.710 
really for beginners I would say very
difficult<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.290> learn<00:04:31.790> compared<00:04:32.790> to<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.030> larger

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
difficult to learn compared to a larger

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.390 
difficult to learn compared to a larger
blade<00:04:33.990> like<00:04:34.410> this<00:04:35.000> blade<00:04:36.169> lift<00:04:37.169> you<00:04:37.470> know<00:04:37.590> this

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
blade like this blade lift you know this

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.850 
blade like this blade lift you know this
plate<00:04:38.640> was<00:04:38.790> way<00:04:39.120> easier<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:40.050> learn<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:40.590> stick

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
plate was way easier to learn to stick

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.159 
plate was way easier to learn to stick
it's<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.220> straight<00:04:41.520> small<00:04:41.850> kukri<00:04:42.390> I<00:04:42.600> use<00:04:43.020> this

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
it's a straight small kukri I use this

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.719 
it's a straight small kukri I use this
as<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.290> throwing<00:04:43.710> knife<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:44.100> actually<00:04:44.520> works

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
as a throwing knife it actually works

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.080 
as a throwing knife it actually works
very<00:04:44.880> well<00:04:45.979> larger<00:04:46.979> things<00:04:47.250> like<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:47.640> boker

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
very well larger things like this boker

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.840 
very well larger things like this boker
magnum<00:04:48.500> throwing<00:04:49.500> axe<00:04:49.770> you<00:04:50.460> know<00:04:50.580> this<00:04:50.820> is

magnum throwing axe you know this is

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.800 
magnum throwing axe you know this is
like<00:04:51.830> 10<00:04:52.830> times<00:04:53.160> easier<00:04:53.580> to<00:04:54.030> successfully

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
like 10 times easier to successfully

like 10 times easier to successfully
stick<00:04:55.140> then<00:04:55.770> this<00:04:56.040> small<00:04:56.400> little<00:04:57.050> basically

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
stick then this small little basically

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.430 
stick then this small little basically
arrow-shaped<00:04:58.760> thrower<00:04:59.760> okay<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:00.840> I<00:05:00.870> enjoy

to<00:05:07.080> change<00:05:07.169> so<00:05:07.620> I<00:05:07.770> don't<00:05:08.010> usually<00:05:08.070> say<00:05:08.580> the

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
to change so I don't usually say the

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.460 
to change so I don't usually say the
price<00:05:08.940> I'll<00:05:09.180> try<00:05:09.419> to<00:05:09.450> list<00:05:09.810> it<00:05:10.050> so<00:05:10.260> if<00:05:10.350> it

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
changes but the price was basically

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.180 
changes but the price was basically
pretty<00:05:13.350> cheap<00:05:13.470> um<00:05:15.380> but<00:05:16.380> yeah<00:05:16.620> they<00:05:16.800> were<00:05:16.860> very

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
pretty cheap um but yeah they were very

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.260 
pretty cheap um but yeah they were very
difficult<00:05:17.880> to<00:05:18.120> throw<00:05:18.600> or<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:19.050> learn<00:05:19.260> to<00:05:19.560> throw

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
difficult to throw or to learn to throw

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.830 
difficult to throw or to learn to throw
relative<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:22.169> other<00:05:22.470> blades<00:05:23.120> heavier<00:05:24.120> longer

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
relative to other blades heavier longer

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.500 
relative to other blades heavier longer
blades<00:05:25.169> I<00:05:25.940> tried<00:05:26.940> every<00:05:27.510> different<00:05:27.900> method

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
blades I tried every different method

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.750 
blades I tried every different method
like<00:05:28.660> every<00:05:29.200> different<00:05:29.680> grip<00:05:29.920> I<00:05:30.220> tried

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
like every different grip I tried

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.470 
like every different grip I tried
gripping<00:05:31.210> them<00:05:31.300> up<00:05:31.480> here<00:05:32.070> down<00:05:33.070> here<00:05:33.130> I<00:05:33.910> tried

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
gripping them up here down here I tried

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.960

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
like doing you know the whole finger on

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.050 
like doing you know the whole finger on
the<00:05:37.090> side<00:05:37.420> thing<00:05:37.810> I<00:05:38.140> tried<00:05:39.070> I<00:05:39.250> tried<00:05:39.280> every

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
the side thing I tried I tried every

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.260 
the side thing I tried I tried every
different<00:05:40.510> method<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:42.310> only<00:05:42.520> method<00:05:42.730> i<00:05:42.940> found

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
different method the only method i found

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.530 
different method the only method i found
that<00:05:43.660> worked<00:05:44.320> was<00:05:44.860> actually<00:05:45.340> holding<00:05:45.550> it<00:05:45.880> like

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
that worked was actually holding it like

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.530 
that worked was actually holding it like
this<00:05:46.780> holding<00:05:47.290> it<00:05:47.440> by<00:05:47.590> that<00:05:47.800> ring<00:05:48.480> all<00:05:49.480> right

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
this holding it by that ring all right

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.160 
this holding it by that ring all right
and<00:05:49.930> as<00:05:50.200> I<00:05:50.260> release<00:05:50.770> it<00:05:50.980> I<00:05:51.490> basically<00:05:52.210> pulled

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
and as I release it I basically pulled

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.400 
and as I release it I basically pulled
down<00:05:53.440> a<00:05:53.800> lot<00:05:54.270> suddenly<00:05:55.270> with<00:05:55.960> this<00:05:56.140> finger

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
down a lot suddenly with this finger

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.920 
down a lot suddenly with this finger
here<00:05:56.590> as<00:05:57.130> I<00:05:57.640> release<00:05:57.850> the<00:05:58.300> thumb<00:05:58.570> so<00:05:58.870> I'm

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
here as I release the thumb so I'm

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.370 
here as I release the thumb so I'm
almost<00:05:59.200> like<00:05:59.440> BAM<00:06:00.100> like<00:06:00.850> that<00:06:01.170> that's<00:06:02.170> the

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
almost like BAM like that that's the

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.140 
almost like BAM like that that's the
only<00:06:02.620> method<00:06:02.830> i<00:06:03.040> found<00:06:03.340> that<00:06:03.460> worked<00:06:03.790> for<00:06:04.090> me

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
only method i found that worked for me

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.930 
only method i found that worked for me
alright<00:06:05.110> not<00:06:05.410> sure<00:06:05.740> you<00:06:06.190> know<00:06:06.310> I'm<00:06:06.730> not<00:06:06.880> the

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
alright not sure you know I'm not the

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.700 
alright not sure you know I'm not the
greatest<00:06:07.150> store<00:06:07.600> in<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:07.870> freaking<00:06:08.200> world<00:06:08.380> so

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
greatest store in the freaking world so

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.560 
greatest store in the freaking world so
I'm<00:06:08.890> sure<00:06:09.100> there's<00:06:09.370> many<00:06:09.640> other<00:06:09.790> methods<00:06:10.450> you

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
I'm sure there's many other methods you

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.650 
I'm sure there's many other methods you
could<00:06:10.780> use<00:06:11.080> but<00:06:12.070> that<00:06:12.280> was<00:06:12.910> my<00:06:13.090> trial<00:06:13.480> and

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
could use but that was my trial and

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.600 
could use but that was my trial and
error<00:06:13.780> method<00:06:14.080> you<00:06:14.620> can<00:06:14.740> also<00:06:14.920> probably<00:06:15.280> just

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
error method you can also probably just

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.400 
error method you can also probably just
pinch<00:06:15.940> it<00:06:16.090> like<00:06:16.300> this<00:06:16.510> and<00:06:16.570> throw<00:06:17.050> it<00:06:17.200> with<00:06:17.380> the

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
pinch it like this and throw it with the

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.280 
pinch it like this and throw it with the
same<00:06:17.680> motion<00:06:18.190> but<00:06:18.340> I<00:06:18.400> found<00:06:18.670> it<00:06:18.850> useful<00:06:19.060> to<00:06:19.600> use

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
same motion but I found it useful to use

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.370 
same motion but I found it useful to use
the<00:06:20.530> extra<00:06:20.830> leverage<00:06:21.160> of<00:06:21.520> that<00:06:21.700> ring<00:06:22.170> to<00:06:23.170> just

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
the extra leverage of that ring to just

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.790 
the extra leverage of that ring to just
snap<00:06:24.310> it<00:06:24.340> out<00:06:24.780> with<00:06:25.780> my<00:06:26.020> finger<00:06:26.350> like<00:06:26.380> that

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
snap it out with my finger like that

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.130 
snap it out with my finger like that
alright<00:06:27.220> so<00:06:27.430> that's<00:06:27.550> my<00:06:27.940> method<00:06:28.420> it<00:06:28.810> worked

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
alright so that's my method it worked

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.620 
alright so that's my method it worked
for<00:06:29.380> me<00:06:29.590> I<00:06:29.830> can<00:06:30.310> stick<00:06:30.550> five<00:06:30.820> in<00:06:31.030> a<00:06:31.120> row<00:06:31.150> with

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
for me I can stick five in a row with

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.990 
for me I can stick five in a row with
some<00:06:32.020> practice<00:06:32.590> I<00:06:32.830> was<00:06:33.250> throwing<00:06:33.490> from<00:06:33.700> about

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
some practice I was throwing from about

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.420 
some practice I was throwing from about
10<00:06:34.300> feet<00:06:34.540> away<00:06:34.720> you<00:06:35.320> know<00:06:35.440> these<00:06:35.590> are<00:06:35.650> so<00:06:36.010> small

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
10 feet away you know these are so small

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.220 
10 feet away you know these are so small
that<00:06:36.490> if<00:06:36.820> I<00:06:36.940> had<00:06:37.180> it<00:06:37.360> if<00:06:37.510> I<00:06:37.750> through<00:06:37.990> from

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
that if I had it if I through from

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.060 
that if I had it if I through from
farther<00:06:38.530> away<00:06:38.650> you<00:06:40.140> have<00:06:41.140> difficulty<00:06:41.650> of<00:06:41.920> been

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
farther away you have difficulty of been

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.400 
farther away you have difficulty of been
seeing<00:06:42.280> them<00:06:42.580> on<00:06:42.700> camera<00:06:42.970> and<00:06:43.600> also<00:06:43.990> you<00:06:44.290> know

know you know learn how to throw them

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.420 
know you know learn how to throw them
first<00:06:52.660> and<00:06:52.900> then<00:06:52.960> you<00:06:53.050> can<00:06:53.190> gradually<00:06:54.190> move

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
first and then you can gradually move

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.610 
first and then you can gradually move
back<00:06:54.670> and<00:06:54.880> back<00:06:55.060> and<00:06:55.090> back<00:06:55.330> right<00:06:56.320> but<00:06:56.470> these

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
are like you know if you try and throw

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.990 
are like you know if you try and throw
them<00:06:58.450> from<00:06:58.690> a<00:06:58.750> very<00:06:58.990> far<00:06:59.230> distance<00:06:59.790> you'd<00:07:00.790> have

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
them from a very far distance you'd have

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.510 
them from a very far distance you'd have
to<00:07:01.150> put<00:07:01.360> like<00:07:01.540> a<00:07:01.720> lot<00:07:02.200> of<00:07:02.440> force<00:07:02.830> like<00:07:03.340> I<00:07:03.460> said

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
to put like a lot of force like I said

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.910 
to put like a lot of force like I said
throwing<00:07:04.120> something<00:07:04.360> light<00:07:04.750> it<00:07:05.350> gets<00:07:05.710> to<00:07:05.890> be

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:05.920 
throwing something light it gets to be

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.470 
throwing something light it gets to be
like<00:07:06.190> you're<00:07:06.370> trying<00:07:06.580> to<00:07:06.700> throw<00:07:06.970> a<00:07:07.000> feather

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:07.480 
like you're trying to throw a feather

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.080 
like you're trying to throw a feather
right<00:07:08.110> you<00:07:08.320> need<00:07:08.500> you<00:07:09.130> need<00:07:09.310> to<00:07:09.460> release<00:07:09.790> it

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090 
right you need you need to release it

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.600 
right you need you need to release it
there's<00:07:10.810> a<00:07:10.930> tiny<00:07:11.260> window<00:07:11.620> in<00:07:12.010> the<00:07:12.130> motion

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
there's a tiny window in the motion

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.120 
there's a tiny window in the motion
where<00:07:13.240> you<00:07:13.360> actually<00:07:13.570> release<00:07:14.170> it<00:07:14.440> that<00:07:14.920> it's

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.130 
where you actually release it that it's

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.300 
where you actually release it that it's
going<00:07:15.250> to<00:07:15.310> be<00:07:15.460> accurate<00:07:15.670> alright<00:07:16.660> so<00:07:17.310> yeah

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.310 
going to be accurate alright so yeah

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.410 
going to be accurate alright so yeah
these<00:07:18.580> are<00:07:19.140> really<00:07:20.140> cool<00:07:20.530> really<00:07:21.420> inexpensive

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:22.420 
these are really cool really inexpensive

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:27.150 
these are really cool really inexpensive
but<00:07:23.970> not<00:07:24.970> for<00:07:25.240> beginners<00:07:25.390> in<00:07:25.930> my<00:07:26.110> mind<00:07:26.410> but

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 
but not for beginners in my mind but

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.340 
but not for beginners in my mind but
still<00:07:27.460> pretty<00:07:27.940> darn<00:07:28.300> cool<00:07:28.630> if<00:07:28.840> you<00:07:28.960> can<00:07:29.170> throw

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:29.350 
still pretty darn cool if you can throw

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.590 
still pretty darn cool if you can throw
these<00:07:29.650> you'll<00:07:29.950> have<00:07:30.100> no<00:07:30.310> problem<00:07:30.910> with
