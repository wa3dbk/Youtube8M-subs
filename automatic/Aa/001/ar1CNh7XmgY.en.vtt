cold<00:00:51.360> winter<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.289> mean<00:00:52.559> up<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.160> got<00:00:53.820> this

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
cold winter I mean up I got this

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.650 
cold winter I mean up I got this
snowball<00:00:55.309> right<00:00:56.309> here<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> kids<00:00:57.539> were

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
snowball right here that the kids were

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.150 
snowball right here that the kids were
saving<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> freezer<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.920> from

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
saving in the freezer and it is from

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.680 
saving in the freezer and it is from
right<00:00:59.430> over<00:00:59.640> there<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:02.270> just<00:01:03.270> because<00:01:03.420> it's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
right over there so just because it's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.870 
right over there so just because it's
called<00:01:03.899> where<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.320> lit<00:01:04.589> does<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.369> mean<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.670> is

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
called where we lit does not mean it is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.780 
called where we lit does not mean it is
cold<00:01:06.299> everywhere<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.470> people<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.159> Twitter
