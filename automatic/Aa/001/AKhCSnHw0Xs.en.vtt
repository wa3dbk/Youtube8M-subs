00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 yes hello and servus deal today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.259
 we deal with the preparation of a b46 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.480
 Three countries would have to have us here 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.940
 left headlight of the 46 and on the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.130
 first glance do not actually look 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.289
 times so bad but if we look 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.520
 to look closer you see that 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.619
 the plastic surface of the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.439
 spotlights a bit battered 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.810
 and scratched maybe you hear it 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:33.420
 but on the camera but you hear 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:36.690
 Look that this is already a rough one 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.280
 owns and degrades surface 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.790
 of course, the luminosity of 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.500
 spotlights no matter if you have one 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.870
 high quality or a cheaper lamp 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.940
 has for the preparation of our 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.690
 I use spotlights today 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.110
 Headlight repair time from the war 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.780
 this includes an apparent polish 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:04.049
 a few strips of sandpaper 2000 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.250
 3000 5000 and an art insurance as 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.990
 first step I will be the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.170
 Clean the headlights once 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.560
 I use brakes cleaner and all the way 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.960
 normal paper and after that we will 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.960
 donate everything with adhesive tape 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.470
 after years degreased headlight 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.680
 and cleaned it is now about the deliver 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.050
 I just take it normal 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.280
 paper band and protect the 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.280
 surrounding area 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.740
 so after you deliver your headlights 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.150
 have we can start to grind 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.490
 this we use here first of all 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.500
 2000 sandpaper when sanding always 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.460
 always pay attention to the water 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.790
 surface to spray 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.920
 to enable regrinding and 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.920
 to slide the paper better 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.760
 so after you have the 2000 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.730
 You have been able to work on paper towel 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.510
 the finer ones can change in the 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.960
 If so, pay attention to the 3000 now 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.060
 Turn the loop direction 90 degrees 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.950
 that is, if you are horizontal before 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.260
 have sanded vertically now 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.580
 Grind around the previous sanding 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.580
 shouted to compensate again 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.110
 if you now with the three thousand 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.430
 paper also by you can you 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.830
 turn to the last step 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.590
 the grind and that 5000 paper 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.450
 here again pay attention to the sanding 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.600
 change direction again that is in 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.970
 in this case again horizontally and afterwards 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.750
 it starts as a problem 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.970
 after you have all three papers 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.550
 we could now sleep in the 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.830
 devote to actual polishing 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.990
 You can either do this in this package 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.770
 use the supplied towels or 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.230
 a normal polish sponge 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.000
 I am using demonstrational 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.070
 half the political center to it 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.790
 have been delivered and just the 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.380
 liveblog just something polish 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.520
 Apply and back in the 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.520
 opposite a direction 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.100
 so after you all over the blade 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.239
 could have subscribed to polish fit the 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.600
 We accept clarifications and the sparkle 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.600
 unite 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.220
 even in all these steps 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.600
 you can have on the cleaned 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.370
 Spotlight now the seal 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.650
 apply 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.450
 That's why it's very important 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.670
 Unprotected glasses plastic glasses 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.120
 of course, by the uv-light again 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.310
 can be drifting and sealing 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.290
 this protects next to through this uv 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.240
 filter 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.870
 we also have the set in the set here 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:03.550
 given the seal 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.550
 the easy big pads 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.930
 if you have now distributed the whole five 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.030
 to retrieve that ten minutes 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.240
 the sealers can connect and 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.170
 can ventilate and then with a 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.940
 wipe clean cloth 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.830
 Here we have our final result 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.720
 and as you can see the surface 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:38.390
 is now much smoother than at the beginning 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.390
 and if we again this fingernail 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.640
 Doing a test is hardly something to hear so 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.240
 The surface is very smooth now 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.070
 and polish has taken a lot out 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.360
 can 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.520
 Seeing it here can make it clearer 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.740
 headlights not only from the function 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.600
 what's out but still visually 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.460
 an extra plus if you like this 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.560
 video has liked click on flaig and 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.450
 and visited me on mine 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.570
 facebook-side rivers to the next 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.570
 times
