affect the clean signal and this is a

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.600 
affect the clean signal and this is a
tilt<00:01:58.780> eq<00:01:59.200> so<00:01:59.470> it's<00:01:59.650> very<00:01:59.770> flexible<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:00.460> you

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
tilt eq so it's very flexible and you

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.510 
tilt eq so it's very flexible and you
can<00:02:00.729> get<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:00.880> lot<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.120> variation<00:02:01.810> from<00:02:01.960> it<00:02:02.400> so<00:02:03.400> as
