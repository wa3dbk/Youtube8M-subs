00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
other peg on the load so I'm skipping

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.010 
other peg on the load so I'm skipping
pegs<00:00:46.190> every<00:00:47.090> other<00:00:47.210> peg<00:00:47.450> if<00:00:47.629> that<00:00:47.780> makes<00:00:47.900> any

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
pegs every other peg if that makes any

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.260 
pegs every other peg if that makes any
sense<00:00:48.170> at<00:00:48.470> all<00:00:48.559> you<00:00:48.860> can<00:00:49.580> kind<00:00:49.790> of<00:00:49.850> see<00:00:50.059> the

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
sense at all you can kind of see the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.000 
sense at all you can kind of see the
effect<00:00:50.570> that<00:00:50.660> it<00:00:50.870> gives<00:00:51.019> here<00:00:51.440> it's<00:00:51.860> gonna

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
effect that it gives here it's gonna

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.560 
effect that it gives here it's gonna
look<00:00:52.250> a<00:00:52.400> little<00:00:52.610> bit<00:00:52.910> different<00:00:53.300> than<00:00:53.449> if<00:00:53.540> you

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
look a little bit different than if you

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.100 
look a little bit different than if you
just<00:00:53.660> knitted<00:00:54.379> simply<00:00:55.250> but<00:00:55.790> that's<00:00:55.940> okay<00:00:56.210> now

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
just knitted simply but that's okay now

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.570 
just knitted simply but that's okay now
I'm<00:00:57.170> gonna<00:00:57.260> take<00:00:57.440> my<00:00:57.500> aqua<00:00:57.920> blue<00:00:58.070> yarn<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.519> I'm

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
I'm gonna take my aqua blue yarn and I'm

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.330 
I'm gonna take my aqua blue yarn and I'm
gonna<00:00:58.699> go<00:00:58.850> in<00:00:59.059> between<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.960> Y<00:01:00.800> yarn<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:01.280> I'm

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
gonna go in between the Y yarn and I'm

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.520 
gonna go in between the Y yarn and I'm
gonna<00:01:01.430> do<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.850> pegs<00:01:02.150> that<00:01:02.449> I<00:01:02.480> skipped<00:01:02.989> with

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
gonna do the pegs that I skipped with

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.950 
gonna do the pegs that I skipped with
the<00:01:03.710> white<00:01:03.920> yarn<00:01:04.160> so<00:01:04.790> every<00:01:05.330> other<00:01:05.420> peg<00:01:05.720> on<00:01:05.869> the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
the white yarn so every other peg on the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.170 
the white yarn so every other peg on the
loom<00:01:06.170> will<00:01:06.680> be<00:01:06.830> blue<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.520> then<00:01:07.759> the<00:01:07.850> ones

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
loom will be blue and then the ones

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.480 
loom will be blue and then the ones
in-between<00:01:08.390> will<00:01:08.810> be<00:01:08.930> white<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.220> even

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
in-between will be white so the even

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.279 
in-between will be white so the even
pegs<00:01:10.729> are<00:01:11.060> blue<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.020> odd<00:01:12.170> pegs<00:01:12.530> are<00:01:12.770> white

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
pegs are blue and the odd pegs are white

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.210 
pegs are blue and the odd pegs are white
so<00:01:15.289> now<00:01:15.410> I'm<00:01:15.470> just<00:01:15.560> gonna<00:01:15.710> go<00:01:15.890> ahead<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.039> it

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
so now I'm just gonna go ahead and it

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:26.590 
so now I'm just gonna go ahead and it
off<00:01:16.490> each<00:01:16.940> each<00:01:17.780> peg<00:01:18.050> now

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.750 

all<00:01:27.200> right<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:27.470> I'm<00:01:27.530> just<00:01:27.710> taking<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.250> project

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
all right so I'm just taking the project

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.040 
all right so I'm just taking the project
and<00:01:28.909> pulling<00:01:29.120> it<00:01:29.180> down<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.630> bottom<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:29.960> the

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
and pulling it down to the bottom of the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.430 
and pulling it down to the bottom of the
Loom<00:01:30.940> I'm<00:01:31.940> gonna<00:01:32.420> repeat<00:01:32.720> this<00:01:32.900> process<00:01:33.110> again

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
Loom I'm gonna repeat this process again

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.469 
Loom I'm gonna repeat this process again
but<00:01:33.830> this<00:01:34.220> time<00:01:34.490> I'm<00:01:34.670> gonna<00:01:34.820> take<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.150> blue

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
but this time I'm gonna take the blue

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.040 
but this time I'm gonna take the blue
and<00:01:35.780> do<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.350> odd<00:01:36.680> numbers<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:37.220> even<00:01:37.760> do<00:01:38.180> the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
and do the odd numbers and even do the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.040 
and do the odd numbers and even do the
and<00:01:39.470> then<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.070> white<00:01:40.400> do<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.760> even<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:41.600> the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
and then the white do the even so the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.609 
and then the white do the even so the
blue<00:01:42.380> will<00:01:42.860> first<00:01:43.310> do<00:01:44.090> I'm<00:01:44.479> firsty<00:01:45.229> wrapping

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
blue will first do I'm firsty wrapping

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.130 
blue will first do I'm firsty wrapping
the<00:01:45.800> first<00:01:46.100> third<00:01:46.490> fifth<00:01:46.850> seventh<00:01:47.479> ninth<00:01:47.869> and

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
the first third fifth seventh ninth and

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.270 
the first third fifth seventh ninth and
so<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:48.800> so<00:01:48.920> forth

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
so on and so forth

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.969 
so on and so forth
mom<00:01:49.520> pets<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:50.869> basically<00:01:51.229> they're<00:01:51.470> switching

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
mom pets so basically they're switching

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.420 
mom pets so basically they're switching
roles<00:01:52.190> where<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.180> blue<00:01:53.990> was<00:01:54.290> even<00:01:54.979> originally

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
roles where the blue was even originally

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.490 
roles where the blue was even originally
now<00:01:55.610> it's<00:01:55.910> on<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.150> odd<00:01:56.300> number<00:01:56.600> pegs<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:57.259> is

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
now it's on the odd number pegs it is

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.290 
now it's on the odd number pegs it is
easier<00:01:58.040> to<00:01:58.100> think<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.430> it<00:01:58.550> in<00:01:58.700> terms<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:59.119> the

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
easier to think of it in terms of the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.029 
easier to think of it in terms of the
peg<00:01:59.840> numbers<00:02:00.410> you<00:02:00.649> know<00:02:00.770> if<00:02:00.830> you<00:02:00.920> think

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
peg numbers you know if you think

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.279 
peg numbers you know if you think
there's<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.340> 24<00:02:01.759> peg<00:02:01.940> loom<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:02.539> starts<00:02:03.020> at<00:02:03.140> peg

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
there's a 24 peg loom and starts at peg

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.620 
there's a 24 peg loom and starts at peg
one<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.770> it's<00:02:03.950> at<00:02:04.130> peg<00:02:04.310> 24<00:02:04.460> it's<00:02:05.360> a<00:02:05.420> little

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
one and it's at peg 24 it's a little

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.870 
one and it's at peg 24 it's a little
simpler<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.470> think<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.009> like<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.700> help

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
simpler to think of it like that to help

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.490 
simpler to think of it like that to help
you<00:02:07.970> with<00:02:08.119> this<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:08.959> I'm<00:02:09.050> just<00:02:09.259> taking

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
you with this so that I'm just taking

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.140 
you with this so that I'm just taking
the<00:02:09.590> white<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:09.979> once<00:02:10.190> again<00:02:10.310> going<00:02:10.970> in

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
the white and once again going in

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.320 
the white and once again going in
between<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.660> blue<00:02:12.530> yarn<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.580> unwrapped

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
between the blue yarn to the unwrapped

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.710 
between the blue yarn to the unwrapped
pegs<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:16.400> now<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:16.610> can<00:02:16.910> basically<00:02:17.030> see<00:02:17.510> from

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
pegs so now you can basically see from

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.900 
pegs so now you can basically see from
this<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.920> bottom<00:02:19.370> loop<00:02:19.550> should<00:02:19.730> be

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
this that the bottom loop should be

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.330 
this that the bottom loop should be
white<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.420> top<00:02:20.630> should<00:02:20.900> be<00:02:20.959> blue<00:02:21.410> on<00:02:21.920> sub

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
white and the top should be blue on sub

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.009 
white and the top should be blue on sub
pegs<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.790> then<00:02:22.910> on<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.120> other<00:02:23.150> pegs<00:02:23.570> the

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
pegs and then on the other pegs the

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.810 
pegs and then on the other pegs the
bottom<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.410> blue<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.040> top<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.400> white<00:02:25.610> is

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
bottom is blue and the top is white is

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.850 
bottom is blue and the top is white is
this<00:02:25.970> make<00:02:26.209> sense<00:02:26.480> like<00:02:26.660> your<00:02:27.050> pegs<00:02:27.320> literally

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
this make sense like your pegs literally

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.850 
this make sense like your pegs literally
would<00:02:28.070> look<00:02:28.160> like<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.370> checkerboard<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:29.860> hope

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
would look like a checkerboard I hope

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.680 
would look like a checkerboard I hope
I'm<00:02:30.980> making<00:02:31.010> sense<00:02:31.519> here<00:02:31.610> by<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.850> way<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.269> feel

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
I'm making sense here by the way I feel

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.930 
I'm making sense here by the way I feel
like<00:02:32.840> I'm<00:02:33.019> selling<00:02:33.230> like<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.500> crazy<00:02:33.830> person<00:02:33.980> I'm

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
like I'm selling like a crazy person I'm

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.160 
like I'm selling like a crazy person I'm
just<00:02:35.000> pulling<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.450> project<00:02:35.810> out<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:35.959> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
just pulling the project out to the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.210 
just pulling the project out to the
bottom<00:02:36.320> once<00:02:36.650> again

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
bottom once again

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.580 
bottom once again
and<00:02:37.730> now<00:02:38.690> I'm<00:02:38.780> gonna<00:02:38.870> go<00:02:39.049> back<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.290> the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
and now I'm gonna go back to the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.370 
and now I'm gonna go back to the
original<00:02:39.820> here<00:02:40.820> but<00:02:41.660> before<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:42.140> do<00:02:42.230> that

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
original here but before I do that

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.199 
original here but before I do that
there's<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:42.860> little<00:02:43.160> cat<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.760> wanted<00:02:44.150> to

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
there's a little cat that I wanted to

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.259 
there's a little cat that I wanted to
interrupt<00:02:44.690> my<00:02:44.959> video<00:02:45.350> of<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.579> you<00:02:46.670> AC<00:02:46.910> heard

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
interrupt my video of the you AC heard

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.060 
interrupt my video of the you AC heard
throughout<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.600> video<00:02:47.959> because<00:02:48.290> she<00:02:48.890> likes

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
throughout the video because she likes

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.140 
throughout the video because she likes
yarn<00:02:49.600> if<00:02:50.600> you<00:02:50.810> can<00:02:50.959> tell<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.980> now<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.400> am<00:02:52.880> taking

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
yarn if you can tell so now I am taking

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.060 
yarn if you can tell so now I am taking
the<00:02:53.480> white<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:54.019> going<00:02:54.230> back<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.680> original

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
the white and going back to the original

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.830 
the white and going back to the original
pattern<00:02:55.310> of<00:02:55.579> doing<00:02:55.730> these

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
pattern of doing these

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.740 
pattern of doing these
odd<00:02:57.410> colored<00:02:59.020> pecs<00:03:01.330> one<00:03:02.330> thing<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.630> may

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
odd colored pecs one thing you may

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.630 
odd colored pecs one thing you may
happen<00:03:03.110> is<00:03:03.319> you<00:03:03.470> may<00:03:03.590> have<00:03:03.620> your<00:03:03.860> yarn<00:03:04.160> kind<00:03:04.520> of

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
happen is you may have your yarn kind of

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.479 
happen is you may have your yarn kind of
not<00:03:05.060> not<00:03:05.390> really<00:03:05.690> not<00:03:05.870> up<00:03:06.110> just<00:03:06.739> twists<00:03:07.069> itself

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
not not really not up just twists itself

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.309 
not not really not up just twists itself
because<00:03:07.970> you're<00:03:08.420> constantly<00:03:08.870> switching

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
because you're constantly switching

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.350 
because you're constantly switching
between<00:03:09.560> colors<00:03:10.130> so<00:03:10.610> about<00:03:10.760> every<00:03:10.970> few<00:03:11.180> rows

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
between colors so about every few rows

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.820 
between colors so about every few rows
you<00:03:11.569> probably<00:03:11.780> gonna<00:03:11.870> have<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.050> detangle<00:03:12.560> it

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
you probably gonna have to detangle it

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.589 
you probably gonna have to detangle it
all<00:03:13.519> right<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:13.760> now<00:03:13.880> I'm<00:03:13.940> just<00:03:14.060> going<00:03:14.209> back<00:03:14.390> in

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
all right so now I'm just going back in

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.540 
all right so now I'm just going back in
with<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.810> blue<00:03:15.019> and<00:03:15.349> doing<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.920> even<00:03:16.280> number

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
with the blue and doing the even number

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.030 
with the blue and doing the even number
pegs

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:31.360 

and<00:03:21.040> I'm<00:03:21.310> just<00:03:21.459> gonna<00:03:21.610> do<00:03:21.849> both

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.920 

all<00:03:32.370> right<00:03:32.550> so<00:03:32.819> you<00:03:32.910> kind<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.240> see<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.510> look<00:03:33.750> of

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
all right so you kind of see the look of

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.270 
all right so you kind of see the look of
the<00:03:34.140> Hat<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.560> middle<00:03:34.800> you're<00:03:34.980> gonna<00:03:35.069> see

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
the Hat in the middle you're gonna see

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.400 
the Hat in the middle you're gonna see
these<00:03:35.400> really<00:03:35.910> stripe<00:03:36.450> things<00:03:36.780> on<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.080> inside

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
these really stripe things on the inside

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.960 
these really stripe things on the inside
of<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.560> loop<00:03:37.800> but<00:03:38.280> that's<00:03:38.490> just<00:03:38.670> because<00:03:38.790> of

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
of the loop but that's just because of

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.580 
of the loop but that's just because of
how<00:03:39.240> we<00:03:39.300> have<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.569> make<00:03:39.750> this<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.200> one<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.470> the

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
how we have to make this so one of the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.230 
how we have to make this so one of the
importance<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.400> make<00:03:41.640> sure<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:42.090> your

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
importance is to make sure that your

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.809 
importance is to make sure that your
ending<00:03:42.690> is<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.959> last<00:03:43.260> two<00:03:43.860> pegs<00:03:44.310> before<00:03:44.550> the

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
ending is the last two pegs before the

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.030 
ending is the last two pegs before the
central<00:03:45.209> lab<00:03:45.360> so<00:03:45.930> if<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:46.200> don't<00:03:46.590> do<00:03:46.860> this

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
central lab so if you don't do this

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.800 
central lab so if you don't do this
correctly<00:03:47.220> let<00:03:47.940> me<00:03:48.030> show<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.450> what<00:03:48.660> can

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
correctly let me show you what can

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.440 
correctly let me show you what can
happen<00:03:48.840> if<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:49.770> were<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:49.920> just<00:03:50.190> knit<00:03:50.580> normally

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
happen if you were to just knit normally

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.170 
happen if you were to just knit normally
with<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.930> UM<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:53.160> white<00:03:53.340> color<00:03:53.670> like<00:03:53.940> shown

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
with the UM the white color like shown

wrapping<00:04:15.810> over<00:04:16.169> this<00:04:16.650> will<00:04:16.859> happen<00:04:17.160> with<00:04:17.340> the

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
wrapping over this will happen with the

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.420 
wrapping over this will happen with the
color<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.600> end<00:04:18.930> with<00:04:19.019> on<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.650> left<00:04:19.950> side

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
of the central knob if that makes any

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.080 
of the central knob if that makes any
sense

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
sense

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.780

this<00:04:26.880> white<00:04:27.570> yarn<00:04:27.780> correctly<00:04:28.850> I<00:04:29.850> will<00:04:30.479> end<00:04:30.900> up

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
this white yarn correctly I will end up

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.650 
this white yarn correctly I will end up
right<00:04:32.400> before<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.880> central<00:04:33.210> knob<00:04:33.360> which<00:04:33.540> is

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
right before the central knob which is

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.780 
right before the central knob which is
where<00:04:33.810> I'm<00:04:33.900> supposed<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.500> be<00:04:34.710> okay<00:04:35.550> does<00:04:35.760> that

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
where I'm supposed to be okay does that

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.250 
where I'm supposed to be okay does that
make<00:04:35.910> sense<00:04:36.240> like<00:04:36.390> you<00:04:36.690> always<00:04:36.840> want<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.110> make

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
make sense like you always want to make

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.350 
make sense like you always want to make
sure<00:04:37.290> that<00:04:37.590> you're<00:04:37.710> ending<00:04:38.220> with<00:04:38.970> your<00:04:39.210> yarn

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
sure that you're ending with your yarn

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.020 
sure that you're ending with your yarn
the<00:04:39.600> last<00:04:39.840> two<00:04:40.320> pegs<00:04:40.650> before<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.700> central

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
the last two pegs before the central

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.640 
the last two pegs before the central
about<00:04:42.240> because<00:04:42.570> if<00:04:42.720> you're<00:04:42.870> ending<00:04:43.229> any

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
about because if you're ending any

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.890 
about because if you're ending any
farther<00:04:44.070> away<00:04:44.370> from<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.940> it<00:04:45.240> will<00:04:45.450> screw<00:04:45.870> up

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
farther away from it it will screw up

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.380 
farther away from it it will screw up
the<00:04:46.080> look<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:47.220> checkerboard<00:04:47.580> hat<00:04:47.910> so<00:04:48.360> I

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
the look of the checkerboard hat so I

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.909 
the look of the checkerboard hat so I
hope<00:04:48.539> that<00:04:48.570> just<00:04:48.900> kind<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.080> makes<00:04:49.289> sense<00:04:49.410> just

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
hope that just kind of makes sense just

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.159 
hope that just kind of makes sense just
make<00:04:50.130> sure<00:04:50.400> that<00:04:51.000> you're<00:04:51.510> ending<00:04:51.810> those<00:04:51.960> two
