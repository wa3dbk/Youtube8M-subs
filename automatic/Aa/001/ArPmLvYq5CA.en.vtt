arc or just a unlike a circle the
default<00:03:46.910> behavior<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.420> an<00:03:47.510> arc<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:48.380> choose

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
default behavior of an arc is to choose

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.229 
default behavior of an arc is to choose
the<00:03:48.650> start<00:03:49.130> point<00:03:51.549> then<00:03:52.549> a<00:03:52.579> second<00:03:53.000> point<00:03:53.209> and

the start point then a second point and
finally<00:03:56.239> an<00:03:56.360> end<00:03:56.510> point<00:03:56.780> will<00:03:57.049> define<00:03:57.410> the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
finally an end point will define the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.530 
finally an end point will define the
shape<00:03:57.859> of<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.130> arc<00:04:00.970> if<00:04:01.970> I'd<00:04:02.090> like<00:04:02.239> to<00:04:02.359> draw<00:04:02.510> my

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
do now is go through these exercises so

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.920 
do now is go through these exercises so
the<00:04:40.889> first<00:04:41.100> exercise<00:04:41.250> on<00:04:41.729> page<00:04:41.880> 28<00:04:42.330> tells<00:04:42.810> us

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
the first exercise on page 28 tells us

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.409 
the first exercise on page 28 tells us
to<00:04:43.020> draw<00:04:43.199> a<00:04:43.229> house<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:44.160> tree<00:04:44.430> using<00:04:45.180> the

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
to draw a house and a tree using the

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.820 
to draw a house and a tree using the
line<00:04:45.630> command<00:04:45.660> this<00:04:46.350> isn't<00:04:46.530> going<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.680> be<00:04:46.770> very

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
line command this isn't going to be very

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.570 
line command this isn't going to be very
precise

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
precise

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.960 
precise
so<00:04:48.000> I'll<00:04:48.090> just<00:04:48.240> start<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.539> line<00:04:48.690> command<00:04:49.970> draw

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
so I'll just start the line command draw

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.110 
so I'll just start the line command draw
the<00:04:51.090> basic<00:04:51.449> outline<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.780> my<00:04:51.990> house<00:04:52.139> and<00:04:53.120> I'll

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
the basic outline of my house and I'll

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.210 
the basic outline of my house and I'll
use<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.419> close<00:04:54.660> option<00:04:55.139> to<00:04:55.620> finish<00:04:55.889> up<00:04:56.039> this

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
use the close option to finish up this

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.710 
use the close option to finish up this
rectangle<00:04:58.849> I'll<00:04:59.849> begin<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.240> line<00:05:00.419> command

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
rectangle I'll begin the line command

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.270 
rectangle I'll begin the line command
again<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:02.370> draw<00:05:02.550> a<00:05:02.580> door<00:05:06.680> and<00:05:07.680> when<00:05:08.039> I'm<00:05:08.130> done

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
again to draw a door and when I'm done

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.870 
again to draw a door and when I'm done
with<00:05:08.430> that<00:05:08.490> door<00:05:08.820> I<00:05:09.000> can<00:05:09.539> just<00:05:09.720> press<00:05:09.870> ENTER<00:05:10.880> to

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
with that door I can just press ENTER to

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.550 
with that door I can just press ENTER to
finish<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.240> line<00:05:12.360> command<00:05:15.110> now<00:05:16.110> I'll<00:05:16.259> draw<00:05:16.440> in

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
finish the line command now I'll draw in

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:35.549 
finish the line command now I'll draw in
some<00:05:16.710> windows

00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:35.559 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:42.410 

at<00:05:36.159> a<00:05:36.219> roof

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.060 

now<00:05:42.990> you<00:05:43.080> can<00:05:43.230> imagine<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.740> tree<00:05:43.950> will<00:05:44.040> be

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
now you can imagine the tree will be

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.860 
now you can imagine the tree will be
drawn<00:05:44.340> in<00:05:44.580> almost<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.150> exact<00:05:45.450> same<00:05:45.660> manner

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
drawn in almost the exact same manner

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.590 
drawn in almost the exact same manner
then<00:05:46.650> on<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.830> bottom<00:05:47.100> of<00:05:47.190> page<00:05:47.250> 29<00:05:47.880> you'll<00:05:48.450> see

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
then on the bottom of page 29 you'll see

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.130 
then on the bottom of page 29 you'll see
another<00:05:48.810> exercise<00:05:49.470> to<00:05:49.800> create<00:05:50.250> a<00:05:50.280> Sun<00:05:51.050> to<00:05:52.050> do

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
another exercise to create a Sun to do

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.820 
another exercise to create a Sun to do
that<00:05:52.440> I'll<00:05:52.650> start<00:05:53.010> with<00:05:53.130> the<00:05:53.220> circle<00:05:53.400> command

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
that I'll start with the circle command

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.520 
that I'll start with the circle command
I'll<00:05:55.830> choose<00:05:56.070> a<00:05:56.100> center<00:05:56.430> point<00:05:56.580> for<00:05:56.760> my<00:05:56.970> son

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
I'll choose a center point for my son

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.650 
I'll choose a center point for my son
and<00:05:58.880> then<00:05:59.880> I'll<00:06:00.000> just<00:06:00.120> use<00:06:00.210> my<00:06:00.450> mouse<00:06:00.630> to

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
and then I'll just use my mouse to

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.900 
and then I'll just use my mouse to
choose<00:06:01.080> an<00:06:01.200> appropriate<00:06:01.290> radius<00:06:04.790> next<00:06:05.790> I'll

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
choose an appropriate radius next I'll

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.220 
choose an appropriate radius next I'll
start<00:06:06.120> adding<00:06:06.330> some<00:06:06.450> marks<00:06:06.920> type<00:06:07.920> a<00:06:08.130> for<00:06:08.340> arc

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
start adding some marks type a for arc

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.390 
start adding some marks type a for arc
choose<00:06:10.230> a<00:06:10.260> start<00:06:10.590> point<00:06:10.770> on<00:06:10.980> the<00:06:11.070> right<00:06:11.220> side

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
choose a start point on the right side

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.610 
choose a start point on the right side
of<00:06:11.490> my<00:06:11.580> circle<00:06:11.970> I<00:06:12.120> point<00:06:12.600> up<00:06:12.960> into<00:06:13.350> the<00:06:13.440> right

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
of my circle I point up into the right

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.750 
of my circle I point up into the right
from<00:06:13.860> that<00:06:14.010> and<00:06:14.300> then<00:06:15.300> finally<00:06:15.630> an<00:06:15.720> end<00:06:15.840> point

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
from that and then finally an end point

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.040 
from that and then finally an end point
then<00:06:17.760> I'll<00:06:17.880> just<00:06:18.030> continue<00:06:18.210> to<00:06:18.630> draw<00:06:18.840> arcs

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
then I'll just continue to draw arcs

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.730 
then I'll just continue to draw arcs
around<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:19.800> circle<00:06:20.160> in<00:06:20.310> this<00:06:20.460> same<00:06:20.700> manner
