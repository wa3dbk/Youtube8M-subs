let's take a look another glad sure how

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.050 
let's take a look another glad sure how
it's<00:01:59.820> done<00:02:00.320> okay<00:02:01.320> now<00:02:01.469> i<00:02:01.500> prefer<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.890> nte<00:02:02.460> then

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
it's done okay now i prefer the nte then

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.510 
it's done okay now i prefer the nte then
wall<00:02:03.390> heat<00:02:03.780> shrink<00:02:04.079> tubing<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.619> get<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.399> inch

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
wall heat shrink tubing I get the inch

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.100 
wall heat shrink tubing I get the inch
and<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.759> half<00:02:05.790> for<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.119> larger<00:02:06.509> section<00:02:06.899> which

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
and a half for the larger section which

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.320 
and a half for the larger section which
recovers<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.619> three-quarter<00:02:08.190> inch<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.580> of

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
recovers to three-quarter inch and of

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.550 
recovers to three-quarter inch and of
course<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.690> one<00:02:09.899> inch<00:02:10.080> which<00:02:10.289> recovers

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
course the one inch which recovers

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.149 
course the one inch which recovers
approximately<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> half<00:02:11.520> an

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
approximately to a half an

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.440 
approximately to a half an
so<00:02:13.159> what<00:02:13.310> I'll<00:02:13.430> do<00:02:13.549> is<00:02:13.579> I'll<00:02:13.760> cut<00:02:13.970> off<00:02:14.000> an<00:02:14.269> inch

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
so what I'll do is I'll cut off an inch

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.390 
so what I'll do is I'll cut off an inch
and<00:02:14.659> three<00:02:14.840> quarters<00:02:15.230> of<00:02:15.379> the<00:02:15.769> one<00:02:15.980> inch<00:02:16.189> heat

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
and three quarters of the one inch heat

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.250 
and three quarters of the one inch heat
shrink<00:02:16.700> tubing<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.420> then<00:02:17.900> I'll<00:02:18.019> cut<00:02:18.230> off

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
shrink tubing and then I'll cut off

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.080 
shrink tubing and then I'll cut off
three<00:02:18.620> quarters<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:18.950> an<00:02:19.099> inch<00:02:19.189> on<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.970> inch

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
three quarters of an inch on the inch

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.860 
three quarters of an inch on the inch
and<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.299> half<00:02:20.530> shrink<00:02:21.530> tubing<00:02:25.480> okay<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.510> simply

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
and a half shrink tubing okay I simply

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.110 
and a half shrink tubing okay I simply
take<00:02:27.049> the<00:02:27.079> shorter<00:02:27.530> section<00:02:27.920> go<00:02:28.879> ahead<00:02:29.090> and

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
take the shorter section go ahead and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.009 
take the shorter section go ahead and
level<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:29.959> out<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.409> top<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.859> unit<00:02:32.019> just

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
level it out to the top of the unit just

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.589 
level it out to the top of the unit just
like<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:34.400> I'll<00:02:34.549> cut<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.879> heat<00:02:35.329> gun<00:02:35.540> or

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
like that and I'll cut the heat gun or

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.050 
like that and I'll cut the heat gun or
low<00:02:36.970> work<00:02:37.970> my<00:02:38.120> way<00:02:38.269> around<00:02:39.489> for<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.730> does<00:02:40.939> not

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
low work my way around for it does not

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.750 
low work my way around for it does not
completely<00:02:41.390> perfect<00:02:42.280> because<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.489> can<00:02:43.640> go

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
blade of me be so it turns out for the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.030 
blade of me be so it turns out for the
