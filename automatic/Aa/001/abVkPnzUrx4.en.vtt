00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.619
 just the right car for this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.810
 to find steering wheel 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.060
 I would like a sports car so 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.410
 really much ps on the rear axle and 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.029
 nice to scratch the curves 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.590
 but it may also be economical 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.220
 his purse should be spared 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.869
 become 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.399
 on this steering wheel fits the custom gt 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.870
 gas sports car that is a 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.790
 single piece and I will today 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.270
 move welcome to street 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.520
 knows the automagazin it already belongs 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.079
 a lot of courage nowadays for a new 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.480
 to establish sports cars 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.399
 The competition is harder than ever 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.289
 large-scale manufacturer battles through 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.879
 the sports car upper class around itself 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.180
 to be able to part of the cake 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.800
 the custom gt comes with some ingredients 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.199
 which makes him unique in Germany 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.840
 make the base comes from one 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.359
 american manufacturer the us kettcar 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.949
 was completed in three years 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.110
 evolving the data are 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.909
 impressive 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.250
 450 ps from a corvette engine and that 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.820
 paired with gas drive and 14 liters 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.820
 consumption 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.810
 eleven months alone have the tÃ¼v decreases 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 lasted 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.409
 Patrick is curious what this 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.409
 poisonous green single piece on the box has 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.340
 how do you get your own car? 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.149
 to build 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.710
 We probably started in 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.700
 childhood in the car had fun 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.439
 At some point I said I want too 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.939
 build my own car while being one 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.070
 fair enough, all parts have to be said 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.179
 Of course not from us the bodies and 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.679
 also the lattice frame are out 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.390
 america originally because the form us 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.950
 like and the rest we have 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.810
 German standard to 5 compliant 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.250
 reconstructed from the beginning on that the door 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.289
 been involved in the project 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.789
 and there we said they are 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.560
 the components will use more 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.459
 that will be approved and then 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.450
 after that we also have the good ones 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.729
 selected technology partner 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.080
 for example, kw are for the landing gear 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.459
 very important technology partner of 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.970
 Dare drives really well and good 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.770
 handling has 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.970
 muuvit as a brake manufacturer too 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.679
 very important partner that the dare 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.630
 Of course, good braking just as 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.250
 Safety aspect especially when driving car 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.540
 without technical helper trains that 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.790
 means the car has by nature no 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.290
 abs or no esp there you should already 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.280
 components also use that on both 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.260
 the street as well as in racing 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.180
 work like a sports car 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.299
 I drive with LPG gas propulsion 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.549
 me now 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:34.500
 Let's see how we get in there 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:35.840
 somehow steering the head first 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.600
 move in 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.209
 left almost eighteen in there we are 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.689
 ever fall so upright here 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:52.670
 because of me is the good 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:54.590
 right nice bit third important 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.159
 is only the door close because if the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.260
 good shoulder 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:10.280
 Sometimes you do not get there like that 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:13.629
 easy to sit on so left we do 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.430
 ever put on the steering wheel 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.849
 central lock very practical and for 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.920
 This car is vital, there are two 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:26.470
 red switch up 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.470
 the inflammation is on fire 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.480
 I would not say so bad 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.349
 we can and we are now the 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.720
 Switch gas drive and valve operation 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.360
 and then it's time to go first 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.159
 let's see what the custom gt 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.159
 would like to do with us today 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.020
 again on it 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.920
 a sick one I'm not bad 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:26.710
 1050 guido that is of course best 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:30.180
 recipe for an agile handling kw 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.180
 Suspension also works 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.060
 treats 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.060
 raise lighter gas 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.460
 you can feel the car good good feedback 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.550
 it must be something 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.150
 50,000 euros 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.030
 7 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.500
 demands the crisp hand and I think 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.730
 without power steering 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.650
 surprisingly good 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.300
 quite simply we do not have any weight on it 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.070
 the front axle and there you come to 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.060
 theme weight distribution sound very 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.520
 easy on the front axle 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.520
 always enough 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.460
 deferred taxes 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.710
 the holy father 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.460
 melts 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.190
 that is the waste again 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.050
 then comes the hsg flow in custom gt 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.600
 do not work electronic helpers 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.310
 no esp I think I have to 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.479
 try what happens when i enter 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.479
 a little earlier than gasquet 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.339
 mas 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.450
 with the steering wheel 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.850
 decent delay on the brake 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.680
 but attention no abs 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.210
 that, of course, for the moment if it is 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.460
 really on the last point 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.470
 Braking is very difficult 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.470
 meter but the advantage 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.500
 1040 kg So hopefully much mass as 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.500
 to break 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.020
 despite all the performance and the driving fun 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.220
 the single piece has a lot 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.220
 to provide fine grinding 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.690
 we are the low translation so 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.700
 a normal curve you need 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.460
 almost 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.580
 to keep more steering angle 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.440
 sports cars are quite unusual for 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.949
 access to a curve by simply 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.960
 drive 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:41.030
 This is possible with a sports car 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.530
 not that has to be much fairer 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:48.820
 a quarter turns must turn 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:51.440
 rich to beautiful 190 sick to travel 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.910
 Of course it is extremely difficult for it 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.129
 me the sitting position only so always 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.219
 light 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:07:00.339
 We are allowed to correct the approaches 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:07:02.379
 take outside have it's high-volume car 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:04.389
 Everything was a lot of love you have 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:06.039
 a lot of heart blood but so pure 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:08.199
 I therefore lack the clarity 

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:10.629
 would have to where you at the traffic light the red 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:12.309
 to recognize the light I felt that way 

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:15.099
 500 meters stay in front of me 

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:17.529
 just not really out front 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:20.169
 she did not really know either side either 

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:22.779
 If I look in the mirror I can 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:23.949
 without getting off the stand of 

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:25.629
 Check coolant 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:28.209
 because in the rearview mirror depends exactly 

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:29.409
 the fund's purse cooling water so even 

00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:30.929
 not so bad on the spot possible 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:33.309
 just say 

00:07:30.929 --> 00:07:34.629
 One thing is for sure after a few rounds 

00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:36.580
 in the custom gt 

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:39.819
 I have to first on the rack 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.569
 Mittmann 195 is not that easy 

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:42.879
 to pack in 

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:45.249
 but basically I should think so 

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:48.189
 the big manufacturers x1 look it up 

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:50.740
 the weight is 1040 kilos at 450 ps 

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:53.259
 a total driving machine very much 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.959
 puristically without abs or esp without 

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:57.459
 Power steering of the gas drive in one 

00:07:55.959 --> 00:08:01.179
 sports cars that works right 

00:07:57.459 --> 00:08:03.669
 great thanks lpg gas for sports car drivers 

00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:05.709
 a ferrari 458 italia or 

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:07.779
 lamborghini gallardo too much of the 

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:10.959
 rod is just right 

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:12.969
 the custom gt just under 150000 euro for 

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:14.229
 this single piece would have to lie down 

00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:17.759
 I 'm curious how much we think about it 

00:08:14.229 --> 00:08:17.759
 to be seen on the street
