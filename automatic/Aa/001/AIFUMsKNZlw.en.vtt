00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
just going to go over the areas of the

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.530 
just going to go over the areas of the
folds<00:03:43.600> where<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.810> actual<00:03:43.900> light<00:03:44.350> already<00:03:44.800> is

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
folds where the actual light already is

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.880 
folds where the actual light already is
select<00:03:46.540> mid-tones<00:03:50.910> just<00:03:51.910> to<00:03:52.060> make<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.890> stand

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
select mid-tones just to make it stand

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:09.050

up<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.459> little<00:03:54.940> bit<00:03:55.060> more

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.500 

like<00:04:09.720> that

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.479 

try<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.170> use<00:04:13.349> a<00:04:13.379> brush<00:04:13.680> size<00:04:13.950> when<00:04:14.189> you<00:04:14.310> do

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
try and use a brush size when you do

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.430 
try and use a brush size when you do
this<00:04:14.670> roughly<00:04:15.659> the<00:04:15.689> size<00:04:15.959> of<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:16.290> area

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
this roughly the size of the area

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.870 
this roughly the size of the area
because<00:04:16.769> if<00:04:16.919> you<00:04:17.010> do<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.190> too<00:04:17.220> small<00:04:17.519> it<00:04:17.790> will

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
because if you do it too small it will

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.939 
because if you do it too small it will
just<00:04:18.030> look<00:04:18.209> like<00:04:18.449> you've<00:04:18.630> got<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.109> bunch<00:04:19.829> of

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
just look like you've got a bunch of

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:28.800 
just look like you've got a bunch of
white<00:04:20.220> lines<00:04:20.489> everywhere

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.700 

this<00:04:29.620> bit<00:04:29.860> for<00:04:30.010> reflection<00:04:30.669> on<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.880> coffee<00:04:31.710> so

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
this bit for reflection on the coffee so

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.379 
this bit for reflection on the coffee so
make<00:04:33.040> that<00:04:33.070> stand<00:04:33.490> out<00:04:33.730> a<00:04:33.760> little<00:04:33.940> bit<00:04:34.120> more

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
make that stand out a little bit more

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.780 
make that stand out a little bit more
and<00:04:37.410> I'm<00:04:38.410> going<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.590> go<00:04:38.710> into<00:04:38.889> our<00:04:39.070> arm<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.610> do

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
and I'm going to go into our arm and do

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.430 
and I'm going to go into our arm and do
a<00:04:39.820> little<00:04:40.090> bit<00:04:40.270> of<00:04:40.300> dodging<00:04:40.840> on<00:04:40.930> your<00:04:41.020> arm<00:04:41.230> as

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
a little bit of dodging on your arm as

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.070 
a little bit of dodging on your arm as
well<00:04:41.620> just<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.190> make<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.580> kind<00:04:43.570> of<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.870> light

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
well just to make the kind of the light

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.420 
well just to make the kind of the light
reflection<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:45.070> little<00:04:46.030> bit<00:04:46.150> stronger<00:04:47.430> all

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
reflection a little bit stronger all

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:56.520 
reflection a little bit stronger all
right<00:04:48.550> that<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.820> on<00:04:55.510> this<00:04:55.660> side<00:04:55.960> I'm<00:04:56.260> just

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
right that and on this side I'm just

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:10.839 
right that and on this side I'm just
going<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.770> dodge<00:04:57.070> that<00:04:57.100> a<00:04:57.490> little<00:04:57.880> bit

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:17.100 

okay<00:05:11.449> now<00:05:11.629> that's<00:05:11.839> looking<00:05:12.110> pretty<00:05:12.139> good<00:05:14.229> zoom

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
okay now that's looking pretty good zoom

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.239 
okay now that's looking pretty good zoom
okay<00:05:18.110> now<00:05:18.229> i'm<00:05:18.349> going<00:05:18.469> to<00:05:18.529> do<00:05:18.679> here<00:05:18.919> is<00:05:18.949> because

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:19.249 
okay now i'm going to do here is because

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:22.299 
okay now i'm going to do here is because
you<00:05:20.179> can<00:05:20.330> see<00:05:20.539> there's<00:05:20.809> not<00:05:21.649> an<00:05:21.800> awful<00:05:21.889> lot<00:05:22.189> of

00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:22.309 
you can see there's not an awful lot of

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:23.829 
you can see there's not an awful lot of
light<00:05:22.520> here<00:05:22.729> and<00:05:22.849> it's<00:05:22.969> just<00:05:23.300> basically<00:05:23.719> a

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:23.839 
light here and it's just basically a

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:26.739 
light here and it's just basically a
black<00:05:24.110> color<00:05:24.409> so<00:05:25.309> um<00:05:25.729> you<00:05:26.240> have<00:05:26.330> to<00:05:26.419> be<00:05:26.479> really

00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:26.749 
black color so um you have to be really

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:27.999 
black color so um you have to be really
careful<00:05:26.869> when<00:05:27.139> you're<00:05:27.259> dodging<00:05:27.469> these<00:05:27.740> areas

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
careful when you're dodging these areas

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:28.959 
careful when you're dodging these areas
because<00:05:28.339> otherwise<00:05:28.550> it<00:05:28.849> will<00:05:28.909> just

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:28.969 
because otherwise it will just

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.019 
because otherwise it will just
completely<00:05:29.869> screw<00:05:30.409> up<00:05:30.469> the<00:05:30.619> image<00:05:30.830> quality<00:05:31.029> so

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:32.029 
completely screw up the image quality so

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:33.969 
completely screw up the image quality so
i<00:05:32.360> just<00:05:33.050> want<00:05:33.229> to<00:05:33.289> bring<00:05:33.409> a<00:05:33.529> little<00:05:33.649> bit<00:05:33.830> more

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
i just want to bring a little bit more

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:42.089 
i just want to bring a little bit more
light<00:05:34.219> down<00:05:34.459> on<00:05:34.789> this<00:05:35.179> side<00:05:35.419> of<00:05:35.599> a<00:05:35.689> lag<00:05:38.830> like<00:05:39.830> so

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099 
light down on this side of a lag like so

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.639 
light down on this side of a lag like so
just<00:05:43.099> trying<00:05:43.369> to<00:05:43.459> mimic<00:05:43.639> that<00:05:44.439> light<00:05:45.439> coming

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:45.649 
just trying to mimic that light coming

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:46.899 
just trying to mimic that light coming
in<00:05:45.860> from<00:05:45.889> the<00:05:46.129> right<00:05:46.249> hand<00:05:46.429> side<00:05:46.519> there

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
in from the right hand side there

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.459 
in from the right hand side there
because<00:05:47.119> i<00:05:47.300> only<00:05:47.389> use<00:05:47.629> one<00:05:47.839> one<00:05:48.019> on<00:05:48.110> this<00:05:48.229> set

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
because i only use one one on this set

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:53.769 
because i only use one one on this set
up<00:05:48.679> and<00:05:49.179> you<00:05:50.179> can't<00:05:50.449> really<00:05:50.979> dodge<00:05:52.629> areas<00:05:53.629> of

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:53.779 
up and you can't really dodge areas of

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:55.299 
up and you can't really dodge areas of
extreme<00:05:54.229> darkness<00:05:54.559> because<00:05:54.919> it<00:05:55.039> will<00:05:55.129> just

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:55.309 
extreme darkness because it will just

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:58.359 
extreme darkness because it will just
make<00:05:55.519> the<00:05:55.999> image<00:05:56.179> look<00:05:56.360> awful<00:05:57.069> bear<00:05:58.069> that<00:05:58.279> in

00:05:58.359 --> 00:05:58.369 
make the image look awful bear that in
