00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.220
 actual topic what I am with today 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.600
 We have a unique network 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.850
 are meanwhile part of the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.350
 network unique network and so you 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.479
 also know and for a better understanding 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.460
 What that actually is, I have 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.380
 the managing director of unique network 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.060
 ultimate clap with the deconstruction 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.770
 at the start announces community arises 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.420
 Just go ahead and tell others 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.020
 Just something the unique network now 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.020
 exactly 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.670
 Of course, some of you know 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.869
 my job gameplays sounded channel soon 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.209
 already his normal channel and yes me 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.099
 I've got my own one now 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.899
 youtube network so completely own 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:51.830
 somehow now a contractor 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.630
 to have in the background 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.800
 and yes what are we we are still one 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.539
 young network and looking natural 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.569
 also partners and then we use too 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.739
 of course, here is this advertising space fun 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.890
 we wanted you anyway 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:08.099
 notify that vp is now officially member 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.220
 or partner with us means 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.590
 Of course, they also have many features 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.180
 to get that the videos stop 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.730
 so what better are we so 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.010
 take care that vp is really what 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.989
 really great is because 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.580
 I am also already a long time and me 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.870
 can only imagine that the whole 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.980
 also much better to expand 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.689
 be this whole little canal and 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.239
 on for yourself network normal youtube 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.950
 network you get great revenue say 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.870
 I now even that is usually whether the people 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.470
 actually we look 24 7 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.480
 support 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.129
 there is now also a trailer the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.870
 days of online will come then 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.739
 maybe in the description in it 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.540
 I do not know, in any case, net 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.950
 and yes we can only really stop 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.159
 Let's say we are the partners 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.250
 not like other networks 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:58.620
 I do not mention here by name 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.569
 We do not want to be profit-oriented 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.790
 Of course that means we get too 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.739
 revenue through you I say but 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.599
 we 'll take care of that 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.340
 you are doing the most well and watching 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.799
 not on our own things that is 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.480
 we have 24 7 extra support we 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.879
 support every single youtuber 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.519
 no matter if small or big we support 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.769
 just as we are so so sitting 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.500
 seen youtube network from youtube for 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.780
 youtube and yes that actually makes us 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.639
 a bit like anabolic steroids 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.569
 ask but just ask what had 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.519
 I then spent actually for 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.650
 it will be unique network 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.650
 Certainly some are interested too 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.739
 So I have the whole since one 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.900
 Couple of years in my head I wanted to go ahead 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.620
 six years through with youtube circa 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.540
 I wanted to start a network 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.370
 so I have said or wanted to say 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.440
 other people I support my that 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.840
 Of course I do with gtg now too 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.099
 that I support others but I am 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.139
 now, of course, the whole thing a bit 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.669
 raise larger 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.169
 because I did not even then 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.599
 really support but want 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.639
 This time many others will give it 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.980
 support and that is also here 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:08.159
 is there so we do the whole thing too 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.290
 so or market your channels of course 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.060
 also completely different than the others resp 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.220
 give us more 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.849
 I'll tell you more trouble in this 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.790
 bring to 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.260
 as others now generate in others 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.669
 is that, for example, so that stops 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.050
 really only on the big pay and 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.260
 look something but we can get in 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.110
 theoretically everyone we look in 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.150
 Reflecting quality here 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.880
 channel and quantity so it really 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.169
 not now we say you have 5 now 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.570
 have millions of subscribers or something 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.729
 Of course, we are exaggerated 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.990
 just look at each channel itself and 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.610
 if he pleases us next door 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.020
 contract 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.970
 That's definitely possible 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.680
 correct action that is a great start 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.880
 There are really few who do that 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.870
 and then it really does 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.160
 support others 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.770
 there is actually when I get it right 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.540
 that canon only gives one the people 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.010
 other all the coal through, so to speak 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.210
 who only make coal and then stop 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.220
 just pull out the profit 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.200
 if you tell yourself that's just it 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.790
 only makes are to support other 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.470
 In any case, a mega cashier actions 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.320
 my biggest respect you have here in 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.810
 the job and definitely people completely 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.700
 Honestly, of course, if you also participate 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.860
 This network will be reported 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.690

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.100

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.610
 would do that and I can only do one thing 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.750
 say it really is not wrong 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.070
