00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.260

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.790

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.100
 There's still a lot to do but 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.740

 while he's down here that one 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.030
 I thought I got there on the pc studio 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.290
 You did not hear it all, leaving a 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.390
 link in the description you may be 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.680

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.820

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.619

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.299

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.689
 Good, I'm not going to show everyone how much here 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.369
 because I'm all over here because I 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.829
 I'm going to make a video on Sunday doing 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.710
 this and showing both at will and 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.820
 also how the final result was not 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.220
 It's final because there's something to 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.479
 to do but we will advance this to the improvement 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.210
 which in more detail 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.549
 in the Sunday video not 360 that the egg 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.899
 brown beige or was here damn it 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.030
 I got the car here that she caused 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.649
 camac tires with the leg which you 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.369
 Learned it fits us here with the reading 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.099
 along with unveiled that already imagines him 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.200
 It's good, it also comes in the arm here. 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.330
 it's heavy 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.690
 then warns the rapidion forming from 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.760
 5 25 videos per day on the channel 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.980
 at the correct time at eight -thirty 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.620
 11 am to thirty in the morning at two 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.540
 mid - afternoon at 5:30 in the afternoon and at 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.080
 half past eight today at two-thirty 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.390
 has in May reached 11 6 the series 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.700
 next to the 2015 voter I think it will 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.069
 keep going out every day 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.420
 How are you supporting the series? 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.250
 I think the show is going to continue 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.019
 going out every day in general 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.450
 just do not know if ever the 11:30 it 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.880
 You can go out every day, but not at 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.480
 fixed time 11 6 can leave both 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.790
 eight at 8 and 6 8 and 6 8 6 in 2 hours and 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.950
 half the team tomorrow, first night she can 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.530
 let's say at any time announce 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.360
 2000 the rate of 26 in the afternoon 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.040
 series of art evils and thank you 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.450
 even support need it 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.890
 but then I think the series is in your 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.440
 bed 2000 and this you continue 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.690
 supporting will 5 only left every day 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.239
 but not on any day there is no schedule 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.680
 can be fixed every day but the recording 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.299
 was interrupted because the card 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.549
 memory ended up swelling 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.310
 But how are you talking about the flight series? 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.380
 simulator 2015 can yes continue to go out 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.569
 everyday as if you are still 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.389
 supporting however there is no fixed schedule 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.480
 as for example today will have the same 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.819
 Right 2015-5-thirty then 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.310
 You can continue to be every day but 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.109
 schedules there to not fixed in the 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.549
 can be in every day still as 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.049
 today after the afternoon 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.700
 but then this is a video support because 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.470
 will not end up in the field will stay 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.510
 filling the last minute again 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.430
 because I just delete some things there 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.620
 that it was unnecessary to open 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.420
 a little space in it but then there's the 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.760
 from today we will see again with five 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.290
 videos every day and I'm sorry for 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.660
 the latter is already betting - 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.160
 I just posted - because I was a 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.870
 bit of ear pain and also 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.250
 I was working this lot of stuff. 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.380
 here you will see this 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.690
 probably on Sunday I think 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.190

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.560

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.750
 All this stuff 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:14.959
 Saying that every day can come in 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.030

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.190

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.440
 vague in the tent in the chamber what beauty I 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.019

 she turned singer would end then 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.150
 this is what exploded between 11 6 2 6 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.340

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.050
