take it out play some the slider like
this<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.860> replace<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> screw

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
this and then just replace the screw

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.870 
this and then just replace the screw
back<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.119> really<00:01:25.020> easy<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.759> on

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.789 
back in really easy and just do it on
the<00:01:27.000> other<00:01:27.030> side<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:27.540> well<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.020> then<00:01:28.650> your

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the other side as well and then your

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.550 
the other side as well and then your
slider<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.729> ready<00:01:30.720> already

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
slider is actually ready already

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:45.289 
slider is actually ready already
I<00:01:42.920> believe<00:01:43.920> previous<00:01:44.250> models<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.030> glide

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
I believe previous models of the glide

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.819 
I believe previous models of the glide
tracks<00:01:45.600> were<00:01:45.780> sold<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.680> then

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
tracks were sold like this but then

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.280 
tracks were sold like this but then
two-hybrid<00:01:47.130> came<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.570> hybrid<00:01:48.720> has<00:01:49.079> these

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
two-hybrid came and the hybrid has these

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.130 
two-hybrid came and the hybrid has these
like<00:01:49.970> adjustable<00:01:50.970> things<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> height

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
like adjustable things for the height

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.649 
like adjustable things for the height
here's<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> locking<00:01:53.549> nut<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.270> slider

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
here's the locking nut for the slider

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.109 
here's the locking nut for the slider
pad<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.829> base<00:01:56.040> plate<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.520> unlock<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.090> and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
pad the base plate just unlock it and

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.959 
pad the base plate just unlock it and
you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.390> slide<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.810> around<00:01:58.049> or<00:01:58.890> lock<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.430> if

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
you can slide it around or lock it if

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.420 
you can slide it around or lock it if
you<00:02:00.149> want<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.540> lock<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.979> then<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.280> these

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
you want to lock it then you have these

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.270 
you want to lock it then you have these
things<00:02:03.110> they<00:02:04.110> come<00:02:04.320> with<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.560> hybrid<00:02:04.740> setup

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
things they come with the hybrid setup

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.449 
things they come with the hybrid setup
these<00:02:06.090> are<00:02:06.240> used<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.689> adjust<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.920> height<00:02:08.009> of

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
these are used to adjust the height of

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.390 
these are used to adjust the height of
the<00:02:08.849> slider<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.539> maybe<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.709> ground<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.250> not

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the slider and maybe the ground is not

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.449 
the slider and maybe the ground is not
even<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:13.110> put<00:02:14.069> them<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.280> different

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
even so you can put them in different

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.400 
even so you can put them in different
heights<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.239> then<00:02:15.390> your<00:02:15.900> glider<00:02:16.170> is

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
heights and then your glider is

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.309 
heights and then your glider is
perfectly<00:02:17.010> straight<00:02:17.690> even<00:02:18.690> certain<00:02:19.050> through

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
perfectly straight even certain through

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.199 
perfectly straight even certain through
the<00:02:19.410> holes<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.920> each<00:02:20.099> side<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.970> legs

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
the holes on each side of the legs

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.910 
the holes on each side of the legs
they're<00:02:22.050> little<00:02:22.349> adjustment<00:02:23.010> screws

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
they're little adjustment screws

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.330 
they're little adjustment screws
just<00:02:24.310> unscrew<00:02:24.520> it<00:02:24.850> put<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.480> thing<00:02:25.690> in<00:02:26.340> the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
just unscrew it put the thing in the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.460 
just unscrew it put the thing in the
black<00:02:27.580> knob<00:02:27.880> on<00:02:28.120> again<00:02:28.420> they're<00:02:29.050> like<00:02:29.200> rubber

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
black knob on again they're like rubber

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.130 
black knob on again they're like rubber
knobs<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:30.100> heard<00:02:30.310> they<00:02:30.520> they<00:02:31.000> don't<00:02:31.240> like<00:02:31.780> when
