Hank<00:00:25.430> prepared<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.760> accelerated

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
Hank prepared for this accelerated

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.569 
Hank prepared for this accelerated
finish<00:00:27.990> at<00:00:28.110> oh<00:00:30.290> so<00:00:31.290> this<00:00:31.770> seems<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> bit<00:00:32.250> crude

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
finish at oh so this seems a bit crude

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.850 
finish at oh so this seems a bit crude
but<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.820> think<00:00:33.060> it<00:00:33.180> gives<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.630> small<00:00:33.960> advantage

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
but I think it gives one small advantage

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.150 
but I think it gives one small advantage
these<00:00:35.820> blacks<00:00:36.329> thinking<00:00:36.900> already<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.440> bit

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
these blacks thinking already a bit

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.140 
these blacks thinking already a bit
concerned<00:00:38.370> about<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:41.730> potentially

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
concerned about this so it's potentially

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.220 
concerned about this so it's potentially
weakening<00:00:42.540> his<00:00:42.780> dart<00:00:43.020> squares<00:00:43.610> maybe<00:00:44.610> h4<00:00:45.329> h5

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
weakening his dart squares maybe h4 h5

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.780 
weakening his dart squares maybe h4 h5
to<00:00:46.410> try<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.680> soften<00:00:46.860> blackout<00:00:47.400> on<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.550> King

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
to try and soften blackout on the King

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.530 
to try and soften blackout on the King
side<00:00:48.030> will<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.170> useful<00:00:49.380> by<00:00:49.650> there<00:00:50.000> if<00:00:51.000> night

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
side will be a useful by there if night

00:00:51.540 --> 00:01:01.240 
side will be a useful by there if night
g7<00:00:54.980> River<00:00:55.980> Bishop<00:00:56.400> g5<00:00:56.790> having<00:00:57.330> age<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.750> fast

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.899 

all<00:01:02.250> right<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.610> h5<00:01:03.090> Bishop<00:01:03.450> g5<00:01:03.930> maybe<00:01:04.909> cos

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
all right so if h5 Bishop g5 maybe cos

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.320 
all right so if h5 Bishop g5 maybe cos
was<00:01:06.119> maybe<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.570> age<00:01:06.810> 5<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.909> think<00:01:08.970> black

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
was maybe just age 5 so I think black

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.090 
was maybe just age 5 so I think black
needs<00:01:09.509> to<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.720> concerned<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.470> always<00:01:10.860> got

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
