00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.500
 what we have to play 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.890
 aware of how many points 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.140
 that are per place by dispute and 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.580
 we obviously want to accumulate the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.310
 more points to be able to 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.100
 to reach an area is the silicone of 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.430
 classification English that can not 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.890
 worry much the other rivals what 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.899
 important that today we depend on 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.580
 us and with the water not to pass that 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.470
 first test and after closing the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.600
 local standard 9 the tri will move 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.369
 towards the Peruvian capital where 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.800
 week you will have to ready the eleven 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.470
 holder to face the selected 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.759
 peru from peru the oven pressing 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.350
 'we are aware that they play 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.790
 of locals we do the same 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.190
 well let's go from local we are going to press 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.390
 to the rival to have us the ball not 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.369
 they know when what our local in 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.420
 our skill so it's going to be what 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.460
 same 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.570
 I'm going to do it's going to be very similar to what 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.920
 that was with Germany from a first 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.350
 minute so that it will press 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.509
 take away the ball then this the most 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.060
 weak a lot of choice does not work for 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.700
 nothing to improve the match with Peru not 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.409
 I will pass that and take out or point 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.700
 important that we need until the 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.700
 moment is not complete
