types of restoration we have we have

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
types of restoration we have we have
what's<00:00:31.649> called<00:00:31.710> authoritative<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:32.879> have

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
what's called authoritative and we have

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.329 
what's called authoritative and we have

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159 
restore this lower machine down here is

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.869 
restore this lower machine down here is
going<00:00:41.159> to<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:41.640> replicate<00:00:42.420> any<00:00:43.190> changes<00:00:44.190> from

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
going to then replicate any changes from

the other domain controllers this is

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.560 
the other domain controllers this is
very<00:00:47.100> useful<00:00:47.370> let's<00:00:47.760> say<00:00:47.909> that<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.210> domain

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
very useful let's say that this domain

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.420 
very useful let's say that this domain
controller<00:00:48.629> fell<00:00:49.530> over<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:49.920> died<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.399> know

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
controller fell over and died you know

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.029 
controller fell over and died you know
hard<00:00:50.820> drive<00:00:51.030> caught<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.480> fire<00:00:51.690> whatever<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.440> can

hard drive caught on fire whatever I can

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.290 
hard drive caught on fire whatever I can
grab<00:00:53.280> my<00:00:53.899> my<00:00:54.899> backup<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:56.340> restore<00:00:56.730> using<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
grab my my backup I can restore using a

grab my my backup I can restore using a
non<00:00:57.480> authoritative<00:00:57.989> restore<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.620> comes<00:00:58.859> back

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
non authoritative restore it comes back

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.930 
non authoritative restore it comes back
online

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
online

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.849 
online
then<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.510> contacts<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> other<00:01:01.530> domain

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
then it contacts the other domain

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.820 
then it contacts the other domain
controllers<00:01:02.429> and<00:01:02.609> says<00:01:02.789> hey<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.929> changes<00:01:04.619> do

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
controllers and says hey what changes do

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.620 
controllers and says hey what changes do
you<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:05.910> all<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> these<00:01:06.300> changes

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
you have and then all of these changes

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.260 
you have and then all of these changes
are<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.200> be<00:01:07.289> replicated<00:01:08.039> down<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:09.000> this

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
are going to be replicated down to this

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
are going to be replicated down to this
domain<00:01:09.899> controller<00:01:09.960> makes<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.100> pretty<00:01:11.250> easy

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
domain controller makes it pretty easy

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.859 
domain controller makes it pretty easy
this<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.729> great<00:01:12.119> if<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.780> know

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
this is great if you have you know

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.190 
this is great if you have you know
recovery<00:01:13.860> from<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.100> failure<00:01:14.630> but<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.140> do

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
recovery from a failure but what if I do

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.520 
recovery from a failure but what if I do
something<00:01:16.679> silly<00:01:17.390> what<00:01:18.390> if<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.690> go<00:01:18.929> in<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.470> I

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
something silly what if I go in and I

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.469 
something silly what if I go in and I
delete<00:01:19.920> an<00:01:20.039> organizational<00:01:20.820> unit<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
delete an organizational unit and I

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.270 
delete an organizational unit and I
didn't<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.929> it<00:01:22.080> protected<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.800> don't<00:01:23.009> have

controllers<00:01:51.360> will<00:01:51.509> replicate<00:01:51.750> delete<00:01:52.470> it

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
controllers will replicate delete it
