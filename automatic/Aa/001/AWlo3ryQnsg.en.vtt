and when this game was released last
year<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.330> didn't<00:00:42.629> really<00:00:42.720> receive<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
year it didn't really receive the

year it didn't really receive the
warmest<00:00:43.769> reception<00:00:44.390> probably<00:00:45.390> because<00:00:45.870> it

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
warmest reception probably because it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.170 
warmest reception probably because it
has<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.470> many<00:00:46.650> similarities<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.339> the<00:00:47.699> recent

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
has so many similarities to the recent

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.569 
has so many similarities to the recent
Batman<00:00:48.420> Arkham<00:00:48.839> games<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.400> good

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
Batman Arkham games and it's not as good

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.729 
Batman Arkham games and it's not as good
as<00:00:50.699> those<00:00:50.820> games<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> wasn't<00:00:52.409> really<00:00:52.589> sure

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
as those games so I wasn't really sure

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.670 
as those games so I wasn't really sure
what<00:00:52.769> to<00:00:53.070> expect<00:00:53.100> when<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.699> started<00:00:54.089> but<00:00:54.899> after

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
what to expect when I started but after

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.200 
what to expect when I started but after
playing<00:00:55.829> all<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.489> way<00:00:56.579> through<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> game<00:00:57.000> I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
playing all the way through the game I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.670 
playing all the way through the game I
understand<00:00:57.840> why<00:00:57.989> people<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.440> some

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
understand why people have some

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.920 
understand why people have some
frustration<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.969> honestly<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> really

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
frustration but honestly I really

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.020 
frustration but honestly I really
enjoyed<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.309> controls<00:01:02.640> took<00:01:02.879> some

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
enjoyed it the controls took some

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.999 
enjoyed it the controls took some
getting<00:01:03.270> used<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.379> didn't<00:01:04.680> really<00:01:04.830> care

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
getting used to and I didn't really care

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.499 
getting used to and I didn't really care
for<00:01:05.220> their<00:01:05.309> button<00:01:05.550> layout<00:01:05.759> all<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> time

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
for their button layout all the time

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:07.850 
for their button layout all the time
you<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.960> use<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.259> left<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.770> right

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
you have to use the left and right

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.980 
you have to use the left and right
shoulder<00:01:08.130> buttons<00:01:08.550> pretty<00:01:08.820> often<00:01:09.149> but<00:01:09.810> once

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
shoulder buttons pretty often but once

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.540 
shoulder buttons pretty often but once
you<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.200> used<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.830> combat<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.369> pretty

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
you get used to it the combat is pretty

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.930 
you get used to it the combat is pretty
good

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
good

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.150 
good
hopefully<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> most<00:01:12.930> important<00:01:13.500> aspect<00:01:14.039> to

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
hopefully the most important aspect to

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.830 
hopefully the most important aspect to
the<00:01:14.250> combat<00:01:14.640> they<00:01:14.910> needed<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.300> get<00:01:15.450> right<00:01:15.660> was

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the combat they needed to get right was

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.440 
the combat they needed to get right was
the<00:01:16.020> shield<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.310> think<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.729> they<00:01:17.880> use<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the shield and I think that they use the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.270 
the shield and I think that they use the
shield<00:01:18.660> pretty<00:01:18.960> well<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.649> incorporate<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
shield pretty well they incorporate it

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.160 
shield pretty well they incorporate it
nicely<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:20.820> they<00:01:21.149> don't<00:01:21.450> require<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.140> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
nicely but they don't require you to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.870 
nicely but they don't require you to
constantly<00:01:22.950> stop<00:01:23.220> what<00:01:23.399> you're<00:01:23.460> doing<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
constantly stop what you're doing and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.940 
constantly stop what you're doing and
throw<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.810> when<00:01:25.289> you're<00:01:25.440> in<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> middle

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
throw it and when you're in the middle

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.160 
throw it and when you're in the middle
of<00:01:26.009> combat<00:01:26.220> issues<00:01:26.910> nicely<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.720> counter

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
of combat issues nicely for counter

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.230 
of combat issues nicely for counter
attacks<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.039> last<00:01:29.250> item<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.670> combat<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
attacks the last item in the combat that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.570 
attacks the last item in the combat that
I<00:01:30.300> want<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.229> talk<00:01:31.410> about<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> ability<00:01:32.369> to

I want to talk about is the ability to
fill<00:01:32.819> up<00:01:32.940> a<00:01:33.090> power<00:01:33.420> meter<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.679> do<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.039> by

like the ability to land any punch take

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:48.109 
like the ability to land any punch take

into super soldier which makes you
invincible<00:01:50.580> for<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> short<00:01:51.390> time<00:01:51.599> unless<00:01:51.959> you

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
invincible for a short time unless you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.749 
invincible for a short time unless you
pretty<00:01:52.380> much<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.739> tear<00:01:52.890> up<00:01:53.039> anybody<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.580> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
pretty much just tear up anybody on the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.570 
pretty much just tear up anybody on the
screen<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:55.080> this<00:01:55.200> game<00:01:55.440> is<00:01:55.649> pretty<00:01:56.250> linear

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
screen now this game is pretty linear

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.729 
screen now this game is pretty linear
and<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.239> really<00:01:57.509> don't<00:01:57.599> mind<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.989> at<00:01:58.140> all<00:01:58.229> but

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:58.739 
and I really don't mind that at all but

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.589 
and I really don't mind that at all but
I<00:01:59.009> think<00:01:59.039> probably<00:01:59.670> some<00:02:00.060> people<00:02:00.179> will<00:02:00.420> view

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
I think probably some people will view

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.719 
I think probably some people will view
it<00:02:00.660> as<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> negative<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.099> the<00:02:02.190> things<00:02:02.399> that

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
it as a negative one of the things that

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.249 
it as a negative one of the things that
I<00:02:02.759> think<00:02:02.970> that<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> linearity<00:02:03.450> lends<00:02:03.929> itself

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
I think that the linearity lends itself

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.010 
I think that the linearity lends itself
to<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.800> there<00:02:05.459> isn't<00:02:05.879> a<00:02:06.030> need<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.569> voice<00:02:06.780> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
to is there isn't a need for a voice to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.600 
to is there isn't a need for a voice to
constantly<00:02:07.530> chime<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.190> tell<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.489> what

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
constantly chime in and tell you what

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.699 
constantly chime in and tell you what
you<00:02:08.729> need<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.970> be<00:02:09.060> doing<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:10.259> far<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
you need to be doing and as far as the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.040 
you need to be doing and as far as the
rest<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> audio<00:02:11.520> goes<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.180> liked<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.840> I

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
rest of the audio goes I liked it I

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.760 
rest of the audio goes I liked it I
liked

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
liked

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.980 
liked
music<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.130> like<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.520> sound<00:02:14.730> effects<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.390> it

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
music I like the sound effects and it

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.900 
music I like the sound effects and it
was<00:02:16.080> pretty<00:02:16.260> cool<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.710> hear<00:02:16.920> dialogue<00:02:17.460> done<00:02:17.730> by

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
was pretty cool to hear dialogue done by

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.030 
was pretty cool to hear dialogue done by
the<00:02:17.970> actors<00:02:18.450> from<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.690> movie<00:02:18.950> there<00:02:19.950> are

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
the actors from the movie there are

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.010 
the actors from the movie there are
times<00:02:20.310> where<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.240> graphics<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:21.960> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
times where the graphics and the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.870 
times where the graphics and the
environments<00:02:22.680> can<00:02:22.770> be<00:02:22.890> pretty<00:02:23.160> bland<00:02:23.670> and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
environments can be pretty bland and

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.760 
environments can be pretty bland and
maybe<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.150> little<00:02:24.510> inaccurate<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:25.380> pushing

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
maybe a little inaccurate like pushing

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.480 
maybe a little inaccurate like pushing
off<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.130> space<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.240> wall<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:28.710> thought<00:02:29.220> for

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
off of space in a wall but I thought for

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.650 
off of space in a wall but I thought for
the<00:02:29.550> most<00:02:29.700> part<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> characters<00:02:30.420> looked

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
the most part the characters looked

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.330 
the most part the characters looked
really<00:02:30.960> good<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.440> just<00:02:31.950> wished<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.190> there

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
really good I just wished that there

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.950 
really good I just wished that there
would<00:02:32.520> have<00:02:32.610> been<00:02:32.670> more<00:02:32.910> variety<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.510> enemy

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
would have been more variety and enemy

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.860 
would have been more variety and enemy
and<00:02:34.200> definitely<00:02:34.650> more<00:02:34.980> bosses<00:02:35.720> visually<00:02:36.720> the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
and definitely more bosses visually the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.110 
and definitely more bosses visually the
biggest<00:02:37.170> issue<00:02:37.350> with<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> 360<00:02:38.310> version<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.880> that

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
biggest issue with a 360 version is that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.420 
biggest issue with a 360 version is that
the<00:02:39.180> framerate<00:02:39.750> can<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.320> drop<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:41.040> make<00:02:41.310> it

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
the framerate can you drop and make it

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.460 
the framerate can you drop and make it
feel<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.670> little<00:02:41.760> choppy<00:02:42.150> at<00:02:42.390> times<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:43.380> not

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
feel a little choppy at times it's not

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.980 
feel a little choppy at times it's not
saying<00:02:43.740> that<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:43.890> big<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.550> deal<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.840> is

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
saying that that big of a deal but it is

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.660 
saying that that big of a deal but it is
noticeable<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.740> if<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:47.040> can<00:02:47.190> need<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.340> bring<00:02:47.550> it

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
noticeable so if I can need to bring it

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.970 
noticeable so if I can need to bring it
out<00:02:48.020> now<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.260> games<00:02:49.500> been<00:02:49.560> out<00:02:49.770> for<00:02:49.950> a
