exclusively<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.070> CBC<00:02:02.700> because<00:02:03.420> she

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
exclusively to the CBC because she

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.530 
exclusively to the CBC because she
wanted<00:02:03.930> people<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:04.740> happened

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
wanted people to see what happened

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.660 
wanted people to see what happened
I<00:02:05.690> think<00:02:06.110> it's<00:02:06.260> something<00:02:06.520> everyone<00:02:07.520> should

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
I think it's something everyone should

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.150 
I think it's something everyone should
know<00:02:08.060> that<00:02:08.270> it's<00:02:08.450> like<00:02:08.810> they<00:02:09.560> have<00:02:09.590> not<00:02:09.979> done

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
know that it's like they have not done

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.650 
know that it's like they have not done
anything<00:02:10.460> and<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.850> police<00:02:11.120> might<00:02:11.330> have<00:02:11.360> gone

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
anything and the police might have gone

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.710 
anything and the police might have gone
a<00:02:11.720> little<00:02:11.990> bit<00:02:12.230> too<00:02:12.380> far<00:02:12.590> by<00:02:13.040> hurting<00:02:13.400> them<00:02:13.760> um

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
a little bit too far by hurting them um

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.140 
a little bit too far by hurting them um
and<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.950> truth<00:02:16.190> I<00:02:16.490> think<00:02:16.790> everyone

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
and it's the truth I think everyone

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.180 
and it's the truth I think everyone
should<00:02:17.180> know<00:02:17.540> Thomas<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.710> Jones<00:02:18.980> are

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
should know Thomas and Jones are

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.070 
should know Thomas and Jones are
reluctant<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.790> see<00:02:20.030> anything<00:02:20.390> critical<00:02:20.690> about

reluctant to see anything critical about

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.200 
reluctant to see anything critical about
the<00:02:21.230> police<00:02:21.560> but<00:02:22.280> they<00:02:22.340> feel<00:02:22.670> they<00:02:22.910> were<00:02:22.970> doing

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
the police but they feel they were doing
