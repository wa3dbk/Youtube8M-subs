00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.520
 As I opened my eyes on the altar, 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.610
 I saw the holy chalice with the blood of Jesus 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.980
 and from within that same chalice rose, 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.740
 majestic the Eucharist. 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.600
 In your presence I feel, 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.440
 a beggar seated at the table of a king 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.070
 and without having to pay such a meal, 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.710
 I can only give you everlasting gratitude. 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.910
 The chalice and the host were one, 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.870
 my desire was also with them to be one. 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.570
 Be one heart, my Lord! 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.340
 The same blood in your veins, Lord! 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.920
 And being united with you, forget me, 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.310
 grant that I may remain forever so.
