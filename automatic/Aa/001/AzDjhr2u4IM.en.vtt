the first episode they hop around and
they<00:02:47.340> sub<00:02:47.670> divided<00:02:48.030> into<00:02:48.359> smaller<00:02:48.720> blobs<00:02:49.109> when

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
they sub divided into smaller blobs when

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.020 
they sub divided into smaller blobs when
they're<00:02:49.739> killed<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.340> when<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.549> smallest

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
they're killed and when the smallest

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.330 
they're killed and when the smallest
blobs<00:02:51.420> are<00:02:51.720> killed<00:02:52.049> they<00:02:52.379> drop<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:52.980> slimeball

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
blobs are killed they drop a slimeball
