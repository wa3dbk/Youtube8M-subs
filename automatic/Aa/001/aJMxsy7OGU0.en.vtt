let's<00:00:33.149> transform<00:00:33.480> him<00:00:33.600> he<00:00:34.590> does<00:00:34.800> need<00:00:35.040> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
let's transform him he does need to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.150 
let's transform him he does need to
stand<00:00:35.239> because<00:00:36.239> he<00:00:36.630> find<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.020> heavy<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.950> pop<00:00:40.950> him

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
stand because he find a heavy so pop him

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.380 
stand because he find a heavy so pop him
off<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.309> his<00:00:42.469> stand<00:00:43.760> take<00:00:44.760> off<00:00:44.910> his<00:00:45.059> two<00:00:46.020> weapon

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
off of his stand take off his two weapon

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.639 
off of his stand take off his two weapon
and<00:00:48.390> let's<00:00:48.899> transform<00:00:49.320> him<00:00:49.440> again<00:00:51.320> he<00:00:52.320> doesn't

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and let's transform him again he doesn't

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.500 
and let's transform him again he doesn't
really<00:00:52.860> require<00:00:53.100> any<00:00:53.579> parts<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.149> come<00:00:54.300> off

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
really require any parts to come off

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.090 
really require any parts to come off
it's<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.680> makes<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
it's just that it makes the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.830 
it's just that it makes the
transformation<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.149> whole<00:00:57.899> lot<00:00:58.140> easier<00:00:59.840> so

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
transformation a whole lot easier so

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.280 
transformation a whole lot easier so
that's<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> do<00:01:02.300> don't<00:01:03.300> complain<00:01:03.719> because

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290
