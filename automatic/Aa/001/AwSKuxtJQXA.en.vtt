00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:12.389
 a young girl named sara somehow 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.969
 mysteriously gets scary 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.730
 abandoned hospital why is she from 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.890
 does not remember all that Sarah has a smartphone with 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.539
 flashlight and map sometimes for this 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.609
 unknown person is calling to smartphone 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.919
 who speak in a fake voice 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.740
 girls some meaningless phrases 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.589
 what to do in a situation like that 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.840
 look for a way out daylight game is about 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.910
 this for two or three hours you 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.399
 You will walk along dark dark corridors 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.469
 hospitals and neighborhoods finding foggy 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.120
 notes and scraps of newspapers still be 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.010
 get scared when you scream 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.010
 jump out the ghost of a dead young 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.230
 a witch in general is the whole scheme for 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.539
 which is well-built game very simple 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.030
 daylight is conditionally divided into several 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.829
 sections each such section consists of 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.289
 entangled from native corridors and 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.149
 rooms lugs to move from one 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.160
 such a section to another account 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.320
 collect old records that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.280
 gradually reveal the essence of what is happening 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.920
 here devilry 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.780
 the tees are scattered everywhere 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.180
 Tati need to fry every centimeter 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.770
 every deadlock branch of these 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.300
 corridors as soon as you collect 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.370
 several such records 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.560
 in one of the rooms a key will appear in the form 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.870
 any old junk this key 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.030
 need to take a free hand and bring in 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.250
 the other end of the card after that all 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.320
 begins on a new one only in others 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.840
 the scenery itself is a process of these 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.630
 searches will scare you scare the whole 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.490
 rustling and howling 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.350
 randomly pop-up stimuli 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.810
 the ghost of a dead witch 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.420
 It is obvious that daylight was created exactly 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.670
 for the sake of these relatively sudden scenes with 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.980
 ghost they work here as it should 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.710
 smartphone screen is obstructed 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.840
 where does the strange noise come from 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.210
 somewhere near appears pale 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.250
 screaming corpse he may appear in front 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.740
 from the side right behind the back or behind the door 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.540
 which you are going to open sometimes 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.030
 the corpse is generally without any 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.280
 signals don't get scared in such cases 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.930
 hard creators of the game used the most 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.060
 banal 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.670
 and the most effective technique lined up 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.070
 around him the whole game ended up like this 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.170
 what's working here is just him in contrast 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.690
 from everything else attack ghost 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.060
 you can't even throw a smartphone into it 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.250
 but ghost can get rid of if you ignite 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.440
 the red signal cartridge is on 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.030
 however not too long so in 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.250
 some places ammunition accounted for 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.290
 spend one by one if scare away 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.630
 dead munich because they have to run 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.060
 have to run and at the end of each 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.680
 sections as soon as you find the key with 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.260
 key in hand to use signal 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.540
 cartridges can't all sound like that 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.850
 like daylight dynamic horror but on 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.890
 far from 90 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.239
 percent of the game you will walk slowly 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.910
 from one corridor to another 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.430
 and carefully examine every corner 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.320
 maybe just behind this old box 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.720
 lying around you need a piece of paper 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.550
 maybe there is a signal chuck in 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.500
 most cases of course there is nothing 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.520
 no even when you find old 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.950
 scrapbook documents 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.380
 interest does not add much 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.780
 for the most part this is the standard no 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.000
 noteworthy patient description reports 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.730
 and deliberately terrible incidents or to 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.480
 the newspaperâ€™s example is also not particularly 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.790
 are interesting 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.220
 of course in the course of the game all these scraps 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.370
 will form a built-in chain and you will be 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.769
 it is clear who Sara is and what she does 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.680
 in this hospital honestly us this 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.640
 the opening never bothered 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.560
 it was supposed to be daylight 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.780
 replayability because the arrangement of rooms 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.940
 and it automatically generates the corridors 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.220
 in reality it seemed that due to poor 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.110
 design each new passage will be 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.810
 look exactly the same as 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.180
 previous but the truth is someone 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.640
 seriously thought that if two are the same 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.620
 rooms swap something from it 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.019
 change the impression that 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.360
 zombie studios just really wanted 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.970
 make at least some horror just to 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.340
 he was in daylight today 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.380
 no point whatsoever this game 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.780
 which carries absolutely nothing 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.480
 new and everything old in it is already too 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.100
 hackneyed and uninteresting and although if you 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.950
 just want to get scared on the cheap 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:14.350
 you will certainly achieve this 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.350
 Good luck and see you on the playground.ru
