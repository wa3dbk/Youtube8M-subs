00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
we understand that this is a huge

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.490 
we understand that this is a huge
challenge<00:01:48.670> but<00:01:49.510> it's<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.810> challenge<00:01:50.080> we<00:01:50.470> need

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
challenge but it's a challenge we need

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.370 
challenge but it's a challenge we need
to<00:01:51.010> address<00:01:54.090> after<00:01:55.090> all<00:01:55.270> we're<00:01:55.870> all<00:01:55.900> living

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
to address after all we're all living

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.980 
to address after all we're all living
longer<00:01:56.410> which<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.520> good<00:01:57.700> news<00:01:57.910> for<00:01:57.940> us<00:01:58.270> but<00:01:58.840> it

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
longer which is good news for us but it

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.960 
longer which is good news for us but it
also<00:01:59.170> means<00:01:59.680> we're<00:01:59.920> using<00:02:00.130> health<00:02:00.550> and<00:02:00.760> social

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
also means we're using health and social

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.230 
also means we're using health and social
care<00:02:01.330> services<00:02:01.600> for<00:02:01.930> longer<00:02:02.470> -<00:02:05.760> this<00:02:06.760> means<00:02:07.000> a

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
care services for longer - this means a

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:15.510 
care services for longer - this means a
greater<00:02:07.510> demand<00:02:07.930> for<00:02:08.050> services<00:02:14.250> whilst<00:02:15.250> our

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
greater demand for services whilst our

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.490 
greater demand for services whilst our
funding<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.150> staying<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.600> same<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:20.050> we've<00:02:20.230> got

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
funding is staying the same so we've got

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.010 
funding is staying the same so we've got
to<00:02:20.740> think<00:02:21.040> smarter<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.270> more<00:02:22.540> out<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.780> our

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
to think smarter to get more out of our

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.460 
to think smarter to get more out of our
existing<00:02:23.590> facilities<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.450> resources<00:02:28.470> we

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
existing facilities and resources we

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.800 
existing facilities and resources we
already<00:02:29.680> have<00:02:30.160> some<00:02:30.400> excellent<00:02:30.850> examples<00:02:31.150> of

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
already have some excellent examples of

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.900 
already have some excellent examples of
services<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.800> have<00:02:32.950> found<00:02:33.160> ways<00:02:33.460> of<00:02:33.700> taking

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
services that have found ways of taking

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.840 
services that have found ways of taking
waste<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.840> duplication<00:02:35.190> out<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.730> way

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
waste and duplication out of the way

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.490 
waste and duplication out of the way
they<00:02:37.060> work

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.410 

so<00:02:40.500> now<00:02:40.770> we<00:02:40.830> just<00:02:41.340> need<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.730> replicate<00:02:41.970> this

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
so now we just need to replicate this

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.630 
so now we just need to replicate this
approach<00:02:42.810> across<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.410> whole<00:02:43.650> system<00:02:44.459> and

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
approach across the whole system and

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.210 
approach across the whole system and
really<00:02:45.480> join<00:02:45.840> up<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.440> way<00:02:46.620> we<00:02:46.800> deliver<00:02:46.980> care

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
really join up the way we deliver care

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.740 
really join up the way we deliver care
