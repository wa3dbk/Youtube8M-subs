00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.150
 hello all right is welcome to be 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.160
 Welcome to another video lesson from our 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.259
 channel next to hidden 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.720
 We're going to continue our video series. 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.670
 classes on complex numbers 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.949
 You should have seen in the videos already. 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.439
 previous series of information 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.750
 on this set of numbers 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.170
 complex and now we're going to talk about 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.530
 the powers of the imaginary unit and e 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.219
 what is this number and you already know what it does 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.700
 is this set of complex numbers is 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.399
 work and make a lot of sense 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.230
 good 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.410
 we already know that the whole number leads to 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:00.430
 0 taking 10 himself does not equal 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.890
 will be different with and neither is it 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.250
 high to one is equal and good you will see 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.869
 a logic that will happen here in 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.050
 as we are increasing 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.630
 exponents of looks only what is the square 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.240
 by definition you have already seen and 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.260
 in previous videos and the square is 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.400
 equal to minus one that is the cube is and 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:30.369
 square times however and squared less 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:32.770
 one and less than 1 times - and the fourth 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.700
 power and the fourth power is the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:43.479
 square times is the square, however, and 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:46.420
 square - 1 - 1 times - one raised to 5 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.479
 raising to five is raised four times 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.250
 and the ownership of the power nec 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.720
 people add and the exponents 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:01.899
 we know that it raises to four is a 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:07.180
 successful and high to 6 would be to raise five 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:10.200
 5 is high and times and times and it is 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.880
 framed which is minus one 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.900
 Did you notice anything here? 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:25.480
 sequence looks the results were 1 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:28.230
 e - 1 - and one and minus one 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.430
 finally we will see here and it will take seven 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:37.930
 take six times and raise to six - 1 - 1 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.670
 times and reduce again repair the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:51.359
 sequence insofar as the exponents 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:55.750
 increasing a drive and - 11 - an 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:59.019
 then we realize here that the values 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.379
 possible powers for the snow is 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.540
 an experimental method are varying 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.060
 only in these four values â€‹â€‹and following 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:12.939
 a sequence then looks when it is a 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.430
 multiple of 401 high 4 is one 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:19.120
 we did here was also raised 18 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:23.139
 one the next result would be there 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.739
 in case of high to 9 then it would be 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.930
 minus 1 and a11 - and so on. 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.060
 so how is it going from 4 to 4? 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.639
 people have a rule here we go 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.419
 calculate high hunting educate a number 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.989
 all 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:39.400
 the result is the way to actually 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.220
 We can figure that out, we do. 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.859
 so the video agent exposes indicate 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.229
 for four and we will consider the 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.260
 rest the division as being a new 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:54.280
 exponent of us we will divide the exponent 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.470
 and the rest of the division will be 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.609
 a new exponent of you will see that it does 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:05.169
 every sense here looks only high 38 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:10.030
 so let's divide 38 by 49 like nine 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:12.669
 times 4 36 the rest is two then high 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.919
 38 according to this rule of thumb here 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:18.310
 people will get the 2 that the rest is the new 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:21.190
 exponent and squared is easy to 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.979
 square minus one to calculate powers 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.580
 It's enough to know the results there. 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.639
 huh 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.200
 or to calculate only the power 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:37.390
 ireland 0 to 3 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.920
 another example to raise 121 divide 121 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.830
 by 41 to 30 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:46.750
 only 30 times 4 and 120 then the rest 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:52.360
 one as high as 121 is as if it were 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:57.160
 high one simply another example 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.270
 here less than 200 minus 200 is a 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.150
 whole number 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.600
 so we're going to split less 200 per 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.840
 four minus 50 exact division rest 0 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:12.100
 so high - two hundred is as it were 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.740
 elevated to 0 and leads to 0 is one as is 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:20.590
 easy then repeating you will always 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:23.770
 divide the exponent by four the rest 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.900
 this division will be the new exponent of 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.680
 imaginary unit so it will get very 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.710
 easier for you to do this calculation 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.530
 now it 's your turn, you leave it with you 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:42.700
 exercise are actually two exercises 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:46.170
 and elevated 36 to 102 and - e 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:49.000
 between parenthesis high 8 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:52.030
 You can leave your response in 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.040
 comments from the video and already the people 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:59.440
 announces the resolution of these exercises in 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.680
 a video you can also click 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.630
 here in this region down here that you 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.720
 will have access to ii 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.720
 resolution of this exercise is also ok 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.920
 So thank you so much for watching this 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.530
 video 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.890
 I wish you a good study 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:20.350
 A big hug if you click on this

 social networks that you participate in can 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:33.130
 find here and here the address of our 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.180
 google.com class once again 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.950
 thank you very much 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.520
 A big hug and until the next video 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.520
