00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.890 

we're<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.220> to<00:00:38.309> try<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> go<00:00:38.670> zero<00:00:38.970> to<00:00:39.030> 60<00:00:39.120> with

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
we're going to try to go zero to 60 with

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.110 
we're going to try to go zero to 60 with
an<00:00:40.020> m6<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:40.920> we're<00:00:41.070> spraying<00:00:41.340> income<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
an m6 but we're spraying income to the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.850 
an m6 but we're spraying income to the
rear<00:00:42.270> tires<00:00:42.600> while<00:00:43.080> we're<00:00:43.290> doing<00:00:43.410> it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
rear tires while we're doing it

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.009 
rear tires while we're doing it
when<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.519> first<00:00:44.850> heard<00:00:45.059> about<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.480> project

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
when I first heard about the project

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.250 
when I first heard about the project
that<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.290> like<00:00:46.470> you<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:47.809> you've<00:00:48.809> got<00:00:49.019> to<00:00:49.170> be

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
that was like you what you've got to be

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.680 
that was like you what you've got to be
kidding<00:00:49.710> me

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
kidding me

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.090 
kidding me
the<00:00:51.690> first<00:00:51.900> challenge<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.379> had<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:52.559> how<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:52.949> we

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the first challenge we had was how do we

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.180 
the first challenge we had was how do we
turn<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.370> BMW<00:00:53.970> m6<00:00:54.120> into<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.019> printing<00:00:55.350> press<00:00:55.559> we

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
turn a BMW m6 into a printing press we

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.490 
turn a BMW m6 into a printing press we
came<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.089> spray<00:00:57.540> technique<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.379> it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
came up with a spray technique and it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.219 
came up with a spray technique and it
was<00:00:58.680> definitely<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.430> way<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.699> go<00:01:00.199> we<00:01:01.199> got

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
was definitely the way to go we got

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:02.810 
was definitely the way to go we got
these<00:01:01.500> pressure<00:01:01.769> tanks<00:01:02.250> when<00:01:02.519> you<00:01:02.610> push<00:01:02.790> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
these pressure tanks when you push a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.660 
these pressure tanks when you push a
button<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.600> opens<00:01:03.629> up<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.320> lets<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.250> income

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
button it opens up and lets the income

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.910 
button it opens up and lets the income
through<00:01:05.909> hit<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> tires<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:09.260> lot<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.409> material

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
through hit the tires a lot of material

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.710 
through hit the tires a lot of material
mechanics<00:01:11.729> all<00:01:11.940> this<00:01:12.240> coming<00:01:12.600> together

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
mechanics all this coming together

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.170 
mechanics all this coming together
getting<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> track<00:01:14.130> seeing<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.640> success

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
getting it on a track seeing a success

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.359 
getting it on a track seeing a success
of<00:01:15.330> our<00:01:15.420> work

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.920 

we're<00:01:20.820> putting<00:01:21.090> something<00:01:21.329> between<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
we're putting something between the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.539 
we're putting something between the
contact<00:01:22.409> patch<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.829> rear<00:01:23.009> tires<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
contact patch of the rear tires in the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.310 
contact patch of the rear tires in the
road<00:01:23.700> writer<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.360> case<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> paper<00:01:24.869> which

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
road writer in this case the paper which

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.200 
road writer in this case the paper which
is<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.649> usually<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> good<00:01:26.070> thing<00:01:26.130> feel<00:01:26.970> sort<00:01:27.180> of

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
is not usually a good thing feel sort of

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.490 
is not usually a good thing feel sort of
like<00:01:27.270> Chuck<00:01:27.570> Yeager<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.200> don't<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.380> how

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
like Chuck Yeager and I don't know how

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.690 
like Chuck Yeager and I don't know how
this<00:01:28.649> thing<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> work<00:01:29.189> out<00:01:29.399> right

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
this thing is going to work out right

00:01:29.700 --> 00:02:05.600 
this thing is going to work out right
kind<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.090> test<00:01:30.450> pilot

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.960 

Oh<00:02:09.560> accurate<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.710> were<00:02:10.890> my<00:02:11.370> God<00:02:11.610> was<00:02:11.790> so

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
Oh accurate you were my God was so

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.080 
Oh accurate you were my God was so
straight<00:02:12.360> have<00:02:12.690> my<00:02:12.840> suppose<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.350> whole<00:02:13.500> time

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
straight have my suppose the whole time

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.730 
straight have my suppose the whole time
I'll<00:02:15.090> take<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:16.730> what<00:02:17.730> makes<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.240> cool<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.780> m6

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
I'll take it what makes it so cool is m6

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.800 
I'll take it what makes it so cool is m6
with<00:02:20.190> all<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.490> power<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.910> torque<00:02:21.300> what<00:02:21.780> is

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
with all this power and torque what is

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.390 
with all this power and torque what is
trying<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.140> do<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.410> road<00:02:22.590> all<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.830> time<00:02:23.160> this

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
trying to do the road all the time this

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.340 
trying to do the road all the time this
twist<00:02:24.060> up<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.630> pavement<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:25.260> that

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
twist up the pavement here that

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.990 
twist up the pavement here that
expression<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.890> think<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.250> wrinkle<00:02:26.550> payment

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
expression to think of wrinkle payment

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.340 
expression to think of wrinkle payment
and<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.480> guys<00:02:27.630> are<00:02:27.780> come<00:02:27.930> up<00:02:27.990> with<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.170> way<00:02:28.320> to

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
and you guys are come up with a way to

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.230 
and you guys are come up with a way to
be<00:02:28.560> able<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.740> take<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.070> with<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.460> so<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:29.820> it

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
be able to take this with you so it's it

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:40.430 
be able to take this with you so it's it
was<00:02:30.360> cool

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.500 

you
