00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:07.600 
it's a video of a a crow figure 93 this

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.669 
it's a video of a a crow figure 93 this
reel<00:00:07.870> is<00:00:08.230> how<00:00:08.589> to<00:00:09.960> eliminate<00:00:10.960> the<00:00:11.849> airbags

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
reel is how to eliminate the airbags

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.900 
reel is how to eliminate the airbags
some<00:00:14.679> people<00:00:14.950> need<00:00:15.610> the<00:00:15.790> airbags<00:00:17.910> depending

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
some people need the airbags depending

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.300 
some people need the airbags depending
if<00:00:18.970> you<00:00:19.060> go<00:00:19.180> on<00:00:19.240> high<00:00:19.420> speeds<00:00:19.810> and<00:00:20.050> some<00:00:21.039> people

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
if you go on high speeds and some people

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.279 
if you go on high speeds and some people
don't<00:00:21.640> need<00:00:21.789> the<00:00:21.940> airbags

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
don't need the airbags

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.040 
don't need the airbags
some<00:00:23.920> people<00:00:24.189> don't<00:00:24.400> usually<00:00:24.910> drive<00:00:25.449> 5<00:00:25.689> speeds

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
some people don't usually drive 5 speeds

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.980 
some people don't usually drive 5 speeds
and<00:00:26.199> so<00:00:26.380> on<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.820> in<00:00:28.150> my<00:00:28.330> case<00:00:28.390> I<00:00:28.689> don't<00:00:28.750> drive

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
and so on so in my case I don't drive

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.580 
and so on so in my case I don't drive
high<00:00:29.199> speed<00:00:30.420> most<00:00:31.420> of<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.599> time<00:00:31.779> I'm<00:00:31.990> driving

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
high speed most of the time I'm driving

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.029 
high speed most of the time I'm driving
at<00:00:32.979> low<00:00:33.489> speed<00:00:33.850> so<00:00:34.120> I<00:00:34.809> necessarily<00:00:35.319> don't<00:00:35.920> need

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
at low speed so I necessarily don't need

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.700 
at low speed so I necessarily don't need
the<00:00:36.159> airbags<00:00:36.579> and<00:00:37.479> Plus<00:00:37.899> on<00:00:38.050> this<00:00:38.260> car<00:00:38.559> is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
the airbags and Plus on this car is

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.759 
the airbags and Plus on this car is
missing<00:00:39.100> one<00:00:39.399> airbag<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:41.079> I<00:00:41.350> only<00:00:41.469> have<00:00:41.739> one

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
missing one airbag so I only have one

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.629 
missing one airbag so I only have one

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
possible as a seatbelt like I disable

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:08.190 
possible as a seatbelt like I disable
that<00:01:03.360> one<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.570> light<00:01:05.229> turn<00:01:06.719> you<00:01:07.719> know<00:01:07.810> see<00:01:08.020> no

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
that one the light turn you know see no

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:18.149 
that one the light turn you know see no
light<00:01:08.409> or<00:01:08.649> whatever<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:16.140> good<00:01:17.140> way<00:01:17.320> for<00:01:17.679> that<00:01:17.799> is

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
light or whatever a good way for that is

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.060 
light or whatever a good way for that is
just<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:19.149> pull<00:01:19.359> out<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.630> whole<00:01:19.829> gauges<00:01:20.829> here

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
just to pull out the whole gauges here

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.800 
just to pull out the whole gauges here
and<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:22.479> take<00:01:22.600> out<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.899> ball<00:01:23.109> for<00:01:23.380> that<00:01:24.810> but

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
and just take out the ball for that but

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.239 
and just take out the ball for that but
I<00:01:26.369> decided<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:27.520> take<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.820> extra<00:01:28.240> step<00:01:28.570> and

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
I decided to take the extra step and

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:33.389 
I decided to take the extra step and
taking<00:01:30.249> out<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:31.090> computer<00:01:31.929> for<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.649> seat<00:01:32.920> fat

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
taking out the computer for the seat fat

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:40.910 
taking out the computer for the seat fat
off<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.869> airbags<00:01:35.229> it's<00:01:35.950> right<00:01:36.399> there<00:01:37.979> see

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
off for the airbags it's right there see

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.309 
off for the airbags it's right there see
this<00:01:41.920> is<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.219> computer<00:01:42.670> for<00:01:42.909> the<00:01:43.060> airbags<00:01:43.390> and

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
this is the computer for the airbags and

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.459 
this is the computer for the airbags and
all<00:01:45.069> that<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.429> the<00:01:45.609> wiring<00:01:46.030> for<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:47.049> ear<00:01:47.710> wax

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
all that is the wiring for the ear wax

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.330 
all that is the wiring for the ear wax
when<00:01:50.469> the<00:01:51.069> late-model<00:01:52.469> accra<00:01:53.469> or<00:01:53.649> Honda<00:01:54.100> I

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
when the late-model accra or Honda I

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.459 
when the late-model accra or Honda I
don't<00:01:55.329> think<00:01:55.569> they<00:01:57.299> there's<00:01:58.299> no<00:01:58.719> wire<00:01:58.960> really

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
don't think they there's no wire really

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.760 
don't think they there's no wire really
associated<00:02:00.340> with<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.700> computer<00:02:01.240> so<00:02:02.139> it's

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
associated with the computer so it's

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.819 
associated with the computer so it's
more<00:02:02.979> like<00:02:03.159> an<00:02:03.310> individual<00:02:03.909> system<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:04.689> it<00:02:05.619> can

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
more like an individual system so it can

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.130 
more like an individual system so it can
come<00:02:06.130> off

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
come off

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.650 
come off
easily<00:02:07.979> by<00:02:08.160> itself<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.679> polymorphs<00:02:10.679> aqua<00:02:11.220> or

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
easily by itself and polymorphs aqua or

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.680 
easily by itself and polymorphs aqua or
Honda's<00:02:12.660> anywhere<00:02:13.380> around<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:14.690> early

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
on all also on India there's a computer

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.860 
on all also on India there's a computer
and<00:03:16.770> behind<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:17.890> computer<00:03:18.070> is<00:03:18.460> a<00:03:18.490> sensor<00:03:19.060> this

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
and behind the computer is a sensor this

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.510 
and behind the computer is a sensor this
other<00:03:20.080> sensor<00:03:20.530> look<00:03:20.710> like<00:03:25.470> it's<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.650> believe

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
other sensor look like it's a believe

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.780 
other sensor look like it's a believe
it's<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.790> crash<00:03:28.030> sensor<00:03:28.710> so<00:03:29.710> anytime<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.580> car

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
it's a crash sensor so anytime the car

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.850 
it's a crash sensor so anytime the car
