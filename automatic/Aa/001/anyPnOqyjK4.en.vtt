00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.009 
cooler parts to having windows ce e on
this<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.649> totally<00:02:08.360> completely<00:02:09.360> hackable

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
this is it's totally completely hackable

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.199 
this is it's totally completely hackable
so<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:11.039> know<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.430> theory<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.910> could<00:02:11.970> really

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
so you know in theory you could really

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.470 
so you know in theory you could really
just<00:02:12.330> hack<00:02:12.720> your<00:02:12.930> own<00:02:12.989> UI<00:02:13.410> on<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.790> say

from a lot of Miss presses so it's kind

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.309 
from a lot of Miss presses so it's kind
of<00:03:01.769> why<00:03:01.950> I'm<00:03:02.130> using<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.760> stylus<00:03:03.599> here<00:03:04.079> that's

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
of why I'm using the stylus here that's

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.780 
of why I'm using the stylus here that's
connected<00:03:05.069> on<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.489> player<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:08.370> works<00:03:08.670> a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
connected on to the player this works a

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.680 
connected on to the player this works a
little<00:03:08.910> bit<00:03:09.060> better<00:03:09.299> than<00:03:09.510> your<00:03:09.660> finger<00:03:11.690> so

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
little bit better than your finger so

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.800 
little bit better than your finger so
but<00:03:13.349> that<00:03:13.500> doesn't<00:03:13.680> mean<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.430> a

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
but that doesn't mean that this is a

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.729 
but that doesn't mean that this is a

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.300 

it's<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.780> very<00:03:38.430> straightforward<00:03:41.310> utilitarian

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
it's a very straightforward utilitarian

it's a very straightforward utilitarian
you<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:44.020> think<00:03:44.350> will<00:03:44.470> appeal<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:45.100> a

you I that I think will appeal to a
certain<00:03:46.810> group<00:03:46.840> of<00:03:47.110> people<00:03:48.570> so<00:03:49.570> I<00:03:49.600> won't<00:03:49.870> call

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
imagination it's just a very different

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.270

you I one of the one of the neat things

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.810 
you I one of the one of the neat things
here<00:04:12.040> is<00:04:12.370> with<00:04:13.090> flash<00:04:14.190> they<00:04:15.190> actually<00:04:15.400> give

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
here is with flash they actually give

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.729 
here is with flash they actually give
you<00:04:16.030> I<00:04:16.090> unload<00:04:16.570> any<00:04:16.750> kind<00:04:17.019> of<00:04:17.080> flash<00:04:17.260> on<00:04:17.500> here

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
you I unload any kind of flash on here

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.650 
you I unload any kind of flash on here
yet<00:04:17.920> they<00:04:18.340> actually<00:04:18.489> give<00:04:18.760> you<00:04:18.880> controls<00:04:19.390> here

great-looking screen looks fantastic not
too<00:05:05.500> different<00:05:05.680> from<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.040> 02<00:05:06.190> with<00:05:06.580> those<00:05:06.760> who

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
too different from the 02 with those who

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.740 
too different from the 02 with those who
had<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.180> great<00:05:07.419> screen<00:05:07.660> to<00:05:07.840> begin<00:05:08.110> with<00:05:08.320> so<00:05:09.750> not

had a great screen to begin with so not
much<00:05:10.870> of<00:05:11.050> an<00:05:11.169> improvement<00:05:11.380> but<00:05:11.650> no

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
much of an improvement but no

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:18.030 
much of an improvement but no
improvement<00:05:12.460> was<00:05:12.610> really<00:05:12.850> needed<00:05:16.620> so<00:05:17.620> overall

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
improvement was really needed so overall

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.760

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
the UI is pretty interesting um

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.580 
the UI is pretty interesting um
different<00:05:20.770> from<00:05:21.070> what<00:05:21.190> I've<00:05:21.310> seen<00:05:22.200> but<00:05:23.200> like<00:05:23.500> I

some you is or even some new utilities
on<00:05:32.470> to<00:05:32.860> this<00:05:33.520> players<00:05:33.850> since<00:05:34.180> we<00:05:34.360> have<00:05:34.540> a

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
on to this players since we have a

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.850 
on to this players since we have a
full-blown<00:05:36.150> window<00:05:37.150> CEOs<00:05:37.930> here<00:05:38.200> and<00:05:38.710> I'm<00:05:38.800> not

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
full-blown window CEOs here and I'm not

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.820 
full-blown window CEOs here and I'm not
too<00:05:39.130> familiar<00:05:39.370> with<00:05:39.700> embedded<00:05:40.570> OS<00:05:40.990> is<00:05:41.229> so<00:05:43.830> so

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
too familiar with embedded OS is so so

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.570 
too familiar with embedded OS is so so
we're<00:05:44.950> gonna<00:05:45.039> have<00:05:45.190> to<00:05:45.250> look<00:05:45.400> to<00:05:45.550> the

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
we're gonna have to look to the

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.559 
we're gonna have to look to the
community<00:05:46.120> for<00:05:46.450> some

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569
