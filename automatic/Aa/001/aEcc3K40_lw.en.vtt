00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.780
 our final conclusion 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.119
 The Nikon Coolpix L 830 is a 1/2 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.890
 3 inch big c mos sensor with 15 9 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.849
 megapixel resolution and sensor 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.860
 Publications from iso 125 to iso 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.259
 3,200 image quality drops for the 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.840
 By default, bridge class is at iso 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.760
 125 is the detail reproduction good one 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.860
 Image noise can not be detected 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.470
 with iso 200 , the detail reproduction 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.880
 only minimal at iso 400 then shows up 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.559
 but already a lighter 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.290
 Blur the fine details 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.760
 destroyed the iso 800 must stop there 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.989
 already clearer cuts in the 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.239
 accept pictures 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.660
 Above all, higher sensor publics 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.920
 ISO 3.200 provides muddy textures 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.410
 in less light for the picture quality 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.179
 the iso 200 will be well out of it 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.789
 Shots through the noise filter stock 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.430
 soft at the speed 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.900
 cuts nikon coolpix l 830 for one 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.420
 entry-level model mostly 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.010
 respectable from series shots let 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.900
 with 60 pictures per second 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.310
 stick with only five shots in 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.800
 but you are already something 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.930
 limited is the trigger delay 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.120
 with 0 01 seconds very short the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.820
 autofocus requires only 0 in the wide angle 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.500
 17 seconds to focus very well 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.910
 We also liked the short one 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.970
 switch-on time to complete 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.650
 Display with 123 seconds and the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.080
 short time for the first picture 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.050
 after turning it on for 112 seconds 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.580
 so must the coolpix l 830 too 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.210
 not much more expensive models 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.330
 hide 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.810
 the nikon coolpix l 830 is a 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.580
 successful successor of the coolpix l120 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.440
 nikon relies partly on tried and tested 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.970
 partly the bridge camera became 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.550
 also improved in some points 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.540
 with the 34x zoom optics can be 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.440
 a very nice focal range 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.630
 cover 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.260
 this starts at wide angle 22 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.140
 5 mm and rich to 7 165 mm 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.990
 the light intensity leads with f3 so far 59 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.610
 class usual from class class 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.289
 the picture quality falls out of the 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.000
 enough light and accordingly 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.129
 low sensor sensitivities for 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.290
 this small sensor size is convincing 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.540
 In addition, the image quality of the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.129
 full hd videos convince the autofocus 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.090
 works fast and the camera is 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.950
 quickly ready for use 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.560
 well above average for a 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.050
 entry-level model is the coolpix 830 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.670
 equipped with the display it solves with 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.020
 921,000 pixels not only high but 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.680
 can also be up and down 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.720
 fold 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.640
 In addition, the viewing angles are great 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.110
 only in the photo programs the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.960
 Settings and in the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.850
 Camera case bbc the bridge camera 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.530
 actually to a higher level who 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.240
 a cheap bridge camera with large 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.980
 zoo area as well as a folding display 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.510
 looks for and on many manual options 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.210
 should be able to do without the coolpix 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.210
 L 830 in any case look closer 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.710
 the d camera the test judgments to the camera
