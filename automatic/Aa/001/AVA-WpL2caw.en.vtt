00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.150 
science calm hey welcome back
today<00:00:08.580> we<00:00:08.760> have<00:00:08.940> snap<00:00:09.480> circuits<00:00:09.719> lights<00:00:10.230> make

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
today we have snap circuits lights make

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.220 
today we have snap circuits lights make
a<00:00:11.190> ton<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.639> cool<00:00:11.910> experiments<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.780> light<00:00:13.080> up

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
a ton of cool experiments that light up

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.890 
a ton of cool experiments that light up
and<00:00:13.440> do<00:00:13.889> all<00:00:14.099> sorts<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.429> cool<00:00:14.610> things<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.210> it

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
about the cards in our world and got

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.230 
about the cards in our world and got
some<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.779> project<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.740> need

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
some of the project that we need

00:00:26.240 --> 00:01:29.190 
some of the project that we need
absolutely

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200

so<00:01:30.200> that's<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:30.590> video<00:01:30.740> that<00:01:31.340> snap<00:01:31.790> circuits

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
so that's the video that snap circuits

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.230 
so that's the video that snap circuits
lights<00:01:32.509> you<00:01:33.049> can<00:01:33.259> get<00:01:33.439> it<00:01:33.560> at<00:01:34.240> incredible
