00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.710
 Morillo Davis beats his head circled in 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.580

 final 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.110
 its elements about his 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:13.770
 on you as you mean support 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:17.810
 Of course, the first to get on a partner 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:20.340
 Marius required a lot of agility and 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.270
 long numerous trainings 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.870
 the two remaining let's say this is already some 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.900
 repetition from the recent past and not 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.880
 just from the past but as for 1 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.250
 support from of course clean 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.080
 uncomplicated east well questions 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.210
 regarding this rolled there is of course 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.479
 same 1000 and one night 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.259
 This is the amount of time you can 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.199
 keep an eye on it 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.580
 free dance replenishment 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.039
 American athletes on this what are they 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.919
 still ahead of the rest of the planet on 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.080
 exceptions only yew and and scott this 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:59.099
 too, everything seems to be discussed and 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.199
 try to move towards them and cuts 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.360
 this distance which in the end only 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:06.050
 increases and increases 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.539
 remember the master and margarita 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:13.050
 the very beginning of you ran homeless 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:16.199
 for three and voland cow and hippo 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.229
 catch up to shorten the distance so you him 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:22.560
 despite the fact that they only did what went 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:24.449
 not really speeding up like this when 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.180
 it must be like that she is the very first 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:29.190
 support is very original but what 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.000
 regards will support performed by zue 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.349
 duets last year 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.530
 non-classical karma performed by 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:38.389
 Canadians are not surprised at anything. 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:43.060
 this 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:47.040
 Scheherazade and the oriental melodies 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.040
 west of the globe 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.240
 first place more unconditional than 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.970
 can only imagine now 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.300
 organize themselves Meryl Davis and Charlie 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:01.300
 white with a claim to their own worlds cartoon 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.620
 court in general, all of these athletes 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.620
 still good 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:20.839
 I somehow completely thoughtlessly closed 

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:20.839
 the composition of the participants at the stages of the grand prix 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:30.169
 this year where again we will see these 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.620
 athletes 

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:34.310
 in no one honestly in my opinion not in 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.830
 Moscow 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.830
 that's what can definitely be said 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.599
 I think in Japan where and how or 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:48.110
 nella notte but again will not wait 

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:49.759
 pay attention to balls 112 and 53 when 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.779
 the case concerns these athletes in 

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:53.810
 no wonder 

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:55.610
 absolutely nothing I do not win until 

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.319
 Maryl Davis and Charlie White as well as mine 

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.960
 as if they were i am left handed as if they were 

00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:00.469
 how to adopt not a as well as ethics and 

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.189
 Wednesday 

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:06.289
 will appear even at the stage in Japan which 

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:06.849
 has 5 serial number and we again 

00:08:06.289 --> 00:08:09.860
 see 

00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:11.689
 full-time against 4 ordinal number 5 and y 

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.909
 of the paris stage and we again see the full-time 

00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:16.789
 confrontation of Americans and Italians 

00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:20.259
 so far no chance rivals 

00:08:16.789 --> 00:08:20.259
 there are no world champions
