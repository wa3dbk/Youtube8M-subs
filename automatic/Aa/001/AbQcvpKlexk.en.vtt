 and it is on the southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.570
 despite the fact that they decide it is characterized by numerous stacked buildings made 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.550
 of clay bricks 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.000
 many of these tall buildings were built this way 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 as a way to protect themselves from attacks that penguins 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.669
 a defensive wall and two doors protects the city 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.399
 proposed buildings of five to eight floors and up the together of each other in 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.570
 a small area 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.570
 some of the houses are joined by corridors on the heights 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.400
 people can move quickly between runners changing from one 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.430
 house to another to fight in case of an attack by enemies 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.430
 The wooden frames of the windows and the mud walls have the shape of 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.810
 an arch 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.810
 history and zidan dates from the 3rd century 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.300
 however the buildings that remain standing are mostly decided 16 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.770
 but how was it possible that the city or had so much wealth to the point that their 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.080
 inhabitants feared that they were preparing for enemy attacks the secret resides 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.080
 in the incense that still sells the city 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.410
 you go up to a valdés that the upper floors to perform works of 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.940
 repairs 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.890
 the walls were covered with mud from time to time due to the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.890
 erosion caused by wind and rain 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.050
 these artisans are making bricks 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.500
 these gradually get smaller in the upper floors what 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.430
 means that the building gradually becomes thinner 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.840
 braking the shape of a trapeze 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.450
 the walls are the runs of the floors above to reduce the pressure in 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 the lower floors making the constructions strong and established 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.970
 each building is usually occupied by a family that uses the third level as 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.970
 your residence 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.380
 the first and second floors are used to store food that as a 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.380
 barn for animals 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.340
 recently do not do anything inside the houses to survive in the times in 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.829
 that the city was attacked 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.279
 the houses remained cold inside despite the prevailing heat 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:21.389
 abroad 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.609
 the aroma of the incense that hurts the rooms creates an atmosphere 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.149
 exotic 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:31.249
 in this species of desert mazatán its inhabitants ask as if it did not happen
