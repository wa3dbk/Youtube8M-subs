00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
hello everyone my name is cinder and

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.230 
hello everyone my name is cinder and
this<00:00:01.890> is<00:00:02.010> going<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.220> be<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.370> quick<00:00:02.639> tutorial<00:00:02.730> on

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
this is going to be a quick tutorial on

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.900 
this is going to be a quick tutorial on
how<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.899> make<00:00:04.140> mirrors<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.220> unity<00:00:05.700> with

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
how to make mirrors and unity with

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.730 
how to make mirrors and unity with
shaders<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:06.930> kind<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.259> better<00:00:07.529> way<00:00:07.710> to

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
shaders this is kind of a better way to

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.040 
shaders this is kind of a better way to
do<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.099> just<00:00:08.130> because<00:00:08.370> it's<00:00:08.639> not<00:00:09.179> as<00:00:09.330> taxing<00:00:09.840> as

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
do it just because it's not as taxing as

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.749 
do it just because it's not as taxing as
the<00:00:10.230> way<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.349> showed<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.620> before<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:11.639> reason

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
the way I showed you before the reason

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.089 
the way I showed you before the reason
why<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.000> had<00:00:12.420> been<00:00:12.599> using<00:00:12.809> reflection<00:00:13.769> probe

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
why I had been using reflection probe

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.490 
why I had been using reflection probe
before<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.610> because<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.900> script<00:00:16.260> wasn't

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
before is because this script wasn't

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.230 
before is because this script wasn't
working<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:16.949> unity<00:00:17.160> 5<00:00:17.250> when<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.730> had<00:00:17.880> tried<00:00:18.090> it

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
working in unity 5 when I had tried it

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.910 
working in unity 5 when I had tried it
when<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.690> was<00:00:18.900> an<00:00:18.990> early<00:00:19.170> adopter<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.529> unity<00:00:19.770> 5

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
when I I was an early adopter of unity 5

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.220 
when I I was an early adopter of unity 5
like<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.550> hate<00:00:21.210> was<00:00:21.359> using<00:00:21.630> unity<00:00:21.869> 5<00:00:22.020> like

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
like I I hate was using unity 5 like

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.500 
like I I hate was using unity 5 like
immediately<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.910> hadn't<00:00:24.150> quite<00:00:24.210> made<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
immediately and I hadn't quite made the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.120 
immediately and I hadn't quite made the
changes<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.140> from<00:00:25.289> unity<00:00:25.619> 4<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.920> make<00:00:26.039> it

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
changes to it from unity 4 to make it

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.429 
changes to it from unity 4 to make it
work<00:00:26.250> with<00:00:26.340> unity<00:00:26.640> 5<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.150> now<00:00:27.930> those<00:00:28.109> changes

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
work with unity 5 and now those changes

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.689 
work with unity 5 and now those changes
have<00:00:28.529> been<00:00:28.590> made<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.039> we<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.279> go<00:00:29.369> ahead<00:00:29.490> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
have been made so we can go ahead and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.779 
have been made so we can go ahead and
use<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.570> method

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:32.789 
use this method

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.849 
use this method
so<00:00:33.600> first<00:00:33.960> what<00:00:34.079> you're<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.199> to<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.710> go

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:34.859 
so first what you're going to do is go

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.869 
so first what you're going to do is go
to<00:00:34.920> game<00:00:35.160> object<00:00:35.449> 3d<00:00:36.449> object<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.579> plane<00:00:38.579> oh

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
to game object 3d object and plane oh

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.540 
to game object 3d object and plane oh
and<00:00:39.539> also<00:00:39.659> I<00:00:39.839> I<00:00:40.289> remember<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> turn

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
and also I I remember to turn

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.010 
and also I I remember to turn
mouse<00:00:43.860> cursor<00:00:44.860> capture<00:00:45.250> on<00:00:45.550> which<00:00:46.420> I<00:00:46.600> didn't

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
mouse cursor capture on which I didn't

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.930 
mouse cursor capture on which I didn't
do<00:00:47.110> for<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.320> other<00:00:47.410> video<00:00:47.680> because<00:00:48.610> I'm<00:00:48.760> an

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
do for the other video because I'm an

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.730 
do for the other video because I'm an
idiot<00:00:49.060> and<00:00:49.570> I<00:00:49.930> normally<00:00:50.290> don't<00:00:50.380> use<00:00:50.560> it<00:00:50.710> for

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
idiot and I normally don't use it for

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.670 
idiot and I normally don't use it for
anything<00:00:51.030> all<00:00:52.030> right<00:00:52.090> so<00:00:52.470> you<00:00:53.470> have<00:00:53.500> your

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
anything all right so you have your

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.830 
anything all right so you have your
plane<00:00:53.890> and<00:00:54.340> once<00:00:54.700> you<00:00:54.790> have<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.060> mirror<00:00:55.420> where

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
plane and once you have the mirror where

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.450 
plane and once you have the mirror where
it's<00:00:55.990> going<00:00:56.140> to<00:00:56.170> be<00:00:56.230> reflecting<00:00:56.800> is<00:00:57.040> always

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
it's going to be reflecting is always

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.040 
it's going to be reflecting is always
going<00:00:57.700> to<00:00:57.730> be<00:00:57.790> this<00:00:58.030> axis<00:00:58.450> right<00:00:58.510> here<00:00:58.660> which

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
going to be this axis right here which

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.930 
going to be this axis right here which
is<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.230> y-axis<00:00:59.490> it's<00:01:00.490> always<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.790> green

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
is the y-axis it's always the green

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.210 
is the y-axis it's always the green
arrow<00:01:01.180> and<00:01:01.480> we're<00:01:02.470> gonna<00:01:02.560> have<00:01:02.740> it<00:01:02.770> face<00:01:02.980> this

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
arrow and we're gonna have it face this

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.710 
arrow and we're gonna have it face this
little<00:01:03.400> guy<00:01:03.490> right<00:01:03.520> here<00:01:03.940> just<00:01:04.420> so<00:01:04.510> we<00:01:04.570> have

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
little guy right here just so we have

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.440 
little guy right here just so we have
something<00:01:05.230> in<00:01:05.500> there<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.880> do<00:01:07.060> it<00:01:07.210> you're<00:01:07.360> gonna

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
something in there to do it you're gonna

something in there to do it you're gonna
want<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:07.720> have<00:01:07.870> a<00:01:07.900> negative<00:01:08.140> wall<00:01:08.710> for<00:01:08.920> me<00:01:08.950> it's

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
want to have a negative wall for me it's

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.719 
want to have a negative wall for me it's
negative<00:01:09.700> 90<00:01:10.000> in<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.420> rotation<00:01:10.960> axis

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.660 

pull<00:01:16.479> that<00:01:16.570> up<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:16.960> move<00:01:17.350> it<00:01:17.470> on<00:01:17.560> over

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.420 

okay<00:01:20.150> now<00:01:20.300> right-click<00:01:20.690> and<00:01:21.200> create<00:01:21.620> a<00:01:22.010> new

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
okay now right-click and create a new

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.000 
okay now right-click and create a new
shader<00:01:23.020> or<00:01:24.020> right-clicking<00:01:24.500> your<00:01:24.650> assets

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
shader or right-clicking your assets

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.100 
shader or right-clicking your assets
folder<00:01:25.340> I'm<00:01:25.880> gonna<00:01:26.030> call<00:01:26.150> this<00:01:26.240> mirror

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
folder I'm gonna call this mirror

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.200 
folder I'm gonna call this mirror
and<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.130> also<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.460> gonna<00:01:29.550> go<00:01:29.730> ahead<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
and I'm also just gonna go ahead and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.830 
and I'm also just gonna go ahead and
call<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.480> plane<00:01:30.690> mirror

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.120 

now<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:37.900> need<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.080> go<00:01:38.230> in<00:01:38.500> right-click<00:01:39.010> in<00:01:39.100> the

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
now you need to go in right-click in the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.480 
now you need to go in right-click in the
assets<00:01:39.460> folder<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.970> create<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.540> material

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
assets folder and create a material

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.300 
assets folder and create a material
called<00:01:42.490> I<00:01:42.670> call<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.120> mirror<00:01:43.360> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.740 

and<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.430> can<00:01:48.549> just<00:01:48.670> drag<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:48.970> shader<00:01:49.180> on<00:01:49.450> to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
and you can just drag this shader on to

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.080 
and you can just drag this shader on to
mirror<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:51.460> not<00:01:51.610> going<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.790> change<00:01:51.850> or

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
mirror it's not going to change or

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.070 
mirror it's not going to change or
anything<00:01:52.210> as<00:01:52.450> we<00:01:52.509> haven't<00:01:52.689> actually<00:01:52.810> added

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
anything as we haven't actually added

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.270 
anything as we haven't actually added
the<00:01:53.350> shader<00:01:53.740> script

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
the shader script

and<00:01:55.460> we're<00:01:56.120> gonna<00:01:56.210> have<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.450> create<00:01:56.630> one<00:01:56.870> last

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
and we're gonna have to create one last

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.300 
and we're gonna have to create one last
thing<00:01:57.350> which<00:01:58.220> is<00:01:58.400> a<00:01:58.430> c-sharp<00:01:59.060> script<00:02:00.190> which<00:02:01.190> we

thing which is a c-sharp script which we

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.490

this<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.480> shader<00:02:37.020> we're<00:02:37.170> gonna<00:02:37.260> use<00:02:37.500> in

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
this is the shader we're gonna use in

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.340 
this is the shader we're gonna use in
our<00:02:37.770> shader<00:02:38.630> unity<00:02:39.630> shader<00:02:40.790> script<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.350> this

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
our shader unity shader script and this

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.720 
our shader unity shader script and this
is<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.739> c-sharp<00:02:44.160> script<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.520> we're<00:02:44.640> gonna

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
is the c-sharp script that we're gonna

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.490 
is the c-sharp script that we're gonna
need<00:02:45.000> this<00:02:45.420> basically<00:02:45.750> just<00:02:45.959> tells<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.350> what

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
need this basically just tells it what

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.990 
need this basically just tells it what
to<00:02:46.560> do<00:02:46.830> with<00:02:47.010> all<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.250> stuff<00:02:47.280> around<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.910> and

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
to do with all the stuff around it and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.160 
to do with all the stuff around it and
like<00:02:48.120> how<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.270> reflect<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.750> back<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.080> all<00:02:49.140> that

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
like how to reflect it back and all that

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.830 
like how to reflect it back and all that
stuff<00:02:49.470> very<00:02:50.000> complicated<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.300> this<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.660> all

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
stuff very complicated and this is all

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.930 
stuff very complicated and this is all
based<00:02:52.080> on<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:53.700> unity<00:02:54.180> Pro<00:02:54.709> water<00:02:55.940> which

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
based on the the unity Pro water which

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.760 
based on the the unity Pro water which
has<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.180> lot<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.600> reflection<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.470> it

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
has a lot of reflection to it and it

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.229 
has a lot of reflection to it and it
also<00:02:58.890> has<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.190> lot<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.430> distortion<00:02:59.850> to<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.120> in

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
also has a lot of distortion to it in

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.760 
also has a lot of distortion to it in
the<00:03:00.360> shader<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:00.900> basically<00:03:01.500> what<00:03:01.650> they've

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
the shader so basically what they've

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.110 
the shader so basically what they've
done<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.010> they've<00:03:02.160> changed<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.820> not<00:03:02.970> have

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
done is they've changed this to not have

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.699 
done is they've changed this to not have
any<00:03:03.270> distortion<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:03.989> it's<00:03:04.140> just<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.470> flat

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
any distortion so it's just a flat

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.030 
any distortion so it's just a flat
mirror<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:06.239> as<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:07.020> can<00:03:07.110> see<00:03:07.170> right<00:03:07.410> here<00:03:07.470> you

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
mirror and as you can see right here you

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.770 
mirror and as you can see right here you
are<00:03:08.190> able<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.489> change<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.000> resolution<00:03:09.270> of<00:03:09.630> it

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
are able to change the resolution of it

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.509 
are able to change the resolution of it
which<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.290> can<00:03:10.500> do<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.800> inspector<00:03:11.280> in

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
which you can do in the inspector in

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.490 
which you can do in the inspector in
powers<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.630> two<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.380> that's<00:03:13.560> like<00:03:14.450> 1024<00:03:16.040> 2048

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
powers of two so that's like 1024 2048

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.600 
powers of two so that's like 1024 2048
you<00:03:19.500> can<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.739> look<00:03:19.799> up<00:03:19.920> powers<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.340> two<00:03:20.459> if

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
you can just look up powers of two if

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.789 
you can just look up powers of two if
you<00:03:20.730> don't<00:03:20.880> know<00:03:21.510> like<00:03:21.750> all<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.019> typically

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
you don't know like all the typically

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.949 
you don't know like all the typically
used<00:03:23.040> resolutions<00:03:23.549> for<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.790> okay<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:24.600> go<00:03:24.780> ahead

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
used resolutions for it okay so go ahead

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.550 
used resolutions for it okay so go ahead
and<00:03:25.049> just<00:03:25.200> copy<00:03:26.100> this<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.810> shader<00:03:28.080> part<00:03:28.410> right

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
and just copy this the shader part right

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.720 
and just copy this the shader part right
here

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
here

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.940 
here
go<00:03:31.390> back<00:03:31.510> over<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:31.780> unity<00:03:32.080> open<00:03:33.040> up<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.250> shader

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
go back over to unity open up the shader

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.229 
go back over to unity open up the shader
it'll<00:03:35.950> open<00:03:36.069> up<00:03:36.250> here<00:03:36.430> in<00:03:36.520> monodevelop

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
it'll open up here in monodevelop

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.790 
it'll open up here in monodevelop
I'm<00:03:37.840> gonna<00:03:37.989> go<00:03:38.080> ahead<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.319> zoom<00:03:38.410> this<00:03:38.590> in<00:03:38.709> a

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
I'm gonna go ahead and zoom this in a

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.240 
I'm gonna go ahead and zoom this in a
little<00:03:38.890> bit<00:03:39.099> so<00:03:39.250> it's<00:03:39.370> easier<00:03:39.610> to<00:03:39.640> see<00:03:39.730> it

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
little bit so it's easier to see it

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.559 
little bit so it's easier to see it
smaller<00:03:42.250> resolutions

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
smaller resolutions

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.229 
smaller resolutions
all<00:03:45.230> right<00:03:45.409> that's<00:03:45.560> good<00:03:45.969> so<00:03:46.969> you<00:03:47.090> just

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
all right that's good so you just

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.500 
all right that's good so you just
highlight<00:03:47.659> all<00:03:47.689> of<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:48.639> delete<00:03:49.639> it<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:49.939> then

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
highlight all of this delete it and then

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.170 
highlight all of this delete it and then
paste<00:03:51.019> it

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
paste it

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.040 
paste it
because<00:03:52.900> our<00:03:53.080> new<00:03:54.450> shader<00:03:55.450> here

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
because our new shader here

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
yeah so just copy the c-sharp script

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.170 
yeah so just copy the c-sharp script
here<00:04:18.049> all<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.799> way<00:04:18.859> down<00:04:18.979> to<00:04:19.039> the<00:04:19.100> bottom

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.050 

back<00:04:23.419> in<00:04:23.540> monodevelop<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:24.259> like<00:04:24.500> all<00:04:24.590> this

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
back in monodevelop I like all this

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.350 
back in monodevelop I like all this
elite<00:04:26.060> taste

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.570

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
change the API which isn't changed on

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.130 
change the API which isn't changed on
the<00:04:38.920> script<00:04:39.160> just<00:04:39.400> go<00:04:40.300> ahead<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.540> say<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:40.690> made

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
the script just go ahead and say I made

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.750 
the script just go ahead and say I made
a<00:04:41.200> backup<00:04:41.440> go<00:04:41.710> ahead<00:04:41.950> because<00:04:42.160> we<00:04:42.310> can<00:04:42.610> always

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
a backup go ahead because we can always

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.230 
a backup go ahead because we can always
go<00:04:43.060> back<00:04:43.210> into<00:04:43.330> this<00:04:43.480> script<00:04:43.720> off<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:44.350> website

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
go back into this script off the website

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.400 
go back into this script off the website
and<00:04:46.240> that'll<00:04:46.510> make<00:04:46.630> all<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:46.900> changes<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.380> your

and that'll make all the changes to your
script<00:04:47.740> necessary<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.340> make<00:04:48.460> this<00:04:48.580> work<00:04:48.820> in

onto your mirror plane and then also the

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.680 
onto your mirror plane and then also the
script<00:05:02.760> so<00:05:03.760> it's<00:05:03.910> got<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.330> mirror<00:05:05.080> shader<00:05:05.320> and

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690

can<00:05:34.300> handle<00:05:34.510> this<00:05:34.600> no<00:05:34.780> problem<00:05:34.810> since<00:05:35.290> it's

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
can handle this no problem since it's

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.150 
can handle this no problem since it's
the<00:05:35.470> only<00:05:35.590> thing<00:05:35.770> in<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:35.980> scene<00:05:38.010> sound<00:05:39.010> like<00:05:39.100> a

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
the only thing in the scene sound like a

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.650 
the only thing in the scene sound like a
laptop<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:39.730> something<00:05:39.970> I<00:05:40.060> probably<00:05:40.360> wouldn't

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
laptop and something I probably wouldn't

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.980 
laptop and something I probably wouldn't
recommend<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:42.000> yep<00:05:43.000> so<00:05:43.330> now<00:05:43.420> you<00:05:43.480> can<00:05:43.630> see<00:05:43.810> him

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
recommend it yep so now you can see him

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.570 
recommend it yep so now you can see him
pretty<00:05:44.380> well<00:05:44.500> it's<00:05:44.800> even<00:05:44.860> reflecting<00:05:45.370> a<00:05:45.430> bit

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
pretty well it's even reflecting a bit

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.920 
pretty well it's even reflecting a bit
of<00:05:45.670> the<00:05:45.730> light<00:05:45.880> see<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.240> lights<00:05:46.420> there<00:05:46.660> so

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
of the light see the lights there so

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.330 
of the light see the lights there so
it's<00:05:47.080> a<00:05:47.170> little<00:05:47.350> bit<00:05:47.530> brighter<00:05:47.740> in<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:47.920> mirror

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
it's a little bit brighter in the mirror

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.670 
it's a little bit brighter in the mirror
than<00:05:49.330> it<00:05:49.450> is<00:05:49.570> right<00:05:50.260> down<00:05:50.380> here

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
than it is right down here

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.670 
than it is right down here
his<00:05:51.070> other<00:05:51.160> reflection<00:05:52.200> kind<00:05:53.200> of<00:05:53.260> amplifies

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
his other reflection kind of amplifies

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.240 
his other reflection kind of amplifies
how<00:05:54.160> bright<00:05:54.400> it<00:05:54.490> is<00:05:55.770> yep<00:05:56.770> there's<00:05:56.950> our<00:05:57.070> little

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
how bright it is yep there's our little

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.530 
how bright it is yep there's our little
guy<00:05:57.340> there's<00:05:57.610> a<00:05:57.669> reflection<00:05:57.940> here's<00:05:58.360> my

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
guy there's a reflection here's my

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.659 
guy there's a reflection here's my
reflection<00:05:59.020> and<00:05:59.200> if<00:05:59.890> more<00:06:00.190> on<00:06:00.310> the<00:06:00.370> scene<00:06:00.550> to

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
reflection and if more on the scene to

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:01.950 
reflection and if more on the scene to
be<00:06:00.730> able<00:06:00.880> to<00:06:00.940> see<00:06:01.060> all<00:06:01.150> that<00:06:01.270> there's<00:06:01.690> a<00:06:01.780> box

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
be able to see all that there's a box

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.190 
be able to see all that there's a box
underneath<00:06:02.530> there<00:06:03.630> so<00:06:04.630> yeah<00:06:04.720> this<00:06:04.840> is<00:06:04.900> pretty

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
underneath there so yeah this is pretty

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.540 
underneath there so yeah this is pretty
much<00:06:05.290> what<00:06:05.470> you're<00:06:05.560> trying<00:06:05.740> to<00:06:05.770> achieve

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
much what you're trying to achieve

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.520 
much what you're trying to achieve
you<00:06:07.940> can<00:06:08.060> put<00:06:08.240> this<00:06:08.360> on<00:06:08.510> anything<00:06:09.110> just

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
you can put this on anything just

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.720 
you can put this on anything just
remember<00:06:09.590> that<00:06:09.890> it<00:06:09.980> only<00:06:10.100> reflects<00:06:10.490> in<00:06:10.640> the

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
remember that it only reflects in the

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.110 
remember that it only reflects in the
one<00:06:10.880> direction<00:06:11.740> which<00:06:12.740> is<00:06:12.920> the<00:06:13.100> the<00:06:13.760> forward

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
one direction which is the the forward

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.560 
one direction which is the the forward
direction<00:06:14.480> or<00:06:14.570> the<00:06:14.690> Y<00:06:14.720> direction<00:06:15.350> of<00:06:15.500> it<00:06:15.860> and

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
direction or the Y direction of it and

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.140 
direction or the Y direction of it and
that's<00:06:17.570> pretty<00:06:18.530> much<00:06:18.650> it<00:06:18.790> the<00:06:19.790> scripts<00:06:20.030> will

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
that's pretty much it the scripts will

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.250 
that's pretty much it the scripts will
be<00:06:20.210> on<00:06:20.300> the<00:06:20.390> website<00:06:20.510> I'll<00:06:20.870> have<00:06:20.960> a<00:06:21.020> link<00:06:21.200> to

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
be on the website I'll have a link to

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.380 
be on the website I'll have a link to
that<00:06:21.470> and<00:06:21.710> the<00:06:21.950> link<00:06:22.160> to<00:06:22.400> the<00:06:22.610> website<00:06:22.910> we're

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
that and the link to the website we're

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.520 
that and the link to the website we're
actually<00:06:23.660> out<00:06:23.780> the<00:06:23.870> original<00:06:24.020> scripts<00:06:24.380> will

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
actually out the original scripts will

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.130 
actually out the original scripts will
also<00:06:24.770> be<00:06:24.920> in<00:06:25.040> the<00:06:25.130> description<00:06:25.750> so<00:06:26.750> hopefully

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.140 
also be in the description so hopefully

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.770 
also be in the description so hopefully
this<00:06:27.290> helps<00:06:27.530> it's<00:06:27.830> a<00:06:28.070> much<00:06:28.400> better<00:06:29.270> way<00:06:29.540> to<00:06:29.600> do

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
this helps it's a much better way to do

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.050 
this helps it's a much better way to do
it<00:06:29.810> than<00:06:30.020> the<00:06:30.050> other<00:06:30.230> way<00:06:30.350> just<00:06:30.560> because<00:06:30.650> its

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
it than the other way just because its

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.060 
it than the other way just because its
first<00:06:32.060> of<00:06:32.150> all<00:06:32.210> easier<00:06:32.600> cleaner<00:06:32.990> you<00:06:33.950> don't

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
first of all easier cleaner you don't

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
first of all easier cleaner you don't
have<00:06:34.160> any<00:06:34.280> problems<00:06:34.550> with<00:06:34.640> the<00:06:34.700> reflection

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
have any problems with the reflection

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.940 
have any problems with the reflection
probe<00:06:35.540> picking<00:06:36.020> up<00:06:36.140> shadows<00:06:36.560> or<00:06:36.770> anything

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:36.950 
probe picking up shadows or anything

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.540 
probe picking up shadows or anything
like<00:06:37.160> that<00:06:38.050> so<00:06:39.050> this<00:06:39.950> is<00:06:40.070> the<00:06:40.130> way<00:06:40.220> to<00:06:40.280> do<00:06:40.430> it

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
like that so this is the way to do it

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.800 
like that so this is the way to do it
all<00:06:41.210> right<00:06:41.330> guess<00:06:41.800> why
