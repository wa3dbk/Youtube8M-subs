00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.139
 hello surfer who leaves sailing our 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.120
 site in the workshop football 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.550
 Come on then your production is full 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.980
 of student workshop biology 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.710
 I'll give you my tips to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.019
 my many biology tips on the back 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.939
 today I have prepared a subject that says 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.789
 respect to the test everybody says this 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.700
 but do not fall even let's go there is the such 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.980
 of the pc is the point of compensation can be 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.059
 Good, but I say it plummets for a 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.870
 noble motive right? 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.020
 here we have photosynthesis and breathing 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.450
 united in an event just is not cool then 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.210
 first killed here on top of the equation 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.030
 of the photosynthesis below the equation 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.219
 general of inspiration to europe and here 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.579
 I'm putting it with the colors and it looks like 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.030
 photosynthesis, and here in the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.520
 rosy the fuchsia aerobic respiration does not 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.299
 I was there, look here with subtlety 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.340
 of the event that photosynthesis only 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.490
 occurs in the Portuguese presence 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.450
 Incidentally the name itself says here Photo 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.299
 simple, right? 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.540
 On the other hand the expansion happens 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.600
 night or at night the plant has life 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.180
 At night the plant will break 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.869
 organic matter in fact the xxii of 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.090
 organic matter to obtain the energy 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.570
 vital for their processes is legal and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.380
 the pc point of strong compensation with it 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.680
 is not here neither he neither here nor as 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.770
 little is exactly here is the point of 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.340
 light intensity where photosynthesis 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.140
 it is the inspiration if they are equivalent to 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.620
 It's true here, good. 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.440
 and it looks like it 's a 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.530
 the other eye in these two equations by 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.350
 example is exactly at this point here 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.500
 how is the production and consumption of 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.480
 glucose the same look well look here 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:10.869
 At this point the plant produces a 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.230
 certain amount of glucose and goes 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.510
 also consume the same intensity 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.060
 It's cool he's going to compete with other 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.210
 substances for example what the plant 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.640
 produced of carbon dioxide at that time 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.260
 will also consume at the same intensity 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.850
 Identical reasoning with oxygen looks 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:37.390
 here it produced a certain amount x 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.200
 also consumed this same amount x 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.060
 huh 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.160
 Good, so you're watching a 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.340
 intercalation between products 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.810
 reagents of both photosynthesis and 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.940
 also the right inspiration 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.310
 but the key to the class is clear 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.880
 especially for entrance exams and you 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.790
 compare to the right and left of the ps 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.180
 serves for example the director of pcf 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.450
 come on something pretty simple blank pr 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.700
 look the green is one of the rose 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.480
 great idea on a Cartesian plane 5th 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.500
 series nÃ© the 6th year, come on, your green is 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.170
 pink mode 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.340
 then it means that the consumption of 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.800
 glucose is greater than its production and 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.430
 if you produce a mode that you consume 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:31.690
 an accident will happen just this 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:35.410
 surplus is here to see him take 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.940
 starch ie the excess glucose is 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.530
 competed and fear 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.560
 I already dueled 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.959
 comes to reserves and vegetables is good and 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.069
 what the pcf left the opposite 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.459
 can here 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.220
 consumption is a production plate 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.940
 Especially when the night comes. 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.830
 therefore of the dark only has consumption and 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.650
 has glucose production 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.750
 good now at that time the plant is going 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.600
 do the exact opposite 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.080
 look here on part of the friend she reserved 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.810
 in the most favorable hours it is competing 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.500
 in glucose but that's okay but for what? 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.410
 with pt 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.430
 This friend and psychosis are here, remember. 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.720
 exploitation evening and night occurs 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.980
 photosynthesis 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.900
 only during the day is cool but with 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.540
 so much I did not want him dabbling 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.190
 carry the next thought I already know 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.600
 then it means that throughout life 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.540
 of the plant 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.180
 she took more inspiration than 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.430
 photosynthesis since the expression happens 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.070
 and photosynthesis 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.350
 only during the day does not deny this 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.630
 information for your home and of course 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.080
 especially for the college entrance examination and 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.750
 full proof is here who saw it 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.880
 here is a clear eraser in an alley here 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.850
 has synthetic substance but catching 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.060
 only this organic part here 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.710
 wood what I have to I have one 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.169
 vegetable piece 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.390
 if I have a vegetable piece I have 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.510
 organic matter and this matter 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:14.979
 from photosynthesis 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.840
 therefore although aaa photosynthesis 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.479
 occurs during the day 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.380
 if you think for the whole life of the 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.590
 plant 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.710
 she did more photosynthesis than 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.780
 breathed in a matter that was already 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.040
 was from the fuvest and can usually paint 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.130
 no vestibular is 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:37.050
 It's nice the people do a good job in the 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.050
 exams and even more
