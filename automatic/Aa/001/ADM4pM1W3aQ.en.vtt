00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.560
 here now that the sky is looking 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.650
 here you do not have to look 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:35.590
 right in the middle but just when you 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.590
 cuddle the TV 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.260

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.060
 they break and that is there in the background 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.840
 worth is worth the big leather guard 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:55.350
 the big one that breaks if I'm worth it 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.350
 I tell you this if I'm to remove yes yes 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:06.889

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.610

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.110
 there flashing keys after supposes 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.630
 which is the portal that is supposed to be 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:51.300
 carries well 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:54.280
 it's worth the portal what goes there 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.780
 little by little and then they are not halfway through 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.630
 distance from the table will be with a 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:02.370
 black dot the black dot is because 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.370
