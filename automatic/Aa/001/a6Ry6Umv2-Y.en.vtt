00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.459 
our that's one of the reasons why we had
a<00:01:58.979> restructure<00:01:59.460> a<00:02:00.329> couple<00:02:00.840> contracts<00:02:01.290> or

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
a restructure a couple contracts or

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.859 
a restructure a couple contracts or
least<00:02:01.649> one<00:02:01.829> contract<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.180> feel<00:02:03.540> good<00:02:03.689> where

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
least one contract so I feel good where

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.010 
least one contract so I feel good where
we're<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> lot<00:02:05.460> more<00:02:05.610> depth<00:02:06.020> that

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
we're at we have a lot more depth that

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.630 
we're at we have a lot more depth that
would<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.350> able<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> three<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.580> those

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
would be able to get a three of those

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.400 
would be able to get a three of those
players<00:02:08.970> back<00:02:09.270> for<00:02:09.509> sure

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
players back for sure

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.970 
players back for sure
so<00:02:11.450> hopefully<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:13.320> take<00:02:13.500> advantage<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.920> it

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
so hopefully we take advantage of it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.160 
so hopefully we take advantage of it
just<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.940> quick<00:02:15.120> fault<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.690> did<00:02:15.960> you<00:02:16.080> have

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
just a quick fault to that did you have

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.830 
just a quick fault to that did you have
to<00:02:16.350> make<00:02:16.500> any<00:02:16.740> decisions<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.790> cut<00:02:18.360> down<00:02:18.570> day

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
to make any decisions on cut down day

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.780 
to make any decisions on cut down day
different<00:02:19.740> than<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.920> would<00:02:20.100> have<00:02:20.130> based<00:02:20.490> him

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
different than you would have based him

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.420 
different than you would have based him
on<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.060> cat<00:02:21.300> penalty<00:02:21.720> no<00:02:22.290> we<00:02:22.410> did<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.590> and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
on the cat penalty no we did not and

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.360 
on the cat penalty no we did not and
then<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.630> out<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:25.050> inside<00:02:25.440> we<00:02:26.220> had<00:02:26.340> a

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.370 
know they've earned that position and I
like<00:03:15.240> what<00:03:15.390> I've<00:03:15.510> seen<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:16.050> know<00:03:16.140> with<00:03:16.260> their

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.850 
like what I've seen you know with their
young<00:03:16.590> guys<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:18.090> know<00:03:18.570> they<00:03:18.690> got<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:19.050> lot<00:03:19.800> of

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
young guys you know they got a lot of

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.980 
young guys you know they got a lot of
potential<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:20.610> they<00:03:21.360> still<00:03:21.570> got<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.810> carry

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
potential but they still got to carry

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.740 
potential but they still got to carry
over<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.320> field<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:22.830> hopefully<00:03:23.459> we<00:03:24.300> can<00:03:24.540> play

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
over the field so hopefully we can play

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.180 
over the field so hopefully we can play
the<00:03:24.900> way<00:03:24.990> we've<00:03:25.140> been<00:03:25.170> practicing<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.040> that's

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
the way we've been practicing and that's

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.290 
the way we've been practicing and that's
at<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.340> very<00:03:26.550> high<00:03:26.580> level<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:29.100> are<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.640> think<00:03:29.910> 15

at a very high level you are I think 15

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
games but you get a chance to look on a

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.410

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
look at them on Sunday and Monday so you

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.360 
look at them on Sunday and Monday so you
get<00:04:03.570> a<00:04:03.600> little<00:04:03.780> jump<00:04:04.140> on<00:04:04.350> those<00:04:04.800> teams<00:04:05.160> that

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
get a little jump on those teams that

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.580 
get a little jump on those teams that
you<00:04:05.489> do<00:04:05.580> play<00:04:05.820> after<00:04:06.230> like<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.260> Monday<00:04:07.560> night

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
you do play after like a Monday night

you do play after like a Monday night
game<00:04:07.709> on<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.070> short<00:04:08.340> week<00:04:08.420> so<00:04:09.420> that's<00:04:09.750> typical

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
game on a short week so that's typical

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.740 
game on a short week so that's typical
any<00:04:11.040> particular<00:04:11.310> reason<00:04:11.640> in<00:04:12.180> your<00:04:12.360> mind<00:04:12.570> for

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
any particular reason in your mind for

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.050 
any particular reason in your mind for
the<00:04:12.900> week<00:04:13.380> one<00:04:13.620> success<00:04:14.070> just<00:04:14.730> anything

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
the week one success just anything

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.360 
the week one success just anything
different<00:04:15.630> week<00:04:16.260> 1<00:04:16.470> versus<00:04:16.830> any<00:04:16.980> other<00:04:17.070> week

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
different week 1 versus any other week

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.190 
different week 1 versus any other week
for<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.640> I<00:04:17.820> think<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:18.870> know<00:04:18.930> you<00:04:19.049> get<00:04:19.169> a

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
for you I think you know you get a

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.599 
for you I think you know you get a
little<00:04:19.320> bit<00:04:19.470> more<00:04:19.590> time<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.919> prepare<00:04:20.070> you're

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
little bit more time to prepare you're

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.640 
little bit more time to prepare you're
preparing<00:04:21.150> throughout<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.570> offseason<00:04:21.690> so

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
preparing throughout the offseason so

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.990 
preparing throughout the offseason so
hopefully<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:24.130> take<00:04:24.460> advantage<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:24.880> that

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
hopefully you take advantage of that

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.480 
hopefully you take advantage of that
preparation<00:04:28.350> what<00:04:29.350> areas<00:04:29.740> do<00:04:29.920> quarterbacks

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
preparation what areas do quarterbacks

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.800 
preparation what areas do quarterbacks
when<00:04:30.610> they<00:04:30.670> make<00:04:30.880> that<00:04:31.060> jump<00:04:31.330> from<00:04:31.510> year<00:04:31.690> one

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
when they make that jump from year one

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.210 
when they make that jump from year one
to<00:04:31.840> year<00:04:31.960> two<00:04:32.140> what<00:04:32.770> are<00:04:32.890> some<00:04:32.920> of<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.130> areas

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
to year two what are some of the areas

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.040 
to year two what are some of the areas
where<00:04:33.490> they<00:04:33.610> really<00:04:34.060> make<00:04:34.270> it<00:04:34.450> bigger<00:04:34.690> leap

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
where they really make it bigger leap

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.810 
where they really make it bigger leap
then<00:04:35.530> some<00:04:35.770> others<00:04:36.010> well<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.460> think<00:04:36.550> we're<00:04:36.730> not

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
then some others well I think we're not

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.370 
then some others well I think we're not
quarterback<00:04:37.270> comes<00:04:37.540> in<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:38.110> know<00:04:38.170> he's

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.720 
formations usually it's all the above
and<00:04:47.020> then<00:04:47.860> you<00:04:48.010> got<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:48.190> take<00:04:48.430> a<00:04:48.460> look<00:04:48.610> at

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
and then you got to take a look at

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.040 
and then you got to take a look at
different<00:04:49.000> defenses<00:04:49.570> you<00:04:49.780> know<00:04:49.870> different

you learn all these new things and

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.860 
you learn all these new things and
you're<00:04:54.910> not<00:04:55.030> even<00:04:55.180> really<00:04:55.390> thinking<00:04:55.810> about

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
you're not even really thinking about

the defense's you're facing and so you

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.060 
the defense's you're facing and so you

fully healthy how much does that take

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.620 
fully healthy how much does that take
the<00:05:39.430> pressure<00:05:39.640> off<00:05:39.790> the<00:05:39.970> secondary<00:05:40.390> how<00:05:40.510> much

really change things for those guys well

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.450 
really change things for those guys well
I<00:05:43.990> don't<00:05:44.050> care<00:05:44.260> how<00:05:44.410> good<00:05:44.650> your<00:05:44.860> secondary<00:05:45.250> is

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
I don't care how good your secondary is

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.620 
I don't care how good your secondary is
if<00:05:45.580> you<00:05:45.670> don't<00:05:45.820> have<00:05:45.940> a<00:05:45.970> pass<00:05:46.240> rush<00:05:46.480> you're

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
if you don't have a pass rush you're

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.570 
if you don't have a pass rush you're
going<00:05:46.750> to<00:05:46.810> be<00:05:46.900> in<00:05:46.930> for<00:05:47.200> a<00:05:47.230> long<00:05:47.260> day<00:05:47.620> you<00:05:48.430> can

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
going to be in for a long day you can

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.100 
going to be in for a long day you can
have<00:05:48.610> a<00:05:48.730> great<00:05:48.940> secondary<00:05:49.450> and<00:05:49.690> if<00:05:49.780> you<00:05:49.900> have<00:05:50.080> a

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
have a great secondary and if you have a

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.110 
have a great secondary and if you have a
poor<00:05:50.380> average<00:05:50.740> pass<00:05:51.190> for<00:05:51.370> us<00:05:51.430> your<00:05:51.700> second<00:05:52.030> or

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
poor average pass for us your second or

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.280 
poor average pass for us your second or
your<00:05:52.180> secondaries<00:05:52.990> going<00:05:53.110> to<00:05:53.170> look<00:05:53.260> pretty

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
your secondaries going to look pretty

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.090 
your secondaries going to look pretty
average<00:05:53.760> so<00:05:54.760> I<00:05:54.790> think<00:05:55.180> any<00:05:55.330> NFL<00:05:56.230> football<00:05:56.800> team

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
average so I think any NFL football team

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.220 
average so I think any NFL football team
has<00:05:57.460> you<00:05:58.000> know<00:05:58.090> success<00:05:58.540> of<00:05:58.660> the<00:05:58.720> defensive

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
has you know success of the defensive

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.480 
has you know success of the defensive
predicated<00:05:59.770> not<00:05:59.890> only<00:06:00.040> having<00:06:00.280> a<00:06:00.340> great

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
predicated not only having a great

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.700 
predicated not only having a great
secondary<00:06:00.880> but<00:06:01.030> a<00:06:01.120> great<00:06:01.240> pass<00:06:01.480> rush<00:06:01.750> and<00:06:01.990> for

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
secondary but a great pass rush and for

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.590 
secondary but a great pass rush and for
some<00:06:02.890> reason<00:06:02.920> you<00:06:03.250> do<00:06:03.400> lose<00:06:04.090> a<00:06:04.120> number<00:06:04.540> of

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
some reason you do lose a number of

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.060 
some reason you do lose a number of
players<00:06:04.840> then<00:06:05.620> you<00:06:05.740> got<00:06:05.830> to<00:06:05.890> be<00:06:06.040> able

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
players then you got to be able

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.340 
players then you got to be able
improvise<00:06:07.030> and<00:06:07.270> try<00:06:07.480> to<00:06:07.540> create<00:06:07.900> some<00:06:08.140> type<00:06:08.290> of

improvise and try to create some type of

improvise and try to create some type of
pressure<00:06:10.140> Mike<00:06:11.140> Michael<00:06:11.830> Vick<00:06:12.070> was<00:06:12.100> telling

pressure Mike Michael Vick was telling

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.000 
pressure Mike Michael Vick was telling
us<00:06:12.760> by<00:06:13.060> the<00:06:13.120> teleconference<00:06:13.990> that<00:06:14.140> really

until just this year he didn't learn how
