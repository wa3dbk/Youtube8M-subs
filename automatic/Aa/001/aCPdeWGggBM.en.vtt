shiny<00:03:08.540> pokemon<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.500> i'm<00:03:09.740> making<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:10.910> hard

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
shiny pokemon so i'm making a hard

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.760 
shiny pokemon so i'm making a hard
decision<00:03:11.270> here<00:03:11.690> between<00:03:11.840> ultra<00:03:12.410> ball<00:03:12.590> and

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
decision here between ultra ball and

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.190 
decision here between ultra ball and
repeat<00:03:13.160> ball<00:03:13.430> I've<00:03:14.150> already<00:03:14.420> caught<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.750> abra

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
repeat ball I've already caught the abra

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.430 
repeat ball I've already caught the abra
so<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.709> repeat<00:03:16.100> ball<00:03:16.340> chances<00:03:16.880> is<00:03:17.110> about<00:03:18.110> the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
so the repeat ball chances is about the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.130 
so the repeat ball chances is about the
same<00:03:18.680> as<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.640> ultra<00:03:19.940> bar<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.330> depends<00:03:20.959> I

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140
