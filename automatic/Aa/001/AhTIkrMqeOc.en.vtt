00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
familiar if you haven't changed these

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.210 
familiar if you haven't changed these
settings<00:01:22.470> before<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.170> ISO<00:01:25.740> speed

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
settings before so you have ISO speed

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.999 
settings before so you have ISO speed
range<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.909> auto<00:01:27.750> ISO<00:01:28.380> range<00:01:29.479> okay

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
range and auto ISO range okay

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
range and auto ISO range okay
now<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.280> sets<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> overall<00:01:32.850> system<00:01:33.810> ISO

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
now this sets the overall system ISO

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.870 
now this sets the overall system ISO
speed<00:01:34.740> range

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
speed range

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.499

you<00:01:37.869> know<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.170> second<00:01:38.560> year<00:01:39.060> yet<00:01:40.060> your<00:01:40.240> mental

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
you know the second year yet your mental

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.600 
you know the second year yet your mental
should<00:01:40.990> always<00:01:41.259> be<00:01:41.619> on<00:01:43.950> 104<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.039> second<00:01:45.490> one

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
should always be on 104 the second one

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.889 
should always be on 104 the second one
now<00:01:45.969> it's<00:01:46.119> going<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.299> be<00:01:46.360> defaulted<00:01:47.110> at<00:01:47.429> 6400

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
now it's going to be defaulted at 6400

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.510 
now it's going to be defaulted at 6400
but<00:01:49.899> you<00:01:50.439> can<00:01:50.590> go<00:01:50.710> up<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.860> 1200<00:01:51.340> 1200<00:01:53.009> 8412<00:01:54.009> 800

there's<00:02:24.849> a<00:02:24.910> lot<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.180> philosophy<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.780> know

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
there's a lot of philosophy you know

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.809 
there's a lot of philosophy you know
should<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.620> shoot<00:02:26.799> auto<00:02:27.069> or<00:02:27.400> should<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.700> not

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
should you shoot auto or should you not

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
and really I am a firm believer if

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.520 
and really I am a firm believer if

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.160 
just totally blast the picture and let's
say<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.799> is<00:03:05.950> for<00:03:06.250> done<00:03:07.150> in<00:03:07.269> run<00:03:07.420> situations

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
say this is for done in run situations

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.120 
say this is for done in run situations
you<00:03:08.799> shootin<00:03:09.100> tripod<00:03:09.609> set<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.209> 100<00:03:10.739> but<00:03:11.739> you

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
you shootin tripod set it to 100 but you

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.780 
you shootin tripod set it to 100 but you
know<00:03:13.950> anyway<00:03:14.950> minimum<00:03:15.660> always<00:03:16.660> 100<00:03:17.790> maximum

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
know anyway minimum always 100 maximum

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.629 
know anyway minimum always 100 maximum
now<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.780> maximum<00:03:20.410> setting<00:03:20.769> mine<00:03:20.920> down<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.459> is

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
now the maximum setting mine down to is

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.460 
now the maximum setting mine down to is
3200<00:03:23.340> 1600<00:03:24.340> would<00:03:24.519> be<00:03:24.639> good<00:03:25.200> 800<00:03:26.200> would<00:03:26.319> be
