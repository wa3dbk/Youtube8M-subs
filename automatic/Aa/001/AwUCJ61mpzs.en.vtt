show<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.670> picture<00:02:11.910> right<00:02:12.060> now<00:02:12.420> as<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.840> can

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
show you a picture right now as you can

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.920 
show you a picture right now as you can
see<00:02:13.020> i<00:02:13.500> have<00:02:13.920> got<00:02:14.310> plenty<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.270> rub<00:02:15.690> on

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
see i have got plenty of that rub on

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.680 
see i have got plenty of that rub on
that<00:02:16.350> brisket<00:02:16.800> this<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.400> no<00:02:17.670> foil<00:02:18.060> technique

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
that brisket this is a no foil technique

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.980 
that brisket this is a no foil technique
so<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.320> can't<00:02:19.620> be<00:02:19.740> adding<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.340> stuff<00:02:20.670> and

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
so you can't be adding this stuff and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.050 
so you can't be adding this stuff and
then<00:02:21.990> wrapping<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.770> in<00:02:22.890> foil<00:02:23.160> because<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:23.910> has

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
then wrapping it in foil because it has
