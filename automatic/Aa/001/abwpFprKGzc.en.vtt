00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
key aspects like hardware design games

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.470 
key aspects like hardware design games
online<00:00:33.470> and<00:00:34.190> other<00:00:34.640> things<00:00:35.060> that<00:00:35.180> are<00:00:35.300> going

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
online and other things that are going

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
to give you a full sense of what the 3ds

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.940 
to give you a full sense of what the 3ds
is<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:39.050> what<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:39.800> can<00:00:39.980> do<00:00:40.300> so<00:00:41.530> obviously<00:00:42.530> you

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
is and what it can do so obviously you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.670 
is and what it can do so obviously you
can<00:00:43.100> see<00:00:43.250> the<00:00:43.370> 30s<00:00:43.790> right<00:00:44.000> here<00:00:44.300> on<00:00:44.480> now<00:00:45.379> let's

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
can see the 30s right here on now let's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.000 
can see the 30s right here on now let's
take<00:00:45.920> a<00:00:45.950> look<00:00:46.160> at<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.370> hardware<00:00:46.730> design

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
take a look at the hardware design

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.340 
take a look at the hardware design
starting<00:00:49.010> with<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.790> two<00:00:50.450> cameras<00:00:50.900> at<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.110> top

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
starting with the two cameras at the top

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.030 
starting with the two cameras at the top
which<00:00:51.950> are<00:00:52.129> used<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:52.610> take<00:00:52.879> new<00:00:53.720> 3d<00:00:54.530> pictures

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
which are used to take new 3d pictures

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.939 
which are used to take new 3d pictures
but<00:00:55.339> unfortunately<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.720> cameras<00:00:57.230> only<00:00:57.409> have

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
but unfortunately the cameras only have

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.820 
but unfortunately the cameras only have
zero<00:00:58.309> point<00:00:58.580> three<00:00:58.659> megapixels<00:00:59.659> and<00:00:59.839> the<00:01:00.379> 3d

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
zero point three megapixels and the 3d

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.850 
zero point three megapixels and the 3d
pictures<00:01:01.220> can<00:01:01.460> only<00:01:01.760> be<00:01:02.059> viewed<00:01:02.089> on<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.350> 3ds

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
pictures can only be viewed on the 3ds

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.680 
pictures can only be viewed on the 3ds
um<00:01:05.530> you<00:01:06.530> know<00:01:06.680> which<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.670> pretty<00:01:07.909> good<00:01:08.180> but

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
um you know which is pretty good but

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.460 
um you know which is pretty good but
what<00:01:09.229> mainly<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.600> main<00:01:11.780> important<00:01:12.229> part

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
what mainly is the main important part

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.170 
what mainly is the main important part
is<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.890> zero<00:01:13.130> point<00:01:13.280> three<00:01:13.400> megapixels

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
is the zero point three megapixels

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.060 
is the zero point three megapixels
because<00:01:14.450> it's<00:01:14.600> sometimes<00:01:15.110> ruins<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.650> 3d

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
because it's sometimes ruins the 3d

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.130 
because it's sometimes ruins the 3d
effect<00:01:16.240> but<00:01:17.240> we'll<00:01:17.450> talk<00:01:17.659> more<00:01:17.840> about<00:01:17.960> the

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
effect but we'll talk more about the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.740 
effect but we'll talk more about the
camera<00:01:18.440> later<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:19.820> can<00:01:20.060> also<00:01:20.210> see<00:01:20.479> that

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
camera later so you can also see that

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.810 
camera later so you can also see that
right<00:01:20.990> here<00:01:21.260> you<00:01:21.380> have<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.530> small<00:01:22.010> light<00:01:22.310> that

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
right here you have a small light that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.610 
right here you have a small light that
tells<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.240> when<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.630> camera<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.049> being<00:01:24.350> used

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
tells you when the camera is being used

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.270 
tells you when the camera is being used
and<00:01:25.720> another<00:01:26.720> small<00:01:27.020> light<00:01:27.410> at<00:01:27.620> the<00:01:27.680> top<00:01:27.890> right

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
and another small light at the top right

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.910 
and another small light at the top right
corner<00:01:28.490> here<00:01:28.940> that<00:01:29.540> indicates<00:01:29.720> when<00:01:30.560> either

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
corner here that indicates when either

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.970 
corner here that indicates when either
your<00:01:31.400> battery<00:01:31.820> is<00:01:31.940> running<00:01:32.150> low<00:01:32.330> or<00:01:32.860> when<00:01:33.860> you

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
your battery is running low or when you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.340 
your battery is running low or when you
have<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.250> new<00:01:34.490> streetpass<00:01:35.120> or<00:01:35.450> when<00:01:35.690> spotpass

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
have a new streetpass or when spotpass

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.390 
have a new streetpass or when spotpass
is<00:01:36.590> active<00:01:37.130> now<00:01:37.340> let's<00:01:38.270> look<00:01:38.390> at<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.630> side<00:01:38.840> uh

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
is active now let's look at the side uh

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.680 
is active now let's look at the side uh
which<00:01:40.400> we've<00:01:40.730> got<00:01:40.970> now<00:01:41.240> right<00:01:41.480> here<00:01:41.630> a

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.970 
got the game slot uh with the new 3ds
game<00:02:16.910> cartridges<00:02:17.540> which<00:02:18.530> are<00:02:18.680> pretty<00:02:18.860> much

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
game cartridges which are pretty much

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.000 
game cartridges which are pretty much
the<00:02:19.040> same<00:02:19.190> size<00:02:19.610> as<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:19.849> DS<00:02:20.180> cartridge<00:02:20.690> but<00:02:21.680> now

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
the same size as a DS cartridge but now

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.949 
the same size as a DS cartridge but now
it's<00:02:22.250> white<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.180> has<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.330> little<00:02:23.599> hinge

easier what's in the background and
what's<00:03:41.269> in<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.480> foreground<00:03:41.870> for<00:03:42.290> example<00:03:42.709> if

it feels very comfortable and it's very

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.009 
it feels very comfortable and it's very
astounding<00:03:52.040> how<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:52.640> 3d<00:03:53.090> effect<00:03:53.120> works<00:03:53.690> is

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
astounding how the 3d effect works is

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.250 
astounding how the 3d effect works is
that<00:03:54.049> there's<00:03:54.549> two<00:03:55.549> images<00:03:56.860> that<00:03:57.860> line<00:03:58.610> up<00:03:58.910> and

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
that there's two images that line up and

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.680 
that there's two images that line up and
then<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:01.100> gives<00:04:01.280> you<00:04:01.459> that<00:04:01.610> 3d<00:04:02.060> effect<00:04:02.420> into

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
then it gives you that 3d effect into

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.870 
then it gives you that 3d effect into
your<00:04:03.049> eyes<00:04:03.290> um<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:05.120> know<00:04:05.239> it's<00:04:05.630> got<00:04:05.840> different

your eyes um you know it's got different
sweet<00:04:07.880> spots<00:04:08.299> in<00:04:08.660> which<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:11.030> know<00:04:11.380> you<00:04:12.380> can

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
sweet spots in which you know you can

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.920 
sweet spots in which you know you can
see<00:04:12.829> the<00:04:12.980> 3d<00:04:13.250> just<00:04:13.519> fine<00:04:13.760> but<00:04:14.359> if<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:14.540> tilt<00:04:14.750> it

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
see the 3d just fine but if you tilt it

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.199 
see the 3d just fine but if you tilt it
a<00:04:15.109> little<00:04:15.410> bit<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.859> the<00:04:16.039> right<00:04:16.070> you'll<00:04:16.549> see<00:04:16.640> the

you it's true not many games have online
at<00:05:38.539> this<00:05:38.629> moment<00:05:38.869> and<00:05:39.229> the<00:05:39.709> 3ds<00:05:40.129> community<00:05:40.789> has

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
at this moment and the 3ds community has

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.350 
at this moment and the 3ds community has
an<00:05:41.539> enlarged<00:05:41.990> enough<00:05:42.319> but<00:05:43.129> it's<00:05:43.789> a<00:05:44.059> lot

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
an enlarged enough but it's a lot

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.779 
an enlarged enough but it's a lot
simpler<00:05:44.899> than<00:05:45.050> the<00:05:45.499> wii<00:05:45.649> for<00:05:46.279> example

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
simpler than the wii for example

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.119 
simpler than the wii for example
compared<00:05:47.569> to<00:05:47.689> the<00:05:47.779> week<00:05:47.959> you<00:05:48.349> only<00:05:48.469> need<00:05:48.740> one

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.129 
compared to the week you only need one

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.850 
compared to the week you only need one
friend<00:05:49.519> code<00:05:49.789> which<00:05:50.269> really<00:05:51.080> does<00:05:51.469> simplify

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
friend code which really does simplify

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.639 
friend code which really does simplify
adding<00:05:52.459> friends<00:05:52.749> but<00:05:53.749> unfortunately<00:05:53.899> there's

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:54.649 
adding friends but unfortunately there's

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:57.100 
adding friends but unfortunately there's
a<00:05:54.740> downfall<00:05:55.370> you<00:05:56.089> can't<00:05:56.360> send<00:05:56.599> messages<00:05:57.080> to

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
a downfall you can't send messages to

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.509 
a downfall you can't send messages to
them<00:05:57.439> but<00:05:58.339> really<00:05:59.089> another<00:05:59.659> thing<00:06:00.019> is<00:06:00.249> most<00:06:01.249> of

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:01.519 
them but really another thing is most of

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:04.329 
them but really another thing is most of
the<00:06:01.580> upcoming<00:06:01.909> 3ds<00:06:02.899> games<00:06:03.409> will<00:06:03.889> have<00:06:04.069> online

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:04.339 
the upcoming 3ds games will have online

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:06.909 
the upcoming 3ds games will have online
and<00:06:04.909> it's<00:06:05.449> gonna<00:06:05.689> be<00:06:05.899> as<00:06:06.019> organized<00:06:06.469> as<00:06:06.620> super

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
and it's gonna be as organized as super

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.129 
and it's gonna be as organized as super
street<00:06:07.129> fighter<00:06:07.159> 4<00:06:07.610> then<00:06:08.180> I<00:06:08.300> think<00:06:08.569> the<00:06:08.719> 3ds

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
street fighter 4 then I think the 3ds

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.529 
street fighter 4 then I think the 3ds
community<00:06:09.769> will<00:06:10.059> definitely<00:06:11.059> get<00:06:11.240> bigger

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
community will definitely get bigger

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.399 
community will definitely get bigger
really<00:06:12.409> fast<00:06:12.830> because<00:06:13.779> street<00:06:14.779> fighter<00:06:14.959> 4<00:06:15.229> has

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.409 
really fast because street fighter 4 has

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:17.949 
really fast because street fighter 4 has
a<00:06:15.439> simple<00:06:15.800> joining<00:06:16.459> a<00:06:16.550> match<00:06:16.729> online<00:06:17.059> kind<00:06:17.809> of

a<00:06:18.999> system<00:06:19.999> it's<00:06:20.930> very<00:06:21.259> simple<00:06:21.649> and<00:06:22.039> very

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:22.209 
a system it's very simple and very

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:24.999 
a system it's very simple and very

better than the wii a home console but
it<00:07:30.410> still<00:07:30.770> needs<00:07:31.040> a<00:07:31.340> bit<00:07:32.000> of<00:07:32.030> work<00:07:32.180> and<00:07:32.780> overall
