00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.360
 hello here steffen of the leyen and me 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.259
 have the new samsung for you here 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.419
 galaxy note 3 was at ifa 2013 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:24.880
 this year presents the new 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:26.019
 smart ed from korea and we'll see 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.039
 if we look that way out a bit 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.349
 to look at the nearness 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.759
 the back is different we have it 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.980
 no longer with the smooth plastic too 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.199
 but like this is one here 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.610
 top in leather look it is not 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.230
 real leather what you do as well 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.210
 a little bit stuck and it feels 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.040
 actually very nice to is a 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.809
 Where in the hand would have been a little better 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.000
 we're about to do a 3 10 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.900
 megapixel camera so 5 megapixels more 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.979
 as the last model with LED flash 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.269
 Also the side of the frame is a 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:56.199
 bit redesigned with so 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.780
 a little rain pattern on the 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.510
 back and a bottom you see 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.129
 a usb 3.0 ports 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.710
 that has so far synonymous with none 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:10.290
 smartphone smartpad can be seen 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.290
 but also with a usb 2.0 cable load 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.359
 Here below me that already from the 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.429
 Know previous models of models is the 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.899
 pen in it 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.310
 samsung dedicates this to the model 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.200
 a little more attention there is 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.450
 significantly more features than before 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.609
 we all detail you again 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.479
 Imagine if the device is so far 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:33.780
 is can already see here 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.979
 This opens the air command menu 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.509
 that either can be called that 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.600
 when the pen is pulled out or 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.280
 if I keep to do it again 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.340
 pin lightly over the display presses the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.439
 button and there it is again on the are 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.069
 partially revised partially new 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.899
 Features 2 seems action mimo exists 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.359
 I can say a few examples 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.310
 for example when I make a note of a number 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.600
 I will be able to talk here now 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.359
 call up the menu 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.859
 he offers me the note 3 things like me 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.729
 can call the number can contact 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.829
 save 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.020
 send a message to a website 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.179
 go in google maps and such 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.160
 stories must be practical 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.610
 See everything in the test how often you do that 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.610
 used back 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.610
 Overall, a quad-core processor 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.620
 presumable snapdragon 800 with 2.3 ghz 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.980
 3 gb ram so pretty good, too 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.920
 The battery has a capacity 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.930
 of 3200 milliamps should be so 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.940
 walk quite well 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.720
 the display of the galaxy note 3 has 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.400
 a diagonal of 5.7 inches and is 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.870
 again a super-amoled display this time 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.370
 with full hd resolution that looks good 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.830
 very very impressive though 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.140
 you look at it from the side, the 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.560
 It can be something but that is not 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.510
 only new product from samsung because 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.920
 The smart watch is Samsung Galaxy 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.350
 Greed man has such a before 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.230
 there are six in a little bit 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.080
 different colors had the thing 2 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:07.570
 inch large display with a resolution 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.940
 320x320 pixels in the bracelet 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.080
 a 1 9 megapixel camera installed the 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.260
 Usually when I have the time now 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.670
 wearing on the arm would point forward and 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.620
 that would be pictures and videos 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.209
 nothing wants 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.850
 it's about 11 millimeters thick so 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.140
 not even so slim 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.600
 but it looks pretty nice in six 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.310
 different colors and the operation 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.019
 done next to this home button here 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.570
 especially by gestures when I live 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.940
 from above pure vision I always come in 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.370
 the camera 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.770
 Can simply trigger by a tip 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.960
 on the screen no video mode 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.720
 seems like 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.270
 back it is always from above and 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.560
 from below Rheins Rhenish comes every 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.040
 phone menu because I can with the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.580
 of course my contacts call 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.630
 back again and from the side 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.710
 Now the menu looks natural 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.290
 Contacts notification apps are out there 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.420
 to start according to samsung over 70 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.940
 customized apps the extra for the galaxy 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.700
 s smart watch and the smaller accessory 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.250
 display have been optimized by 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.840
 Music about fitness apps to else 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.060
 something that is quite a bit of it 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.519
 the bottom we are such a row 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.620
 of contacts 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.549
 These are for the loading of the above 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.500
 she should be responsible 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.780
 unfortunately only one day active use 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.310
 stick around 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.570
 The load then works over one 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.270
 adapter looks like there will be the clock 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.790
 then the adapter is deceived 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.470
 closed and then I can the clock 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.090
 here via the usb port with a 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.580
 normal charger, however, again 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.140
 then usb2 then recharge one 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.380
 to walk through the area for a long day 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.950
 can 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.300
 the red on the clip of the clock the whole 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.820
 By the way, the bracelet is in the 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.100
 Size adjust somehow so 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.450
 different sizes can do it 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.460
 here is a speaker still installed 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.250
 So just have an audio output 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.930
 There is a direct connection to the ruhr and microphone 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.350
 also because I phone them with it 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.790
 can 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.890
 The microphone sits next to three first 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.040
 is a classic evolution 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.940
 from the previous model better display 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.260
 faster processor more 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.370
 main memory such things new 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.210
 functions of the pen the clock is new 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.060
 you have to see how they are in the 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.530
 I personally suggest everyday life 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.470
 relatively thick because they eleven 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.580
 millimeter thick is but in the evening 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.410
 actually still comparatively 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.730
 pleasant but comfortable that this is the bracelet 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.230
 very tight is very very inflexible 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.710
 must wait and see what that costs, yes 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.390
 somehow additional product 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.970
 no independent device still need 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.350
 a device and there I am 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.080
 curious how practical that his 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.310
 everyday will be really good thanks for 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.310
 watch and see you soon
