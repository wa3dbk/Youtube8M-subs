00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hello friends today we have monday 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.220
 day in which we respond to the questions 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.080
 various tags and I really hope that you 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.599
 drew attention to this intimate 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.549
 the setting that I tried for you 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.670
 create it for a reason 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.100
 no no no today we have suitable those 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.840
 which I found on the hive channel and this 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.109
 do that tells just about 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.480
 the book is quite old but as yet not 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.449
 can you do find less interesting 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.969
 questions as it turned out not so easy ayat 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.070
 I seemed curious enough 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.950
 it's called like that 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.780
 monetary obscenity during 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.110
 which book would you not want to read 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.480
 so that you are caught by a parent from 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.350
 time my viewers are watching my videos 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.070
 then they call and say Sasha 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.260
 you would have your tongue torn off 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.239
 so I can not be completely 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.760
 frank but I think that they would not 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.960
 I liked it if you saw how I think 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.930
 let's say comics about spiderman no 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.140
 cool comics it's all clear to me 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.770
 already far beyond 20 and read them somehow 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.960
 outside the storm and you're at home all alone 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.200
 which book could only make it worse 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.180
 I think no situation but in general 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.509
 no, but because the statement itself 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.530
 the question is rather strange thunderstorm 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.500
 you think one edge is fine in my opinion 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.860
 the most excellent situation that may 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.640
 take shape generally in the world outside the rain window 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.960
 thunderstorm fuzz you and you sit warm at home 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.570
 you feel good 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.570
 make yourself some more hot tea 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.240
 come to the window there all this living people 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.960
 go wet seat and im assholes 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.140
 it is necessary in this weather to sit at home tip 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.270
 beat this really cool you 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.659
 ever read a book just because 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.689
 hype around her of course 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.810
 read you can open the latest video 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.390
 which I dedicated to books and almost every 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.129
 of which I read only because of the hype 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.720
 around them but I was curious 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.060
 look 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.580
 this zac some so actively discuss 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.830
 on which so actively argue and 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.900
 Even so not which now read for it 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.990
 took precisely because of the hype 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.940
 which suddenly arose her pretty 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.430
 Do I often criticize what I take 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.920
 initially bad books everyone understands that 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.050
 they are bad and I say bad things about them 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.220
 that is, as if I did not open America 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.740
 so I picked up a book that everyone praises 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.260
 This type of book is generally very very 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.140
 good if you believe the reviews are called 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.770
 she's a martian andy weir and i'm still 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.570
 I read and believe this book is complete 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.880
 sucks 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.430
 did not know so it turns out I did not want 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.190
 then the poppy does not burn pretty bad and it 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.350
 at the same time such a small announcement 1 of 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.230
 the following videos where in detail by 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.630
 Martian walk the most nasty 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.650
 love bed scene in a book 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.250
 something that made you cringe so much 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.100
 the book is this apule 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:21.500
 The Golden Ass and here is the price is not one 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.760
 and their dofiga choose what you want 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.620
 there is homosexuality 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.230
 there are orgies too and even with animals everything 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.320
 what book pleases your heart 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.840
 made you doubt reasonableness 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.690
 author is not one book I let myself 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.739
 name a whole series of books is harry 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.709
 potter don't think bad i love 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.160
 Harry Potter's country I think it's like 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.700
 least not bad books but john has a role in 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.180
 for a moment something clicked and out 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.180
 a child's good fairy tale and began to create 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.000
 some game of thrones where more 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.500
 only so some months fly off 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.019
 bloodshed what happens when 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.000
 that i love these books but i'm some 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.040
 moment to start harry potter exactly 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.760
 because of the tale of all this 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.810
 turned into some kind 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.430
 meat grinder that is not not not not me 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.150
 I don't like that 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.780
 something good and eternal but with some 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.910
 fictional characters related yours 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.890
 indecent thoughts of course immediately 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.330
 princess lei comes to mind 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.840
 called Tom swimsuits 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.210
 but it's not entirely fair because we 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.180
 as if we are talking primarily about books 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.200
 is it a cinema of the universe process 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.720
 star warriors 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.670
 so I thought a little and remembered 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:55.400
 another princess is daenerys targaryen 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:05:00.140
 she is also pretty sweet and most importantly she has 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.240
 there are dragons real dragons i hope 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.250
 that she will allow me on one of them 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.320
 ride or we can together 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:11.770
 set off to the sky set fire to the village 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.770
 romance in general 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:31.289
 that's shining infinitely beautiful 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:31.289
 Princess because you do not dare to dream has become 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:38.909
 the birds soared into the sky 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:43.120
 but teaches us for the clouds 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:44.460
 the fastest and best 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.009
 why 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.889
 have you ever read any 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:53.430
 erotic content literature and what 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:56.270
 you think about her well I did not read the cabin 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.370
 large form ie it is a novel novel 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.800
 No, it did not come across as a wish 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.139
 no special but I read small porn 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.009
 stories and I will say this is small 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.569
 A rare case when all the same movie will be 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:13.139
 it is better 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:16.009
 uniquely you stumbled upon a portal in 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.960
 what a fictional world would you not like 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.599
 get well let's start with the fact that I would not 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.349
 began to hang around for some portal type 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:25.110
 portal 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:28.199
 not delayed will not go I will go 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:31.580
 in its affairs nothing good from 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:35.099
 do not wait for stupid portals and really 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.349
 a world that seems to me quite ugly and 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:41.039
 then would not want to fall for nothing 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:43.860
 narnia world here narnia can not stand 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:48.360
 there the beasts are constantly talking china 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:52.009
 come out the whale minotaurs are just an abomination 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:56.490
 honest word beast must be silent 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:59.610
 here silent well there run run growl 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:04.940
 but do not speak people say 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:07.770
 and the beast serve it seems to me right 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.440
 so they can't stand talking 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.120
 beasts and in narnia I would never 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.570
 I went and I would like to go 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.949
 let's go to the world of noon brothers 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.849
 Strugatskikh because they are very 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:22.710
 interesting future and detailed and good 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.110
 worked and of course I would like 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.960
 set off world pokemon because there 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:31.050
 I would have my pokemon and he is busy 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.389
 fought he was about really fun but on 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:36.620
 This ends my questions and I would 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:39.090
 I wanted to ask you how do you feel about 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.520
 obscene scenes in literature in 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:44.940
 Do you have books like these ? 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.770
 read and write your opinion about them in 

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.889
