00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
so let's be a lot more refined more

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.620 
so let's be a lot more refined more
accurate<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.580> lot<00:02:17.730> more<00:02:17.850> better<00:02:18.000> sound<00:02:18.330> which

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
accurate a lot more better sound which

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.300 
accurate a lot more better sound which
again<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.840> really<00:02:19.110> called<00:02:19.290> see<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:19.920> come<00:02:20.160> at

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
again is really called see and I come at

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.850 
again is really called see and I come at
sea<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.790> sound<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.900> pleasant<00:02:22.320> sounds<00:02:22.680> over

sea and sound the pleasant sounds over

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.650 
sea and sound the pleasant sounds over
the<00:02:22.920> engine<00:02:23.010> again<00:02:23.640> I've<00:02:24.300> done<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.450> lot<00:02:24.600> of

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
the engine again I've done a lot of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.050 
the engine again I've done a lot of
tweaks<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.140> AI<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.160> lot<00:02:26.340> more<00:02:26.370> based<00:02:26.880> on

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
tweaks to the AI is a lot more based on

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.610 
tweaks to the AI is a lot more based on
personality<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:27.900> actual<00:02:28.110> drivers<00:02:28.500> themselves

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
personality in actual drivers themselves

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.920 
personality in actual drivers themselves
so<00:02:29.250> interests<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.670> see<00:02:29.790> how<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.030> works<00:02:30.180> top

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
so interests and see how that works top

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.300 
so interests and see how that works top
so<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.050> have<00:02:31.170> lewisham<00:02:31.560> behind<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.100> is<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> bit

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
so you have lewisham behind you is a bit

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.790 
so you have lewisham behind you is a bit
more<00:02:32.520> aggressive<00:02:32.750> trying<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.840> find<00:02:34.650> any
