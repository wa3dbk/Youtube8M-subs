00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
good one is a good source of

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.780 
good one is a good source of
carbohydrates<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.680> there's<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.550> same<00:02:59.730> amount

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
carbohydrates so there's the same amount

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.970 
carbohydrates so there's the same amount
of<00:03:00.120> carbs<00:03:00.450> in<00:03:00.570> an<00:03:00.690> onion<00:03:00.989> as<00:03:01.260> there<00:03:01.440> isn't<00:03:01.590> in

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
of carbs in an onion as there isn't in

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.449 
of carbs in an onion as there isn't in
an<00:03:02.190> apple<00:03:02.900> they're<00:03:03.900> also<00:03:04.110> very<00:03:04.620> good<00:03:05.280> because

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
an apple they're also very good because

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.690 
an apple they're also very good because
they<00:03:05.730> contain<00:03:06.120> plenty<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.810> natural

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
they contain plenty of natural

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.800 
they contain plenty of natural
anti-inflammatories<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.570> they<00:03:09.690> have

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
anti-inflammatories so they have

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.140 
anti-inflammatories so they have
something<00:03:10.050> in<00:03:10.230> them<00:03:10.350> called<00:03:10.530> quercetin<00:03:11.150> which

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
something in them called quercetin which

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.800 
something in them called quercetin which
takes<00:03:12.900> information<00:03:13.110> away<00:03:13.830> from<00:03:14.040> cells<00:03:14.400> so

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
takes information away from cells so

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.000 
takes information away from cells so
anything<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.840> can<00:03:16.170> do<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.680> recovery

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010

now<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.250> reason<00:04:18.579> that's<00:04:18.880> better<00:04:19.329> for<00:04:19.630> you<00:04:19.840> is

now the reason that's better for you is

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.249 
now the reason that's better for you is

omega-6 to omega-3 and grain-fed beef is

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.800 
omega-6 to omega-3 and grain-fed beef is
20<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:26.500> 1<00:04:26.710> which<00:04:27.340> means<00:04:27.370> it's<00:04:27.759> 20<00:04:28.060> times<00:04:28.300> worse
