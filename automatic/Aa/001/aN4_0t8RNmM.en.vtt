00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
waterproof what I read is for its 30

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.280 
waterproof what I read is for its 30
seconds<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.970> can<00:04:36.120> move<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.510> and<00:04:36.780> then<00:04:37.020> after

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
seconds you can move it and then after

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.290 
seconds you can move it and then after
30<00:04:37.530> seconds<00:04:37.950> it<00:04:38.070> becomes<00:04:38.370> pretty<00:04:38.580> solid<00:04:39.060> in<00:04:39.180> it

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
30 seconds it becomes pretty solid in it

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.730 
30 seconds it becomes pretty solid in it
that<00:04:39.570> is<00:04:39.750> true<00:04:40.020> because<00:04:40.200> this<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:40.560> what<00:04:40.710> i

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
that is true because this is what i

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.760 
that is true because this is what i
normally<00:04:40.860> use<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.760> i<00:04:42.270> can<00:04:42.960> work<00:04:43.230> with<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:43.500> it

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.620 
does move if i'm trying to smudge and
like<00:04:47.910> I<00:04:48.240> smudged<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.350> out<00:04:49.500> down<00:04:50.280> here<00:04:50.820> but<00:04:51.360> you

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
like I smudged it out down here but you

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.240 
like I smudged it out down here but you
have<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.990> kind<00:04:52.140> of<00:04:52.290> work<00:04:52.500> with<00:04:52.560> in<00:04:52.860> that<00:04:53.010> 30

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250

seconds<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:53.910> think<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:54.240> moves<00:04:54.450> a<00:04:54.570> little<00:04:54.720> bit

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
seconds I think it moves a little bit

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.360 
seconds I think it moves a little bit
longer<00:04:55.170> than<00:04:55.470> that<00:04:55.620> but<00:04:55.680> that's<00:04:56.070> what<00:04:56.160> they

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
longer than that but that's what they

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.450 
longer than that but that's what they
claim<00:04:56.850> so<00:04:57.510> anyway<00:04:58.020> i<00:04:58.260> hope<00:04:58.890> this<00:04:59.130> was
