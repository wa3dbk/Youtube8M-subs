year<00:00:40.879> we<00:00:41.360> redesigned<00:00:41.900> the<00:00:41.989> zoning<00:00:42.350> we've<00:00:42.440> had

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
year we redesigned the zoning we've had

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.500 
year we redesigned the zoning we've had
the<00:00:42.710> zillion<00:00:42.980> before<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:43.850> we<00:00:43.970> changed<00:00:44.360> the

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
the zillion before so we changed the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.220 
the zillion before so we changed the
whole<00:00:44.960> redesign<00:00:45.949> of<00:00:46.220> the<00:00:46.280> body<00:00:46.489> everything<00:00:47.230> so

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
whole redesign of the body everything so

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.320 
whole redesign of the body everything so
start<00:00:48.470> with<00:00:48.620> this<00:00:48.769> is<00:00:48.980> basically<00:00:49.730> a<00:00:50.030> aluminum

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
start with this is basically a aluminum

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.660 
start with this is basically a aluminum
frame<00:00:50.989> but<00:00:51.739> one<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.040> things<00:00:52.280> we've<00:00:52.430> done

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
frame but one of the things we've done

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.000 
frame but one of the things we've done
is<00:00:52.879> on<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.150> side<00:00:53.360> plate<00:00:53.660> on<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:53.930> gear<00:00:54.110> side<00:00:54.140> we

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
is on the side plate on the gear side we

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.310 
is on the side plate on the gear side we
made<00:00:55.220> this<00:00:55.339> out<00:00:55.519> of<00:00:55.550> zion<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:56.900> reason<00:00:57.199> why

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
made this out of zion and the reason why

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.260 
made this out of zion and the reason why
we<00:00:57.440> make<00:00:57.589> it<00:00:57.710> out<00:00:57.830> of<00:00:57.950> zion<00:00:58.340> is<00:00:58.640> we<00:00:59.090> want<00:00:59.239> to

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
we make it out of zion is we want to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.770 
we make it out of zion is we want to
reduce<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.750> weight<00:01:00.070> and<00:01:01.329> zion<00:01:02.329> is<00:01:02.480> a<00:01:02.510> very

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
reduce the weight and zion is a very

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.689 
reduce the weight and zion is a very
strong<00:01:03.170> mature<00:01:03.500> as<00:01:03.649> well<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.190> you<00:01:04.250> want<00:01:04.610> to

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
strong mature as well so you want to

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.690 
strong mature as well so you want to
keep<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.600> side<00:01:06.229> plate<00:01:06.530> strong<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.369> that<00:01:07.399> when

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
keep the side plate strong so that when

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.700 
keep the side plate strong so that when
you<00:01:07.789> crank<00:01:08.060> fish<00:01:08.330> in<00:01:08.539> you<00:01:09.110> don't<00:01:09.259> get<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.440> lot<00:01:09.530> of

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
you crank fish in you don't get a lot of

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.650 
you crank fish in you don't get a lot of
flex<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.640> that's<00:01:10.789> why<00:01:10.940> we<00:01:11.030> make<00:01:11.149> but<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:11.420> want

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
flex so that's why we make but you want

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.510 
flex so that's why we make but you want
to<00:01:11.750> use<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:12.080> light<00:01:12.530> weight<00:01:12.710> but<00:01:13.190> you're<00:01:13.369> like

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
to use a light weight but you're like

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.460 
to use a light weight but you're like
Zion<00:01:13.910> so<00:01:14.210> that<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.509> get<00:01:14.690> less<00:01:14.899> weight<00:01:15.200> when

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
Zion so that you get less weight when

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.230 
Zion so that you get less weight when
you're<00:01:15.590> casting<00:01:15.800> it<00:01:16.160> so<00:01:16.670> that's<00:01:16.820> one<00:01:17.030> feature

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
you're casting it so that's one feature

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.749 
you're casting it so that's one feature
the<00:01:17.960> another<00:01:18.410> big<00:01:18.619> feature<00:01:18.800> is<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.250> t<00:01:19.580> wing

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
the another big feature is the t wing

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.700 
the another big feature is the t wing
system<00:01:20.000> as<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:20.810> can<00:01:20.930> see<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.200> opening<00:01:21.590> is

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
system as you can see the opening is

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.760 
system as you can see the opening is
bigger<00:01:22.369> so<00:01:23.090> when<00:01:23.300> you<00:01:23.420> go<00:01:23.570> to<00:01:23.600> cast<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.440> opens

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
bigger so when you go to cast it opens

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.670 
bigger so when you go to cast it opens
up<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:25.430> go<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.640> cast<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.869> line<00:01:27.080> comes<00:01:27.410> off

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
up you go to cast and the line comes off

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.550 
up you go to cast and the line comes off
the<00:01:27.920> spool<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.580> lot<00:01:29.210> less<00:01:29.450> resistance<00:01:30.140> when<00:01:30.470> it

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
the spool a lot less resistance when it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.699 
the spool a lot less resistance when it
comes<00:01:30.770> off<00:01:31.569> as<00:01:32.569> you<00:01:32.750> can<00:01:32.810> see<00:01:32.990> at<00:01:33.080> any<00:01:33.200> angle<00:01:33.440> on

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:33.709 
comes off as you can see at any angle on

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:36.130 
comes off as you can see at any angle on
the<00:01:33.830> reel<00:01:34.039> it'll<00:01:34.729> be<00:01:34.849> it'll<00:01:35.179> be<00:01:35.330> able<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.990> have

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
the reel it'll be it'll be able to have

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.040 
the reel it'll be it'll be able to have
less<00:01:36.319> angles<00:01:36.800> less<00:01:37.099> resistance<00:01:37.640> no<00:01:38.630> friction

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
less angles less resistance no friction

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.290 
less angles less resistance no friction
also<00:01:39.280> different<00:01:40.280> from<00:01:40.429> our<00:01:40.759> last<00:01:41.090> year's

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
also different from our last year's

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.660 
also different from our last year's
model<00:01:41.569> tattoo<00:01:41.929> low<00:01:42.080> which<00:01:42.259> is<00:01:42.289> got<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.280> t<00:01:43.459> wing

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
model tattoo low which is got the t wing

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.400 
model tattoo low which is got the t wing
system<00:01:43.880> this<00:01:44.539> has<00:01:44.750> got<00:01:44.929> what<00:01:45.110> we<00:01:45.200> call<00:01:45.349> a

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
system this has got what we call a

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.650 
system this has got what we call a
free-floating<00:01:45.920> spool<00:01:46.399> normally<00:01:47.330> there's<00:01:47.599> a

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
free-floating spool normally there's a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.080 
free-floating spool normally there's a
shaft<00:01:47.959> that<00:01:48.229> goes<00:01:48.410> on<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:48.830> spool<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.399> when

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
shaft that goes on the spool and when

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.089 
shaft that goes on the spool and when
you<00:01:50.179> put<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.509> in<00:01:50.599> free<00:01:51.110> spool<00:01:51.410> and<00:01:51.649> you<00:01:51.860> go<00:01:52.039> to

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
you put it in free spool and you go to

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.240 
you put it in free spool and you go to
cast<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:53.119> shaft<00:01:53.390> rotates<00:01:53.660> as<00:01:54.050> well<00:01:54.229> well<00:01:54.920> we

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
cast the shaft rotates as well well we

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.070 
cast the shaft rotates as well well we
have<00:01:55.399> a<00:01:55.429> system<00:01:55.880> called<00:01:56.119> free<00:01:56.539> floating<00:01:56.750> spool

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
have a system called free floating spool

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.529 
have a system called free floating spool
which<00:01:57.289> detaches<00:01:57.920> right<00:01:58.369> at<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.670> spool<00:01:58.970> so

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
which detaches right at the spool so

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.889 
which detaches right at the spool so
that<00:02:00.170> actually<00:02:00.709> has<00:02:00.830> less<00:02:01.039> resistance<00:02:01.250> and

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
that actually has less resistance and

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.510 
that actually has less resistance and
you<00:02:02.899> can<00:02:03.080> with<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.590> t<00:02:03.739> wing<00:02:03.950> system<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.369> can

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
you can with the t wing system you can

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.699 
you can with the t wing system you can
get<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.819> longer<00:02:05.060> cast<00:02:05.450> now<00:02:05.750> got<00:02:06.229> a<00:02:06.259> free<00:02:06.470> spool

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
get a longer cast now got a free spool

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.990 
get a longer cast now got a free spool
better<00:02:07.069> free<00:02:07.340> spool<00:02:07.610> more<00:02:07.940> casting<00:02:08.450> distance

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
better free spool more casting distance

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.180 
better free spool more casting distance
