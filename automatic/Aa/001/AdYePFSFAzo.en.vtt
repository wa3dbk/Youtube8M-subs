00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.480
 hello my name is catarina sousa franco tem 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:32.800
 38 years and it's our great idea and wishing 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.170
 divine gift magic beans 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.690
 the beans that have a recorded message and 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.660
 you want to get that message I 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.040
 I get a feeling you're recording and 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.640
 that the person offering to 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.250
 convey the person that you are an idea 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.540
 my suggestion of how people can 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.930
 that what is seen is that it is 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.930
 here in the background is a representation 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.340
 that what I feel I want to live 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:04.210
 to win will receive a can that should 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.479
 caring will open slowly will put the soil 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.700
 will maintain controlled conditions that 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.530
 are indicated on the can and at the end of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.170
 about 15 days the beans will start to 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.060
 germinate recommended name than what the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.650
 that it keeps in the place where it passes 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.040
 more time at home 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.450
 in this class in the kitchen that is part 30 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.400
 that time will be part of the family 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.430
 is the effective fulfillment that it calls 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.440
 that yemen needs he did not know 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.140
 the mall and thought it was a great 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.610
 present for my mother and she was 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.010
 before in December at the beginning therefore 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.090
 ordered at the end of November is e 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.680
 of generators and was the original 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.869
 We have some pre-written messages. 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.790
 defined and we have the possibility of 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.200
 record personalized messages of thing 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.200
 that the client expects 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:59.890
 we found on the internet there are websites 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.619
 mainly in large quantities 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.710
 What we did was thanks to this 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.140
 little girl's business potential and 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.399
 window and we try to create a concept 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.030
 around this idea 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:18.390
 within this segment the demos dimensions 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.390
 and communicated directly to the consumer 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.299
 the big challenge was partner will be worth 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.709
 accident that would have a behavior 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.989
 used to go to supermarkets 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.859
 Let's go to all the neighborhood grocery stores. 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.349

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.079
 seeds into the ground and are the stock and 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.760
 important day care 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.069
 it was clear did not have because we 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.970
 let us get either to push this fear into 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.650
 out of Earth 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.230
 we mark our research with results 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.569
 international beans, the ideal 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:58.840
 Brazil does not stand and see and I 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:00.010
 I need hot afternoons to arrive on 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.230
 christmas height 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.450
 even though a person years with prass says 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.579
 was not one of these 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.030
 in an equal can for each person 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.129
 but expects to receive the 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.859
 message is that they are offering what the 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.829
 qq person that the official pm and this I 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:21.389
 I feel when 31 himself was playing here 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.389
 is special and continues to do 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.490
 this program has the support of renan 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.390
 great ideas are supported by a 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:48.410
 great straight and cicca result in a 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.410
