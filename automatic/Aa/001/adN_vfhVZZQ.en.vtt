move<00:00:15.120> shun<00:00:15.330> based<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.850> just

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
move shun based this is a it's just

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.290 
move shun based this is a it's just
essentially<00:00:18.750> emotion<00:00:19.140> really<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:19.590> not

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
essentially emotion really it's not

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.810 
essentially emotion really it's not
amazingly<00:00:21.300> interesting<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:22.550> darker<00:00:23.550> sort

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
amazingly interesting it's darker sort

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.670 
amazingly interesting it's darker sort
of<00:00:23.880> variety<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:24.689> got<00:00:24.869> some<00:00:25.019> armor<00:00:25.320> all<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.470> it

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
of variety it's got some armor all on it

of variety it's got some armor all on it
some<00:00:25.920> drums<00:00:26.279> although<00:00:27.119> honestly<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.510> don't

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
some drums although honestly I don't

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.120 
some drums although honestly I don't
think<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> most<00:00:28.199> interesting<00:00:28.529> amounts

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
think it's the most interesting amounts

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.890 
think it's the most interesting amounts
now<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.730> both<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> picture<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.779> on

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
now I do have both the picture of it on

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.659 
now I do have both the picture of it on
the<00:00:31.050> screen<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> screen<00:00:31.740> shot<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.099> then

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the screen like a screen shot and then

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.150 
the screen like a screen shot and then
also<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.450> second<00:00:33.840> brain<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.440> which<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
also the second brain of it which is the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.000 
also the second brain of it which is the
angry<00:00:35.579> moonshine<00:00:36.030> beast<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.590> drop

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
angry moonshine beast this is a drop

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.200 
angry moonshine beast this is a drop
that<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.370> get<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> island<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.030> not

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
that you can get in the island I'm not

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.459 
that you can get in the island I'm not
too<00:00:39.360> sure<00:00:39.540> specifically<00:00:40.079> where<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.379> I'll

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
too sure specifically where but I'll

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.690 
too sure specifically where but I'll
cover<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.710> later<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:42.350> essentially<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.440> just

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
cover that later and essentially it just

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.310 
cover that later and essentially it just
like<00:00:44.700> summons<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.360> uncontrollable<00:00:45.989> version

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
like summons and uncontrollable version

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.290 
like summons and uncontrollable version
that<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.559> mount<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.100> goes<00:00:47.280> at<00:00:47.430> 270

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
that you can mount that goes at 270

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.060 
that you can mount that goes at 270
percent<00:00:48.570> speed<00:00:48.780> which<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.050> very<00:00:49.379> fast<00:00:49.710> so

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
percent speed which is very fast so

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.210 
I know just whatever this color scheme
really<00:01:27.450> suits<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> model<00:01:28.290> well<00:01:28.470> especially

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
really suits the model well especially

an hour I'm not too sure in the drop
rate<00:01:39.810> though<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.500> still<00:01:40.770> pretty<00:01:40.979> cool

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
rate though but it's still pretty cool

and the next one will probably be the

and the next one will probably be the
hardest<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.490> because<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.149> need<00:01:45.299> a

very big number and you also need to be

depending<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.710> how<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
depending on how you do it so this is a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.179 
depending on how you do it so this is a
golden<00:01:57.990> cloud<00:01:58.110> serpent<00:01:58.590> now<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.890> very

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
and I think it looks pretty wonderful

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.730 
and I think it looks pretty wonderful
actually<00:02:04.150> and<00:02:04.630> it's<00:02:05.110> really<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.380> stylistic

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
actually and it's really a stylistic

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.290 
actually and it's really a stylistic
thing<00:02:06.100> whether<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:06.430> prefer<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:07.000> sort<00:02:07.210> of

thing whether you prefer the sort of

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.300 
thing whether you prefer the sort of
lighter<00:02:07.660> one<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.560> darker<00:02:08.890> one<00:02:09.039> like<00:02:09.160> the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
lighter one to the darker one like the
