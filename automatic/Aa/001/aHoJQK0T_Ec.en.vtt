00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello and welcome to the chrome 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.860
 still wants b preview with the parade 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.840
 account on the way and found me please 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.840
 not why I'm doing this 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.369
 unfortunately you click show with yes 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.960
 the combination on the way to Ehrenberg and 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.760
 I could think it over 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.220
 actually it is almost less preview 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.779
 as a place is yes because it is 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.189
 actually everything out to the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.510
 Of course, we would already have tanks on 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.309
 Wednesdays can only publish 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.290
 somehow I just did not want me there 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.489
 crush with videos being that today 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.730
 probably will happen because of the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.340
 probably test it today and come 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.079
 and well, there is just one 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.690
 nice gameplay I would say of 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.510
 Kombi and I will do it all here 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.710
 comment preview moderately from I'm doing 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.989
 actually otherwise the videos rather in 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.329
 arm nothing more background knowledge and 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.989
 so on or what is more behind 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.960
 left so I have no idea 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.869
 why I think that's a replay 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.150
 spring of the motors was shown 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.700
 already the first run by the doctor in the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.860
 unfortunately was clouded and unfortunately too 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.720
 relatively large amount of damage I've happened 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.830
 me the good balls as well as in all 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.229
 I believe I have videos there 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.430
 everywhere a good crew I mean 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.549
 at least and because of it all kinds of things 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.210
 somewhere no this video was not 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.799
 buy tomorrow very nice but nee 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.780
 So that's just how they get 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.220
 possibility how could the tanks 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.750
 We can get introduced for accounts 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.970
 and that 's it we unfortunately get 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.649
 No type 59 in the garage if 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.689
 i cool i would be burglar too 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.420
 account to take a private party for 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:54.890
 videos but unfortunately nothing like that 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.600
 and that means I'm doing it, too fun 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.280
 I just wanted to say that on the edge 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.640
 have there in the forum probably one 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.650
 discussion about it 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.360
 kindled we youtuber but all 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.030
 are bought and now the maximum of gold 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.630
 So I have if then my god 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.680
 I have to say that's it 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.140
 now definitely pals on 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.820
 ehrenberg has personally with me on 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.920
 At least I liked to say 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.680
 the normal chrome he wants was already 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.150
 not so nice i know i got it yesterday 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.240
 played a lot of rudi and top 30 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.730
 petzow my account stop where I am 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.200
 I did not buy from my money 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.090
 wikis and yes the wumme was so me 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.070
 I've already noticed so on duration 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.920
 find it already on when and snapshot 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.370
 the whole sap skills do not have it 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.840
 of course, but I already noticed and I 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.530
 believe in the proam wants to notice that 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.300
 the more because I am with the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.660
 worse crew , not many 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.790
 Battles really drove and I liked 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.530
 but I like the normal we come 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.220
 not so mia it was never like that 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.040
 my thing 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.510
 because of the wound and yes that 's just the case 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.890
 that's because it's more 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.200
 or less just like the normal one 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.880
 that means he is not quite mine either 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.890
 Things are not bad at all 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.290
 I have already had some battles where I am 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.360
 Real problems partly with buddies because 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.190
 that's not the bowl at all 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.870
 on bader on it and meets the creates 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.100
 You do not rudi there so often you have to 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.900
 rather one a bit more 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.220
 and even if you changed completely 1 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.600
 fly youth u to buxtehude and at 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.459
 shoot flags be currently at 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.410
 not to my brother 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.730
 but well and there I have to say that is 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.670
 Just mix it up a bit better 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.459
 incredibly much longer than that 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.110
 But here I am here exactly me 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.950
 I might not know exactly 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.220
 but a lot higher and thereby can 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.810
 you just better foreclose even if the 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:04:00.090
 emming share so to speak 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:04.080
 is high and that's why I 'm definitely 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.930
 bad but it was somehow it was 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.170
 never my thinking and otherwise 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.970
 Actually , this is just aiming team 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.460
 it always bothers me but you can stop 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.990
 actually slapshot 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.540
 You do not really need it because of it 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:22.260
 you just have to shoot it 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.840
 Meet me at a high rate 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.030
 detected 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.490
 and yes, but for us it was then 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.090
 but somehow not so that I am 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.110
 had imagined 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.450
 I imagined courage in stop 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.160
 weird not so much with how much he 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:44.460
 comet and therefore was in the way clear that 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.070
 I ding not so much to say but 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.660
 of course, that it does exist 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.860
 enough people make the buddy very much 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.660
 I do not think it's cool either 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.420
 None of these three tanks is bad 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.140
 is bad because none of these three the 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.390
 normal tank as scramble and tv 1980 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.970
 None of the bad ones are 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:07.440
 Premium version not bad either 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.540
 So what else can you say to that? 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.500
 are not all bad because you have to 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.180
 just look what just hold me who this 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.550
 best which which armor on which 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.050
 best fits the driving style and had to 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.360
 determine or has determined that 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.720
 the rudi I really like him 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.800
 soon he has a nice sum has 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.390
 armor which you sometimes notice 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.050
 and I like that best and the 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.700
 combo that's just smaller if I am 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.490
 even believed much faster too 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:42.900
 A little acceleration sees it 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.460
 pretty much now and he has 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.070
 similar firepower I think so 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.350
 I was less there now too 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.820
 Camille trainer I have somehow 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.590
 do not make me that way do not meet like that 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.740
 yes not so much to meet with 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.069
 the link and therefore I do not quite know 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:04.460
 so much to say 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:04.460
 unfortunately unpack genuine premium unpack 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.969
 that was a very nice last king 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.400
 from animal and not so bad 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:18.110
 and yes , I just found the last coup 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.969
 very 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:25.199
 so far so good that was the little one 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:26.699
 preview gameplay by cromwell b like 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:30.419
 said my ding is not possible but you can 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:33.020
 recommend and otherwise yes me too me 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:36.090
 I would have been happy if it was the 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.789
 all the whole three tanks as well 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.009
 to buy single armor without gold 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.180
 without premium days, therefore, they will 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.520
 logically a bit cheaper 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.889
 but there are unfortunately 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.479
 not and therefore I had something there too 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:50.310
 reach deeper into the bag 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.810
 Well so far so good, thank you 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.599
 Will you already I hope you have it 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:58.099
 please and i hope the tiscover com 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:58.099
 indicates until then
