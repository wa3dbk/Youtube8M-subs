 Sponsor video online store Steampey 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.060
 dot com where you can purchase 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.000
 license activation keys at low 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.550
 prices link in the description hello 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.960
 I hope no one looking at any new 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.719
 games softly fucked 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.730
 wyeth their value course price falls 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.109
 grow all these freaking political 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.539
 play and in the first place from not 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.369
 gamers suffered and one thing was completely 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.260
 it is logical because we consume 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.330
 imported product in connection with this all 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.060
 more often come in PM messages 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.099
 when to hack playstation 4 and how 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.020
 will this be evil and when will it be 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.809
 and how it will all look like 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.520
 it will cost i can't answer 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.469
 these questions here I swear how could I not 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.719
 wanted i don't possess insider 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.590
 information about musa somehow discuss 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.510
 farting who appeared on the Internet no 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.670
 no no not too expensive 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.530
 reputation i respect my audience not 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.390
 I want to put some shit in your ears and 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.090
 on high when you shoot this video 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.820
 you ask 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.800
 just want to talk in this video want 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.410
 tell why hacking on playstation 4 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.690
 no longer needed than needed and why is it 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.610
 more harmful than useful and in general 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.380
 outline to tell what it is hacking us you 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.420
 is for those who do not know 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.650
 I had a stitched playstation for half a year 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.000
 3 slim version later I sold bought 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.320
 playstation 3 super slim she hardly 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.180
 probably visible 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.550
 but no less worth it to playstation 3 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.740
 super slim it is no longer stitched in 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.240
 principle truth through cobra about q somehow 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.210
 people lived there but I didn't 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.610
 soared on my ps3 slim myself 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.950
 universal firmware version 4.5 and 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.899
 roger and that myself general firmware 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.460
 represented this full access to 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.680
 file system console 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.960
 some immoral now was him 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.940
 somehow everything works you take a flash drive 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.920
 including the computer you want to 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.690
 torrents you download the game you throw at 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.880
 flash drive stick inserted into the console 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.009
 the console stops the game and you play 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.720
 everything is very simple but in this ideal 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.700
 the system has some problem you 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.280
 you can completely forget about achivki 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.560
 that's completely me personally on them was 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.110
 always shit i never hunted for 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.060
 achivka my but to someone it is important further you 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.490
 completely forget stor because if 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.380
 you will enter so banned you this time 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.420
 secondly you can always go to the side 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.120
 because your firmware version will be 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.190
 let in the old songs only with new ones 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.930
 and latest firmware and 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.690
 of course completely forget about 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.640
 multiplayer and in my opinion it is to 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.410
 huge cant because now 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.510
 singles per se not yourself 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.290
 long ago lived now decides only 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.060
 multiplayer 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.830
 and multiplayer excuse me this 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.390
 the strongest side of the console is here 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.670
 a huge selection of players which 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.740
 millions of times more than pc 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.750
 complete lack of cheaters macross nicks 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.239
 other representatives of non-traditional 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.030
 sexual orientations and of course 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.420
 all the same management tool 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.030
 gamepad where he is all one only 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.780
 such a gamepad will not be some super 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.040
 duper mice and all that is 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.290
 familiar situation when you have old 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.599
 Spent office mouse from someone there 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.420
 super expensive steelseries isn't it 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.930
 further with some lotions all one 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.569
 the same gamepad solves only 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.909
 skill decides only he and that's all 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.019
 Yes, I have now brought critically shortcomings 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.420
 stitched console 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.939
 but I will not tell you in any way 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.650
 case do not flash it all bad 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:21.650
 everything from the evil one is not granada only 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.139
 buy no i understand perfectly 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.870
 games are very expensive especially at this 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:29.150
 moment but you need to understand why 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.219
 games are so expensive games are so expensive 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.950
 because the company 's main income goes 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:35.599
 it is from the sale of games they console you 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.909
 You may ask why this is done 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.090
 everything is just the only form of struggle 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.829
 SEC gaming who like to sleep 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.169
 spread around the world 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.090
 players have to be attracted by the price and 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.280
 future when long die as a game 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.349
 platform and this is for sure we will 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.239
 inevitably progressing and this 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.189
 will definitely happen the consoles will 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.709
 cost as much as computers 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.719
 until you have to get used to it will not 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.810
 stand the most powerful iron that will not 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:06.200
 have absolutely no restrictions 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.000
 powerful iron and optimization we aim 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.099
 here are the operas so when you download 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.859
 pirated games you harm first 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:16.519
 turn to developer to publisher 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.060
 anyone out there still console itself and naturally 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.489
 sony 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.859
 I will catch you absolutely shit and so 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.659
 no less you must understand that you are part 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.699
 of all this gigantic mechanism under 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:28.039
 title progress so it is from 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.919
 you determine the fate of consoles as quickly 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.960
 they will swallow the whole world whom and the speaker 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.599
 i am very far away from m i have 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.880
 such a habit and so hacking playstation 4 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.880
 promises absolutely nothing good no 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.380
 it's not important for you to remember the console itself. 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.750
 multiplayer on consoles fight 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.900
 piracy is very simple let's say you 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.360
 sitting on firmware 1.03 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.240
 and let's say sony is now releasing something 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.979
 OS version 1.04 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.289
 and all you can not upgrade to it 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.780
 because you flies firmware and enter into 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.520
 network with old firmware you can't 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.250
 that is, you are completely denied access to 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.690
 communication to the internet psn to multiplayer 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.759
 absolutely everything 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.800
 it was the first part of the problem now 2 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.289
 sony 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.409
 This ban your console does not account well 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:16.479
 the console could not be unbanned market 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.830
 teeming with consoles banned them therefore 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.319
 be sure to pay attention to it 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.180
 when you buy playstation 3 slim 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.979
 if you buy this at the moment 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.110
 and now buy very very 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.509
 relevant given the price of games prices 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.430
 the console is quite relevant so far 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.069
 working platform by the way myself soon 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.960
 I won’t play bought demon souls 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.940
 a couple more games and I'll buy some 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.580
 old woman resurrect quietly 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.800
 Well, the third course 4 where do without these 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.710
 Pixar has had so many cheaters since 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.199
 gta 5 online but if there cheaters only 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.900
 hung brought then win type 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.150
 shooters out there strategy is complete hard 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.580
 it was still remember black ops 2 was 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.349
 a huge number of cheaters just 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.610
 playing was very difficult nonetheless 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.560
 knot and there are pluses you can 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:03.370
 fully customize your console 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.770
 which is very much lacking now 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.270
 playstation 4 can change themes and 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.400
 as radically as possible 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.219
 imagine not just changing colors 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.810
 icons or put behind the picture there 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:15.729
 you can completely change the icons in short 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.380
 you can do when you want 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.240
 install a bunch of useful software for example 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.340
 I was standing on playstation 3 slim 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.650
 temperature sensor that showed 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.080
 Should I change the thermal paste or not? 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.210
 I had a stormy console there should have been 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.430
 understand when you need to change because there 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.400
 fur consoles need to be changed 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.930
 about once every three to four years if you 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.580
 actively using 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.050
 this is important for me to know shorter hacking 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.419
 console on one side so damn 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.159
 cool you can customize the console 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.469
 can add a bunch of useful software there 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:47.139
 because now it's like an iphone without 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:49.419
 jailbreak iphone without jailbreak well you 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.979
 understand it yourself on the other hand 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:55.270
 I banned the console a complete absence 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:55.659
 multiplayer bringing to star input 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.879
 you 

00:06:55.659 --> 00:07:00.490
 of course there is a great scheme you 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:02.259
 buy console flashing it but 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.259
 if it's a jailbreak on the console 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:07.120
 will come out he will be available blah blah blah 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:08.789
 flashing and playing all existing 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.199
 go through games 

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:13.479
 be updated you fly pirate 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:15.180
 firmware version you are moving to a new one 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:18.030
 clean fresh 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:21.810
 link you will now have a console clean 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:24.360
 before the law and everything but your criminal 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.100
 past sony no one know except 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.770
 you on this themselves at me all I 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.750
 I really really hope this is not me 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.550
 I really really hope that I answered 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.350
 some of your questions that you had it 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.690
 video is useful if you have left 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.370
 some clever questions down sky 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.630
 leave someone else to write 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.660
 necessarily in the comments 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:46.680
 I will answer them here with my mom
