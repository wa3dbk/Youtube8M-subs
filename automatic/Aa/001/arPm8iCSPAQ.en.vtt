hey guys per chair today I'm gonna be
showing<00:00:03.120> you<00:00:03.389> how<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.629> make<00:00:04.339> infinity<00:00:05.339> this

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
showing you how to make infinity this

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.589 
showing you how to make infinity this
pretty<00:00:07.740> early<00:00:08.010> on<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.730> game<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.420> can

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
pretty early on in the game that you can

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.320 
pretty early on in the game that you can
do<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.559> it'll<00:00:11.010> last<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.670> until<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.120> get

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
do this so it'll last you until you get

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.380 
do this so it'll last you until you get
some<00:00:12.650> good<00:00:13.650> sales<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.820> want<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.090> start

some good sales and you want to start

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.750 
some good sales and you want to start
with<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> 3<00:00:19.590> by<00:00:19.800> 3<00:00:19.830> or<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.430> 2x2<00:00:21.000> square<00:00:22.310> of<00:00:23.310> water

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
with a 3 by 3 or a 2x2 square of water

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.880 
with a 3 by 3 or a 2x2 square of water
and<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.600> want<00:00:24.810> put<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.990> pump<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> middle<00:00:25.800> of

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
and you want put a pump in the middle of

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.349 
and you want put a pump in the middle of
that<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:28.279> now<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.699> probably<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
that and now this is probably one of the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.060 
that and now this is probably one of the
most<00:00:30.480> expensive<00:00:30.990> items<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.740> called<00:00:31.949> an

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
most expensive items it's called an

craft power of the mega joules see what
I<00:00:40.710> stick<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.070> bat<00:00:41.250> box<00:00:41.430> down<00:00:41.760> there<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.500> just<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
I stick a bat box down there and just a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.529 
I stick a bat box down there and just a
solar<00:00:43.890> panel<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:44.489> something<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.329> get<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
solar panel or something to get a

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.209 
solar panel or something to get a
kickstart<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> are<00:00:49.110> bringing<00:00:49.620> some

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
kickstart and you are bringing some

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.819 
kickstart and you are bringing some
pipes<00:00:50.660> doesn't<00:00:51.660> matter<00:00:51.840> which<00:00:52.020> ones<00:00:52.320> I'm

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
pipes doesn't matter which ones I'm

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.840 
pipes doesn't matter which ones I'm
using<00:00:52.890> gold<00:00:53.430> because<00:00:53.730> they<00:00:53.820> go<00:00:54.000> further<00:00:54.680> and

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
using gold because they go further and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.779 
using gold because they go further and
just<00:00:56.850> put<00:00:57.059> one<00:00:57.090> water<00:00:57.539> strainer<00:00:57.960> down<00:00:58.670> now<00:00:59.670> if

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
just put one water strainer down now if

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.030 
just put one water strainer down now if
you<00:00:59.910> bring<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.980> wire<00:01:01.980> range<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.820> bat<00:01:03.059> box

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
you bring a wire range to the bat box

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.719 
you bring a wire range to the bat box
you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.510> easily<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:07.080> rid<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.729> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
you can then easily get rid of this and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.600 
you can then easily get rid of this and
it'll<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.210> constantly<00:01:10.080> fill<00:01:10.830> up<00:01:10.979> forever

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
it'll just constantly fill up forever

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.670 
it'll just constantly fill up forever
it'll<00:01:12.090> never<00:01:12.240> run<00:01:12.450> it

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.680 

and<00:01:16.430> that<00:01:16.610> will<00:01:16.790> indefinitely<00:01:17.630> just<00:01:19.270> make<00:01:20.270> EU

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
and that will indefinitely just make EU

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.020 
and that will indefinitely just make EU
into<00:01:21.260> BuildCraft<00:01:21.830> power<00:01:22.190> and<00:01:22.550> then<00:01:22.700> turn<00:01:22.910> it

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
into BuildCraft power and then turn it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.850 
into BuildCraft power and then turn it
back<00:01:23.180> into<00:01:23.360> EU<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:24.020> it's<00:01:24.170> been<00:01:24.320> around<00:01:24.500> around

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
back into EU and it's been around around

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.190 
back into EU and it's been around around
around<00:01:25.120> now<00:01:26.120> it's<00:01:26.270> not<00:01:26.390> actually<00:01:26.690> giving<00:01:27.050> us

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
around now it's not actually giving us

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.950 
around now it's not actually giving us
any<00:01:27.410> power<00:01:27.710> at<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.070> minute<00:01:28.310> though<00:01:28.900> so<00:01:29.900> you

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
any power at the minute though so you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.060 
any power at the minute though so you
just<00:01:30.470> add<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.950> couple<00:01:31.190> more<00:01:31.340> water<00:01:32.030> strains<00:01:33.070> and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
just add a couple more water strains and

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:42.490 
just add a couple more water strains and
a<00:01:34.190> few<00:01:34.460> more<00:01:34.640> bat<00:01:34.850> boxes<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:41.230> there<00:01:42.230> you<00:01:42.320> go

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
a few more bat boxes and there you go

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.610 
a few more bat boxes and there you go
and<00:01:42.740> it's<00:01:43.460> not<00:01:43.760> too<00:01:44.060> shabby<00:01:44.360> for<00:01:45.230> the<00:01:45.350> start

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
and it's not too shabby for the start

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.719 
and it's not too shabby for the start
really<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:48.380> will<00:01:48.560> work<00:01:48.710> all<00:01:49.040> night<00:01:49.280> as<00:01:49.550> well

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
really this will work all night as well

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.190 
really this will work all night as well
you<00:01:50.030> don't<00:01:50.240> have<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.510> worry<00:01:50.690> about<00:01:50.720> it<00:01:51.080> running

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
you don't have to worry about it running

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.920 
you don't have to worry about it running
8<00:01:54.640> it's<00:01:55.640> far<00:01:56.360> better<00:01:56.600> than<00:01:58.210> just<00:01:59.210> solar<00:01:59.479> panels

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
8 it's far better than just solar panels

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.090 
8 it's far better than just solar panels
because<00:02:00.170> they<00:02:00.260> could<00:02:00.410> be<00:02:00.500> quite<00:02:00.740> expensive

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
because they could be quite expensive

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.760 
because they could be quite expensive
and<00:02:01.610> water<00:02:02.420> strainers<00:02:02.900> are<00:02:03.020> now<00:02:03.170> difficult<00:02:03.680> to

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
and water strainers are now difficult to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.760 
and water strainers are now difficult to
make<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.540> worst<00:02:05.840> thing<00:02:06.170> here<00:02:06.440> is<00:02:06.650> the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
make the the worst thing here is the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.060 
make the the worst thing here is the
energy<00:02:07.130> link<00:02:07.310> as<00:02:07.670> I<00:02:07.850> said<00:02:08.260> they<00:02:09.260> requires<00:02:09.619> fair

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
energy link as I said they requires fair

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.680 
energy link as I said they requires fair
that<00:02:10.250> they're<00:02:10.340> gold<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.000> pipes<00:02:11.240> if<00:02:11.570> you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
that they're gold and the pipes if you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.050 
that they're gold and the pipes if you
want<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.990> make<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.260> quite<00:02:12.440> long<00:02:12.650> as<00:02:12.890> well<00:02:13.100> other

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
want to make it quite long as well other

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.270 
want to make it quite long as well other
than<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.660> that's<00:02:15.110> about<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.890> can<00:02:16.070> play

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
than that that's about it you can play

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.190 
than that that's about it you can play
around<00:02:16.430> with<00:02:16.700> this<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.060> add<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.209> lot<00:02:17.510> more<00:02:17.720> to

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
around with this and add a lot more to

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.810 
around with this and add a lot more to
it<00:02:18.230> but<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.510> pretty<00:02:20.930> much<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.350> basics

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
it but this is pretty much the basics

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.330 
it but this is pretty much the basics
now<00:02:22.820> just<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.600> elaborate<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.260> bit<00:02:24.380> more<00:02:24.590> on<00:02:24.769> how

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
now just to elaborate a bit more on how

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
now just to elaborate a bit more on how
good<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:25.820> could<00:02:26.090> be<00:02:26.470> I've<00:02:27.610> built<00:02:28.610> this

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
good this could be I've built this

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.400 
good this could be I've built this
contraption<00:02:29.870> over<00:02:30.350> here<00:02:31.540> I've<00:02:32.540> got<00:02:32.810> one<00:02:33.140> two

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
contraption over here I've got one two

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.479 
contraption over here I've got one two
three<00:02:33.769> four<00:02:34.100> five<00:02:34.760> six<00:02:35.560> on<00:02:37.090> three<00:02:38.090> sides<00:02:39.489> of

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
three four five six on three sides of

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.330 
three four five six on three sides of
gold<00:02:40.820> pipe<00:02:41.060> well<00:02:41.420> done<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.500> twice<00:02:42.680> as<00:02:43.100> well

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
gold pipe well done that twice as well

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.560 
gold pipe well done that twice as well
so<00:02:43.610> you've<00:02:43.760> got<00:02:43.880> quite<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.180> lot<00:02:44.330> water

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
so you've got quite a lot water

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.080 
so you've got quite a lot water
strainers<00:02:45.080> there

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
strainers there

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.480 
strainers there
and<00:02:47.410> I<00:02:48.410> don't<00:02:48.500> think<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.920> power<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.280> running

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
and I don't think the power is running

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.010 
and I don't think the power is running
out<00:02:49.819> I<00:02:49.850> think<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.209> power<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:50.510> actually<00:02:50.630> going

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
out I think the power is actually going

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.059 
out I think the power is actually going
up<00:02:52.030> even<00:02:53.030> though<00:02:53.180> an<00:02:53.360> mfsu<00:02:53.840> is<00:02:54.260> kicking<00:02:54.830> over<00:02:54.980> a

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
up even though an mfsu is kicking over a

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.040 
up even though an mfsu is kicking over a
lot<00:02:55.220> more<00:02:55.430> power<00:02:55.670> than<00:02:55.790> going<00:02:56.240> in<00:02:56.480> at<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.840> same

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
lot more power than going in at the same

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.980 
lot more power than going in at the same
time<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.850> let's<00:03:02.060> see<00:03:02.240> how<00:03:02.420> much<00:03:02.600> this<00:03:02.810> will

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
time so let's see how much this will

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.900 
time so let's see how much this will
give<00:03:03.140> me<00:03:03.320> if<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.590> now<00:03:03.740> hook<00:03:03.980> up<00:03:04.160> all<00:03:04.490> of<00:03:04.730> these

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
give me if I now hook up all of these

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.060 
give me if I now hook up all of these
but<00:03:05.570> one<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:06.740> each<00:03:06.890> side<00:03:06.920> just<00:03:07.730> power<00:03:09.070> boxes

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
but one on each side just power boxes

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.020 
but one on each side just power boxes
again<00:03:12.100> there<00:03:13.100> you<00:03:13.130> go<00:03:13.420> it's<00:03:14.420> going<00:03:14.690> up<00:03:14.810> about<00:03:15.319> a

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
again there you go it's going up about a

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.490 
again there you go it's going up about a
thousand<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.270> second<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:20.570> I<00:03:20.600> would<00:03:20.959> not<00:03:21.140> have<00:03:21.320> to

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
thousand a second so I would not have to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.860 
thousand a second so I would not have to
leave<00:03:21.620> this<00:03:21.830> very<00:03:22.430> long<00:03:22.670> before<00:03:23.300> that<00:03:23.720> and

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
leave this very long before that and

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.020 
leave this very long before that and
then<00:03:23.959> start<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.800> generate<00:03:25.040> enough<00:03:25.550> to<00:03:25.820> fill

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
then start to generate enough to fill

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.420 
then start to generate enough to fill
this<00:03:26.180> up

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.980 

we<00:03:33.120> just<00:03:33.329> popped<00:03:33.540> down<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.780> Matz<00:03:34.079> fabricator

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990
