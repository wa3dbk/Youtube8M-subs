one of my biggest pet peeves is how

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.190 
one of my biggest pet peeves is how
people<00:00:02.490> use<00:00:02.909> win<00:00:03.120> rates<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.510> judge<00:00:03.720> champion

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200

champions due to their win rates my

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.700 
champions due to their win rates my
opinion<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.840> happened<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.260> four<00:00:10.440> point

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710

11 with both garner and Italy so I

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.879 
11 with both garner and Italy so I
figured<00:00:12.960> now<00:00:13.080> be<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> good<00:00:13.410> time<00:00:13.469> we<00:00:13.710> get<00:00:13.799> this

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
figured now be a good time we get this

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.530 
figured now be a good time we get this
off<00:00:14.099> my<00:00:14.370> chest<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.849> rant<00:00:15.030> for<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.210> little<00:00:15.330> bit

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
off my chest and rant for a little bit

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.330 
off my chest and rant for a little bit
I've<00:00:15.750> laid<00:00:15.960> out<00:00:16.080> six<00:00:16.410> reasons<00:00:16.770> why<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> judging

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
I've laid out six reasons why a judging

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.890 
I've laid out six reasons why a judging
champion<00:00:17.730> shrank<00:00:18.000> based<00:00:18.240> on<00:00:18.420> win<00:00:18.539> rates<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.869> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
champion shrank based on win rates is a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.720 
champion shrank based on win rates is a
bad<00:00:19.109> idea<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:19.800> kind<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.100> group<00:00:20.310> these<00:00:20.460> into

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
bad idea we can kind of group these into

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.609 
bad idea we can kind of group these into
four<00:00:20.910> different<00:00:21.029> topics<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.840> first<00:00:22.080> topic<00:00:22.260> is

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
four different topics the first topic is

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.620 
four different topics the first topic is
champion<00:00:23.130> difficulty<00:00:23.699> champions<00:00:24.240> are<00:00:24.420> hard

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
champion difficulty champions are hard

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.029 
champion difficulty champions are hard
to<00:00:24.720> play<00:00:24.900> will<00:00:25.050> have<00:00:25.199> deflated<00:00:25.590> win<00:00:25.830> rights

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
to play will have deflated win rights

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.470 
to play will have deflated win rights
and<00:00:26.279> champions<00:00:26.609> are<00:00:26.760> easy<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.150> play<00:00:27.300> will

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and champions are easy to play will

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.300 
and champions are easy to play will
generally<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:27.810> inflated<00:00:28.380> win<00:00:28.619> rates<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.099> of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
generally have inflated win rates and of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.250 
generally have inflated win rates and of
course<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.699> makes<00:00:29.910> sense<00:00:30.179> easier<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.050> play

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
course this makes sense easier to play

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.540 
course this makes sense easier to play
champions<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.830> be<00:00:31.890> mastered<00:00:32.070> by<00:00:32.250> more<00:00:32.520> people

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
champions can be mastered by more people

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.670 
champions can be mastered by more people
which<00:00:33.090> will<00:00:33.239> yield<00:00:33.420> higher<00:00:33.690> win<00:00:33.960> rates<00:00:34.200> Lisa

there's<00:00:46.739> more<00:00:46.920> than<00:00:47.039> one<00:00:47.129> reason<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
there's more than one reason but the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.100 
there's more than one reason but the
common<00:00:48.030> denominator<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.780> they're<00:00:48.930> both

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
common denominator is that they're both

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.049 
common denominator is that they're both

RF legendary I know how annoying that
champion<00:04:35.070> can<00:04:35.190> be<00:04:35.340> but<00:04:35.580> she's<00:04:35.760> not<00:04:35.910> easy<00:04:36.180> to

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
champion can be but she's not easy to

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.970

play<00:04:36.450> at<00:04:36.570> a<00:04:36.630> high<00:04:36.660> level<00:04:36.750> so<00:04:37.350> Natalie<00:04:37.770> we<00:04:37.890> have

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
play at a high level so Natalie we have

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.620 
play at a high level so Natalie we have
a<00:04:38.010> combination<00:04:38.610> of<00:04:38.700> things<00:04:38.880> first<00:04:39.360> of<00:04:39.510> all

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
a combination of things first of all

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.970

she's<00:04:39.870> difficult<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.350> play<00:04:40.560> so<00:04:40.830> this

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
she's difficult to play so this

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.320 
she's difficult to play so this
automatically<00:04:41.490> deflates<00:04:41.850> her<00:04:41.970> win<00:04:42.150> rate

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
entire tournament this kind of thing has

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.600 
entire tournament this kind of thing has
happened<00:05:37.500> multiple<00:05:37.890> times<00:05:38.130> in<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.520> history

happened multiple times in the history
of<00:05:38.850> league<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.270> so<00:05:39.540> one<00:05:39.630> of<00:05:39.690> the<00:05:39.780> reasons<00:05:40.080> why

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
of league and so one of the reasons why

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.780 
of league and so one of the reasons why
I<00:05:40.230> think<00:05:40.290> we<00:05:40.560> should<00:05:40.710> just<00:05:40.740> let<00:05:41.100> champions<00:05:41.550> be

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
I think we should just let champions be

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.640 
I think we should just let champions be
for<00:05:42.060> a<00:05:42.090> while<00:05:42.210> after<00:05:42.480> they<00:05:42.750> get<00:05:42.870> changed<00:05:43.320> at

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
for a while after they get changed at

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.050 
for a while after they get changed at
the<00:05:43.800> end<00:05:43.890> of<00:05:43.950> the<00:05:44.040> day<00:05:44.160> when<00:05:44.490> rates<00:05:44.700> are<00:05:44.850> not<00:05:45.000> a

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
the end of the day when rates are not a

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.670 
the end of the day when rates are not a
good<00:05:45.330> indicator<00:05:45.480> of<00:05:45.810> champion<00:05:46.230> strength<00:05:46.500> and

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
good indicator of champion strength and

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.080 
good indicator of champion strength and
using<00:05:46.920> an<00:05:47.010> argue<00:05:47.310> in<00:05:47.400> favor<00:05:47.610> of<00:05:47.700> buffs<00:05:47.970> and
