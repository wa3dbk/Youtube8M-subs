00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.200
 the smartphone was interestingly presented 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.460
 this summer is a bright budget phone and 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.360
 let's see what is there 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.419
 so interesting 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.189
 the phone comes with our type of packaging 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.870
 Here is a photo of the device. 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.480
 model name on the back 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.530
 technical data 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.290

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.500
 we have a network adapter with usb input 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.379

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.170
 headset should be on the phone is 2 years 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.059
 guarantees worth being a little neat we 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.920
 it is not advisable not to lose the micro cable 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.620
 usb which is a bundle connected so 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.949
 what's in the microusb phone case and connector 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.890
 we drowned it turns out applied here 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.929
 an interesting decision that I donâ€™t remember 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.679
 use phones this is 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.080
 front part 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.420
 with the display unit we have a little less 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.090
 width than the main part of the phone is not 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.310
 It turns out here is such a small 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.899
 a small step is available in general 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.450
 says the phone you try 5 on your

 gram is a classic candy bar 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.420
 here is traditionally the location of the elements 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.610
 that is, no design discoveries 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.479
 No, using soft-touch plastic, he 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.390
 pleasant to the touch many subject to footsteps 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.619
 fingers here remains with us grayson 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.509
 heavily erased by elements 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.310
 locations are the following button here 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.649
 turn on here volume rocker on 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.060

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.939
 here the audio radian looked after the meter 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.649

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.659
 non-removable battery battery here 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.740
 non-removable ie at the exit and 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.649
 decrease the charger need to come in 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.479
 service center to change it 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.729
 the body is perfectly cracked and loose 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.100
 details not observed really 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.070
 nice so here's a budget phone in 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.460
 plan stuffing here on the following 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.610
 installed now with a half inch a 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.050
 ps display he has good viewing angles 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.730
 good color rendition good level 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.160
 maximum brightness i.e. solar 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.220
 weather with this phone can work 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.570
 480 resolution by 854 pixels then 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.630
 have 10 thought not 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.760
 and 4g won't get pixelated 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.400
 observed but overall image 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.520
 Remains smooth fonts and clear ie 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.250
 with the phone you can comfortably and read and 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.900
 play by the way here plan wear with us 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.600
 installed a large number of games with what it 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.090
 connected say difficult but the manufacturer 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.950
 HR is not an app focuses 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.620
 mmo games thousands really have a lot 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.750
 Navitel there are a number of applications 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.690
 but in general it is a clean android system 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.810
 By the way here myself on android 4 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.610
 4.2 and would like to say and make a reproach 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.350
 budget makers who 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.020
 said that mediatek does not cook 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.550
 platforms for 44 here for some reason 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.640
 works by the way here he works on 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.260
 mediatek 6580 2nd processor running 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.270
 decrease from 1300 megahertz 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.180
 this is a quad processor graphics 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.460
 mali-400 impe 2 4 gigabytes for storage 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.280
 data and only 512 megabytes of RAM 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.350
 that's it for the RAM this phone 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.000
 we are just included in the category 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.150
 budget, that is, everything would be fine 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.730
 if not for the RAM but for most 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.410
 there are enough tasks for this memory 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.510
 see this for example looked 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.520
 synthetic tests antutu benchmark 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.340
 is recruiting a thousand three hundred and eighty 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.500
 one point 3d rating four thousand one hundred 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.330
 twenty seven games and you can download 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.430
 including games like gta3 so 46 from 1 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.430
 batteries battery here is not so 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.920
 big on thousand 650 milliamps hour her 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.570
 enough for one light day 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.830
 there will be a phone in the evening 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.870
 put on charge 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.580
 but this is generally characteristic of everything. 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.950
 android segment phone in which 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.490
 able to work longer not much but 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.320
 and this one 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.660
 when used economically stretch 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.060
 it is possible that we have communication modules 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.460
 bluetooth 40 latest energy efficient 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.980
 which is low power there 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.160
 Wi-Fi is gps in search now we have 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.220
 leaves about 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.950
 and minutes to cold start satellites 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.970
 keeps confident and no problems 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.560
 no teeth, that is, you can use 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:36.080
 the phone is not like a navigator on the modules 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.770
 You both have two SIM cards to support 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.380
 3g 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.790
 That is, you do not need to choose which SIM card 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.500
 use for internet what for 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.150
 connection is play 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.310
 we also have a play market fm 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.470
 radio if you need it then there are many 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.780
 flagships are no longer bus and 5 megapixel 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.670
 cameras examples of pictures can see 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.320
 the links sanik this video by the way 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.000
 standard applications much 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.540
 more interesting than the one that offers 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.290
 count count 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.180
 what we have at the exit for 4500 rubles we 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.330
 we get a well-assembled phone 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.390
 long battery life 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.100
 we get high-quality displays we get 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.740
 us a good processor which is capable 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:16.730
 to cope with modern tasks 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.340
 we get a nice soft touch plastic from 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.820
 minuses a little RAM 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.200
 phone fly iq445 gets hit reward 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.730
 editorial selection mega review . 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.410
 bazel aero for our attention signed 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.640
 the channel has come a lot of interest to all
