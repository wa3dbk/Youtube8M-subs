00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
we doing how we you know doing God's

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.029 
we doing how we you know doing God's
attention<00:00:15.660> as<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.809> mean<00:00:15.990> God<00:00:16.379> hadn't<00:00:16.710> noticed

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
attention as I mean God hadn't noticed

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.429 
attention as I mean God hadn't noticed
or<00:00:17.279> giving<00:00:18.119> God<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> clever<00:00:18.690> idea<00:00:18.810> what<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.320> do

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
or giving God a clever idea what to do

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.019 
or giving God a clever idea what to do
about<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.710> obviously<00:00:20.160> know<00:00:20.490> those<00:00:20.640> things<00:00:20.910> are

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
about it obviously know those things are

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.220 
about it obviously know those things are
true<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.300> what<00:00:21.420> are<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.570> doing<00:00:21.810> when<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:21.960> pray

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
true so what are we doing when we pray

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.950 
true so what are we doing when we pray
well<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> think<00:00:22.980> we're<00:00:23.220> doing<00:00:23.340> two<00:00:23.580> things<00:00:23.960> one

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
well I think we're doing two things one

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.769 
well I think we're doing two things one
is<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.519> have<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> certain<00:00:26.760> room<00:00:27.180> for<00:00:27.420> manoeuvre

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
is we have a certain room for manoeuvre

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.450 
is we have a certain room for manoeuvre
limited<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> certain<00:00:28.560> room<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:28.890> manoeuvre<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
limited a certain room for manoeuvre to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.429 
limited a certain room for manoeuvre to
bring<00:00:29.789> about<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.060> future<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.170> believe

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
bring about the future and I believe

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.010 
bring about the future and I believe
that<00:00:31.470> God<00:00:31.650> also<00:00:32.009> has<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> providential<00:00:33.020> power

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
that God also has a providential power

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.380 
that God also has a providential power
to<00:00:34.200> bring<00:00:34.350> about<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.739> future<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.850> when<00:00:36.270> we

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
to bring about the future and when we

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.600 
to bring about the future and when we
pray<00:00:36.660> we're<00:00:36.899> offering<00:00:37.290> our<00:00:37.559> room<00:00:38.370> for

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
pray we're offering our room for

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.299 
pray we're offering our room for
louvered<00:00:38.820> who<00:00:39.059> taken<00:00:39.480> by<00:00:39.629> God<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.050> used<00:00:40.309> in

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
louvered who taken by God and used in

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.520 
louvered who taken by God and used in
alignment<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:42.239> God's<00:00:43.110> providential

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
alignment with God's providential

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.229 
alignment with God's providential
purposes<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.489> believe<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.910> things<00:00:45.090> can

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
purposes and I believe that things can

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.930 
purposes and I believe that things can
happen<00:00:45.539> when<00:00:46.010> human<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.160> divine<00:00:47.250> wills<00:00:47.730> are

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
happen when human and divine wills are

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.819 
happen when human and divine wills are
lined<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.510> sort<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.809> way<00:00:48.960> there<00:00:49.680> would

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
lined up in a sort of way there would

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.380 
lined up in a sort of way there would
not<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.039> possible<00:00:50.550> when<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:51.030> are<00:00:51.180> cross

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
not be possible when there are cross

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.770 
not be possible when there are cross
purposes<00:00:51.780> we're<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:53.340> each<00:00:53.370> other<00:00:53.640> I'd<00:00:54.570> like

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
purposes we're with each other I'd like

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.110 
purposes we're with each other I'd like
to<00:00:54.930> use<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.489> sometimes<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.699> scientific

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
to use the sometimes that scientific

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
metaphor laser light lays light is

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.889 
metaphor laser light lays light is
powerful<00:00:59.940> because<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.629> what<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
powerful because it's what the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.869 
powerful because it's what the
physicists<00:01:01.559> call<00:01:01.680> coherent<00:01:02.250> all<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.730> ways

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
physicists call coherent all the ways

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.490 
physicists call coherent all the ways
are<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.180> step<00:01:03.449> all<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> crests<00:01:04.229> come<00:01:04.379> together

down to maximo effect light that's

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.450 
down to maximo effect light that's
inherent<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.900> ways<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.260> had<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> step<00:01:10.710> are

inherent the ways that had a step are

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.969 
inherent the ways that had a step are

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
I think we're seeking a laser-like

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.859 
I think we're seeking a laser-like
coherence<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.820> God<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.240> prayer<00:01:18.270> that's<00:01:18.750> one

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
coherence with God in prayer that's one

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.210 
coherence with God in prayer that's one
of<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.990> things<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.170> think<00:01:19.259> we're<00:01:19.409> doing<00:01:19.560> second

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
of the things I think we're doing second

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.620 
of the things I think we're doing second
thing<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.430> were<00:01:20.610> doing<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:20.970> pray<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.270> something

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
thing I were doing we pray is something

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.880 
thing I were doing we pray is something
I<00:01:21.689> learned<00:01:21.869> from<00:01:21.930> an<00:01:22.140> Oxford<00:01:22.470> philosopher

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
Christmas Oh God takes seriously our

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.640 
Christmas Oh God takes seriously our
desires<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.240> think<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.659> at<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.409> thought

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
desires and I think that at the thought

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.190 
desires and I think that at the thought
that<00:01:40.680> she<00:01:40.890> makes<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.479> careful<00:01:42.479> about<00:01:42.630> about

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
that she makes you careful about about

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.710 
that she makes you careful about about
about<00:01:43.380> how<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.680> pray<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:45.240> think<00:01:45.600> it's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
about how you pray and I think it's

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.069 
about how you pray and I think it's
right<00:01:45.899> God<00:01:46.860> allows<00:01:47.520> us<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.509> certain<00:01:48.720> limits

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
right God allows us to in certain limits

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.499 
right God allows us to in certain limits
to<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> scienter<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.159> mean<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> cross<00:01:51.360> for

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
to a scienter I mean in the cross for

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.880 
to a scienter I mean in the cross for
example<00:01:51.869> there's<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.079> black<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> biomass

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
example there's a black the biomass

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.100 
example there's a black the biomass
comes<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.759> four<00:01:53.880> cheeses<00:01:54.270> jesus<00:01:54.659> said<00:01:54.840> him

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
comes with four cheeses jesus said him

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.490 
comes with four cheeses jesus said him
what<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.619> want<00:01:57.020> he's<00:01:58.020> always<00:01:58.170> what<00:01:58.439> he

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
what do you want he's always what he

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.899 
what do you want he's always what he
wants<00:01:58.740> he's<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.860> blind<00:01:59.219> man<00:01:59.430> he<00:01:59.520> wants<00:01:59.729> me<00:01:59.820> all

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
wants he's a blind man he wants me all

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.310 
wants he's a blind man he wants me all
to<00:01:59.939> see<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.329> he<00:02:00.390> has<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.719> say<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.110> Lord

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
to see but he has to say to the Lord

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.950 
to see but he has to say to the Lord
that<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:01.979> may<00:02:02.280> see<00:02:02.479> before<00:02:03.479> actually<00:02:03.780> he's

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
that I may see before actually he's

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.870 
that I may see before actually he's
healed<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> think<00:02:04.890> these<00:02:05.399> are<00:02:05.460> sort<00:02:05.850> of

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
healed so I think these are sort of

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.180 
healed so I think these are sort of
things<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.149> go<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:07.049> prayer<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.979> sort

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
things that go on in prayer in that sort

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.630 
things that go on in prayer in that sort
of<00:02:08.280> way<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:09.450> prayer<00:02:09.660> isn't<00:02:09.929> magic<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:11.250> is

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
of way but prayer isn't magic and it is

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.610 
of way but prayer isn't magic and it is
puzzling<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
puzzling that and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.990 
puzzling that and
prayers<00:02:13.950> may<00:02:14.129> be<00:02:14.160> answered<00:02:14.280> all<00:02:14.700> sorts<00:02:14.940> of

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
prayers may be answered all sorts of

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.050 
prayers may be answered all sorts of
unexpected<00:02:15.120> ways<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.840> mean<00:02:16.080> somebody<00:02:16.379> may<00:02:16.560> be

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
unexpected ways I mean somebody may be

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.449 
unexpected ways I mean somebody may be
desperately<00:02:18.060> ill<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.650> church<00:02:19.890> prays<00:02:20.250> for

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
desperately ill and the church prays for

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.570 
desperately ill and the church prays for
that<00:02:20.610> person's<00:02:21.410> healing<00:02:22.410> my<00:02:22.920> healing<00:02:23.220> read<00:02:23.430> me

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
that person's healing my healing read me

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.790 
that person's healing my healing read me
as<00:02:23.640> wholeness<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.330> think<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.440> that

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
as wholeness I think and that that

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.220 
as wholeness I think and that that
really<00:02:26.099> might<00:02:26.310> come<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.989> physical<00:02:27.989> recovery

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
really might come in physical recovery

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.500 
really might come in physical recovery
remission<00:02:28.980> where<00:02:29.879> it<00:02:29.940> might<00:02:30.060> come<00:02:30.360> through

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
remission where it might come through

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.080 
remission where it might come through
being<00:02:30.780> able<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.190> peacefully<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.400> faithfully

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
being able to peacefully and faithfully

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.690 
being able to peacefully and faithfully
accept<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.959> imminent<00:02:34.290> destiny<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.709> death<00:02:34.950> and

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
accept the imminent destiny of death and

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.400 
accept the imminent destiny of death and
nobody<00:02:36.150> can<00:02:36.239> say<00:02:36.420> beforehand<00:02:36.930> which<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.200> going

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
nobody can say beforehand which is going

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.600 
nobody can say beforehand which is going
to<00:02:37.500> be<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.860> only<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.099> person<00:02:38.250> involved

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
to be and only the person involved

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.789 
to be and only the person involved
actually<00:02:39.030> say<00:02:39.209> well<00:02:39.390> healing<00:02:39.930> does<00:02:40.200> come<00:02:40.440> in

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
actually say well healing does come in

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.860 
actually say well healing does come in
one<00:02:40.950> or<00:02:41.069> all<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.220> those<00:02:41.430> ways<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> think<00:02:42.180> so

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
one or all of those ways I think so

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.320 
one or all of those ways I think so
there<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> mystery<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.709> prayer<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.580> there's

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
there is a mystery in prayer but there's

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.479 
there is a mystery in prayer but there's
also<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.630> think<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.920> perceived<00:02:47.280> reality

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
also I think just the perceived reality

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.959 
also I think just the perceived reality
in<00:02:47.880> prayer<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.599> to<00:02:48.720> do<00:02:48.810> it
