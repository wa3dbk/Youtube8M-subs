 who dreamed of becoming a singer and that's all 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.560
 told in graphics and then before when 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.820
 I appear already understand why I sing 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:02.130
 exactly this song and we are with the director 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.509
 understand that this is essentially my story 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.670
 setting it today is folk 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.369
 Ukrainian actress silver winner 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.380
 Eurovision Song Contest 2008 married to 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.600
 beloved and successful man mom 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.730
 the beautiful daughter of the restaurant owner in 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.100
 Kiev center publisher of three books face 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.549
 cosmetic charity companies 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.549
 doer 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.810
 but it is known that the life of Carolina is not always 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.880
 was so vividly colorful and brilliant 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.800
 she is considered a Ukrainian Cinderella because 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.510
 childhood was not easy in a small 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.000
 Kitsman town in Chernivtsi region 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.920
 where is Carolina from ? her mom barely 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.290
 making ends meet to grow 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.360
 daughter and her brothers 6 years old girl was even 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.970
 given to the orphanage and always the main dream 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.460
 Carolina was the scene for a long time dream come true 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.460
 without the scene, Ani Lorac does not think himself 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 but 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.200
 I have been on stage for 20 years and for 20 years I 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.819
 I feel this excitement as for the first time 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:08.140
 just about a concert here people in the hall 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:10.620
 that's how it's all how to get out there like 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.909
 cross this boundary 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.480
 excitement is always that well, impossible 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:19.540
 and when I do it a step towards 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:23.310
 some miracle happens here i'm on the stage 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.909
 here is my favorite viewer i'm in the rays of light 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:31.620
 sound and this is happening is the magic 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.620
 because in this second I forget in all 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.340
 to their stage outfit refers 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.470
 scrupulous for her there are no little things 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.510
 all important she is always in good 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.610
 physical form with no diets 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.210
 does not hold sometimes do not have time 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:58.260
 eat i'm not on a diet and never 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:00.810
 sat on diets so my most 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.060
 best grandfather dressed for life is just 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:09.510
 moderate nutrition ie do not overeat 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:12.720
 no small bowls and drink 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.850
 a lot of water movement again I can 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.120
 said that after the recital in 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.370
 me at least kilograms after the concert if 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.310
 allows graphite to be sure to have a good sleep 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.910
 the truth is also not always working yesterday I 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.940
 arrived in Kiev 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.850
 after five planes per day at me 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:38.160
 there were five flights I performed in two 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:42.090
 countries and in 3 you can even say 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.490
 clarify and of course the most interesting 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.980
 that there was no sleep in this chart 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.040
 in general somehow and somehow food too somehow 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.700

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.780
 plane fed 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.900
 during the flight of the Koran on try 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.580
 take it reading the keys then that without 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.320
 spiritual enrichment can not be 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.840
 harmonious relationship with the world and in 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.390
 Particularly with a loved one I am 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.040
 interested in psychology news here 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.870
 I'm going to just love this 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.270

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.330

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.860
 same robin charm

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.420
 Then Oleg Gadetsky here is this Russian 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.900

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.300
 this psychology of the third millennium too 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.380
 According to the artist, the woman is absolutely 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.390
 beautiful then when 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.190
 and inner calmly harmoniously 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.990
 relationship with a loved man should 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.570
 perfect in this just 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.840
 Caroline helps her favorite literature 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.730
 need to be interesting to my partner i

 on returning home they are in a hurry of Carolina 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:02.759
 rather see his little daughter 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.729
 which is often on tour time 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:10.259
 leave on numerous grandmothers 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:13.740
 every day on fb and standing here with about there 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:15.990
 all the pictures we communicate i know 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.129
 absolutely everything that happens unconditionally 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.069
 missing what I'm saying 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:23.220
 The most favorite kind of recreation singer to be in 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.030
 among big families I like to relax in 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.030
 family circle 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.520
 I do not care where we are not important to 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.199
 we were together these minutes for me 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.419
 without a scene and that is young 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.280
 and sometimes just sitting in 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.560
 include light music in the living room 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.930
 light a incense lamp and make 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.849
 yourself an aromatherapy session and just at home 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.250
 she will relinquish being ani lorak and 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:47.039
 become ordinary women beloved and 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:50.159
 loving in the first place is a husband because 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:52.979
 I’m already moving a little bit to the 2nd flank 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:55.979
 because yielding primacy because 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:58.500
 it is very important to understand there is a scene 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:00.389
 real life september 27 achieve 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.520

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.740
 time will try not to be on tour 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.259
 and with her beloved husband to be in her family there 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.529
 one nice tradition to change which 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:12.270
 I don't want a king I don't know how I will 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:14.120
 celebrate because it's a surprise from 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:17.130
 my husband again he is me to prepare a surprise 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:21.599
 every year he takes me somewhere I 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:23.750
 don't know anything it happens so we're going to 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:26.030
 airport and you know 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.640
 either making presents is getting them 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.580
 also her husband Marat often pampers her 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.880
 among unforgettable surprises offer 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.800
 hands and hearts in paris when we were 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.250
 attended the moulin show 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.570

 treasured box with the words world of wine 

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.080
 Of course, our Chisinau public is always 

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.010
 marked by performers as very 

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.540
 grateful 

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.700
 but at the same time she always 

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.590
 sensitive to drugs that sound 

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.660
 artists from the stage judging by the reaction 

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.940
