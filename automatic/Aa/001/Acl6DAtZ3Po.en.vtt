00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
islands and they now have a coordinate

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.420 
islands and they now have a coordinate
where<00:00:54.360> they<00:00:54.510> can't<00:00:54.780> take<00:00:55.110> cruise<00:00:56.010> liners

okay no I haven't heard about these
giants<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.060> these<00:01:09.210> caverns<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.040> yeah<00:01:11.040> there<00:01:11.430> I

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
giants in these caverns but yeah there I

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.550 
giants in these caverns but yeah there I
my<00:01:12.479> evidence<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.799> case<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.040> there<00:01:14.640> are

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560

it<00:01:37.890> Olaf<00:01:38.700> Jensen<00:01:38.970> described<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.840> inner<00:01:39.960> sun

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it Olaf Jensen described the inner sun

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.010 
it Olaf Jensen described the inner sun
as<00:01:40.439> being<00:01:40.770> divided<00:01:41.430> between<00:01:42.390> his<00:01:42.570> day<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
as being divided between his day and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
as being divided between his day and
night<00:01:43.170> finds<00:01:43.560> when<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:44.460> first<00:01:44.790> noticed<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
night finds when they first noticed it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.789 
night finds when they first noticed it
as<00:01:45.630> they<00:01:45.899> were<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.259> through<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.619> North

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
as they were going through the North

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.490 
as they were going through the North
Pole<00:01:46.979> opening<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:48.299> looked<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.750> smoky

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
Pole opening it looked like a smoky

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.010 
Pole opening it looked like a smoky
color<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:51.000> why<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.210> called<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
color so that's why I called it the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.600 
color so that's why I called it the
smoky<00:01:52.439> God<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.920> his<00:01:53.549> book<00:01:54.470> but<00:01:55.470> every<00:01:56.159> 12<00:01:56.430> hours

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
smoky God in his book but every 12 hours

smoky God in his book but every 12 hours
a<00:01:57.060> bright<00:01:57.329> white<00:01:57.990> side<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.100> would<00:01:59.310> come

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
a bright white side of it would come

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.740 
a bright white side of it would come
into<00:02:00.000> view<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.200> date<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:02.750> there

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750

into view and it was like date so there
was<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> day<00:02:04.200> side<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.280> my<00:02:05.460> slide<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
was a day side to it and in my slide and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.330 
was a day side to it and in my slide and
on<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.020> night<00:02:07.200> side<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.740> he<00:02:07.829> says<00:02:08.069> there<00:02:08.250> is

on the night side of it he says there is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.910 
on the night side of it he says there is
a<00:02:08.369> large<00:02:08.700> opaque<00:02:09.239> area<00:02:09.800> that<00:02:10.800> has<00:02:12.110> bright

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
a large opaque area that has bright

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.570 
a large opaque area that has bright
any<00:02:14.160> holes<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.730> look<00:02:14.970> like<00:02:15.150> stars<00:02:15.209> at<00:02:15.900> night

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
any holes that look like stars at night

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.110 
any holes that look like stars at night
so<00:02:17.580> no<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.420> Sun<00:02:18.690> inside<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:20.280> always<00:02:20.880> visible

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
so no the Sun inside is always visible

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.440 
so no the Sun inside is always visible
but<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.989> has<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> Danite<00:02:22.800> side<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.940> since<00:02:24.270> it

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
but it has a Danite side and since it

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.660 
but it has a Danite side and since it
turns<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:24.959> very<00:02:25.260> slowly<00:02:25.590> once<00:02:26.010> every<00:02:26.340> seven

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
turns so very slowly once every seven

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.990 
turns so very slowly once every seven
hundred<00:02:26.940> years<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:29.190> rotation<00:02:29.819> of<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
hundred years the the rotation of the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.390 
hundred years the the rotation of the
shell<00:02:30.300> about<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.780> makes<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.260> effect<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.220> day

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
shell about it makes the effect of day

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.199 
shell about it makes the effect of day
and<00:02:32.550> night<00:02:32.840> well<00:02:33.840> Rodney<00:02:34.140> good<00:02:34.470> luck<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.860> your

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
and night well Rodney good luck on your

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.430 
and night well Rodney good luck on your
expedition<00:02:36.209> I'm<00:02:36.840> sure<00:02:37.080> we'll<00:02:37.260> be<00:02:37.290> hearing

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
expedition I'm sure we'll be hearing

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.459 
expedition I'm sure we'll be hearing
from<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.250> when
