want<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.570> maintain<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:19.080> treat<00:00:19.350> about<00:00:19.560> four

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
want to maintain this treat about four

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.950 
want to maintain this treat about four
to<00:00:20.010> four<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.369> half<00:00:20.400> feet<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.119> I'm<00:00:21.570> gonna<00:00:21.779> do

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
to four and a half feet so I'm gonna do

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.330 
to four and a half feet so I'm gonna do
the<00:00:22.080> same<00:00:22.260> thing<00:00:22.320> again<00:00:22.619> now<00:00:22.920> I'm<00:00:23.100> going<00:00:23.279> to

the same thing again now I'm going to

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.179 
the same thing again now I'm going to
aggressively<00:00:23.939> look<00:00:24.410> for<00:00:25.410> anything<00:00:25.830> that's

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
aggressively look for anything that's

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.890 
aggressively look for anything that's
growing<00:00:26.519> up<00:00:26.699> above<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.150> point<00:00:27.420> where<00:00:27.869> I

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
growing up above the point where I

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.529 
growing up above the point where I
really<00:00:28.439> want<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.010> take<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.029> growth<00:00:30.300> out

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
really want it and take that growth out

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.179 
really want it and take that growth out
and<00:00:30.779> one<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.170> easiest<00:00:31.320> ways<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.740> do<00:00:32.040> that

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
and one of the easiest ways to do that

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.670 
and one of the easiest ways to do that
where<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.270> made<00:00:33.450> our<00:00:33.480> summer<00:00:33.870> cuts<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.649> have

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
where we made our summer cuts we have

you<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.969> branch<00:00:36.270> was<00:00:36.899> cut<00:00:37.170> here<00:00:37.559> we've

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
you know this branch was cut here we've

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.250 
you know this branch was cut here we've
got<00:00:38.219> four<00:00:38.660> branches<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.050> come<00:00:40.230> out

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
got four branches that have come out

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.020 
got four branches that have come out
from<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.559> point<00:00:40.920> well<00:00:41.399> I'm<00:00:41.520> gonna<00:00:41.610> come<00:00:41.850> back

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
from that point well I'm gonna come back

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.520 
from that point well I'm gonna come back
in<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.329> leave<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.629> low<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:42.960> which<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.260> space

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
in and leave the low one which is space

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.590 
in and leave the low one which is space
to<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> outward<00:00:44.190> growth<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.789> take<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> rest

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
to the outward growth and take the rest

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.380 
to the outward growth and take the rest
out<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.469> I'm<00:00:46.559> always<00:00:46.770> looking<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.520> whatever<00:00:48.300> I

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
out so I'm always looking at whatever I

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.130 
out so I'm always looking at whatever I
can<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.200> make<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.370> cut<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.660> get<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> lot

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
can do to make one cut and and get a lot

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.779 
can do to make one cut and and get a lot
of<00:00:52.289> wood<00:00:52.440> taken<00:00:52.800> out<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.340> all<00:00:53.520> these

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
of wood taken out with it so all these

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.389 
of wood taken out with it so all these
branches<00:00:54.120> where<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:55.289> an<00:00:55.410> outward<00:00:55.770> growing

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
branches where I have an outward growing

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.000 
branches where I have an outward growing
branch<00:00:56.850> off<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.719> them<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.109> main<00:00:58.260> cut<00:00:58.530> I'm

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
branch off of them the main cut I'm

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.950 
branch off of them the main cut I'm
gonna<00:00:59.160> take<00:00:59.399> off<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> vigor<00:00:59.969> all<00:01:00.390> this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
gonna take off the vigor all this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.529 
gonna take off the vigor all this
vigorous<00:01:01.410> growth<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:01.829> there's<00:01:02.010> no

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
vigorous growth here there's no

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.700 
vigorous growth here there's no
flowering<00:01:03.539> wood<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.049> vigorous<00:01:04.470> growth

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
flowering wood on this vigorous growth

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.130 
flowering wood on this vigorous growth
our<00:01:04.890> flower<00:01:05.129> Spurs<00:01:05.580> are<00:01:05.760> all<00:01:05.939> down<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:07.049> in

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
our flower Spurs are all down here in

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.990 
our flower Spurs are all down here in
the<00:01:07.229> lower<00:01:07.409> section<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.100> by<00:01:08.310> taking<00:01:08.700> out<00:01:08.820> this

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the lower section so by taking out this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.210 
the lower section so by taking out this
top<00:01:09.270> all<00:01:09.900> we're<00:01:10.260> doing<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.650> taking<00:01:10.799> out<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
top all we're doing is taking out the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.710 
top all we're doing is taking out the
late<00:01:11.400> season<00:01:11.610> vigor<00:01:11.970> we're<00:01:12.180> not<00:01:12.360> interrupting

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
late season vigor we're not interrupting

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.170 
late season vigor we're not interrupting
any<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.890> our<00:01:14.040> flowering<00:01:14.549> wood<00:01:14.670> down<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.060> here

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
any of our flowering wood down in here

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.440 
any of our flowering wood down in here
toward<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> center<00:01:16.759> we're<00:01:17.759> really<00:01:18.000> trying<00:01:18.390> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
toward the center we're really trying to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.270 
toward the center we're really trying to
take<00:01:18.600> out<00:01:18.810> as<00:01:18.960> much<00:01:19.140> vigor<00:01:19.439> as<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:19.799> can<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.250> I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
take out as much vigor as we can so I

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.789 
take out as much vigor as we can so I
may<00:01:20.520> even<00:01:20.670> take<00:01:20.970> out<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.450> few<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.500> these<00:01:22.619> other

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
may even take out a few of these other

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.440 
may even take out a few of these other
branches<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.430> are<00:01:23.490> growing<00:01:23.759> inward<00:01:24.119> toward

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
branches that are growing inward toward

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.420 
branches that are growing inward toward
the<00:01:24.479> center<00:01:24.740> some<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.830> these<00:01:25.920> areas<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the center some of these areas that

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.219 
the center some of these areas that
growth<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.759> too<00:01:26.939> thick<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.330> don't<00:01:27.540> need<00:01:27.810> all

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
growth is too thick we don't need all

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.380 
growth is too thick we don't need all
this<00:01:28.500> wood<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:29.520> don't<00:01:29.700> need<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.060> thing<00:01:30.270> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
this wood we don't need this thing to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.060 
this wood we don't need this thing to
look<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.780> broom<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.530> want<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.950> look

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
look like a broom we want it to look

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.730 
look like a broom we want it to look
like<00:01:32.130> an<00:01:32.579> open<00:01:33.360> space<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.810> Bush<00:01:34.020> oh<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.590> is

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
like an open space to Bush oh this is

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.050 
like an open space to Bush oh this is
too<00:01:34.920> low<00:01:35.130> I'm<00:01:35.369> gonna<00:01:35.490> take<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.850> off

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
too low I'm gonna take that off

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.850 
too low I'm gonna take that off
completely<00:01:36.420> even<00:01:37.170> though<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.409> want<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
be a low tree I don't want it to branch

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.319 
be a low tree I don't want it to branch
at<00:01:40.020> two<00:01:40.619> inches<00:01:40.890> above<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.189> bud<00:01:41.460> Union<00:01:41.759> I'm

at two inches above the bud Union I'm
also<00:01:42.600> going<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.899> take<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:44.149> center<00:01:45.149> section

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
also going to take this center section

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.120 
also going to take this center section
out<00:01:46.670> completely<00:01:47.670> that's<00:01:48.649> growing<00:01:49.649> too<00:01:49.920> much

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
out completely that's growing too much

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.280 
out completely that's growing too much
in<00:01:50.310> toward<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.610> center<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.210> want<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.899> little<00:01:52.079> bit

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
in toward the center I want a little bit

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.450 
in toward the center I want a little bit
more<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.680> an<00:01:52.770> open<00:01:52.860> structure<00:01:53.340> there

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
more of an open structure there

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.039 
more of an open structure there
I<00:01:56.049> like<00:01:57.049> that<00:01:57.290> one<00:01:57.440> I<00:01:57.500> don't<00:01:57.619> like<00:01:57.860> this<00:01:58.340> one

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
I like that one I don't like this one

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.859 
I like that one I don't like this one
and<00:02:00.049> there<00:02:00.880> that's<00:02:01.880> probably<00:02:02.119> all<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.450> big

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
and there that's probably all the big

this is a variety that we just love the
fruit<00:04:48.130> is<00:04:48.810> exceptionally<00:04:49.810> good<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.140> we've

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
fruit is exceptionally good and we've

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
got lots of fruiting wood up here in the

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.880 
got lots of fruiting wood up here in the
structure<00:04:52.330> although<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.140> want<00:04:53.470> this<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.740> be<00:04:53.770> a

low headed tree I'm leaving this

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.390 
low headed tree I'm leaving this
fruiting<00:04:56.410> wood<00:04:56.440> in<00:04:56.710> for<00:04:56.890> this<00:04:57.010> spring<00:04:57.280> and

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
fruiting wood in for this spring and

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.730 
fruiting wood in for this spring and
summer<00:04:57.460> and<00:04:57.880> we'll<00:04:58.690> do<00:04:58.930> a<00:04:58.960> heavier<00:04:59.380> summer

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
summer and we'll do a heavier summer

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.230 
summer and we'll do a heavier summer
pruning<00:04:59.980> on<00:05:00.220> this<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:00.550> bring<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.790> size<00:05:01.000> back

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
pruning on this to bring the size back

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.480 
pruning on this to bring the size back
down<00:05:01.510> so<00:05:01.750> I'm<00:05:02.380> almost<00:05:02.650> gonna<00:05:02.919> walk<00:05:03.220> away<00:05:03.370> from

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
down so I'm almost gonna walk away from

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.140 
down so I'm almost gonna walk away from
this<00:05:03.700> one<00:05:04.500> here's<00:05:05.500> Braeburn<00:05:05.950> apple<00:05:06.370> we've<00:05:06.970> got

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
this one here's Braeburn apple we've got

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.940 
this one here's Braeburn apple we've got
some<00:05:07.300> nice<00:05:07.480> spore<00:05:07.870> wood<00:05:08.080> set<00:05:08.320> on<00:05:08.470> this<00:05:08.650> so<00:05:08.830> we

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
some nice spore wood set on this so we

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.380 
some nice spore wood set on this so we
should<00:05:09.160> get<00:05:09.280> a<00:05:09.340> reasonable<00:05:09.880> set<00:05:10.060> of<00:05:10.150> fruit

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
should get a reasonable set of fruit

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.600 
should get a reasonable set of fruit
here<00:05:11.110> this<00:05:11.350> next<00:05:11.650> season<00:05:11.979> I'm<00:05:12.190> just<00:05:12.460> going<00:05:12.580> to

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
here this next season I'm just going to

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.840 
here this next season I'm just going to
take<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.060> vigor<00:05:13.270> back<00:05:14.340> enough<00:05:15.340> so<00:05:15.580> that<00:05:15.610> we

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
take the vigor back enough so that we

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.469 
take the vigor back enough so that we
have<00:05:16.060> a<00:05:16.090> nice<00:05:16.300> little<00:05:16.600> canopy<00:05:17.050> on<00:05:17.229> it

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.559 

we<00:05:22.020> want<00:05:22.169> to<00:05:22.229> keep<00:05:22.379> this<00:05:22.559> a<00:05:22.620> low<00:05:23.569> scaffolded

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
we want to keep this a low scaffolded

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.959 
we want to keep this a low scaffolded
low<00:05:24.749> prune<00:05:25.020> tree<00:05:25.289> also<00:05:25.499> open<00:05:26.430> up<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.639> center<00:05:26.849> a

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
low prune tree also open up the center a

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.059 
low prune tree also open up the center a
little<00:05:27.150> bit<00:05:27.270> make<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.110> couple<00:05:28.499> of<00:05:28.620> cuts<00:05:28.770> and<00:05:28.979> we

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
little bit make a couple of cuts and we

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:30.230 
little bit make a couple of cuts and we
can<00:05:29.219> walk<00:05:29.370> away<00:05:29.610> from<00:05:29.789> that

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
can walk away from that

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.829 
can walk away from that
now<00:05:31.110> here's<00:05:32.029> double<00:05:33.029> delight<00:05:33.300> nectarine<00:05:33.809> and

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:33.839 
now here's double delight nectarine and

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.719 
now here's double delight nectarine and
we<00:05:34.050> did<00:05:34.259> we<00:05:34.409> did<00:05:34.559> a<00:05:34.589> couple<00:05:35.129> of<00:05:35.400> different

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
we did we did a couple of different

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.999 
we did we did a couple of different
summer<00:05:35.939> prunings<00:05:36.389> on<00:05:36.539> this<00:05:36.719> one<00:05:36.960> so<00:05:37.680> we<00:05:37.800> have<00:05:37.979> a

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
summer prunings on this one so we have a

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.909 
summer prunings on this one so we have a
nice<00:05:38.249> low<00:05:38.460> canopy<00:05:38.969> on<00:05:39.120> it<00:05:39.330> I<00:05:39.839> think<00:05:40.529> with<00:05:40.770> the

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
nice low canopy on it I think with the

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.809 
nice low canopy on it I think with the
exception<00:05:41.580> of<00:05:41.729> maybe<00:05:42.210> a<00:05:42.330> little<00:05:42.479> bit<00:05:43.020> of

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:43.819 
exception of maybe a little bit of

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:50.689 
exception of maybe a little bit of
inward<00:05:44.819> growing<00:05:45.919> growth<00:05:46.919> here<00:05:49.339> take<00:05:50.339> a<00:05:50.460> couple

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
inward growing growth here take a couple

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.939 
inward growing growth here take a couple
of<00:05:50.879> cuts<00:05:51.150> here<00:05:51.539> and<00:05:51.689> a<00:05:51.719> couple<00:05:51.930> of<00:05:52.110> cuts<00:05:52.289> there

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.379 

and<00:05:55.949> I<00:05:56.039> think<00:05:56.129> I'm<00:05:56.430> about<00:05:56.699> done<00:05:56.759> with<00:05:57.060> that

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
and I think I'm about done with that

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.119 
and I think I'm about done with that
we've<00:05:57.629> got<00:05:57.659> lots<00:05:58.050> of<00:05:58.289> nice<00:05:58.439> fruiting<00:05:58.860> wood<00:05:58.889> on

00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.129 
we've got lots of nice fruiting wood on

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:01.040 
we've got lots of nice fruiting wood on
this<00:05:59.339> and<00:05:59.639> this<00:06:00.089> is<00:06:00.300> a<00:06:00.330> variety<00:06:00.629> that's<00:06:00.930> a
