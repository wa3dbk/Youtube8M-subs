 today we are going to talk about 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.060
 and it's super easy to change the 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.860
 interface of your device 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.860
 thanks to a feature called far 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.160
 in the lounges are packages of 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.060
 that you download directly from the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.119

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.790

 smell that personalizes the entire screen 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.320
 block 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.960

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.430

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.920
