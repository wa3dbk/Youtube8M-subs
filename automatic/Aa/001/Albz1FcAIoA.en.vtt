00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.450
 friends, today we are facing a 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.059
 Fancy recipe a fantasy made with 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.310
 ham with ham of jabugo nothing less than 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.520
 who sent me to taste the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.920
 people in the region look and prepare 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.020
 cones with these molds are the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.880
 cones with slices of ham that 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.640
 Now we will fill with the mushroom cream 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.540
 what am I going to do if here I have half 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.150
 ojito doing if the sofrito the epic 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.430
 or three hundred in the city because I want 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.040
 that the flavor mushroom be made but not 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.780
 note the mushrooms as you see they are so 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.670
 normal cultivation we are not 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.949
 using the same bag and with 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.100
 milk and flour I will make the cream with 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:53.170
 what if you give me a few minutes 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.289
 prepared everything and I already teach you directly 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.969
 how it's done so far so good 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.980
 we are already here in which the 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.589
 garlic I've already thrown the mushrooms 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.040
 minced with the complement that also 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.680
 the blender to apply and how 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.659
 rectify dora but good this is not the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.840
 applicator to use but is simply the 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.360
 that brings us the one that comes with the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.180
 mixer 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.180
 this does not have to be stopped much and neither 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.820
 you have to be very healthy because 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.080
 because we're going to line it up with ham 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.660
 then the ham will cost you salt 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.610
 a pinch of sharp and we throw it is 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.220
 more than enough that there is a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.080
 little bit tasty, we do not have to 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.310
 load salt now the flour I'll 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.770
 let it cook a little 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.620
 simply that to take away the flavor 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.510
 of the flour and this as you see is fast 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.540
 since it will not be this what passes 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:50.010
 coasts then it 's a little bit 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.860
 that takes the necessary texture to be able 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.590
 stuffing the ham cones and that is not 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.320
 spoils us that you do not have to be 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.010
 that is neither too liquid nor too thick 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.200
 because I'm going to try to put it with the 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.140
 normal pastry bag and current 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.470
 So, I have a cooked life 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.720
 I put the milk and now stirring 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.590
 removing them I will take them to the point that 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.810
 I need this from the roller we start another 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.520
 time and they teach you how it is worth until 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.290
 now you can see this is already 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.080
 acquiring a texture 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.400
 of a certain point of strength always 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.670
 which takes into account that four is cool 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.710
 is going to stay more solid and then 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.170
 Look, I think how is this 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.590
 and the right side that will catch when 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.590
 cool 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.020
 and leave a little more to make sure I do not 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.640
 think that 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.970
 and I think that would be fine then 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.980
 but just in case we are going to ensure a 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.980
 little the subject 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.049
 good because this does not have to be like 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.000
 a croquette this is going to be a cream 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.620
 inside a lot 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.810
 that is going to have the position of a 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.040
 croquette but it has to be manageable 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.040
 to enter it within 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.920
 well I think that with this is more than 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.060
 enough 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.010
 ah 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.010
 and I put the tray to cool 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.550
 and so then in a little while we can 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.100
 gather the kittens now if you leave me 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.590
 I leave I begin to prepare the topic of 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.590
 canutillos to show you how they are made 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.430
 Well I'm already done a few 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.210
 cornets that weighs the word 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.850
 canutillos I do not know why they are cornets 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.290
 and you see we just started with 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.519
 the bottom 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.379
 and we put the mold up 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.780
 this is so simple now 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.879
 just to the pan a little bit to the 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.030
 iron because the ham leads singles and 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.030
 is 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.750
 and then we will stay like this we have to leave 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.550
 let it cool down a bit once it 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.430
 cool, they get stiffer 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.459
 so I make them frame here in the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.500
 iron and when and when you remove them 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.720
 let cool like these and as you see 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.329
 now we can link perfectly 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.320
 to be able to fill them with the cream 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.060
 OK 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.340
 so far friends let me make them 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.889
 and then the eggs 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.290
 As you see I'm getting longer 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.840
 Fill 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:34.600
 the last 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.990
 they do not contests 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.480
 to see how you see the end instead of the 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.250
 pastry bag and using this 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.710
 gun because I find it more comfortable 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.550
 but with a pastry bag too 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.640
 you can do a year now and just 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:54.200
 I put a little bit of cheese on them 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.750
 and emerge above 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.390
 I'm going to join 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.730
 so that there was not this time in the 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.330
 simple kitchen and details that make you 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.250
 change the videos 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.490
 and so the hundreds of more little ones 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.729
 so that there the cheese does not fall out 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.719
 everything to where 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.550
 well, this will gratinate in the oven and 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:16.809
 where is the one who feels gratined to 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.979
 same kind of serve so that it 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:25.439
 heat the cone right away by the 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.439
 poles between the mouse and so far 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:31.520
 and we already put 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.910
 the last cluster crash with cream 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.290
 Mushrooms and mozzarella cheese gratin by 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.270
 over 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.190
 this does not need to be proven 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.110
 that is the sea ​​of ​​rich but no longer 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.670
 I would count for when I wrote you larreta 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.840
 already spoke I tell you that I can 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.840
 you until then
