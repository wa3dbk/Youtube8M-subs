goes all right I can't remember I know
everything<00:03:28.510> like<00:03:28.630> a<00:03:28.720> brain<00:03:28.959> fart<00:03:35.130> stable

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
everything like a brain fart stable

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.759 
everything like a brain fart stable
stable<00:03:36.790> yeah<00:03:37.750> stable<00:03:38.410> on<00:03:40.350> gasoline<00:03:41.350> that<00:03:41.590> is

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
stable yeah stable on gasoline that is

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.470 
stable yeah stable on gasoline that is
about<00:03:42.040> three<00:03:42.340> months<00:03:42.489> old<00:03:42.700> so<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.239> can

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
about three months old so I can

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.860 
about three months old so I can
definitely<00:03:43.930> feel<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.290> power<00:03:44.530> difference

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
definitely feel the power difference

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.839 
definitely feel the power difference
the<00:03:47.500> bike<00:03:47.769> definitely<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.489> not<00:03:48.670> running<00:03:49.470> as

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
the bike definitely is not running as

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.750 
the bike definitely is not running as
well<00:03:51.849> as<00:03:52.150> it<00:03:52.330> should<00:03:52.530> because<00:03:53.530> of<00:03:53.680> that<00:03:53.940> but

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
well as it should because of that but

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.160 
well as it should because of that but
I'm<00:03:57.760> trying<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.150> run<00:03:58.420> that<00:03:58.540> out<00:03:58.720> here<00:03:58.989> right

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.280 
now so I should be fine pretty soon once
actually<00:04:03.760> run<00:04:04.209> that<00:04:04.360> tank<00:04:04.690> down

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.160 
actually run that tank down
and<00:04:06.890> get<00:04:07.099> rid<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.340> all<00:04:07.519> that<00:04:07.549> stable<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.959> then

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
and get rid of all that stable and then

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.470 
and get rid of all that stable and then
old<00:04:09.470> gasoline

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.720 

that's<00:04:14.050> not<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.319> say<00:04:14.500> that

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.470 

I<00:04:19.620> can't<00:04:20.620> still<00:04:20.950> go<00:04:21.190> out<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.970> still

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
I can't still go out and still

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.330 
I can't still go out and still
accelerate<00:04:25.480> the<00:04:25.660> way<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:26.080> I<00:04:26.110> need<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.590> do<00:04:26.860> is

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
accelerate the way that I need to do is

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.850 
accelerate the way that I need to do is
just<00:04:28.090> not<00:04:28.420> going<00:04:28.690> as<00:04:28.960> quickly<00:04:29.200> as<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.590> should

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
just not going as quickly as it should

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.970 
just not going as quickly as it should
be<00:04:30.040> going<00:04:33.090> what's<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.270> move<00:04:35.080> this<00:04:35.230> fucking

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980

and<00:04:57.460> I'm<00:04:57.580> hoping<00:04:57.940> not<00:04:58.090> to<00:04:58.150> get<00:04:58.390> into<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.900> car

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
and I'm hoping not to get into the car

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.520 
and I'm hoping not to get into the car
in<00:04:59.380> these<00:04:59.560> fucking<00:05:00.190> traffic<00:05:00.520> ropes<00:05:01.350> right<00:05:02.350> now

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
in these fucking traffic ropes right now

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:53.450 
in these fucking traffic ropes right now
that<00:05:02.800> everyone<00:05:03.160> is<00:05:03.310> in<00:05:09.450> shit

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.390 

I<00:06:04.640> think<00:06:05.330> a<00:06:05.420> lot<00:06:05.660> of<00:06:05.780> those<00:06:05.930> cars<00:06:06.860> are<00:06:07.100> really

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
I think a lot of those cars are really

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.030 
I think a lot of those cars are really
really<00:06:07.820> good<00:06:08.030> now<00:06:08.180> by<00:06:08.450> Hyundai<00:06:09.080> and<00:06:09.320> Kia<00:06:09.650> well

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
really good now by Hyundai and Kia well

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.950 
really good now by Hyundai and Kia well
they're<00:06:10.220> both<00:06:10.400> the<00:06:10.550> same<00:06:10.580> company<00:06:11.150> but

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
they're both the same company but

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.140 
they're both the same company but
they're<00:06:12.140> basically<00:06:12.560> like<00:06:12.860> Honda<00:06:13.250> now<00:06:13.430> I<00:06:13.730> think

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150
