the bootstrap free series in this part
we're<00:00:09.179> going<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.330> be<00:00:09.420> looking<00:00:09.630> at<00:00:09.750> fixed

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
we're going to be looking at fixed

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.500 
we're going to be looking at fixed
versus<00:00:10.650> fluid<00:00:11.100> layouts<00:00:11.490> we'll<00:00:12.030> be<00:00:12.210> using<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 
versus fluid layouts we'll be using the

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.660 
versus fluid layouts we'll be using the
source<00:00:12.720> code<00:00:12.990> from<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.590> sixth<00:00:13.950> tutorial<00:00:14.580> if

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
source code from the sixth tutorial if

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.160 
source code from the sixth tutorial if
you<00:00:14.730> don't<00:00:14.940> have<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.240> don't<00:00:15.480> it'll<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:15.930> a<00:00:15.960> link

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
you don't have it don't it'll be a link

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.349 
you don't have it don't it'll be a link
in<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> description<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:17.430> all<00:00:17.640> fixed<00:00:18.269> and

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
in the description so all fixed and

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.439 
in the description so all fixed and
fluid<00:00:18.929> late<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.500> lens<00:00:19.860> well<00:00:20.430> up<00:00:20.550> till<00:00:20.730> now<00:00:20.970> we

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
fluid late the lens well up till now we

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.109 
fluid late the lens well up till now we
have<00:00:21.750> been<00:00:21.780> using<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.500> fixed<00:00:23.250> LED<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.940> we

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
have been using a fixed LED and we

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.370 
have been using a fixed LED and we
didn't<00:00:24.420> even<00:00:24.570> know<00:00:24.869> about<00:00:25.050> it

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
didn't even know about it

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.310 
didn't even know about it
well<00:00:25.830> well<00:00:26.310> obviously<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.670> did<00:00:27.029> but<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:28.109> wasn't

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
well well obviously I did but it wasn't

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.349 
well well obviously I did but it wasn't
really<00:00:28.529> explained<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.430> that's<00:00:29.760> because<00:00:30.060> it

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
really explained and that's because it

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.240 
really explained and that's because it
was<00:00:30.480> leading<00:00:30.779> up<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.930> this<00:00:31.170> tutorial<00:00:31.890> to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
was leading up to this tutorial to

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.160 
was leading up to this tutorial to
pretty<00:00:32.460> simply<00:00:32.879> a<00:00:33.090> fixed<00:00:33.660> layer<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.960> has<00:00:34.109> a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
pretty simply a fixed layer it has a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.200 
pretty simply a fixed layer it has a
maximum<00:00:34.590> screen<00:00:35.010> width<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:35.340> 1200<00:00:35.850> pixels

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
maximum screen width for 1200 pixels

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.569 
maximum screen width for 1200 pixels
which<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.899> discussed<00:00:37.500> earlier<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.980> like<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
which we discussed earlier on like the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.549 
which we discussed earlier on like the
extra<00:00:38.820> small<00:00:39.030> small<00:00:39.390> medium<00:00:39.420> large<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.230> large

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
extra small small medium large and large

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.060 
extra small small medium large and large
is<00:00:40.890> 1200<00:00:41.730> pixels<00:00:42.210> which<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.380> large

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
is 1200 pixels which is for large

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.120 
is 1200 pixels which is for large
columns<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.120> flew<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.540> that<00:00:45.690> cavern<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
columns but I flew in that cavern have a

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.760 
columns but I flew in that cavern have a
mix<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.790> apart<00:00:48.270> from<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.690> browser<00:00:49.020> width<00:00:49.379> so

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
mix with apart from the browser width so

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.069 
mix with apart from the browser width so
if<00:00:49.860> your<00:00:50.010> browser<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.520> below<00:00:50.850> 200<00:00:51.360> pixels<00:00:51.690> then

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
if your browser is below 200 pixels then

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.110 
if your browser is below 200 pixels then
it<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.379> uses<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.980> other<00:00:53.160> sort<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.460> mediums

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it just uses the other sort of mediums

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.139 
it just uses the other sort of mediums
more<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.989> roll<00:00:55.200> on<00:00:55.350> an<00:00:56.010> extra<00:00:56.370> small<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:56.910> it's

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
more just roll on an extra small if it's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.410 
more just roll on an extra small if it's
above<00:00:57.450> 1200<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.200> still<00:00:58.500> considered<00:00:59.100> large<00:00:59.760> but

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
above 1200 is still considered large but

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.689 
above 1200 is still considered large but
then<00:01:00.600> instead<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.230> columns<00:01:01.680> stop<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.460> from

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
then instead of the columns stop in from

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.009 
then instead of the columns stop in from
adjusting<00:01:03.210> they<00:01:03.270> keep<00:01:03.510> going

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
adjusting they keep going

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.469 
adjusting they keep going
it's<00:01:04.259> using<00:01:05.009> a<00:01:05.100> fluid<00:01:05.460> layer<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.000> 12<00:01:06.270> grade

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it's using a fluid layer the 12 grade

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.870 
it's using a fluid layer the 12 grade
column<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.319> still<00:01:07.649> in<00:01:07.829> effect<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.399> it<00:01:08.639> takes

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
column is still in effect but it takes

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.940 
column is still in effect but it takes
up<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.179> browser<00:01:09.479> width<00:01:09.869> instead<00:01:10.469> that's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
up the browser width instead that's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.249 
up the browser width instead that's
literally<00:01:11.310> all<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.609> need<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.029> know<00:01:12.209> so<00:01:12.869> let's

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
literally all you need to know so let's

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.459 
literally all you need to know so let's
change<00:01:13.529> our<00:01:13.950> website<00:01:14.459> to<00:01:14.759> use<00:01:15.749> the<00:01:16.139> fluid

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
change our website to use the fluid

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:18.349 
change our website to use the fluid
layer<00:01:16.649> this<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.130> really<00:01:17.490> easy<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.969> only

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
layer this is really easy and only

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.059 
layer this is really easy and only
requires<00:01:18.719> a<00:01:18.840> single<00:01:18.869> line<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.439> code<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.979> be

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:20.069 
requires a single line of code to be

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:22.309 
requires a single line of code to be
changed<00:01:20.639> we<00:01:20.819> don't<00:01:21.299> need<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.599> add<00:01:21.810> anything<00:01:22.049> so

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
changed we don't need to add anything so

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.469 
changed we don't need to add anything so
some<00:01:22.499> modification<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.520> let's<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:23.849> open<00:01:24.389> up

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
some modification so let's just open up

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.459 
some modification so let's just open up
index<00:01:24.899> dot<00:01:25.109> HTML<00:01:25.139> in<00:01:25.829> a<00:01:25.889> text<00:01:26.159> editor

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
index dot HTML in a text editor

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.169 
index dot HTML in a text editor
if<00:01:28.469> we<00:01:28.590> go<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.859> where<00:01:29.279> we've<00:01:29.459> got<00:01:29.639> container

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
if we go to where we've got container

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.569 
if we go to where we've got container
instead<00:01:30.899> of<00:01:31.109> on<00:01:31.229> container<00:01:31.649> we<00:01:32.009> put<00:01:32.189> container

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
instead of on container we put container

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.839 
instead of on container we put container
that<00:01:32.880> actually<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.109> to<00:01:34.200> run<00:01:35.069> our

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:35.849 
that actually it's going to run our

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:37.969 
that actually it's going to run our
website<00:01:36.359> so<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.539> can<00:01:36.599> see<00:01:37.020> what<00:01:37.679> it<00:01:37.799> looks

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
website so you can see what it looks

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:38.269 
website so you can see what it looks
like

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:38.279 
like

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:41.510 
like
I<00:01:38.959> think<00:01:39.959> about<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.649> two<00:01:40.829> three<00:01:41.069> four<00:01:41.310> five

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
I think about one two three four five

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.929 
I think about one two three four five
six<00:01:41.789> and<00:01:42.209> we<00:01:42.719> three<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.169> normally<00:01:43.709> but<00:01:44.579> if<00:01:44.729> we

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
six and we three so normally but if we

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.349 
six and we three so normally but if we
go<00:01:45.119> back<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.359> sublime<00:01:46.169> and<00:01:46.759> to<00:01:47.759> change<00:01:47.999> it<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
go back to sublime and to change it to

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.409 
go back to sublime and to change it to
fluid<00:01:48.779> layer<00:01:48.959> you<00:01:49.289> just<00:01:49.499> put<00:01:49.649> -<00:01:51.349> fluid<00:01:52.349> save

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:53.419 
fluid layer you just put - fluid save

Dok<00:02:16.720> ruk<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.980> really<00:02:18.460> matter<00:02:18.670> which<00:02:19.180> one<00:02:19.240> you

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
Dok ruk that really matter which one you

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.900 
Dok ruk that really matter which one you
go<00:02:19.960> on<00:02:20.140> this<00:02:20.560> even<00:02:21.040> though<00:02:21.070> this<00:02:21.400> really<00:02:21.730> isn't

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
go on this even though this really isn't

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.910 
go on this even though this really isn't
responsive<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.690> main<00:02:22.870> reason<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:23.710> isn't

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
responsive the main reason it it isn't

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.850 
responsive the main reason it it isn't
it<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.790> simply<00:02:25.150> because<00:02:25.270> they<00:02:25.570> have<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:26.110> mobile

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
it is simply because they have a mobile

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.520 
it is simply because they have a mobile
app<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.400> it's<00:02:27.670> actually<00:02:27.970> very<00:02:28.090> good<00:02:28.240> so<00:02:29.020> but

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
app and it's actually very good so but

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.000 
app and it's actually very good so but
this<00:02:29.740> is<00:02:30.240> uses<00:02:31.240> if<00:02:31.630> except<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.770> terms<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.850> its

this is uses if except in terms of its

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.820 
this is uses if except in terms of its
it's<00:02:36.010> sort<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.460> centered<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.240> on<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:38.170> browser

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
it's sort of centered so on this browser

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.610 
it's sort of centered so on this browser
or<00:02:39.280> on<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.790> screen<00:02:40.150> I've<00:02:40.420> got<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.900> resolution

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
or on the screen I've got the resolution

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.060 
or on the screen I've got the resolution
set<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:41.860> 1280<00:02:42.430> by<00:02:42.670> 720<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.930> covers<00:02:44.170> most<00:02:44.860> of

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
set to 1280 by 720 so it covers most of

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.100 
set to 1280 by 720 so it covers most of
the<00:02:45.130> browser<00:02:45.430> but<00:02:45.730> if<00:02:45.820> you<00:02:46.000> set<00:02:46.300> your<00:02:46.930> brother

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
the browser but if you set your brother

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.740 
the browser but if you set your brother
will<00:02:47.860> sort<00:02:48.250> of<00:02:48.280> your<00:02:48.430> display<00:02:48.790> resolution<00:02:49.540> to

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
will sort of your display resolution to

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.570 
will sort of your display resolution to
the<00:02:49.900> say<00:02:50.050> 2560<00:02:50.830> which<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.160> native

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
the say 2560 which is the native

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.260 
the say 2560 which is the native
resolution<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:52.270> my<00:02:52.870> iMac<00:02:53.290> then<00:02:54.090> what<00:02:55.090> would

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
resolution of my iMac then what would

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.420 
resolution of my iMac then what would
happen<00:02:55.630> you<00:02:55.750> just<00:02:55.890> appear<00:02:56.890> in<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.220> middle

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
happen you just appear in the middle

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.060 
happen you just appear in the middle
like<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.990> was<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.260> standard<00:02:59.620> for

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
like that and that was a standard for

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.190 
like that and that was a standard for
old<00:03:00.310> what<00:03:00.880> sites<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.450> reason<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.960> was

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
old what sites and the reason that was

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.290 
old what sites and the reason that was
the<00:03:02.350> standard<00:03:02.590> well<00:03:03.190> simply<00:03:03.580> because<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:03.940> lot

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
the standard well simply because a lot

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.050 
the standard well simply because a lot
of<00:03:04.450> computers<00:03:05.080> out<00:03:05.260> there<00:03:05.580> didn't<00:03:06.580> have<00:03:06.790> high

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
of computers out there didn't have high

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.840 
of computers out there didn't have high
resolution<00:03:07.440> therefore<00:03:08.440> if<00:03:08.710> they<00:03:08.980> don't<00:03:09.580> spend

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
resolution therefore if they don't spend

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.330 
resolution therefore if they don't spend
two<00:03:10.240> thousand<00:03:10.750> pixels<00:03:10.960> or<00:03:11.680> something<00:03:12.190> crazy

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
two thousand pixels or something crazy

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.240 
two thousand pixels or something crazy
like<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.820> then<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.900> lot<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.440> users<00:03:14.860> would<00:03:15.190> be

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
like that then a lot of users would be

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.340 
like that then a lot of users would be
alienated<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:16.210> wouldn't<00:03:16.630> be<00:03:16.750> able<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.930> get<00:03:17.170> the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
alienated I wouldn't be able to get the

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.250 
alienated I wouldn't be able to get the
full<00:03:17.620> user<00:03:18.120> experience<00:03:19.120> but<00:03:19.540> now<00:03:19.690> we<00:03:19.750> respond

full user experience but now we respond
to<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.440> design<00:03:20.740> you<00:03:21.190> can<00:03:21.400> give<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:22.150> people

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
to the design you can give the people

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.510 
to the design you can give the people
who<00:03:22.690> have<00:03:22.990> a<00:03:23.020> bigger<00:03:23.320> monitor<00:03:23.800> with<00:03:24.340> higher

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
who have a bigger monitor with higher

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.550 
who have a bigger monitor with higher

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
resolutions more real estate to work

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.980 
resolutions more real estate to work
with<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.130> people<00:03:27.610> let's<00:03:27.910> say<00:03:28.030> who<00:03:28.300> have<00:03:28.480> lower

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
with and people let's say who have lower

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.990 
with and people let's say who have lower
resolutions<00:03:29.770> or<00:03:29.950> they're<00:03:30.640> on<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.760> mobile

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
resolutions or they're on a mobile

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000 
resolutions or they're on a mobile
device<00:03:31.210> because<00:03:31.660> mobile<00:03:32.170> devices<00:03:32.620> are<00:03:32.830> very

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
device because mobile devices are very

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.310 
device because mobile devices are very
popular<00:03:33.190> now<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:34.210> can<00:03:34.420> use<00:03:34.660> responsive

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
popular now you can use responsive

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.880 
popular now you can use responsive
design<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:35.950> it<00:03:36.580> fits<00:03:36.910> accordingly<00:03:37.770> I'm<00:03:38.770> going

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
design so it fits accordingly I'm going

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.530 
design so it fits accordingly I'm going
to<00:03:38.950> show<00:03:39.100> you<00:03:39.160> another<00:03:39.400> website<00:03:39.820> it's<00:03:40.300> this

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
to show you another website it's this

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.500 
to show you another website it's this
one<00:03:40.750> going<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.230> be<00:03:41.290> Amazon<00:03:42.990> and<00:03:45.210> this<00:03:46.210> if<00:03:46.390> you

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
one going to be Amazon and this if you

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.820 
one going to be Amazon and this if you
were<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.690> displace<00:03:47.080> on<00:03:47.260> a<00:03:47.290> bigger<00:03:47.650> resolution

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
were to displace on a bigger resolution

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.460 
were to displace on a bigger resolution
it<00:03:48.550> basically<00:03:49.180> has<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.540> better<00:03:49.840> responsiveness

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
it basically has a better responsiveness

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.370 
it basically has a better responsiveness
to<00:03:50.710> it<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.190> he<00:03:51.490> extends<00:03:52.120> all<00:03:52.270> the<00:03:52.330> way<00:03:52.750> so<00:03:52.960> if<00:03:53.260> I

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
to it and he extends all the way so if I
