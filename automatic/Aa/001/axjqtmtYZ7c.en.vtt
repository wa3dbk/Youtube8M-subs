through a quick edit on a floral picture

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.810 
through a quick edit on a floral picture
I've<00:00:27.200> quite<00:00:27.439> a<00:00:27.470> few<00:00:27.619> people<00:00:27.830> who<00:00:28.310> have<00:00:28.400> sent<00:00:28.669> me

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.569 
I've quite a few people who have sent me
messages<00:00:29.329> and<00:00:29.480> emails<00:00:29.779> from<00:00:30.579> primarily

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579

YouTube<00:00:32.090> about<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:33.680> editing<00:00:34.040> process<00:00:34.340> on

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
YouTube about the editing process on

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.930 
YouTube about the editing process on
some<00:00:35.960> of<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.140> work<00:00:36.320> that's<00:00:36.559> been<00:00:37.430> posted<00:00:37.699> on

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
some of the work that's been posted on

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.210 
some of the work that's been posted on
my<00:00:38.120> blog<00:00:38.150> and<00:00:38.660> website<00:00:39.050> recently<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:40.190> I

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
my blog and website recently so I

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.119 
my blog and website recently so I
figured<00:00:40.610> it<00:00:40.699> was<00:00:40.850> easier<00:00:40.879> just<00:00:41.300> to<00:00:41.540> do<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:41.750> video

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
figured it was easier just to do a video

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.700 
figured it was easier just to do a video
show<00:00:43.129> people<00:00:43.370> roughly<00:00:44.180> my<00:00:44.540> workflow<00:00:44.960> as<00:00:45.379> we<00:00:45.559> go

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
show people roughly my workflow as we go

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.400 
show people roughly my workflow as we go
through<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.129> floral<00:00:46.400> pictures<00:00:47.199> now<00:00:48.199> I've<00:00:48.260> got

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
through the floral pictures now I've got

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.670 
through the floral pictures now I've got
this<00:00:48.530> basic<00:00:48.769> file<00:00:49.280> here<00:00:50.320> this<00:00:51.320> is<00:00:51.440> pretty<00:00:51.590> much

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
this basic file here this is pretty much

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.229 
this basic file here this is pretty much
untouched<00:00:52.129> it's<00:00:52.309> been<00:00:52.489> reset<00:00:52.850> back<00:00:53.059> to

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
untouched it's been reset back to

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.770 
untouched it's been reset back to
default<00:00:53.710> and<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:56.000> first<00:00:56.270> thing<00:00:56.480> I'd<00:00:56.600> always

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
default and the first thing I'd always

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.270 
default and the first thing I'd always
stress<00:00:57.170> is<00:00:57.379> is<00:00:57.620> when<00:00:57.829> you're<00:00:57.949> taking<00:00:58.219> these

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
stress is is when you're taking these

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.160 
stress is is when you're taking these
pictures<00:00:58.820> have<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.270> look<00:00:59.480> at<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.690> background

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
pictures have a look at the background

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.229 
pictures have a look at the background
this<00:01:00.559> out<00:01:00.770> a<00:01:00.800> focus<00:01:01.340> area<00:01:01.489> at<00:01:01.850> this<00:01:01.969> of<00:01:02.149> the

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
this out a focus area at this of the

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.600 
this out a focus area at this of the
back<00:01:02.449> is<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.500> area<00:01:03.829> that's<00:01:03.980> probably<00:01:04.399> one<00:01:04.580> of

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
back is the area that's probably one of

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.180 
back is the area that's probably one of
the<00:01:04.699> most<00:01:04.879> important<00:01:05.630> factors<00:01:06.259> when<00:01:06.979> you're

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
the most important factors when you're

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.300 
the most important factors when you're
taking<00:01:08.030> detail<00:01:08.450> shots<00:01:08.720> like<00:01:08.899> this<00:01:09.310> obviously

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
taking detail shots like this obviously

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.910 
taking detail shots like this obviously
what<00:01:10.550> you<00:01:10.670> don't<00:01:10.910> want<00:01:11.119> is<00:01:11.300> things<00:01:11.600> that

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
what you don't want is things that

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.200 
what you don't want is things that
detract<00:01:12.920> from<00:01:13.039> it<00:01:13.369> too<00:01:13.580> much<00:01:13.789> so<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.030> don't

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
detract from it too much so you don't

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.969 
detract from it too much so you don't

I'm going to use the grid lines here and

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.530 
I'm going to use the grid lines here and
place<00:04:58.620> it<00:04:59.540> on<00:05:00.540> one<00:05:00.600> of<00:05:00.780> these<00:05:00.900> third<00:05:01.320> lines<00:05:02.540> and

place it on one of these third lines and

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.670 
place it on one of these third lines and
what's<00:05:03.690> good<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:04.020> me<00:05:04.140> and<00:05:04.290> I'll<00:05:04.350> just<00:05:04.380> press

often than not on Sat like eighteen
nineteen<00:05:26.490> especially<00:05:26.940> on<00:05:27.000> the<00:05:27.090> bright

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
nineteen especially on the bright

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.150 
nineteen especially on the bright
pictures<00:05:27.690> you<00:05:27.750> don't<00:05:27.840> take<00:05:28.500> things<00:05:28.650> out<00:05:28.920> too

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
pictures you don't take things out too

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.130 
pictures you don't take things out too
much<00:05:29.420> now<00:05:30.420> we've<00:05:30.570> done<00:05:30.690> all<00:05:30.810> that<00:05:30.840> we're<00:05:31.080> just

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
much now we've done all that we're just

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.460 
much now we've done all that we're just
going<00:05:31.320> to<00:05:31.350> knit<00:05:31.590> back<00:05:31.740> up<00:05:31.890> to<00:05:32.040> that<00:05:32.130> exposure

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
going to knit back up to that exposure

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.680 
going to knit back up to that exposure
let's<00:05:34.470> see<00:05:34.650> if<00:05:34.710> we<00:05:34.830> can<00:05:35.040> just<00:05:35.450> crank<00:05:36.450> it<00:05:36.630> back

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
let's see if we can just crank it back

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:46.119 
let's see if we can just crank it back
up<00:05:36.900> again<00:05:37.290> a<00:05:37.320> little<00:05:37.500> bit

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:46.129 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.669 

I'm<00:05:46.789> just<00:05:47.029> gonna<00:05:47.149> drop<00:05:47.389> that<00:05:47.419> why<00:05:47.869> slider<00:05:48.409> and

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:48.679 
I'm just gonna drop that why slider and

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:53.949 
I'm just gonna drop that why slider and
just<00:05:48.949> drag<00:05:49.159> it<00:05:49.279> down<00:05:49.459> a<00:05:49.489> little<00:05:49.669> bit<00:05:49.879> more<00:05:52.959> and

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:53.959 
just drag it down a little bit more and

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:57.399 
just drag it down a little bit more and
I<00:05:54.080> think<00:05:54.139> we're<00:05:54.469> good<00:05:54.589> at<00:05:54.709> that<00:05:56.080> so<00:05:57.080> if<00:05:57.169> we<00:05:57.259> just

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
I think we're good at that so if we just

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:58.570 
I think we're good at that so if we just
nip<00:05:57.589> back<00:05:57.739> and<00:05:57.919> have<00:05:58.039> a<00:05:58.069> look<00:05:58.249> at<00:05:58.339> what<00:05:58.459> we

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
nip back and have a look at what we

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.350 
nip back and have a look at what we
started<00:05:58.969> with<00:05:59.179> which<00:06:00.019> was<00:06:00.050> this<00:06:00.319> picture<00:06:01.360> now

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
started with which was this picture now

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.359 
started with which was this picture now
we've<00:06:02.539> gone<00:06:02.719> from<00:06:02.899> that<00:06:03.110> to<00:06:04.179> this<00:06:06.159> so<00:06:07.159> you<00:06:07.249> can

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:07.369 
we've gone from that to this so you can

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:10.929 
we've gone from that to this so you can
see<00:06:07.519> yeah<00:06:07.639> a<00:06:07.819> few<00:06:08.179> short<00:06:08.449> steps<00:06:08.779> can<00:06:09.849> bring<00:06:10.849> you

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:10.939 
see yeah a few short steps can bring you

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:15.279 
see yeah a few short steps can bring you
quite<00:06:11.179> a<00:06:11.209> long<00:06:11.419> way<00:06:13.809> excuse<00:06:14.809> me<00:06:14.959> it's<00:06:15.080> just

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
quite a long way excuse me it's just

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:20.409 
quite a long way excuse me it's just
stacked<00:06:15.709> my<00:06:15.919> image<00:06:16.219> again<00:06:18.969> so<00:06:19.969> this<00:06:20.089> was<00:06:20.269> the

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
stacked my image again so this was the

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:26.579 
stacked my image again so this was the
before<00:06:21.849> and<00:06:22.849> this<00:06:22.969> was<00:06:23.149> the<00:06:23.300> after<00:06:23.860> before

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:26.589 
before and this was the after before

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:29.769 
before and this was the after before
after<00:06:27.819> they<00:06:28.819> don't<00:06:29.029> have<00:06:29.119> to<00:06:29.209> go<00:06:29.300> quite<00:06:29.599> as

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:29.779 
after they don't have to go quite as

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:31.209 
after they don't have to go quite as
vivid<00:06:30.110> as<00:06:30.199> a<00:06:30.289> husband<00:06:30.649> with<00:06:30.769> this<00:06:30.889> to<00:06:31.099> be<00:06:31.129> a

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:31.219 
vivid as a husband with this to be a

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:33.279 
vivid as a husband with this to be a
high<00:06:31.339> other<00:06:31.519> stuff<00:06:31.759> I'll<00:06:31.999> probably<00:06:32.330> push<00:06:33.139> this

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289 
high other stuff I'll probably push this

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:34.179 
high other stuff I'll probably push this
a<00:06:33.349> little<00:06:33.439> bit<00:06:33.740> further<00:06:33.979> than<00:06:34.069> they

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:34.189 
a little bit further than they

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:36.549 
a little bit further than they
ordinarily<00:06:34.339> would<00:06:35.080> just<00:06:36.080> to<00:06:36.139> make<00:06:36.259> sure<00:06:36.289> they

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:36.559 
ordinarily would just to make sure they

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:37.869 
ordinarily would just to make sure they
actually<00:06:36.589> come<00:06:37.069> across<00:06:37.189> on<00:06:37.550> the<00:06:37.639> video

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:37.879 
actually come across on the video

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:40.659 
actually come across on the video
because<00:06:38.029> sometimes<00:06:38.569> it<00:06:39.189> the<00:06:40.189> effects<00:06:40.490> that

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
because sometimes it the effects that

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.759 
because sometimes it the effects that
you<00:06:40.789> do<00:06:41.029> don't<00:06:41.899> come<00:06:42.079> across<00:06:42.169> very<00:06:42.559> well<00:06:42.679> on

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:42.769 
you do don't come across very well on

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:45.009 
you do don't come across very well on
video<00:06:43.039> so<00:06:43.219> sometimes<00:06:43.579> you<00:06:43.699> have<00:06:43.729> to<00:06:44.019> overcook

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:45.019 
video so sometimes you have to overcook

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:46.509 
video so sometimes you have to overcook
them<00:06:45.169> ever<00:06:45.349> so<00:06:45.499> slightly<00:06:45.709> just<00:06:46.039> so<00:06:46.219> it's<00:06:46.369> more

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:46.519 
them ever so slightly just so it's more

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:48.129 
them ever so slightly just so it's more
obvious<00:06:46.879> to<00:06:47.059> you<00:06:47.329> when<00:06:47.659> you're<00:06:47.809> viewing<00:06:48.019> the

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
obvious to you when you're viewing the

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:53.169 
obvious to you when you're viewing the
video<00:06:48.969> so<00:06:49.969> once<00:06:50.149> again<00:06:50.300> before<00:06:51.219> and<00:06:52.219> after<00:06:52.699> and

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:53.179 
video so once again before and after and

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:55.209 
video so once again before and after and
all<00:06:53.389> we've<00:06:53.539> really<00:06:53.809> done<00:06:53.990> is<00:06:54.050> is<00:06:54.619> we've<00:06:54.979> moved

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:55.219 
all we've really done is is we've moved

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:56.619 
all we've really done is is we've moved
the<00:06:55.339> color<00:06:55.519> temperature<00:06:55.759> up<00:06:56.119> from<00:06:56.240> the<00:06:56.329> tin<00:06:56.509> up

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:56.629 
the color temperature up from the tin up
