don't know how long this is going to

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.390 
don't know how long this is going to
take<00:04:21.479> at<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.260> reason<00:04:22.620> why<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.740> like<00:04:22.979> mules<00:04:23.190> is

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
take at the reason why I like mules is

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.610 
take at the reason why I like mules is
because<00:04:23.669> you<00:04:23.790> can<00:04:23.940> transport<00:04:24.479> items<00:04:25.050> from<00:04:25.380> one

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
because you can transport items from one

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.680 
because you can transport items from one
location<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:26.160> another<00:04:26.310> which<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.270> good<00:04:27.479> if<00:04:27.510> you

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
location to another which is good if you

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.600 
location to another which is good if you
are<00:04:27.930> moving<00:04:28.229> house
