00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
 nor of this art we are not going to go to another Pablo art that we have had this end of 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.280
 week ea also in the middle of the street in the town hall square you go there 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.889
 will have heard chainsaw noises 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.459
 and is that the nexus artists are doing things like this 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.840
 also that everyone is happy 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.880
 we have, for example, the Bulgarians with a very low voltage station 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.440
 simplified and a very nice concept of sculpture by which the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.020
 volumes speak for themselves 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.870
 we have the Poles to have more jeopardized trust in what could be the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.870
 epidermis of the trunk once cites the bark when with unfortunate and 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.320
 creating textures 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.410
 in addition both Argentinean was taken with the one that I share homex found out 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.860
 because he is the deputy director 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.950
 and a very clear way we have delegated to him for being the head of the department of 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.390
 sculpture to organize this shed of the chainsaws 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.730
 consists of typical mines today he worked two on the resignation 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.940
 on the other hand the fair 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.300
 I did not have 18 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.450
 I can not get away from that, it's my bitch 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.470
 by antonomasia I wish with him those who do not possess 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.910
 for salary and fibula clear about the program with the famous 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.340
 alberola 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.670
 female form 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.690
 Juan and I have always 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.860
 with a kind of tacit agreement of jazz was more blind gentlemen link 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.860
 two of them and I warriors in this case 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.799
 my tribute to all those who are forced by force 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.929
 my arracÃ³ visa is going to have everything a little bit of bishop or pop pee de guerrero 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.359
 the president of the Government 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.249
 of all those that are not normally annoying to artists 

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:01.889
 because look where in Toledo it seems that we are she agreements is not even 

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:04.889
 from my fans have thrown in a bucket of water 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.409
 It is really difficult 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.989
 because if an industrial frog exclusively manufactured for what it is 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.989
 a flat cut and we say popular charro 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.499
 totally a tree 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.689
 The truth is that at 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.930
 such a coarse tool forces us to be bolder more accurate 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.139
 simple oblige 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.249
 make an imaginative effort especially to be able to say a lot with 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:41.949
 little bit 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.149
 to it it gives to make some boast because it is necessary to see a little 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.889
 spectacular public as is my case because in addition to as an artist I have 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.209
 as an organizer 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.899
 and that luxury is allowed 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:55.519
 to leave four clean cuts in a destination trunk that 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.099
 will really be determined in which the company Toledo hair and is that the 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.650
 international that support us in this has facilitated us well we are working 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.260
 in most of the guests 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.699
 so much to whom 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.739
 in the meeting the chainsaw as the network the rest of the artists 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.739
 they are directors of arts meetings in their countries 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:14.379
 i 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.269
 we want to be borrowed by ricardo 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.539
 a dream that we must make several years 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.569
 this idea that all independent encounters of artists from europe 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.469
 can work together 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.659
 exchange artists exchanged 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.979
 on the other hand 'cool' 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:32.279
 and not depend 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.469
 from the civil government 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.109
 my art gallery for 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.109
 be able to choose the participating artists 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.699
 there were no injuries and the votes on whether those works of art that could 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.960
 allows but does not go 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.060
 one hundred percent the town hall square the day after 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.880
 conclude being able to sell the sun and they will be able to see 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.620
 in the circle of the arts 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.120
 in the others will be followed we go back with all of you to 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.190
 present them 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.920
 to the director of the carranque archaeological park do not count things 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.920
 very interesting cobos get 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:42.629
 na 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.900
