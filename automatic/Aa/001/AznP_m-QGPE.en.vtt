00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:09.660
 Hello Seedman 1st floor Ivitami 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.340
 There is a wireless extender to-expand wins or more in the first wire 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.230
 It serves as an extension 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.460
 A home antenna itguyo with 2 speeds are presented waengeol 300 mega bps 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.029
 There 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.649
 Do you see now itgoyo Wired Wired News 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:30.779
 That's when the power button is on, and there's usually a lottery on the rice cake. 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:35.040
 It is a small room where one big side is successful . 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.150
 If the wireless signal comes up to 2, it's probably going to be a little off the hook. 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.500
 this 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:44.640
 Because the car back to the first signal makes it back to where palms together again so 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:50.040
 Te'm doeguyo whether it be mastitis, so you better get the party jotgetjyo rate 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:55.860
 But if it's a long distance , it's hard to walk . 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.240
 When the word ends end up re-expand it in the previous point before another 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.460
 It's expanding. 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.160
 The antenna 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:08.130
 I can take off like this . 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:12.719
 This olragandago no further effort is unfolding touches 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:17.310
 And because the antenna is moving the wireless door particles 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:19.079
 Uh obstacle or something is blocked is less a religion so little sweeping 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.929
 It's nice in space 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:27.990
 There is presented a little unusual case, to connect a separate power line wire LAN 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:34.590
 The power button has no terminal I opsoseo week 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:37.280
 Here is the power supply, which provides a 220 volt power tip. 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.280
 If you wave 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:48.690
 I have a batter. 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:53.600
 I'm ready to open it. If I plug it in right now , I will not turn it on. 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.600
 4 I look to the right part mothaetneunde 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.650
 I need you to press this. 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.970
 The Press 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:11.860
 Wi-Fi is turned on, the control portion of the first light contains only ohguyo 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:15.400
 Standing lights up 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.580
 In addition, it has the required button behind the router, wired and wireless IP sharing time 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:23.380
 Keep it pressed. 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:27.490
 On the front c side or another lamp flashes, then I put my hand in it 1 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.840
 There is also pepper. Then press and release and press too long to reset. 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.030
 Be careful. 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:39.550
 If you push it and then you see it on the back side, 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:43.060
 If you look at both sides, there are four buttons and a tx button. 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:47.050
 The two requirements of the flash, then Sanding 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.990
 When you release the button, you will find it . 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.410
 I caught the signal from the router 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:57.550
 Oh, again , after catching something again, 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.840
 So if the radio range river 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.940
 If anyone says that spring is this way too , wireless extension to the end 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.760
 If you do this 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:13.080
 What space is expanding from its expansion . 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.020
 Again, so what if the fish Configuration 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:21.330
 If the Ahno-chan is destroyed by 50,000 , 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:24.740
 Now, the speed is measured, so the status of the router is bad. 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.740
 Toktok allowed me to symbolize 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.200
 It 's not an exhibition now 3 downloads Shang 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.200
 Sometimes I rate it. 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:43.000
 4 This book is like mugwort now 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:47.470
 Now about 35 penalty rounds for the penalty type 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.890
 This is connected, so it's falling again this year on the street. 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.510
 Because this is connected now, I pull it out again here, 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.120
 It's just like there's a little bit more of you now . 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.470
 If the 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.909
 The control room here also that several companies will be aired this is not among domestic banks 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.200
 If you put several of these things together, it will expand continuously. 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.700
 It pops out. 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:17.180
 In order not to do this, the wired / 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:21.650
 I connected this again with the air again , 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:28.370
 Wicheon connections are touched by a long but if you loser radio coverage so 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:31.370
 This objective can tell there or something just a little eojjat refurbished plugging extension 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.730
 I can expand it more easily because I have to do it. 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.030
 If the wired line is available, you can connect it to the wired line. 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:42.140
 And another interesting thing is that 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:46.940
 It acts as a wireless LAN card so the laptop is still dementia 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.620
 Here are four notebooks If my antique notebook is another question here is LAN 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.420
 Twist the line 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:58.040
 It's easy. If it's a game, it's going to be plugged in again . 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.970
 I 'll like it. Plug it in. If you plug it in, it's a wireless card. 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.100
 So if 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:06.200
 If the notebook has a wireless LAN card control performance it is poor Every now and then it's so yet 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.260
 The castle will go up from the max. 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.260
 That way, you can stand for expansion .
