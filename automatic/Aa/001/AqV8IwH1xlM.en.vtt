00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
so anyway the cool thing about the mace

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.850 
so anyway the cool thing about the mace
is<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.509> although<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.900> has<00:01:37.049> an<00:01:37.170> enchant<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
is that although it has an enchant on it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.380 
is that although it has an enchant on it
already<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.520> actually<00:01:38.670> enchant<00:01:39.240> it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
already you can actually enchant it

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.380 
already you can actually enchant it
again<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.070> will<00:01:41.280> keep<00:01:41.490> its<00:01:41.820> previous

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
again and it will keep its previous

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.359 
again and it will keep its previous
enchant<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.140> previous<00:01:43.530> enchant<00:01:43.920> being<00:01:44.159> that

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
enchant the previous enchant being that

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.670 
enchant the previous enchant being that
it<00:01:44.460> does<00:01:44.579> more<00:01:44.729> damage<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.210> workers<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.960> yeah<00:01:46.649> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
it does more damage to workers so yeah I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.249 
it does more damage to workers so yeah I
guess<00:01:47.369> not<00:01:47.880> really<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.240> cool<00:01:48.479> anyway<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
guess not really that cool anyway the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.630 
guess not really that cool anyway the
mace<00:01:49.409> doesn't<00:01:49.740> look<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.009> great<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.460> pretty

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
