00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the greatest Search and Destroy play

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.760 
the greatest Search and Destroy play
here<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.329> one<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.780> more<00:01:01.050> forgiving<00:01:01.649> and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
here so this one is more forgiving and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.529 
here so this one is more forgiving and
it<00:01:01.890> adds<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.250> nice<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:02.670> twist<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.239> really

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it adds a nice little twist so I really

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.210 
it adds a nice little twist so I really
like<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.899> game<00:01:04.140> own<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.470> plays<00:01:04.650> pretty<00:01:04.949> well

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
like this game own it plays pretty well

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.940 
like this game own it plays pretty well
on<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.729> map<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.330> let's<00:01:06.780> move<00:01:06.990> into<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.439> more

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
on this map but let's move into a more

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.520 
on this map but let's move into a more
comfortable<00:01:08.310> game<00:01:09.000> type<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.570> me<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:09.990> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
comfortable game type for me and that is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.380 
comfortable game type for me and that is
domination<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.460> tell<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.760> what<00:01:11.909> though<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.270> do

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
domination I tell you what though I do

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.380 
domination I tell you what though I do
not<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.320> map<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.950> domination<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.760> much

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
not like this map for domination as much

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.480 
not like this map for domination as much
if<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.259> going<00:01:16.680> against<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.100> good<00:01:17.250> team

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
if you get going against a good team

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.749 
if you get going against a good team
that<00:01:18.030> has<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> B<00:01:18.780> side<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.920> extremely

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
that has the a B side it is extremely

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.390 
that has the a B side it is extremely
hard<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.659> unprivate<00:01:22.290> em<00:01:22.650> from<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.130> side<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
hard to unprivate em from that side and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.980 
hard to unprivate em from that side and
I<00:01:23.580> guess<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:23.909> you're<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.180> against<00:01:24.479> any<00:01:24.750> good

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
I guess if you're going against any good

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.780 
I guess if you're going against any good
team<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.530> playing<00:01:25.560> domination<00:01:26.340> it's

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
team that is playing domination it's

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.819 
team that is playing domination it's
going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.180> really<00:01:27.420> hard<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.170> found<00:01:28.619> you

just<00:01:37.229> completely<00:01:37.920> dominated<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> other<00:01:39.119> team

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
just completely dominated the other team

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.510 
just completely dominated the other team
I<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.810> cannot<00:01:40.110> find<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.470> good<00:01:40.740> route<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.340> get

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
I just cannot find a good route to get

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.429 
I just cannot find a good route to get
over<00:01:41.939> into<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.750> here<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.990> got<00:01:43.229> lucky

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
over into here you know here I got lucky

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.289 
over into here you know here I got lucky
because<00:01:43.920> they<00:01:44.159> started<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.790> for<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> sea

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
because they started going for the sea

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.899 
because they started going for the sea
flag<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.530> know<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.920> i<00:01:46.950> think<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.700> map

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
flag but you know so i think this map

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.550 
flag but you know so i think this map
could<00:01:48.149> use<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.630> tweaking<00:01:49.290> when<00:01:49.470> it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
could use a little tweaking when it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.230 
could use a little tweaking when it
comes<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> domination<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.610> maybe<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.970> just

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
comes to domination but maybe I just

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.730 
comes to domination but maybe I just
haven't<00:01:51.509> played<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.930> enough<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.619> know

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
haven't played it enough for you know

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.190 
haven't played it enough for you know
got<00:01:52.950> enough<00:01:53.189> experience<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.119> now<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> will

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
got enough experience on it now I will

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.350 
got enough experience on it now I will
say<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.610> more<00:01:56.790> easier

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
say this this is one of the more easier

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.450 
say this this is one of the more easier
maps<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:57.990> accustomed<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.920> get<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> good

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
maps to get accustomed to and get a good

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.639 
maps to get accustomed to and get a good
feel<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> map<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.110> how<00:02:01.229> its<00:02:01.409> laid<00:02:01.590> out

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
feel for the map and how its laid out

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.260 
feel for the map and how its laid out
you<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:01.979> basically<00:02:02.369> there's<00:02:02.670> two<00:02:03.000> sides

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
you know basically there's two sides

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.480 
you know basically there's two sides
with<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> ravine<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.469> middle<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.280> one

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
with a ravine in the middle on the one

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.459 
with a ravine in the middle on the one
side<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.180> church<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.990> don't<00:02:07.200> see<00:02:07.439> a

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
side is the church and I don't see a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.499 
side is the church and I don't see a
whole<00:02:07.590> lot<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.250> action<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.910> map<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.390> know

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
whole lot of action in that map you know

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.850 
whole lot of action in that map you know
a<00:02:09.690> lot<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.899> times<00:02:10.140> people<00:02:10.410> are<00:02:10.590> going<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.770> be

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
a lot of times people are going to be

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.800 
a lot of times people are going to be
sitting<00:02:11.099> up<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.459> they're<00:02:11.610> sniping<00:02:12.420> from<00:02:12.450> that

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
sitting up and they're sniping from that

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.000 
sitting up and they're sniping from that
side<00:02:13.110> but

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
side but

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.070 
side but
I<00:02:14.069> think<00:02:14.370> most<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.060> action<00:02:15.209> happens<00:02:15.870> on

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
I think most of the action happens on

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.440 
I think most of the action happens on
this<00:02:16.290> other<00:02:16.530> side<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.489> was<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.909> B<00:02:18.090> flag

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
this other side and I was on the B flag

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.660 
this other side and I was on the B flag
that's<00:02:18.810> above<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.379> cafe<00:02:19.799> or<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.189> bar<00:02:20.430> and

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
that's above the cafe or the bar and

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.940 
that's above the cafe or the bar and
then<00:02:21.090> over<00:02:21.510> here<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:22.200> side<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.890> is

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
then over here on this side this is

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.920 
then over here on this side this is
where<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.670> liquor<00:02:23.909> store<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.450> or<00:02:24.659> that's<00:02:24.810> what

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
where the liquor store is or that's what

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.089 
where the liquor store is or that's what
I<00:02:24.989> call<00:02:25.049> it<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.290> think<00:02:25.379> it's<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.620> liquor<00:02:25.890> store

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
I call it I think it's a liquor store

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.890 
I call it I think it's a liquor store
whatever<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.060> but<00:02:27.329> you<00:02:27.480> know<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.629> see<00:02:27.870> a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
whatever it is but you know you see a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.500 
whatever it is but you know you see a
lot<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.230> action<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.400> part<00:02:29.819> of<00:02:29.939> the<00:02:30.000> map<00:02:30.239> so

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
lot of action in this part of the map so

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.390 
lot of action in this part of the map so
if<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.840> want<00:02:31.019> to<00:02:31.079> get<00:02:31.170> some<00:02:31.379> kills<00:02:31.560> hang<00:02:32.250> out

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
if you want to get some kills hang out

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.890 
if you want to get some kills hang out
on<00:02:32.579> this<00:02:32.790> side<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.299> I<00:02:33.420> think<00:02:33.629> you're<00:02:33.750> going<00:02:33.840> to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
on this side and I think you're going to

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.110 
on this side and I think you're going to
be<00:02:34.019> happy<00:02:34.260> with<00:02:34.470> how<00:02:34.739> fast<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:35.400> plays<00:02:35.610> now<00:02:35.879> it

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
be happy with how fast it plays now it

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.360 
be happy with how fast it plays now it
is<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.480> larger<00:02:36.900> map<00:02:37.049> I<00:02:37.319> mean<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.620> super<00:02:38.069> big<00:02:38.220> or

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
is a larger map I mean not super big or

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.520 
is a larger map I mean not super big or
anything<00:02:38.459> like<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.819> so<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.049> little<00:02:40.379> bit

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
anything like that so it is a little bit

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.440 
anything like that so it is a little bit
slower<00:02:40.799> but<00:02:41.250> like<00:02:41.579> I<00:02:41.700> said<00:02:41.760> if<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.030> hang<00:02:42.299> out

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
slower but like I said if you hang out

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.270 
slower but like I said if you hang out
on<00:02:42.629> this<00:02:42.870> side<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.379> think<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.799> moves<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.189> little

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
on this side I think it moves a little

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.970 
on this side I think it moves a little
bit<00:02:44.459> faster<00:02:44.879> and<00:02:45.030> there's<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.209> lot<00:02:45.540> of

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
bit faster and there's a lot of

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.770 
bit faster and there's a lot of
passageways<00:02:46.980> or<00:02:47.370> close<00:02:47.790> encounter<00:02:48.329> areas

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
passageways or close encounter areas

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.210 
passageways or close encounter areas
that<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.440> know<00:02:49.590> it's<00:02:49.769> going<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.980> help<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.159> out

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
that you know it's going to help you out

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.580 
that you know it's going to help you out
now<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.489> think<00:02:50.609> this<00:02:50.879> is<00:02:50.940> an<00:02:51.269> AR<00:02:51.840> map<00:02:52.109> that's

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
now I think this is an AR map that's

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.349 
now I think this is an AR map that's
what<00:02:52.799> I<00:02:52.829> would<00:02:52.920> run<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.639> i<00:02:53.730> do<00:02:53.790> see<00:02:54.060> people

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
what I would run on it i do see people

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.789 
what I would run on it i do see people
sniping<00:02:54.810> on<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.079> and<00:02:55.290> i<00:02:55.379> think<00:02:55.409> there<00:02:55.680> are<00:02:55.769> a

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
sniping on it and i think there are a

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.699 
sniping on it and i think there are a
lot<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.950> good<00:02:56.040> places<00:02:56.340> for<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:57.079> but<00:02:58.079> mostly<00:02:58.470> a

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
lot of good places for that but mostly a

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.129 
lot of good places for that but mostly a
our<00:02:59.040> engagements<00:02:59.970> at<00:03:00.329> least<00:03:00.629> that's<00:03:00.870> what's

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
our engagements at least that's what's

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.140 
our engagements at least that's what's
feeling<00:03:01.590> pretty<00:03:01.769> comfortable<00:03:02.159> to<00:03:02.700> me<00:03:02.849> i<00:03:02.879> guess

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
feeling pretty comfortable to me i guess

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.699 
feeling pretty comfortable to me i guess
if<00:03:03.359> you<00:03:03.569> are<00:03:03.780> running<00:03:03.989> around<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.590> these

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
if you are running around in these

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.199 
if you are running around in these
buildings<00:03:04.980> then<00:03:05.579> you<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.819> run<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.090> with<00:03:06.180> a

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
buildings then you can run it with a

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.149 
buildings then you can run it with a
shotgun<00:03:06.510> or<00:03:06.720> an<00:03:07.019> SMG<00:03:07.379> but<00:03:07.799> i<00:03:07.829> think<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.069> have

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
shotgun or an SMG but i think you have

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.220 
shotgun or an SMG but i think you have
to<00:03:08.310> make<00:03:08.430> some<00:03:08.609> long<00:03:08.879> lines<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.450> sight<00:03:09.629> shots

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
to make some long lines of sight shots

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.559 
to make some long lines of sight shots
sometimes<00:03:10.560> where<00:03:11.340> an<00:03:11.459> AR<00:03:11.879> is<00:03:12.090> really<00:03:12.389> going<00:03:12.510> to

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
sometimes where an AR is really going to

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.910 
sometimes where an AR is really going to
come<00:03:12.780> in<00:03:12.900> handy<00:03:13.049> like<00:03:13.290> shooting<00:03:13.560> across<00:03:13.709> the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
come in handy like shooting across the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.949 
come in handy like shooting across the
map<00:03:14.099> right<00:03:14.310> there<00:03:14.609> now<00:03:15.389> as<00:03:15.659> far<00:03:15.900> as

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
map right there now as far as

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.539 
map right there now as far as
killstreaks<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.739> know<00:03:16.859> of<00:03:16.980> course<00:03:17.129> depending

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
killstreaks you know of course depending

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.069 
killstreaks you know of course depending
on<00:03:17.700> which<00:03:17.879> game<00:03:18.209> mode<00:03:18.419> you're<00:03:18.599> playing<00:03:18.840> your

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
on which game mode you're playing your

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.629 
on which game mode you're playing your
ear<00:03:19.290> streaks<00:03:19.650> are<00:03:19.799> going<00:03:19.919> to<00:03:19.980> do<00:03:20.160> fairly<00:03:20.489> well

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
ear streaks are going to do fairly well

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.759 
ear streaks are going to do fairly well
on<00:03:20.879> this<00:03:21.209> map<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.750> know<00:03:21.870> i'm<00:03:22.049> using<00:03:22.500> the

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
on this map you know i'm using the

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.550 
on this map you know i'm using the
Trinity<00:03:23.310> rockets<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.230> Griffin<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.500> the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
Trinity rockets and the Griffin and the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.559 
Trinity rockets and the Griffin and the
helo<00:03:25.919> pilot<00:03:26.310> all<00:03:26.489> those<00:03:26.819> were<00:03:27.030> doing<00:03:27.329> pretty

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
helo pilot all those were doing pretty

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.689 
helo pilot all those were doing pretty
well<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.840> kind<00:03:28.199> of<00:03:28.319> switched<00:03:28.650> out<00:03:28.919> the<00:03:28.949> Griffin

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
well I kind of switched out the Griffin

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.210 
well I kind of switched out the Griffin
for<00:03:30.359> an<00:03:30.599> attack<00:03:30.959> helicopter<00:03:31.169> because<00:03:31.829> I<00:03:32.040> just

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
for an attack helicopter because I just

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.800 
for an attack helicopter because I just
wanted<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.519> focus<00:03:32.699> around<00:03:32.970> moving<00:03:33.329> around<00:03:33.629> the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
wanted to focus around moving around the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.479 
wanted to focus around moving around the
map<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:34.049> little<00:03:34.379> bit<00:03:34.500> more<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.069> think<00:03:35.190> those

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
map a little bit more so I think those

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.069 
map a little bit more so I think those
are<00:03:35.549> going<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.849> work<00:03:36.060> really<00:03:36.299> well<00:03:36.449> for<00:03:36.629> you<00:03:36.870> I

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
are going to work really well for you I

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.869 
are going to work really well for you I
had<00:03:37.349> a<00:03:37.379> sentry<00:03:37.769> gun<00:03:37.949> up<00:03:38.160> on<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.400> beef<00:03:38.609> flag

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
had a sentry gun up on the beef flag

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.309 
had a sentry gun up on the beef flag
that<00:03:39.090> was<00:03:39.329> holding<00:03:39.690> some<00:03:39.840> people<00:03:40.109> in<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
that was holding some people in the

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.379 
that was holding some people in the
church<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.799> doing<00:03:41.069> well<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.760> there<00:03:42.030> are<00:03:42.060> some

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
church and doing well so there are some

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.539 
church and doing well so there are some
nice<00:03:42.599> places<00:03:42.629> for<00:03:43.379> sentry<00:03:43.739> guns<00:03:43.919> but<00:03:44.129> this<00:03:44.340> is

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
nice places for sentry guns but this is

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.740 
nice places for sentry guns but this is
the<00:03:44.730> church<00:03:44.910> side<00:03:45.150> there<00:03:45.419> is<00:03:45.449> some

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
the church side there is some

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.900 
the church side there is some
interactive<00:03:46.379> pneus<00:03:46.620> over<00:03:47.040> on<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.400> side<00:03:47.459> you

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
interactive pneus over on this side you

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.420 
interactive pneus over on this side you
can<00:03:48.599> create<00:03:48.900> this<00:03:49.139> doorway<00:03:49.470> right<00:03:49.859> here<00:03:49.919> and

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
can create this doorway right here and

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.920 
can create this doorway right here and
take<00:03:50.699> that<00:03:50.849> out<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.239> will<00:03:51.359> give<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.599> another

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
take that out that will give you another

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.770 
take that out that will give you another
route<00:03:52.319> out<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.949> this<00:03:53.010> building<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:53.970> think

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
route out of this building I think

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.960 
route out of this building I think
there's<00:03:54.930> another<00:03:55.349> interactive<00:03:56.069> part<00:03:56.340> over<00:03:56.790> on

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
there's another interactive part over on

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.399 
there's another interactive part over on
the<00:03:57.120> other<00:03:57.150> side<00:03:57.419> of<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.780> map<00:03:57.989> where<00:03:58.169> you<00:03:58.260> can

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
the other side of the map where you can

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.869 
the other side of the map where you can
take<00:03:58.590> down<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.829> window<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.459> there's<00:03:59.639> little

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
take down a window so there's little

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.460 
take down a window so there's little
things<00:04:00.060> like<00:04:00.299> that<00:04:00.359> nothing<00:04:00.720> major<00:04:01.139> that<00:04:01.440> I

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
things like that nothing major that I

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.530 
things like that nothing major that I
found<00:04:01.889> as<00:04:02.159> of<00:04:02.699> yet<00:04:02.909> if<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.150> guys<00:04:03.299> know

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
found as of yet if you guys know

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.330 
found as of yet if you guys know
anything<00:04:03.959> make<00:04:04.440> sure<00:04:04.470> you<00:04:04.709> leave<00:04:04.980> them<00:04:05.099> for<00:04:05.280> me

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
anything make sure you leave them for me

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.699 
anything make sure you leave them for me
but<00:04:06.269> this<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.840> other<00:04:06.959> side<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.500> map

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
but this is the other side of the map

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.680 
but this is the other side of the map
the<00:04:07.949> bridge<00:04:08.310> is<00:04:08.579> in<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:09.000> middle<00:04:09.269> I<00:04:09.389> would

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
the bridge is in the middle I would

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.809 
the bridge is in the middle I would
recommend<00:04:09.989> staying<00:04:10.500> off<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.829> bridge<00:04:11.340> or<00:04:11.639> just

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
recommend staying off the bridge or just

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.789 
recommend staying off the bridge or just
being<00:04:12.060> very<00:04:12.090> careful<00:04:12.840> as<00:04:12.989> you<00:04:13.199> approach<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:13.530> a

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
being very careful as you approach it a

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.860 
being very careful as you approach it a
lot<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.459> people<00:04:14.579> like<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:14.849> snipe<00:04:15.209> down<00:04:15.449> it<00:04:15.629> plus

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
lot of people like to snipe down it plus

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.629 
lot of people like to snipe down it plus
you<00:04:15.989> have<00:04:16.109> people<00:04:16.440> on<00:04:16.590> top<00:04:16.829> of<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.039> bar<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.519> my

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
you have people on top of the bar to my

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.550 
you have people on top of the bar to my
left<00:04:17.849> sniping<00:04:18.419> down<00:04:18.599> it<00:04:18.780> there<00:04:19.199> are<00:04:19.289> a<00:04:19.320> lot<00:04:19.530> of

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
left sniping down it there are a lot of

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.439 
left sniping down it there are a lot of
areas<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.400> just<00:04:20.609> becomes<00:04:20.849> really<00:04:21.180> deadly

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
areas and it just becomes really deadly

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.089 
areas and it just becomes really deadly
so<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.840> wouldn't<00:04:22.289> recommend<00:04:22.530> doing<00:04:22.680> what<00:04:23.010> I'm

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
so I wouldn't recommend doing what I'm

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.040 
so I wouldn't recommend doing what I'm
doing<00:04:23.159> right<00:04:23.700> now<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.090> know<00:04:24.360> use<00:04:24.570> one<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:24.870> the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
doing right now you know use one of the

know if that has to do with the nuke or

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.900 
know if that has to do with the nuke or
maybe<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.590> new<00:05:34.770> comes<00:05:35.100> down<00:05:35.340> in<00:05:35.550> the<00:05:35.669> middle

of map you know I don't know I have to

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.900 
of map you know I don't know I have to
do<00:05:37.560> some<00:05:37.770> more<00:05:37.860> checking<00:05:37.919> on<00:05:38.460> that<00:05:38.610> if<00:05:38.760> you

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
do some more checking on that if you

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.970 
do some more checking on that if you
guys<00:05:39.060> know<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.510> answer<00:05:39.810> to<00:05:39.960> that<00:05:39.990> let<00:05:40.740> me<00:05:40.860> know

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
guys know the answer to that let me know

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.640 
guys know the answer to that let me know
but<00:05:41.190> it<00:05:41.310> seems<00:05:41.550> pretty<00:05:41.910> uneventful<00:05:42.330> if<00:05:43.290> you<00:05:43.440> do

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650
