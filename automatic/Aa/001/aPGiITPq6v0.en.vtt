they really should have hung on to

they really should have hung on to
of<00:03:46.719> course<00:03:47.019> it's<00:03:47.260> going<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:47.890> be<00:03:47.980> difficult<00:03:48.159> to

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
of course it's going to be difficult to

of course it's going to be difficult to

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
complicated business and system but I

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.860 
complicated business and system but I
think<00:03:54.939> that<00:03:55.120> there<00:03:55.390> should<00:03:55.569> be<00:03:55.659> some

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
think that there should be some

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.020 
think that there should be some
straightforward<00:03:56.530> priorities<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.700> OC

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
straightforward priorities that the OC

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.539 
straightforward priorities that the OC
transpo<00:03:58.480> should<00:03:58.780> be<00:03:58.870> focusing<00:03:59.290> on<00:03:59.469> being<00:04:00.370> on

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
transpo should be focusing on being on

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.899 
transpo should be focusing on being on
time<00:04:00.810> announcing<00:04:01.810> stops<00:04:02.109> and<00:04:02.909> customer

time announcing stops and customer

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.440 
time announcing stops and customer
