00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.820
 hello and welcome wrecks 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.679
 Of course we want the flex too 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.690
 undergo a short benchmark test 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.789
 and that's why we look in this video 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.800
 as first in the quadrant standard where 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.140
 nobody does benchmark against the google 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.210
 nexus five that he also made by lg 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.010
 will suggest how to do the usual 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.480
 I obviously just now both new 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.429
 we started up at both 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.050
 no running applications 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.579
 I'll show you that again fast 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.110
 so that you see it here so the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.920
 So conditions are really pretty 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.870
 identical 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.670
 I would say we start directly with 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.040
 the quadrant standard benchmark throughout 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.270
 freshly installed on the g flex too 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.860
 on the nexus 5 he is natural 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.750
 installed and I would say so 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.700
 click here directly on country ful 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.550
 benchmark and then we'll look at the end 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.980
 the higher value spits out here 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.840
 you 're also good at lg flex 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.239
 the oled display of course the better 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.460
 black has value as the nexus 5 for it 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.590
 has the better knows me would be 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.329
 very similar hardware 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.739
 not only both made by lg but 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.650
 they both have the qualcomm 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.090
 snapdragon 800 it looks like the nexus 5 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.220
 with 2 2 ghz at lg flex with 2.3 ghz 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.619
 kern so that's ever a heating value 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.119
 who perhaps lets see through 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.830
 that deep, it may have been one 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.540
 has slightly higher benchmarks chur 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.409
 otherwise with both two gigabytes 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.240
 random access memory 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.950
 I also think you can in this video 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.750
 the two technically correct times 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.880
 really good compare 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.990
 You see , here's 6 inches here 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.540
 we have 5 inches 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.350
 it's a huge one 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.369
 size difference if the two so 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.930
 lie next to each other 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.520
 they were finished pretty much at the same time 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.860
 I would say look at once 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.329
 what the two managed to do that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:50.159
 lg flex has 20,300 29 points 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.140
 brought and the nexus 5 has 7675 points 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.280
 it is so I have five next time 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.930
 Of course, the current is the firmware 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.740
 version installed speak to me already 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:03.900
 android 4.4 point 2 when lg flex have 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.330
 we still android 4.2.2010 my opinion 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.759
 not at all on it 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.590
 has been adjusted so on android 4.4 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.330
 That's why kitkat is still there 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.890
 This problem-we say now that times 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.930
 the next five just will not work 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.580
 Spitting out as high a value as it does 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.720
 actually could with this processor 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.160
 because as I said we have similar 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.320
 hardware should actually too 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.900
 similarly high values create so much so 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.190
 to the quadrant standard and how 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.200
 We promised to see each other 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.390
 the ducks benchmark of course at 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.130
 Both the latest version and me 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.710
 we would say click here directly 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.400
 on test and look what the two are 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.380
 create 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.090
 yes he is the one in the tutu benchmark 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.130
 always needs a bit longer to get it 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.080
 I'll go a little further and report 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.209
 something of my first impression of the lg 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.340
 flex I have the device now so around the 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.380
 four days as my main appliances in the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.330
 So let's take a look 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.100
 because so opened now I have to say 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.750
 the display is really much better than 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.510
 I expected it when the Sun 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.950
 hd hears 6 inches so now from the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.990
 Clearly, we have a rgb 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.270
 matrix but you just want to think so 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.100
 that is in 2014 at one 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.290
 smartphone that is so expensive is something too 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.330
 but I have to say quite honestly 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.010
 the resolution is okay 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.480
 if you are not reading through mails 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.489
 or any elaborate article 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.019
 with quite a little black writing on 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.970
 white background then it all works 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.220
 definitely ok as well 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.530
 creates the rgb matrix does that yes 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.720
 his color representation is good 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.700
 I like that on amoled displays 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.640
 simple or oled displays i have to 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.140
 Saying is a political display I like 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.489
 I just like that pretty much 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.959
 which I do not like very much 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.790
 the brightness could be higher 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.670
 but that's just a problem of 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.010
 many oled displays at note 3 was that 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.360
 the first time much better I have 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.590
 hoped that you can do it here too 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.700
 but that's probably just it 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.660
 not possible with these flexible ones 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.640
 displays 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.860
 otherwise I like the display but 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.290
 as I said , relatively well 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.269
 also the device or the philosophy of 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.010
 this curved display i understand 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.290
 that is or I am already starting slowly 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.150
 to understand the whole thing because it is 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.100
 so one would like to first think that is 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.690
 nonsense what brings me the whole but 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.549
 I have to say if you are too close 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.920
 then it lays much better in 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.390
 the hand as for example a 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.730
 15-20 that yes, a 6 inch display has 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.540
 or a htc one max or not 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.420
 all are called 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.190
 this concave shape makes it easy 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.959
 very very very good 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.880
 also when calling that one would like 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.650
 Hard to believe it tastes good 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.660
 really great on the ear 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.580
 or in the face to the 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.410
 I like that pretty much, too 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.280
 pocket 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.039
 at least if you're in the front now 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.690
 pants pocket it slightly destroys this shape 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.180
 there is probably the galaxy around 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.320
 a little better but now you can 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.240
 do not have everything 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.370
 also the philosophy of the keys 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.110
 the back of the lg with the tattoo 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.520
 I really like it 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.130
 better I have for some time now no 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.110
 LG gets more but I like the flex 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.750
 I have to do it really well again 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.550
 say i could well imagine that 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.560
 the multiple manufacturers make it easy 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.820
 because you go through these beautiful thin ones 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.979
 Display countries at the time of 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.870
 allows and still I always come 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.340
 very fast my power button that 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.479
 is just with appliances this 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.190
 size class just not 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.870
 of course as I said to me 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.780
 I like the philosophy pretty well 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.789
 Of course that's a matter of taste, yes 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.169
 lg flex is already finished 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.820
 have some of my first impression 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:19.320
 We have a very, very nice here 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.639
 strong value of 36,000 167 points looks 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.770
 it is already here in the table 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.880
 the che flex is really up with it 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.630
 while the nexus 5 has it on 27.800 20 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.060
 brought points 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.830
 not a bad value then you realize 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.570
 also just that in tutow benchmark 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.150
 much better already optimized for 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.940
 android 4.4 kicker without us there 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.840
 significantly more representative or 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.280
 get more meaningful values 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.599
 here at this graphic you can see too 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.940
 again very nice the difference 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.090
 between the very intense pole 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.840
 display and the more realistic nexus 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.310
 5 display 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.990
 yes that was it again from 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.610
 this short benchmark test and hate 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.169
 can conclusively say how 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.449
 actually all devices with the qualcomm 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.159
 snapdragon 800 also beats that 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.169
 Ship leaks in the known benchmarks 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.000
 really great but i can do it 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.169
 make each of these benchmarks videos easy 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.880
 only emphasize again and again 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.490
 Of course these are just benchmarks 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.530
 There are more important things like everyday life 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.539
 performance and how dusty flex is there 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.980
 beats the climbing course as always 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.900
 in the final review that also in the 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.280
 It should be possible to go online in this day 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.900
 I hope, as always, it has you 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.790
 Of course I like to thank you for that 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.600
 watch and say ' see you' 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.600
 next time
