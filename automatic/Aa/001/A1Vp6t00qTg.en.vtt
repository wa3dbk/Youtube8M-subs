00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
craftsmen from Morocco were brought here

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.270 
craftsmen from Morocco were brought here
and<00:02:27.450> they<00:02:27.780> stayed<00:02:28.020> in<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.320> workspace<00:02:28.739> for

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
two years before they finished Wow all

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.740 
two years before they finished Wow all
this<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.830> hand<00:02:32.520> done<00:02:32.790> every<00:02:33.209> piece<00:02:33.450> is

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
this is hand done every piece is

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.050 
this is hand done every piece is
different<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:34.650> amazing<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.250> see<00:02:35.760> all

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
different it's just amazing to see all

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.820 
different it's just amazing to see all
these<00:02:36.540> little<00:02:36.720> details<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.500> think<00:02:37.680> about

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
these little details and you think about

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.030 
these little details and you think about
how<00:02:38.160> long<00:02:38.519> it<00:02:38.580> took<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.300> do<00:02:39.570> with<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.350> file<00:02:40.769> is

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
how long it took to do with a file is

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.520 
how long it took to do with a file is
individual<00:02:42.000> pieces<00:02:42.300> but<00:02:42.810> then<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.170> think<00:02:43.380> how

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
individual pieces but then you think how

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.750 
individual pieces but then you think how
long<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.160> took<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.730> do<00:02:45.269> this<00:02:45.450> entire<00:02:46.250> space<00:02:47.250> all

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
long it took to do this entire space all

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.320 
long it took to do this entire space all
the<00:02:48.600> way<00:02:48.680> around<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.100> that<00:02:51.290> is<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.350> lot<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.830> time

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
the way around and that is a lot of time

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.980 
the way around and that is a lot of time
but<00:02:54.410> beautifully<00:02:55.410> done

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
but beautifully done

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.660 
but beautifully done
these<00:02:57.990> walls<00:02:58.349> are<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.740> bit<00:02:58.980> different<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.459> these

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
these walls are a bit different to these

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.070 
these walls are a bit different to these
mosaics<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.239> these<00:03:00.510> are<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.020> a

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
mosaics and these are this is a

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.330 
mosaics and these are this is a
different<00:03:01.380> process<00:03:01.530> they're<00:03:01.950> all<00:03:02.040> made<00:03:02.220> by

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
different process they're all made by

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.220 
different process they're all made by
hand<00:03:02.370> right<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.480> each<00:03:03.660> one<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:03.900> slightly

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
hand right so each one is slightly

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.860 
hand right so each one is slightly
different<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.040> they're<00:03:05.610> put<00:03:05.819> in<00:03:05.910> place<00:03:06.180> by<00:03:06.510> a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
different and they're put in place by a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.020 
different and they're put in place by a
single<00:03:07.230> artist<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.650> does<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.040> section<00:03:08.489> so

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
single artist that does that section so

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.479 
single artist that does that section so
this<00:03:09.360> whole<00:03:09.599> mosaic<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.440> one<00:03:10.920> individual

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
this whole mosaic is one individual

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.070 
this whole mosaic is one individual
piece<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.150> done<00:03:12.420> when<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.870> on<00:03:13.050> the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
piece that is done when it's on the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.809 
piece that is done when it's on the
gross<00:03:13.350> part<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.860> then<00:03:14.010> they<00:03:14.160> stand<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.670> up

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
gross part and then they stand it up

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.059 
gross part and then they stand it up
it's<00:03:15.420> essentially<00:03:15.959> like<00:03:16.080> tiling<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:16.890> lot

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
it's essentially like tiling just a lot

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.890 
it's essentially like tiling just a lot
more<00:03:17.280> difficult<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.480> room<00:03:18.720> was

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
more difficult so the room was

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.750 
more difficult so the room was
essentially<00:03:19.500> modeled<00:03:20.100> after<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.550> Taj<00:03:20.730> Mahal

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
essentially modeled after the Taj Mahal

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.479 
essentially modeled after the Taj Mahal
but<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.780> has<00:03:21.900> more<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.380> Moroccan<00:03:22.650> feel<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.310> it

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
but it has more of a Moroccan feel to it

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.940 
but it has more of a Moroccan feel to it
yeah<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:24.239> combined<00:03:24.720> love<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.110> has<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.769> little

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
yeah it combined love it has a little

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.520 
yeah it combined love it has a little
bit<00:03:26.069> of<00:03:26.130> Turkish<00:03:26.519> influence<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.810> has<00:03:27.959> Arab

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
bit of Turkish influence and it has Arab

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.520 
bit of Turkish influence and it has Arab
influence<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.940> also<00:03:30.060> has<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.900> Hindu

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
influence and it also has the Hindu

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.350 
influence and it also has the Hindu
influence<00:03:31.950> as<00:03:32.069> well<00:03:32.100> it's<00:03:32.700> amazing<00:03:33.209> because

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
influence as well it's amazing because
