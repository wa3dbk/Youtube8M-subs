00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.720
 I cut all the materials in the form of tiny cubes of similar size. 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.900
 I put it in boiling drinking water 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.680
 I cook on the wire for about 30 minutes until all the steamy ingredients are soft. 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.400
 Then transfer the water into the wire I've boiled, 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.180
 I'm going through the blender. 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.360
 Hi there, there's such a thing 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.320
 We've got a word about hitting two birds with 1 stone. 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.640
 Now, I want to give you the recipe for the meat-cut mashed potatoes that will hit 8-10 birds with 1 stone. 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.460
 After he actually started eating the flesh, 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.400
 After starting to give the meat, the doctor can do it from the 8th month. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.840
 I bought little cubed lamb meat today. 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.040
 But with this chicken, fish, 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.380
 with turkey 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.180
 you can keep out, mixed with all vegetables. 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.460
 What do we have? 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.620
 Apple got very little again. 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.860
 These are all very small pieces. 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 Very small piece of onion. 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.200
 1 small potatoes, ½ carrots, fresh zucchini, about 40-50 grams of lamb, 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.940
 1 dried apricot, 1 garlic, fresh thyme, some cumin and butter to add again. 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:37.040
 What we're going to do is we're gonna make some steam here because we're gonna steer. 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 That's how I put my wire in it. 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.680
 I put all my stuff. 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.820
 First meat to cook for so long as I'm putting it. 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.020
 You can cut the tiny little meat or cut it yourself. 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.680
 But when you say I'm going to cook for my baby when you go to town already 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.660
 they really care. 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.020
 It's still the best thing to get from the butcher. 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.400
 I'm gonna put carrots on them, they're cooking too hard. 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.240
 I had them all sliced ​​up very small, I cooked more beautiful and I had the same size as I could. 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.040
 Potato. 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.220
 Of course, the rate we're making right now is too much for one meal. 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.480
 But you can use 2 separate meals for the same day and you can keep it for the next day. 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.980
 I'il put an apple. 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.240
 You may not put the apple, but it has a fruity fruit 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.540
 it is something that is also in our Ottoman Cuisine. 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.020
 I put the onion, 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.380
 you don't put it on me, but you know me now watched more than one of my videos 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.980
 Those of you who know that I love the onion garlic. 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.040
 Let's put the garlic in the name. 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.120
 Onion, garlic, black pepper 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.020
 I once saw Ayşe's doctor's office. 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.840
 Mid-winter, to strengthen immunity 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.280
 in the diet to be watched. 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.300
 And you're really fed 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.020
 Onion, garlic, black pepper, he had a news add. 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.600
 there was writing on the wall of the practice, 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.820
 never forget. 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.340
 One apricot. 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.840
 Again he 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.660
 taste, taste 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.640
 Well worth it. 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.120
 Ayse, for example, does not like apricots, does not eat dry fruits, she loves dry berries. 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.320
 That's why when I grow older, the dried fruits alone 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:10.080
 I don't like to eat. 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.160
 Of course, some cumin, 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.140
 this meat is also worthy of 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.800
 and I also leave thyme like this 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.880
 I'm going to crush her after she 's gonna smell it. 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.780
 But it smells so good already. 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.460
 Let's close up, there's at least 20-25 minutes. 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.900
 Let me gather the kitchen, 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.340
 maybe I can make myself a coffee. 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.360
 Keep the butter here. 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
 Yeah, it took about 25 minutes. 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.380
 I waited for both meat and carrots to cook. 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.480
 Oh, it smells great. 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.920
 Cumin smells very good, thyme smells very good. 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.580
 I'm gonna take these thyme branches, 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.960
 I will never confuse them with puree. 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.520
 She already gave the taste. 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.260
 Let's close the bottom. 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.480
 He went through a couple of things. 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.700
 I'm already going through the blender because it's not enough to crush it with a fork. 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.260
 Maybe it'il be harder, but if you want 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.660
 or if your child is ready, 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.520
 You can also cut a small piece of meat with a fork or a knife. 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.000
 I'm taking this off now. 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.560
 There was very little water at the bottom, and it was all the meat, 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.320
 Carrot also took the color of the carrot. 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.500
 I'm gonna pour the mixture there. 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.360
 If it comes a little watery, it's more soup, and we'il see. 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.820
 I wanted to evaluate the remaining water. 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.960
 It's more comfortable to do anything inside. 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.780
 Stop right there, 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.880
 I'm getting the mix. 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.380
 Yeah, that's a good soup. 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.800
 I want to put a little butter in it. 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.300
 Now that you get good taste 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.160
 very few teaspoons put up. 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.000
 It was so beautiful, 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.960
 yes it was great. 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.040
 But it was my intention to have the consistency of the soup. 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.300
 I got a little too much water. 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.940
 Still the same taste. 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.220
 Like I said, I don't have it, but I always respected my daughter. 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.340
 Such bad combinations to him 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.540
 never tried 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.140
 And I always said why I would eat him if I can not eat 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.720
 So all the vegetables, nuts and meat in it are very compatible with each other, spices. 

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.560
 I think it's food. 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.740
 All of our videos are on our youtube channel. 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.620
