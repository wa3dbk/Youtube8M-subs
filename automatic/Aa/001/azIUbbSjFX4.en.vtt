00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
stop them unfortunately this first one

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.810 
stop them unfortunately this first one
that<00:01:56.140> they<00:01:56.260> get<00:01:56.440> to<00:01:56.470> Sophia<00:01:57.400> is<00:01:57.490> not<00:01:57.640> quite

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
that they get to Sophia is not quite

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.240 
that they get to Sophia is not quite
prepared<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:58.330> take<00:01:58.570> out<00:01:58.840> which<00:01:59.440> means<00:01:59.710> she's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
prepared to take out which means she's

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.560 
prepared to take out which means she's
probably<00:02:00.460> gonna<00:02:00.610> get<00:02:00.790> disabled<00:02:01.270> here<00:02:01.420> in<00:02:01.480> a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
probably gonna get disabled here in a

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.610 
probably gonna get disabled here in a
second<00:02:01.900> I<00:02:02.020> think

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
second I think

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.430 
second I think
so<00:02:04.300> luckily<00:02:05.300> we<00:02:05.450> have<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.570> field<00:02:05.810> medic<00:02:05.990> with<00:02:06.230> us

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
so luckily we have a field medic with us

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.600 
so luckily we have a field medic with us
now<00:02:06.890> he<00:02:06.950> could<00:02:07.160> have<00:02:07.250> been<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.370> field

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
now he could have been a field

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.890 
now he could have been a field
technician<00:02:08.180> which<00:02:08.360> means<00:02:08.540> he<00:02:08.660> could<00:02:08.780> have

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:08.900 
technician which means he could have

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.120 
technician which means he could have
dropped<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.229> check<00:02:09.260> point<00:02:09.619> earlier<00:02:09.979> in<00:02:10.040> the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
dropped a check point earlier in the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.890 
dropped a check point earlier in the
level<00:02:10.520> so<00:02:10.850> we<00:02:10.880> could<00:02:11.060> have<00:02:11.150> actually<00:02:11.300> had<00:02:11.870> a

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
level so we could have actually had a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.480 
level so we could have actually had a
better<00:02:12.230> restart<00:02:12.710> point<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.070> case<00:02:13.220> somebody

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
better restart point in case somebody

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.830 
better restart point in case somebody
died<00:02:13.730> without<00:02:14.270> having<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.510> go<00:02:14.540> all<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.810> way

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
died without having to go all the way

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.260 
died without having to go all the way
back<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.230> beginning<00:02:15.730> now<00:02:16.730> as<00:02:16.880> he<00:02:17.000> clears

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270
