portable mobile gaming speakers however
i<00:01:48.060> would<00:01:48.720> think<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.409> most<00:01:49.860> modern<00:01:50.310> laptops

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
i would think that most modern laptops

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.929 
i would think that most modern laptops
have<00:01:51.090> got<00:01:51.390> onboard<00:01:51.659> sound<00:01:52.290> which<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.880> not

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
have got onboard sound which is if not

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.830 
have got onboard sound which is if not
as<00:01:54.630> good<00:01:55.259> i<00:01:55.500> would<00:01:55.770> say<00:01:55.950> probably<00:01:55.979> at<00:01:56.640> least

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
as good i would say probably at least

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.859 
as good i would say probably at least
sixty<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.990> seventy<00:01:58.170> percent<00:01:58.649> as<00:01:59.070> good<00:01:59.810> if<00:02:00.810> not

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
sixty to seventy percent as good if not

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.130 
sixty to seventy percent as good if not
more<00:02:01.759> in<00:02:02.759> my<00:02:02.939> opinion<00:02:03.119> these<00:02:03.420> are<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.840> not

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
more in my opinion these are just not

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.389 
more in my opinion these are just not

reverse of my head but I've not used
them<00:02:34.380> recently<00:02:34.560> at<00:02:35.130> all<00:02:35.430> simply<00:02:36.090> because<00:02:36.209> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
them recently at all simply because the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.290 
them recently at all simply because the
sound<00:02:36.660> they<00:02:36.840> produce<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.410> terrible<00:02:38.160> in<00:02:38.970> my

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
sound they produce is terrible in my

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.900 
sound they produce is terrible in my
opinion<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:40.560> unfortunately<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.400> can't<00:02:41.670> give<00:02:41.730> it

what green LEDs etc you know normal ways

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.710 
what green LEDs etc you know normal ways
of<00:02:46.800> stuff<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.160> mean<00:02:47.489> if<00:02:47.610> you're<00:02:48.120> using<00:02:48.420> them

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
of stuff I mean if you're using them

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.020 
of stuff I mean if you're using them
maybe<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.380> your<00:02:49.410> laptop<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.100> listen<00:02:50.880> to

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
maybe on your laptop to listen to

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.590 
maybe on your laptop to listen to
YouTube<00:02:51.480> channels<00:02:52.110> such<00:02:52.980> as<00:02:53.040> web<00:02:53.880> which<00:02:54.239> for

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
YouTube channels such as web which for

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.850 
YouTube channels such as web which for
example<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.959> your<00:02:55.110> video<00:02:55.319> like<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.590> where

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
example is your video like this where

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.020 
example is your video like this where
there's<00:02:55.890> someone<00:02:56.280> talking<00:02:56.640> there<00:02:56.819> will<00:02:56.910> be

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
there's someone talking there will be

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.110 
there's someone talking there will be
more<00:02:57.209> than<00:02:57.390> adequate<00:02:57.569> but<00:02:58.530> for<00:02:58.860> music<00:02:59.400> they

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
more than adequate but for music they

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.280 
more than adequate but for music they
will<00:03:00.330> be<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:01.019> not<00:03:01.319> great<00:03:01.620> at<00:03:01.860> all<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:03.290> again

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
will be just not great at all and again

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.229 
will be just not great at all and again
when<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.709> comes<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.100> gaming<00:03:05.370> as<00:03:05.790> well<00:03:05.940> they'll

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
when it comes to gaming as well they'll

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.449 
when it comes to gaming as well they'll
be<00:03:06.269> adequate<00:03:07.140> but<00:03:07.620> they're<00:03:08.069> not<00:03:08.220> going<00:03:08.370> to

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
be adequate but they're not going to

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.880 
be adequate but they're not going to
give<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.180> kind<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.110> audio<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.769> you'd

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
give you the kind of audio that you'd

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.860 
give you the kind of audio that you'd
get<00:03:11.190> by<00:03:11.370> just<00:03:11.400> slapping<00:03:12.330> on<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.480> pair<00:03:12.750> of

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
get by just slapping on a pair of

get by just slapping on a pair of
headphones<00:03:13.080> which<00:03:13.590> costs<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.010> same<00:03:14.160> pair<00:03:14.850> of

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
headphones which costs the same pair of

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.660 
headphones which costs the same pair of
headphones<00:03:15.090> will<00:03:15.750> outperform<00:03:16.290> these<00:03:16.920> by<00:03:17.640> a

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
headphones will outperform these by a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.099 
headphones will outperform these by a
long<00:03:17.910> way<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.269> obviously<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.690> appreciate

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
long way and obviously I appreciate

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.150 
long way and obviously I appreciate
