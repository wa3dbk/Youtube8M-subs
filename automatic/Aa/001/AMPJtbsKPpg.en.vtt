00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
the fan it blows towards this part if

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.039 
the fan it blows towards this part if
you're<00:03:47.609> going<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.000> have<00:03:48.239> it<00:03:48.450> blowing<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:48.930> out

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
you're going to have it blowing it out

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.289 
you're going to have it blowing it out
of<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.859> case<00:03:50.069> towards<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.090> top<00:03:52.910> this<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.090> how

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
of the case towards the top this is how

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.270 
of the case towards the top this is how
mine<00:03:55.200> came<00:03:55.879> I'll<00:03:56.879> have<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.470> remove<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.739> if<00:03:58.950> I

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
mine came I'll have to remove it if I

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.940 
mine came I'll have to remove it if I
want<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.609> see<00:03:59.849> that<00:04:01.819> like<00:04:02.819> that<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.709> want

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
want to see that like that and I want

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.759 
want to see that like that and I want
the<00:04:05.099> fans<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.940> want<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.389> airflow<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.810> go<00:04:07.109> up<00:04:07.379> I

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
the fans I want the airflow to go up I

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.680 
the fans I want the airflow to go up I
have<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.400> remove<00:04:08.669> the<00:04:08.910> fans<00:04:11.359> because<00:04:12.359> right

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
have to remove the fans because right

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.870 
have to remove the fans because right
now<00:04:14.959> it's<00:04:15.959> upside<00:04:16.349> down<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:17.010> me<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.400> don't<00:04:17.669> care

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
now it's upside down to me I don't care

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.759 
now it's upside down to me I don't care
I<00:04:17.940> don't<00:04:18.030> have<00:04:18.299> a<00:04:18.329> window<00:04:18.750> on<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.079> side<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.680> my

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
I don't have a window on the side of my

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.589 
I don't have a window on the side of my
case<00:04:20.039> but<00:04:20.430> if<00:04:20.699> you<00:04:20.820> have<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:20.970> window<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.419> might

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
case but if you have a window that might

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.370 
case but if you have a window that might
be<00:04:21.750> something<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.409> think<00:04:22.620> about<00:04:23.719> other<00:04:24.719> than

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
be something to think about other than

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.810 
be something to think about other than
that<00:04:26.030> so<00:04:27.030> far

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
that so far

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.730 
that so far
like<00:04:28.000> what<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.210> see<00:04:28.510> with<00:04:28.690> this<00:04:28.930> with<00:04:29.710> this

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
like what I see with this with this

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.390 
like what I see with this with this
cooler<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:33.150> as<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.630> can<00:04:34.780> see<00:04:34.930> here<00:04:35.400> the

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
cooler it the as you can see here the

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.170 
cooler it the as you can see here the
fans<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.810> have<00:04:38.140> a<00:04:38.170> chrome<00:04:38.620> finish<00:04:39.070> on<00:04:39.280> them<00:04:39.490> to

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
fans I have a chrome finish on them to

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.600 
fans I have a chrome finish on them to
match<00:04:40.510> up<00:04:40.780> with<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.400> aluminum<00:04:42.400> fins<00:04:42.730> and

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
match up with the aluminum fins and

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.480 
match up with the aluminum fins and
there<00:04:45.610> are<00:04:45.820> four<00:04:46.540> heat<00:04:47.440> pipes<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:47.980> like<00:04:48.280> the

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
there are four heat pipes I like the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.260 
there are four heat pipes I like the
direct<00:04:48.790> touch<00:04:49.090> on<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.960> heat<00:04:50.140> pipes<00:04:50.350> and<00:04:51.270> they

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
direct touch on the heat pipes and they

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.760 
direct touch on the heat pipes and they
are<00:04:52.920> thick<00:04:53.920> eight<00:04:54.550> millimeters<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:56.260> they'll

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
are thick eight millimeters so they'll

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.020 
are thick eight millimeters so they'll
transfer<00:04:57.490> a<00:04:57.670> lot<00:04:57.970> of<00:04:58.300> heat<00:04:58.600> a<00:04:58.900> nice<00:04:59.800> solid<00:05:00.160> base

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
transfer a lot of heat a nice solid base

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:13.020 
transfer a lot of heat a nice solid base
here<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:04.620> mounting<00:05:05.620> bracket<00:05:06.630> goes<00:05:11.250> up<00:05:12.250> it

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
here the mounting bracket goes up it

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.450 
here the mounting bracket goes up it
goes<00:05:13.060> in<00:05:13.480> there<00:05:13.690> that<00:05:13.900> sits<00:05:14.170> right<00:05:14.470> in<00:05:14.530> let's

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
goes in there that sits right in let's

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.520 
goes in there that sits right in let's
see<00:05:15.550> if<00:05:15.640> I<00:05:15.730> can<00:05:16.530> put<00:05:17.530> this<00:05:17.740> on<00:05:19.080> right<00:05:20.080> hand<00:05:20.290> it

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
see if I can put this on right hand it

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:38.910 
see if I can put this on right hand it
here<00:05:29.910> alright<00:05:33.780> it<00:05:34.780> sits<00:05:35.170> flush<00:05:35.620> inside<00:05:37.920> then

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
here alright it sits flush inside then

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
temperature comparisons between this and

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.250 
temperature comparisons between this and
the<00:06:13.300> stock<00:06:13.660> intel<00:06:14.700> cpu<00:06:15.700> cooler<00:06:15.940> and<00:06:16.270> just<00:06:17.140> to

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
the stock intel cpu cooler and just to

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:29.190 
the stock intel cpu cooler and just to
give<00:06:17.500> you<00:06:17.830> an<00:06:18.220> idea<00:06:20.130> here<00:06:21.130> is<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:27.720> fins<00:06:28.720> that

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:29.200 
give you an idea here is the fins that

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:37.719 
give you an idea here is the fins that
came<00:06:29.680> with<00:06:30.420> the<00:06:31.420> LGA<00:06:32.020> 775<00:06:34.320> compared<00:06:35.320> to

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:41.799 

it's<00:06:38.330> not<00:06:38.569> even<00:06:39.020> not<00:06:39.409> even<00:06:39.469> close<00:06:40.809> in

00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:41.809 
it's not even not even close in

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:49.360 
it's not even not even close in
comparison<00:06:44.949> so<00:06:47.800> we'll<00:06:48.800> see<00:06:49.039> what<00:06:49.219> the

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
comparison so we'll see what the

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.420 
comparison so we'll see what the
temperature<00:06:50.050> comparisons<00:06:51.050> are<00:06:51.259> and<00:06:51.919> like<00:06:52.249> to

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
temperature comparisons are and like to

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.369 
temperature comparisons are and like to
thank<00:06:52.639> you<00:06:52.699> for<00:06:52.879> watching<00:06:53.270> and<00:06:53.449> be<00:06:54.169> sure<00:06:54.199> to
