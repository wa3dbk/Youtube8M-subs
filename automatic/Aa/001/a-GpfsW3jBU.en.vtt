prototype<00:00:22.220> our<00:00:23.220> team<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:23.820> able<00:00:23.940> to<00:00:24.090> make<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
prototype our team was able to make a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.510 
prototype our team was able to make a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
thin plastic so instead of glass so it

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.720 
thin plastic so instead of glass so it
won't<00:00:30.840> break<00:00:30.960> even<00:00:31.380> if<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.619> dropped<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.189> we

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
won't break even if it's dropped and we

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:44.610 
won't break even if it's dropped and we
can<00:00:32.879> actually<00:00:33.059> bend<00:00:33.539> the<00:00:33.690> screen

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.720

here<00:01:11.110> with<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:12.229> bended<00:01:13.160> display<00:01:13.520> we<00:01:13.729> have

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
here with this bended display we have

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.580 
here with this bended display we have
expanded<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.540> canvas<00:01:14.960> available<00:01:15.410> for

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
expanded the canvas available for

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.859 
expanded the canvas available for
content<00:01:16.040> content<00:01:16.880> can<00:01:17.030> now<00:01:17.149> flow<00:01:17.450> along<00:01:17.720> the

content content can now flow along the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.850 
content content can now flow along the
sides<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.710> device<00:01:19.009> so<00:01:19.280> for<00:01:20.210> example<00:01:20.710> if<00:01:21.710> I

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
sides of the device so for example if I

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:37.170 
sides of the device so for example if I
receive<00:01:22.190> an<00:01:22.340> important<00:01:22.790> message

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.000 

I<00:01:37.240> can<00:01:38.050> see<00:01:38.230> it<00:01:38.320> come<00:01:38.530> through<00:01:38.800> while<00:01:38.980> the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
I can see it come through while the

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.770 
I can see it come through while the
device<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.370> flat<00:01:39.790> on<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.030> table<00:01:40.360> in<00:01:40.450> front<00:01:40.480> of

me this new form factor will really

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.450 
me this new form factor will really
begin<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.600> change<00:01:43.780> how<00:01:44.410> people<00:01:44.800> interact<00:01:45.340> with
