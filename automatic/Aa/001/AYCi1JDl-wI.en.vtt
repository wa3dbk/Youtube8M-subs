I<00:01:37.430> just<00:01:37.460> duplicate<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.210> entire<00:01:38.300> basic<00:01:38.930> guitar

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
I just duplicate the entire basic guitar

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.070 
I just duplicate the entire basic guitar
track<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.190> I<00:01:40.910> throw<00:01:41.150> on<00:01:41.240> two<00:01:41.479> separate<00:01:41.810> tones

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
track and I throw on two separate tones

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.050 
track and I throw on two separate tones
so<00:01:42.410> I<00:01:42.710> just<00:01:42.920> showed<00:01:43.040> you<00:01:43.160> my<00:01:43.280> low<00:01:43.460> tone<00:01:43.670> and

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
so I just showed you my low tone and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.760 
so I just showed you my low tone and
then<00:01:44.509> I<00:01:44.570> got<00:01:44.720> my<00:01:44.869> high<00:01:45.020> tone<00:01:45.229> over<00:01:45.500> here<00:01:47.649> so<00:01:48.649> you

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
then I got my high tone over here so you

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.990 
then I got my high tone over here so you
can<00:01:48.950> hear<00:01:49.100> that<00:01:49.130> it's<00:01:49.399> basically<00:01:49.820> the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
can hear that it's basically the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.730 
can hear that it's basically the
opposite<00:01:50.450> of<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.660> other<00:01:50.780> one<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.140> has<00:01:51.259> zero

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
opposite of the other one it has zero

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.760 
opposite of the other one it has zero
low<00:01:52.280> frequencies<00:01:52.850> at<00:01:53.000> all<00:01:53.149> it's<00:01:53.770> distorted

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
low frequencies at all it's distorted

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.180 
low frequencies at all it's distorted
I've<00:01:55.430> got<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:55.790> like<00:01:55.970> clanky<00:01:56.450> bass<00:01:56.660> tone<00:01:57.190> and

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
I've got that like clanky bass tone and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.820 
I've got that like clanky bass tone and
it's<00:01:58.460> only<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:59.119> high<00:01:59.300> end<00:01:59.630> frequencies<00:02:00.290> so

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
it's only the high end frequencies so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.730 
it's only the high end frequencies so
basically<00:02:01.700> what<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:01.910> try<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.240> do<00:02:02.509> is<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:02.990> have<00:02:03.170> the

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
basically what I try to do is I have the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.280 
basically what I try to do is I have the
one<00:02:03.890> low<00:02:04.369> bass<00:02:04.580> guitar<00:02:04.940> goes<00:02:05.570> under<00:02:05.870> my<00:02:05.990> guitar

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
one low bass guitar goes under my guitar

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.250 
one low bass guitar goes under my guitar
track<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:06.920> frequency<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.630> high<00:02:08.780> one<00:02:09.049> it

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
track in frequency and the high one it

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.199 
track in frequency and the high one it
goes<00:02:09.410> over<00:02:09.560> top<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.340> can<00:02:10.429> hear<00:02:10.760> it<00:02:10.790> in<00:02:11.120> the

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
goes over top so you can hear it in the

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:19.840 
goes over top so you can hear it in the
full<00:02:11.420> mix<00:02:11.600> such<00:02:12.140> as<00:02:12.350> this

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.010 

yeah<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.060> I'll<00:02:21.150> just<00:02:21.300> show<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.480> some<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.960> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
yeah and I'll just show you some of the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.450 
yeah and I'll just show you some of the
frequencies<00:02:22.500> right<00:02:22.650> here<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.130> for<00:02:23.370> the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
frequencies right here so for the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.670 
frequencies right here so for the
low-end<00:02:25.100> as<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.580> see<00:02:26.850> it's<00:02:27.150> extremely

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
low-end as you can see it's extremely

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.970 
low-end as you can see it's extremely
eq'd<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:29.400> basically<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:29.970> only<00:02:30.150> contains<00:02:30.980> about

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
eq'd it basically it only contains about

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.070 
eq'd it basically it only contains about
100<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.150> 200<00:02:34.220> frequency<00:02:35.660> it's<00:02:36.660> high<00:02:36.840> pass<00:02:37.050> and

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
100 to 200 frequency it's high pass and

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.120 
100 to 200 frequency it's high pass and
low<00:02:37.380> pass<00:02:37.500> at<00:02:37.920> two<00:02:38.100> fifty<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.870> sixty<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.890> again

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
low pass at two fifty and sixty so again

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.430 
low pass at two fifty and sixty so again
only<00:02:41.490> sub<00:02:41.910> bass<00:02:42.090> frequencies<00:02:42.660> in<00:02:42.840> there<00:02:43.050> and

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
only sub bass frequencies in there and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.550 
only sub bass frequencies in there and
then<00:02:44.220> on<00:02:44.640> my<00:02:44.850> high<00:02:45.060> end<00:02:45.300> bass<00:02:45.540> guitar<00:02:46.200> track

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
then on my high end bass guitar track

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.340 
then on my high end bass guitar track
it's<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.220> opposite<00:02:48.209> it's<00:02:48.540> high<00:02:48.870> pass<00:02:49.110> that

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
it's the opposite it's high pass that

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.610 
it's the opposite it's high pass that
150<00:02:50.010> has<00:02:50.730> an<00:02:50.850> extreme<00:02:51.270> cut<00:02:51.540> at<00:02:51.720> 500<00:02:52.380> which<00:02:52.590> is

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
150 has an extreme cut at 500 which is

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.130 
150 has an extreme cut at 500 which is
where<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.459> mid-range<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:54.000> my<00:02:54.150> guitar<00:02:54.480> sits<00:02:54.810> so

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
where the mid-range of my guitar sits so

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.180 
where the mid-range of my guitar sits so
I<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:55.380> get<00:02:55.530> rid<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.830> bass<00:02:55.980> there

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
I just get rid of the bass there

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.740 
I just get rid of the bass there
completely<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:56.940> doesn't<00:02:57.239> mess<00:02:57.450> with<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
completely so it doesn't mess with the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.050 
completely so it doesn't mess with the
guitars<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.410> then<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.100> boost<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.580> lot<00:02:59.790> at

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
guitars and then I boost it a lot at

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.180 
guitars and then I boost it a lot at
2000<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:00.989> sits<00:03:01.170> above<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.680> guitar<00:03:01.980> tone

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
2000 so it sits above the guitar tone

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.810 
2000 so it sits above the guitar tone
and<00:03:02.520> then<00:03:03.060> again<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:03.630> low<00:03:04.440> pass<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.830> at<00:03:04.980> 7000

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
and then again I low pass it at 7000

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.030 
and then again I low pass it at 7000
just<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.180> make<00:03:06.330> sure<00:03:06.360> it's<00:03:06.600> not<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:07.620> know<00:03:07.709> -

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
just to make sure it's not you know -

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.970 
just to make sure it's not you know -
high-pitched<00:03:08.190> or<00:03:08.640> whatever<00:03:09.830> so<00:03:10.830> yeah

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
high-pitched or whatever so yeah

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.740 
high-pitched or whatever so yeah
hopefully<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.610> makes<00:03:11.820> sense<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.450> easy

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
hopefully that makes sense really easy

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.440 
hopefully that makes sense really easy
