thought meditation was just kind of

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.330 
thought meditation was just kind of
sitting<00:04:46.270> there<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.570> thinking<00:04:46.810> what<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.830> is<00:04:48.040> is

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
sitting there and thinking what it is is

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.960 
sitting there and thinking what it is is
the<00:04:49.150> absence<00:04:49.810> of<00:04:49.990> thought<00:04:50.260> it<00:04:50.560> is

the absence of thought it is

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.190 
the absence of thought it is
concentrating<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.780> your<00:04:52.930> breath
