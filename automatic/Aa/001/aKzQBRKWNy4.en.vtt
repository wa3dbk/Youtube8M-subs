00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.139 
bring me some relief he told me last
week<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.560> could<00:02:07.799> start<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.190> drive<00:02:08.459> this

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
week that I could start to drive this

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.740 
week that I could start to drive this
week<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.929> still<00:02:10.739> don't<00:02:11.039> feel<00:02:11.340> quite<00:02:12.209> ready<00:02:12.660> to

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
week I still don't feel quite ready to

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.479 
week I still don't feel quite ready to
do<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.530> think<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.130> over<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.400> next

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
do that but I think that over the next

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.940 
do that but I think that over the next
couple<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:15.060> days<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.660> should<00:02:16.260> be<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.620> said<00:02:16.920> I

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
couple of days I should be like I said I

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.759 
couple of days I should be like I said I
can<00:02:17.220> move<00:02:17.459> my<00:02:17.790> head<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.900> don't<00:02:19.410> know<00:02:19.590> how

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
can move my head I just don't know how

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.130 
can move my head I just don't know how
comfortable<00:02:20.069> I<00:02:20.459> am<00:02:20.670> if<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.510> had<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.870> suddenly

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
comfortable I am if I had to suddenly

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.500 
comfortable I am if I had to suddenly
look<00:02:22.560> over<00:02:22.830> here<00:02:23.040> really<00:02:23.280> quickly<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.150> wit<00:02:24.330> my

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
look over here really quickly and wit my

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.600 
look over here really quickly and wit my
head<00:02:24.720> around<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.200> don't<00:02:25.260> think<00:02:25.890> I'm<00:02:26.220> quite

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
head around I don't think I'm quite

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.400 
head around I don't think I'm quite
ready<00:02:26.790> for<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.989> know<00:02:28.140> sometimes

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
ready for that and you know sometimes

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.050 
ready for that and you know sometimes
you<00:02:28.650> have<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.099> that<00:02:29.280> when<00:02:29.459> you're<00:02:29.580> driving

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
you have to do that when you're driving

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.630 
you have to do that when you're driving
so<00:02:30.420> when<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.290> do<00:02:31.440> start<00:02:31.830> driving<00:02:32.250> I'll<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.519> to

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
so when I do start driving I'll have to

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.509 
so when I do start driving I'll have to
be<00:02:32.790> very<00:02:33.030> kind<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.420> careful<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.470> be<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.370> the

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
be very kind of careful and be in the

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.690 
be very kind of careful and be in the
slow<00:02:35.760> lane<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.690> think<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.230> can<00:02:37.470> be<00:02:37.700> pretty

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
slow lane but I think that can be pretty

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.380 
slow lane but I think that can be pretty
soon<00:02:39.410> I'm<00:02:40.410> not<00:02:40.590> really<00:02:40.769> noticing<00:02:41.390> anything

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
soon I'm not really noticing anything

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.840 
soon I'm not really noticing anything
