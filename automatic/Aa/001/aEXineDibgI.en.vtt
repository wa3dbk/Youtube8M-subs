00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.910 
table that's going to be alright guys so
actually<00:01:40.079> have<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.259> make<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> few<00:01:40.650> elements

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
actually have to make a few elements

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.560 
actually have to make a few elements
because<00:01:41.220> we're<00:01:41.369> missing<00:01:41.700> fabric<00:01:42.150> 0<00:01:42.240> which<00:01:42.420> is

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
because we're missing fabric 0 which is

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.510 
because we're missing fabric 0 which is
the<00:01:42.720> hammer<00:01:42.960> item<00:01:43.350> which<00:01:43.950> takes<00:01:44.220> quite<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> bit

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the hammer item which takes quite a bit

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.980 
the hammer item which takes quite a bit
to<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:44.880> used<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.540> we're<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> go

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
to get used to so we're going to go

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.600 
to get used to so we're going to go
ahead<00:01:46.020> we're<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> need<00:01:47.250> some<00:01:47.399> IQ

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
ahead we're going to need some IQ

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.260 
ahead we're going to need some IQ
minutes<00:01:47.850> which<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.110> those<00:01:49.110> two<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.880> then<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
minutes which is those two and then to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.069 
minutes which is those two and then to
get<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:52.909> we<00:01:53.909> need<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.210> make<00:01:54.329> humanists<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
get to we need to make humanists and

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.660 
get to we need to make humanists and
plus<00:01:55.350> Ordo<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.100> we're<00:01:56.189> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> go<00:01:56.430> grab

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
plus Ordo so we're going to go grab

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.780 
plus Ordo so we're going to go grab
those<00:01:57.469> that<00:01:58.469> gives<00:01:58.799> us<00:01:59.009> instrumentum

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
those that gives us instrumentum

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.160 
those that gives us instrumentum
instrumentum<00:02:00.719> plus<00:02:02.540> humanists<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.689> going<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
instrumentum plus humanists is going to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.210 
instrumentum plus humanists is going to
give<00:02:04.380> us<00:02:05.090> our<00:02:06.439> fabric<00:02:07.439> oh<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.920> I'm<00:02:07.979> going<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.129> go

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
give us our fabric oh so I'm going to go

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.520 
give us our fabric oh so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:08.489> combine<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.479> research<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:10.319> and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
ahead combine this research here and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.960 
ahead combine this research here and
then<00:02:10.649> we'll<00:02:10.739> pause<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.099> rate<00:02:11.220> at<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> end<00:02:11.489> so

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
then we'll pause the rate at the end so

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.430 
then we'll pause the rate at the end so
you<00:02:12.030> get<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.239> good<00:02:12.330> look<00:02:12.390> at<00:02:12.629> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
you get a good look at it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.890 
you get a good look at it
all<00:02:14.010> right<00:02:14.130> there<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.340> go<00:02:14.430> guys<00:02:14.900> hopefully

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
ahead grab that our discovery for the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.170 
ahead grab that our discovery for the
deconstruction<00:02:20.910> table<00:02:21.330> just<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:23.180> so

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
deconstruction table just like that so

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.000 
deconstruction table just like that so
we've<00:02:24.270> got<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.660> now<00:02:25.020> let's<00:02:25.140> get<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.470> research

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
we've got that now let's get a research

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.530 
we've got that now let's get a research
duplication<00:02:26.700> hopefully<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.060> one<00:02:27.180> isn't<00:02:27.420> too

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
duplication hopefully this one isn't too

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.200 
duplication hopefully this one isn't too
complicated<00:02:27.930> for<00:02:28.170> us<00:02:28.400> go<00:02:29.400> ahead<00:02:29.670> throw<00:02:29.700> that

table you see a star icon click an icon

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.400 
table you see a star icon click an icon
will<00:03:36.300> create<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.540> copy<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.840> this<00:03:36.930> research<00:03:37.200> as

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
will create a copy of this research as

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.750 
will create a copy of this research as
long<00:03:37.560> as<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.770> were<00:03:37.860> carrying<00:03:38.100> paper<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.640> ink

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
long as you were carrying paper and ink

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.990 
long as you were carrying paper and ink
and<00:03:38.970> have<00:03:39.330> enough<00:03:39.540> aspects<00:03:40.140> available<00:03:40.850> so<00:03:41.850> you

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
and have enough aspects available so you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.460 
and have enough aspects available so you
can<00:03:42.060> just<00:03:42.150> copy<00:03:42.360> /<00:03:42.540> research<00:03:42.989> if<00:03:43.140> your<00:03:43.260> friends

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
can just copy / research if your friends

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.690 
can just copy / research if your friends
need<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.680> do<00:03:43.800> we<00:03:43.860> can<00:03:43.980> go<00:03:44.040> ahead<00:03:44.160> throw<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.550> in<00:03:44.640> a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
need to do we can go ahead throw it in a

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.420 
need to do we can go ahead throw it in a
chest<00:03:44.940> or<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.870> can<00:03:45.959> be<00:03:45.989> learned<00:03:46.230> for<00:03:46.410> later<00:03:46.590> so

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
chest or it can be learned for later so

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.550 
chest or it can be learned for later so
now<00:03:47.880> we<00:03:47.940> have<00:03:48.060> covered<00:03:48.600> research<00:03:49.140> expertise

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
now we have covered research expertise

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.530 
now we have covered research expertise
mastery<00:03:50.190> research<00:03:50.670> duplication<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.450> the

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
mastery research duplication and the

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.930 
mastery research duplication and the
deconstruction<00:03:52.050> table<00:03:52.440> all<00:03:52.620> in<00:03:52.769> one<00:03:52.950> so<00:03:53.790> there

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
deconstruction table all in one so there
