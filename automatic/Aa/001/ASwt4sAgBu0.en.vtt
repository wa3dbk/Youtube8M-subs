s I'm just going to show you what I do

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.250 
s I'm just going to show you what I do
is<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.630> repeat<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.470> first<00:00:19.830> level<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.730> game

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
is I repeat the first level of the game

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.660 
is I repeat the first level of the game
many<00:00:22.260> many<00:00:22.890> many<00:00:23.580> times<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:25.099> you'll<00:00:26.099> see<00:00:26.400> my

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
many many many times and you'll see my

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.939 
many many many times and you'll see my
exact<00:00:27.090> method<00:00:29.240> while<00:00:30.240> I'm<00:00:30.599> doing<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.769> get

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
exact method while I'm doing this I get

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.090 
exact method while I'm doing this I get
the<00:00:32.099> mushroom<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.320> that'll<00:00:34.320> make<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> Giant

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the mushroom and that'll make the Giant

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.130 
the mushroom and that'll make the Giant
so<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.579> smash<00:00:36.210> through<00:00:36.510> all<00:00:36.750> sorts<00:00:36.960> of

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
so I can smash through all sorts of

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.889 
so I can smash through all sorts of
stuff<00:00:37.410> collecting<00:00:38.120> anything<00:00:39.120> that's<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.719> my

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
stuff collecting anything that's in my

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:40.340 
stuff collecting anything that's in my
way

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
way

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.610 
way
and<00:00:41.120> I<00:00:42.120> take<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> giant<00:00:42.840> all<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.200> way<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
and I take the giant all the way to the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.400 
and I take the giant all the way to the
end<00:00:44.300> where<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.329> smash<00:00:45.809> through<00:00:46.050> all<00:00:46.200> these

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
end where I smash through all these

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.590 
end where I smash through all these
things<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.309> then<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> extra<00:00:48.300> lives

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
things so then I get the extra lives

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.590 
things so then I get the extra lives
over<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> top<00:00:49.730> then<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.820> wait<00:00:51.000> until<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> timer

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
over the top then I wait until the timer

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.500 
over the top then I wait until the timer
says<00:00:51.960> 355<00:00:52.829> hit<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> flag<00:00:54.090> there

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.390 

that'll<00:00:56.960> get<00:00:57.110> me<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.470> maximum<00:00:57.710> amount<00:00:58.280> of

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
that'll get me the maximum amount of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.450 
that'll get me the maximum amount of
points<00:00:58.640> for<00:00:59.000> that<00:00:59.330> first<00:00:59.720> level<00:01:00.220> you'll<00:01:01.220> hear

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
points for that first level you'll hear

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.850 
points for that first level you'll hear
the<00:01:01.610> fireworks<00:01:01.880> and<00:01:02.420> see<00:01:02.660> them<00:01:02.900> breech<00:01:03.530> one<00:01:03.770> of

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
the fireworks and see them breech one of

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.040 
the fireworks and see them breech one of
those<00:01:04.010> I<00:01:04.220> got<00:01:04.370> 4000<00:01:05.180> points<00:01:05.360> that's<00:01:05.810> why<00:01:06.020> I

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
those I got 4000 points that's why I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.960 
those I got 4000 points that's why I
ended<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.590> timer<00:01:06.860> on<00:01:07.250> 3:55<00:01:08.800> now<00:01:09.800> if<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.250> reenter

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
ended the timer on 3:55 now if I reenter

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.780 
ended the timer on 3:55 now if I reenter
the<00:01:11.270> level<00:01:11.750> I<00:01:11.960> can<00:01:12.560> show<00:01:12.740> you<00:01:12.800> how<00:01:13.100> many<00:01:13.160> points

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
the level I can show you how many points

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.750 
the level I can show you how many points
I<00:01:14.000> achieved<00:01:14.660> just<00:01:15.440> for<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:15.800> one<00:01:16.040> level<00:01:18.760> okay

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
I achieved just for that one level okay

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.730 
I achieved just for that one level okay
a<00:01:20.000> bottom<00:01:20.480> screen<00:01:20.810> there<00:01:21.310> there<00:01:22.310> we<00:01:22.430> go

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
a bottom screen there there we go

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.230 
a bottom screen there there we go
61508<00:01:25.780> well<00:01:26.780> that's<00:01:26.960> great<00:01:27.910> now<00:01:28.910> we're<00:01:29.150> gonna

go<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.510> my<00:01:29.840> real<00:01:30.350> file<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:35.570> we'll<00:01:35.750> see<00:01:35.960> how

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
go to my real file and we'll see how

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:45.130 
go to my real file and we'll see how
many<00:01:36.290> points<00:01:36.500> I've<00:01:36.890> got<00:01:37.100> there<00:01:42.850> okay<00:01:44.140> nine

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
many points I've got there okay nine

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.540 
many points I've got there okay nine
hundred<00:01:45.500> ninety<00:01:45.740> nine<00:01:45.770> million<00:01:46.070> nine<00:01:46.400> hundred

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
hundred ninety nine million nine hundred

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.609 
hundred ninety nine million nine hundred
fifty<00:01:46.970> four<00:01:47.330> thousand<00:01:47.810> four<00:01:48.020> hundred<00:01:48.229> and

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
fifty four thousand four hundred and

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.060 
fifty four thousand four hundred and
seventy<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:50.390> I'm<00:01:50.720> just<00:01:50.930> gonna<00:01:51.110> do<00:01:51.410> this<00:01:51.650> last

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
seventy so I'm just gonna do this last

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.320 
seventy so I'm just gonna do this last
level<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:54.830> we'll<00:01:55.310> see<00:01:55.520> what<00:01:55.700> happens<00:01:56.090> I

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
level and we'll see what happens I

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.740 
level and we'll see what happens I
haven't<00:01:56.690> done<00:01:56.780> this<00:01:56.960> before<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:58.750> probably

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
haven't done this before so probably

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.680 
haven't done this before so probably
nothing<00:01:59.990> will<00:02:00.380> happen<00:02:00.530> but<00:02:01.119> we'll<00:02:02.119> see<00:02:02.360> if

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
nothing will happen but we'll see if

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.450 
nothing will happen but we'll see if
something<00:02:03.110> special<00:02:03.560> does<00:02:03.740> happen<00:02:04.160> like<00:02:04.340> they

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
something special does happen like they

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.169 
something special does happen like they
came<00:02:04.640> glitches<00:02:05.240> or<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:06.009> don't<00:02:07.009> know<00:02:07.190> what<00:02:07.460> I've

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
came glitches or I don't know what I've

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.180 
came glitches or I don't know what I've
got<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.569> on<00:02:08.979> film

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
got it on film

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.260 
got it on film
I<00:02:10.340> guess<00:02:10.670> not<00:02:11.000> really<00:02:11.240> film<00:02:12.010> but<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.910> get<00:02:14.120> my

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
I guess not really film but you get my

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.850 
I guess not really film but you get my
