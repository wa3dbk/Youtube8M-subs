something laying around the house and I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.350 
something laying around the house and I
thought<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.880> would<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.930> good<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.369> use<00:01:17.369> as

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
thought that it would be good to use as

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.770 
thought that it would be good to use as
a<00:01:19.229> piece<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.979> make<00:01:20.100> my<00:01:20.280> bag<00:01:20.490> charm<00:01:20.850> so

a piece to make my bag charm so
basically<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.350> took<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.979> little<00:01:23.280> claw<00:01:23.550> clamp

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.529 
basically I took this little claw clamp
and<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:26.119> put<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.240> into<00:01:27.679> the<00:01:28.679> keychain<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.240> just

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
and I put it into the keychain so just

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.430 
and I put it into the keychain so just
like<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.899> would<00:01:31.050> put<00:01:31.320> your<00:01:31.500> keys<00:01:31.830> in<00:01:32.220> here<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
so with this key ring that was attached

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.859 
so with this key ring that was attached
to<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.840> bag<00:01:44.420> was<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.780> long<00:01:47.360> chain<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:48.630> here

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
to this bag was a long chain right here

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.440 
to this bag was a long chain right here
so<00:01:49.350> basically<00:01:49.530> what<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.039> did<00:01:50.190> is<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:51.119> took<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
so basically what I did is I took the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.010 
so basically what I did is I took the
tassels<00:01:52.319> the<00:01:52.950> first<00:01:53.220> two<00:01:53.399> tassels<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.149> I

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
tassels the first two tassels and I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.430 
tassels the first two tassels and I
added<00:01:55.679> them<00:01:56.159> unto<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.179> keyring<00:01:57.690> here<00:01:58.200> and<00:02:00.440> the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
added them unto the keyring here and the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.650 
added them unto the keyring here and the
chain<00:02:01.800> was<00:02:02.220> still<00:02:02.520> hanging<00:02:02.940> long<00:02:03.209> and<00:02:03.599> I

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
chain was still hanging long and I

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.710 
chain was still hanging long and I
didn't<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.050> that<00:02:04.259> look<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.739> what<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> did<00:02:05.099> is

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
didn't like that look so what I did is

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.109 
didn't like that look so what I did is
about<00:02:06.720> halfway<00:02:07.050> down<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.679> chain<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.369> took<00:02:08.880> one

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
about halfway down the chain I took one

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.140 
about halfway down the chain I took one
of<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.360> links<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.170> looped<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.830> inside<00:02:11.730> of

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
of the links and I looped it inside of

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.320 
of the links and I looped it inside of
the<00:02:12.660> keychain<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:14.160> make<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.550> shorter<00:02:15.120> so

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
the keychain to make it shorter so

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.369 
the keychain to make it shorter so
that's<00:02:16.110> why<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.410> have<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:18.200> hanging<00:02:19.200> right

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
that's why you have this hanging right

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.970 
that's why you have this hanging right
here<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.910> then<00:02:21.300> what<00:02:21.629> I<00:02:21.660> did<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.290> had<00:02:22.319> another

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
here so then what I did is I had another

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.410 
here so then what I did is I had another
bag<00:02:24.080> like<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.379> it<00:02:25.739> was<00:02:26.160> my<00:02:26.940> green<00:02:27.209> one

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
bag like this and it was my green one

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.830 
bag like this and it was my green one
and<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.860> took<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.489> keychain<00:02:30.090> off<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:31.800> took

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
and I took that keychain off and I took

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.580 
and I took that keychain off and I took
the<00:02:33.840> last<00:02:34.020> link<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.830> keychain<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.970> I

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
the last link of that keychain and I

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.619 
the last link of that keychain and I
connected<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:38.870> this<00:02:39.870> keychain<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:41.629> added

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
connected it to this keychain and added

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.300 
connected it to this keychain and added
the<00:02:42.750> tassels<00:02:43.260> on<00:02:43.379> here<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:44.069> took<00:02:45.769> about<00:02:46.769> halfway

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the tassels on here I took about halfway

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.020 
the tassels on here I took about halfway
through<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.910> chain<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.569> I<00:02:49.530> looped<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.160> inside

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
through the chain and I looped it inside

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.449 
through the chain and I looped it inside
of<00:02:51.060> here<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:52.260> make<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.620> shorter<00:02:53.129> so<00:02:53.160> it

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
of here to make it shorter so it

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.550 
of here to make it shorter so it
wouldn't<00:02:53.760> hang<00:02:54.060> down<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.720> long<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:58.290> is

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
wouldn't hang down so long so that is

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.050 
wouldn't hang down so long so that is
how<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:58.860> came<00:02:59.129> up<00:02:59.760> with<00:03:00.440> this<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.830> it<00:03:02.790> looks

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
how I came up with this and it looks

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.220 
how I came up with this and it looks
kind<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.840> messy<00:03:03.900> right<00:03:04.650> now<00:03:04.859> because<00:03:05.219> I<00:03:05.459> have

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
kind of messy right now because I have

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.040 
kind of messy right now because I have
all<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.499> this<00:03:07.620> chain<00:03:07.950> stuff<00:03:08.400> hanging<00:03:08.849> in<00:03:08.999> here

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
all of this chain stuff hanging in here

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.220 
all of this chain stuff hanging in here
but<00:03:10.200> what<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.410> did<00:03:11.280> camouflage<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.900> put

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
but what I did camouflage this is I put

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.080 
but what I did camouflage this is I put
this<00:03:13.560> part<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.330> back<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:15.990> bag<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:17.090> when

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
this part to the back of the bag so when

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
this part to the back of the bag so when
you're<00:03:18.270> looking<00:03:18.480> straight<00:03:19.230> on<00:03:19.470> at<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.280> bag

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
you're looking straight on at the bag

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.100 
you're looking straight on at the bag
you<00:03:22.460> just<00:03:23.460> see<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.240> see<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.480> little<00:03:24.840> bit

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
you just see this you see a little bit

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.740 
you just see this you see a little bit
of<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.920> gold<00:03:26.160> but<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.880> bag<00:03:27.090> has<00:03:27.420> gold

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
of the gold but the bag has gold

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.080 
of the gold but the bag has gold
hardware<00:03:28.020> so<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.800> doesn't<00:03:29.280> look<00:03:29.460> too<00:03:29.730> out<00:03:30.060> of

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
hardware so it doesn't look too out of

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.020 
hardware so it doesn't look too out of
place<00:03:30.770> and<00:03:31.770> again<00:03:32.070> I'm<00:03:32.280> still<00:03:32.550> working<00:03:32.940> on

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
place and again I'm still working on

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.390 
place and again I'm still working on
this<00:03:33.210> to<00:03:33.450> see<00:03:33.660> how<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:33.930> can<00:03:35.540> perfect<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:37.010> so<00:03:38.010> I

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
this to see how I can perfect it so I

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.100 
this to see how I can perfect it so I
thought<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.820> actually<00:03:39.210> looked<00:03:39.450> pretty<00:03:39.540> cute

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
thought it actually looked pretty cute

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.780 
thought it actually looked pretty cute
on<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.710> bag<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:42.470> if<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.770> have<00:03:43.980> another<00:03:44.310> bag<00:03:44.580> I

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
on the bag and if I have another bag I

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.310 
on the bag and if I have another bag I
plan<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.060> use<00:03:45.210> this<00:03:45.360> on<00:03:45.870> other<00:03:46.830> bags<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:48.320> are

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
plan to use this on other bags that are

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.530 
plan to use this on other bags that are
a<00:03:49.350> little<00:03:49.920> bit<00:03:50.130> plain<00:03:50.430> just<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.940> add<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.090> little

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
a little bit plain just to add a little

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.130 
a little bit plain just to add a little
bit<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.930> style<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.790> so<00:03:53.790> four<00:03:54.630> bags<00:03:54.810> that

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
bit of style to it so four bags that

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.340 
bit of style to it so four bags that
aren't<00:03:55.800> as<00:03:55.950> large<00:03:56.310> as<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.880> Chelsea<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.570> would

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
aren't as large as the Chelsea I would

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.600 
aren't as large as the Chelsea I would
probably<00:03:58.850> just<00:03:59.850> use<00:04:00.600> two<00:04:01.050> charms<00:04:02.270> instead<00:04:03.270> of

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
probably just use two charms instead of

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.290 
probably just use two charms instead of
four<00:04:05.610> charms<00:04:06.180> or<00:04:06.330> three<00:04:06.630> charms<00:04:06.960> instead<00:04:07.650> of

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
four charms or three charms instead of

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.190 
four charms or three charms instead of
the<00:04:09.300> four<00:04:09.800> so<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:11.220> can<00:04:11.430> just<00:04:11.640> kind<00:04:11.940> of

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
the four so you can just kind of

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.670
