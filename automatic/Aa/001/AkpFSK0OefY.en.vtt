Thunderbolt for himself but he obviously
doesn't<00:00:34.559> hit<00:00:34.769> anything<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.370> dead<00:00:35.579> so

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:37.499 
I go into jolteon pretty much for the

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:39.369 
I go into jolteon pretty much for the
revenge<00:00:37.769> kill<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> Thunderbolt

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
revenge kill just go for the Thunderbolt

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.680 
revenge kill just go for the Thunderbolt
it's<00:00:40.379> normal<00:00:40.739> effective<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:42.239> my<00:00:42.539> most

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
it's normal effective and it's my most

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
it's normal effective and it's my most
powerful<00:00:42.870> move<00:00:43.289> this<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.649> my<00:00:43.769> specs<00:00:44.129> jolteon

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
powerful move this is my specs jolteon

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.520 
powerful move this is my specs jolteon
so<00:00:45.390> he<00:00:45.480> goes<00:00:45.600> into<00:00:45.809> Machamp<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.319> i<00:00:46.350> don't

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
so he goes into Machamp but i don't

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.930 
so he goes into Machamp but i don't
think<00:00:46.679> i<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.769> kill<00:00:47.069> him<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.249> thunderbolt<00:00:47.730> but

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
think i can kill him a thunderbolt but

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.489 
think i can kill him a thunderbolt but
decided<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.269> go<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.600> anyway<00:00:48.899> because<00:00:49.170> I

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:49.499 
decided to go for it anyway because I

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:51.110 
decided to go for it anyway because I
really<00:00:49.769> don't<00:00:50.010> have<00:00:50.069> a<00:00:50.219> switch<00:00:50.519> that<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.789> really

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
really don't have a switch that I really

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.209 
really don't have a switch that I really
like<00:00:51.359> and<00:00:51.569> I<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.440> try<00:00:52.589> to<00:00:52.649> revenge<00:00:52.979> kill

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
can't do much a pollito to force him to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.850 
can't do much a pollito to force him to
switch<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.930> decide<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.350> go<00:01:16.619> for<00:01:16.649> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
switch and I decide to go for the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.850 
switch and I decide to go for the
hypnosis<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> switch<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.619> he<00:01:19.619> actually

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
hypnosis on the switch and he actually

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.740 
hypnosis on the switch and he actually
mrs.<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.759> hypnosis<00:01:21.030> which<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.420> kind<00:01:21.659> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
mrs. with hypnosis which is kind of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.440 
mrs. with hypnosis which is kind of
annoying<00:01:21.930> um<00:01:22.729> but<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> king<00:01:24.149> drew<00:01:24.329> and<00:01:24.420> I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
annoying um but as a king drew and I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.760 
annoying um but as a king drew and I
don't<00:01:24.630> think<00:01:24.840> kingdra<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.289> kill<00:01:25.439> me<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.619> one

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
don't think kingdra can kill me in one

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.830 
don't think kingdra can kill me in one
hits<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.100> decide<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.850> again<00:01:26.969> and<00:01:27.479> he

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
hits we decide to go for it again and he

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.810 
hits we decide to go for it again and he
actually<00:01:28.049> goes<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:28.859> the<00:01:28.950> yawn<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.579> that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
actually goes for the yawn so that

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.459 
actually goes for the yawn so that
forces<00:01:30.210> me<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.329> switch<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:30.899> at<00:01:30.990> least<00:01:31.109> I<00:01:31.289> did

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
forces me to switch but at least I did

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.149 
forces me to switch but at least I did
get<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.859> second<00:01:32.759> hypnosis<00:01:33.060> off<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:34.289> we<00:01:34.979> both

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
get the second hypnosis off so we both

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.130 
get the second hypnosis off so we both
filled<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.520> leftovers<00:01:36.149> and<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:37.020> we're

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
filled with leftovers and I think we're

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.230 
filled with leftovers and I think we're
both<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.530> switch<00:01:37.820> he<00:01:38.820> goes<00:01:38.969> into

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
both going to switch he goes into

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.660 
both going to switch he goes into
mismagius<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.109> go<00:01:40.289> into<00:01:40.469> my<00:01:41.159> champ<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.549> my

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
mismagius and I go into my champ of my

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.240 
mismagius and I go into my champ of my
own<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.649> I<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.920> thing's<00:01:44.130> gonna

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
own and I know this thing's gonna

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.389 
own and I know this thing's gonna
probably<00:01:44.609> try<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.939> set<00:01:45.929> up<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.560> sub<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.310> then

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
probably try to set up like sub and then

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.669 
probably try to set up like sub and then
tell<00:01:47.850> mine<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.359> I<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.990> don't<00:01:49.350> want<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> give

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
tell mine so I just don't want to give

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.230 
tell mine so I just don't want to give
him<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.799> opportunity<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.609> I<00:01:50.640> decided<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> go

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
him that opportunity so I decided to go

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.990 
him that opportunity so I decided to go
for<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.450> stone<00:01:51.719> edge<00:01:51.929> and<00:01:52.579> I'm<00:01:53.579> actually

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
for the stone edge and I'm actually

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.370 
for the stone edge and I'm actually
going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> use<00:01:54.359> this<00:01:54.600> crit<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
going to use this crit because it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.459 
going to use this crit because it
wouldn't<00:01:55.979> break<00:01:56.070> him<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> sub<00:01:56.609> anyway<00:01:57.170> but<00:01:58.170> I

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
wouldn't break him the sub anyway but I

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.789 
wouldn't break him the sub anyway but I
do<00:01:58.859> break<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.340> sub<00:01:59.579> there<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.619> he's<00:02:01.619> going<00:02:01.740> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
do break the sub there and he's going to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.380 
do break the sub there and he's going to
withdraw<00:02:01.979> miss<00:02:02.429> Maggie's<00:02:02.820> realizing<00:02:03.270> he's

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
withdraw miss Maggie's realizing he's

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.760 
withdraw miss Maggie's realizing he's
not<00:02:03.539> going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.719> get<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.020> opportunity<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.530> set

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
not going to get the opportunity to set

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.289 
not going to get the opportunity to set
it<00:02:04.890> up<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.189> he<00:02:05.280> goes<00:02:05.310> into<00:02:05.609> the<00:02:05.670> licky<00:02:05.999> licky

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
it up and he goes into the licky licky

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.509 
it up and he goes into the licky licky
and<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.499> a<00:02:07.530> pretty<00:02:07.770> cool<00:02:07.950> looking<00:02:08.129> lucky

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
and this is a pretty cool looking lucky

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.029 
and this is a pretty cool looking lucky
I<00:02:08.550> must<00:02:08.849> say<00:02:09.440> Stone<00:02:10.440> Edge<00:02:10.590> doesn't<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> whole

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
I must say Stone Edge doesn't do a whole

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.490 
I must say Stone Edge doesn't do a whole
lot<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.909> it's<00:02:12.180> definitely<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:12.989> physically

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
lot so it's definitely like physically

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
lot so it's definitely like physically
bulky<00:02:13.860> but<00:02:14.580> I'd<00:02:14.700> still<00:02:15.030> don't<00:02:15.240> think<00:02:15.300> he<00:02:15.600> can

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
bulky but I'd still don't think he can

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.240 
bulky but I'd still don't think he can
take<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.930> dynamic<00:02:16.440> punch<00:02:16.620> too<00:02:16.860> well<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.190> I

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
take a dynamic punch too well so I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.800 
take a dynamic punch too well so I
decided<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.610> try<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.820> go<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.420> but<00:02:18.570> he<00:02:18.690> goes

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
decided to try to go for it but he goes

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.900 
decided to try to go for it but he goes
for<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.080> protect<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.740> at<00:02:20.490> this<00:02:20.580> point<00:02:20.790> I

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
for the protect and at this point I

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.220 
for the protect and at this point I
realized<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.540> looking<00:02:21.930> like<00:02:22.080> he

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
realized that this looking like he

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.360 
realized that this looking like he
probably<00:02:22.410> doesn't<00:02:22.710> have<00:02:22.770> anything<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.190> hurt

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
probably doesn't have anything to hurt

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.070 
probably doesn't have anything to hurt
mismagius<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.240> decided<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.540> go<00:02:24.660> into<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:25.020> to

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
mismagius so I decided to go into it to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.410 
mismagius so I decided to go into it to
try<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.260> set<00:02:25.440> up<00:02:25.530> my<00:02:25.620> own<00:02:25.650> mismagius<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.730> he

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
try to set up my own mismagius and he

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.970 
try to set up my own mismagius and he
does<00:02:27.600> try<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.930> go<00:02:28.110> for<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.290> counter<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.710> don't

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
does try to go for the counter I don't

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.500 
does try to go for the counter I don't
know<00:02:29.070> if<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.280> were<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.460> survive<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.000> dynamic

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
know if you were to survive the dynamic

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.310 
know if you were to survive the dynamic
punch<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.080> obviously<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:31.830> he<00:02:31.980> did<00:02:32.400> then

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
punch but obviously if he did then

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.540 
punch but obviously if he did then
Machamp<00:02:34.320> would<00:02:34.440> have<00:02:34.530> been<00:02:34.680> defeated<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.310> it's

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
Machamp would have been defeated so it's

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.470 
Machamp would have been defeated so it's
probably<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.850> good<00:02:35.880> thing<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.180> went<00:02:36.330> to

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
probably a good thing I went to

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.580 
probably a good thing I went to
mismagius<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:38.070> he<00:02:38.580> goes<00:02:38.730> into<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.450> heat<00:02:40.140> ran<00:02:40.350> and

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
mismagius so he goes into a heat ran and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.140 
mismagius so he goes into a heat ran and
I<00:02:40.650> don't<00:02:40.860> think<00:02:41.070> I'll<00:02:41.220> be<00:02:41.370> able<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.610> call<00:02:41.910> mind

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
I don't think I'll be able to call mind

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.320 
I don't think I'll be able to call mind
and<00:02:42.390> survive<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.690> hit<00:02:42.990> so<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.290> decide<00:02:43.740> just<00:02:43.950> to

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
and survive a hit so I decide just to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.580 
and survive a hit so I decide just to
take<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.510> free<00:02:45.720> damage<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.290> go<00:02:46.380> for<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
take the free damage and go for the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.770 
take the free damage and go for the
hidden<00:02:46.800> power<00:02:47.040> fighting<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:48.420> go<00:02:48.570> over<00:02:48.660> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
hidden power fighting and I go over the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.630 
hidden power fighting and I go over the
hidden<00:02:48.959> power<00:02:49.080> fighting<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.860> nearly<00:02:50.280> kills

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
hidden power fighting and nearly kills

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.160 
hidden power fighting and nearly kills
the<00:02:50.850> heat<00:02:51.090> ran<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.690> i'm<00:02:51.870> just<00:02:51.959> going<00:02:52.050> to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
the heat ran and i'm just going to

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.800 
the heat ran and i'm just going to
switch<00:02:52.380> out<00:02:52.560> now<00:02:52.770> because<00:02:53.310> i<00:02:53.820> do<00:02:54.120> have<00:02:54.239> scizor

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
switch out now because i do have scizor

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.440 
switch out now because i do have scizor
and<00:02:54.840> scissor<00:02:55.410> resists<00:02:56.070> dragon<00:02:57.000> pulse<00:02:57.180> and

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
and scissor resists dragon pulse and

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.810 
and scissor resists dragon pulse and
judging<00:02:58.380> by<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.650> fact<00:02:58.860> he<00:02:59.100> tran<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.310> faster

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
judging by the fact he tran is faster

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.510 
judging by the fact he tran is faster
than<00:02:59.850> mismagius<00:03:00.300> I<00:03:00.630> know<00:03:00.690> it's<00:03:01.050> scarfed<00:03:01.520> so

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
than mismagius I know it's scarfed so

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.580 
than mismagius I know it's scarfed so
anyway<00:03:03.480> I'm<00:03:03.660> he<00:03:03.840> goes<00:03:03.959> for<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.140> dragon<00:03:04.410> pulse

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590

he goes back in the licky licky and I'm

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.490 
he goes back in the licky licky and I'm
just<00:03:12.180> kind<00:03:12.330> of<00:03:12.360> hoping<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.720> can<00:03:12.780> k<00:03:13.050> home<00:03:13.350> with

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
just kind of hoping I can k home with

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.350 
just kind of hoping I can k home with
brick<00:03:13.739> break<00:03:13.980> at<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.400> point<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:14.970> decided

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
brick break at this point so I decided

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.870 
brick break at this point so I decided
just<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.600> go<00:03:15.690> for<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.549> probably<00:03:17.549> should<00:03:17.820> have

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
just to go for it I probably should have

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.729 
just to go for it I probably should have
went<00:03:18.060> for<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.269> other<00:03:18.390> sword<00:03:18.780> dance<00:03:19.019> but<00:03:19.500> I

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
went for the other sword dance but I

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.500 
went for the other sword dance but I
just<00:03:20.010> didn't<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:20.580> go<00:03:20.790> for<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.030> brick<00:03:21.239> break

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
just didn't so I go for the brick break

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.530 
just didn't so I go for the brick break
and<00:03:21.780> he<00:03:22.680> ends<00:03:22.950> up<00:03:23.010> surviving<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.850> hits<00:03:24.390> me

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
and he ends up surviving and hits me

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.180 
and he ends up surviving and hits me
with<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.720> counter<00:03:25.140> which<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:25.440> obviously<00:03:25.950> going

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
with a counter which is obviously going

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.210 
with a counter which is obviously going
to<00:03:26.310> chaos<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.970> or<00:03:27.150> so<00:03:27.650> this<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:28.769> not<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.980> best

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
to chaos is or so this is not the best

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.610 
to chaos is or so this is not the best
but<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.910> figure<00:03:30.360> hey<00:03:30.600> even<00:03:30.959> if<00:03:31.019> my<00:03:31.320> sis<00:03:31.500> or

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
but I figure hey even if my sis or

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.990 
but I figure hey even if my sis or
doesn't<00:03:31.980> kill<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.220> with<00:03:32.340> brick<00:03:32.549> break<00:03:32.790> and

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
doesn't kill it with brick break and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.580 
doesn't kill it with brick break and
just<00:03:33.060> go<00:03:33.299> into<00:03:33.450> mismagius<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.140> try<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.290> set<00:03:34.500> up

ms<00:04:43.220> Magus<00:04:43.520> is<00:04:43.670> faster<00:04:44.180> he<00:04:44.620> put<00:04:45.620> more<00:04:45.860> v's<00:04:46.460> into

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
ms Magus is faster he put more v's into

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.470 
ms Magus is faster he put more v's into
his<00:04:47.240> defenses<00:04:48.220> while<00:04:49.220> mine<00:04:49.520> i<00:04:49.550> think<00:04:49.970> has<00:04:50.120> max

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
his defenses while mine i think has max

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
his defenses while mine i think has max
speed<00:04:50.840> for<00:04:51.200> mismagius<00:04:51.620> so<00:04:52.990> that<00:04:53.990> wasn't<00:04:54.350> let's

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
speed for mismagius so that wasn't let's

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.500 
speed for mismagius so that wasn't let's
be<00:04:54.650> entire<00:04:54.890> anything<00:04:55.280> i<00:04:55.400> was<00:04:55.520> just<00:04:55.580> faster<00:04:56.000> so

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
be entire anything i was just faster so

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.240 
be entire anything i was just faster so
that's<00:04:56.780> really<00:04:57.080> bad<00:04:57.260> because<00:04:57.530> i'm<00:04:57.860> able<00:04:58.010> to

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
that's really bad because i'm able to

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.490 
that's really bad because i'm able to
take<00:04:58.460> down<00:04:58.580> as<00:04:58.760> mismagius<00:04:59.150> and<00:04:59.630> I<00:04:59.960> get<00:05:00.140> a<00:05:00.170> crit

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
take down as mismagius and I get a crit

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.780 
take down as mismagius and I get a crit
I<00:05:00.530> think<00:05:00.800> it's<00:05:00.920> useless<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.340> mean<00:05:01.490> after<00:05:01.640> a

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
I think it's useless I mean after a

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.490 
I think it's useless I mean after a
column<00:05:02.150> on<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:02.480> bit<00:05:02.660> being<00:05:02.900> super<00:05:03.230> effective

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
column on and bit being super effective

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.260 
column on and bit being super effective
I<00:05:03.770> didn't<00:05:04.040> think<00:05:04.190> that<00:05:04.340> crit<00:05:04.580> mattered<00:05:04.970> but

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
I didn't think that crit mattered but

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.670 
I didn't think that crit mattered but
who<00:05:05.900> knows<00:05:06.250> so<00:05:07.250> I<00:05:07.280> go<00:05:07.760> for<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.030> sub<00:05:08.330> and<00:05:09.110> all<00:05:09.590> he
