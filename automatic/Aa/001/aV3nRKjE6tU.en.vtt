00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.670
 I am Kenichi Omae, President of Business Breakthrough Graduate University 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:19.920
 As we set up our graduate school 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:24.850
 A variety of business breakthroughs over 4,000 hours of management so far 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.910
 We have developed recording the thing called content 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.940
 These things are the story of the manager 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:37.060
 Also the story of the conductor around the world 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:41.290
 Also a consultant or a university professor who is very familiar with management 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:44.840
 These people are cooperating with this policy 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.380
 In addition, we have this theme all over Japan 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:54.170
 For example, this teacher's story about the subject of supply chain 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:56.160
 Or examine the things Fu say that we should listen to the story of this professional as soon as such a person 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:02.010
 Go to us 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.659
 When it comes to creating content, it is said that the content lasts 4,000 hours like that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:12.579
 We have stored things 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:14.150
 In addition, as a system, it is not just the satellite broadcasting, but listening when you want to listen 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:20.490
 Where you want 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:28.150
 Such a broadband delivery system that you can claim only the length you want to hear 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:33.170
 Furthermore, the mayor certification to examine one's own progress situation also included ah 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:39.950
 Satellite campus system and class discussion 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.210
 World news is automatically by using a meeting or campus to become a teacher in charge 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:50.899
 Come in 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:53.159
 And again by repeating the discussion every day with the teacher and the students each other and repeating it for two years 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:59.429
 Summarize your thoughts 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:04.020
 Speak to and this is kind of going to enlighten yourself while listening to the thing called the opinion Te 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:08.910
 You can think for yourself and take action 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:15.060
 Together we will make better things that can persuade people 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:21.450
 This we have made such a system that can learn, including up to such a team work 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:24.010
 The result of repeating many experiments by the system 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.230
 From now on 21st century 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.930
 I will 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:34.450
 To what kind of business person or managerial position 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:43.030
 We think about the need for a manager 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:47.139
 It provides a curriculum we want to provide this as a School of Management specifically 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.920
 I think about this program 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:52.580
 We also staff mansion 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.460
 Most Demanded in the 21st Century Meeting 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:02.620
 Training of management personnel who can be active in the world 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:11.390
 And the people we will analyze to see the things on your own and 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:17.240
 You can think and construct new ideas and create them as businesses 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:22.270
 Such as being able to make arguments based on arguments that are not shameful anywhere in the world 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:31.420
 We are planning to develop practical human resources 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:35.760
 It is because the system remote used in this is really busy people while working on their own 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:41.579
 I can go to this graduate school while working 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:45.470
 We have created a lot of systems for this, so let's start with one of them 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.470
 I would like to introduce you
