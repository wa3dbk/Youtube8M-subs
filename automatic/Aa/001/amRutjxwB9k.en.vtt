00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.940
 Always throw in the month comes 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.389
 new or our consequence practically out 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.639
 and you imagine your cool apps 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.859
 500 before the start, let's go first 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.080
 means linen tools and that is easy 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.640
 super useful we have many here 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.170
 small tools that are very easy 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.689
 in everyday life, for example, they are practical 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.029
 we have a ruler or a here 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.470
 Compass here we can look how 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.689
 So it's just so if I'm right now 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.399
 once spoken, are decibels at 50 60 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.860
 Here are a few comparisons 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.410
 For example, 90 are listed 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.510
 barking dog what else do we have in it 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.780
 a stopwatch will change a case 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.190
 a flashlight magnifying glass and the two 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.629
 functions are not my favorite 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.000
 down here, that's a unicum 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.629
 words to german a units um 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.520
 calculator 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.500
 there you can weigh units of weight 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.940
 units volume units to calculate 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.489
 So if we are America, for example 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.800
 and do not know how much a kilogram 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.780
 is or how much we can do then 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.930
 look all that here you who 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.400
 any wild exotic stuff 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.220
 which I do not know are in here 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.520
 and that needs the last thing I like 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.740
 The stable is good for shop abroad 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.330
 if you like his shoe size in America 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.549

 can you see what they are buying there 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.720
 so i would be really practical 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.500
 app I find line tools left the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.060
 by the way, one of the apps as well 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.820
 description spox our tiltable the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.159
 Next app is far and with the can 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.299
 you have your own innovation pattern 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.829
 Just create on the high 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.420
 press record button and then I am 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.420
 calm down and do the pattern now 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.230
 when I'm done by on the red 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.360
 button and then I can do it all 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.290
 Listen again if I like it and 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.290
 if that's the case 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.490
 I hope you can hear that but me 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.220
 think so loud enough and if that's me 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.930
 like it then on save and 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.030
 can now situations had 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.140
 either for all callers or make 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.390
 I can do it for anybody 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.570
 to arrange personally or only if 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.610
 we now describe hans-detlef on 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.000
 then this individual had to come 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.740
 far from sony step i am fast in 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.980
 google places gate gone and upload them 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.320
 down here she is called block and with 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.360
 This app lets you use other apps 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.130
 secure a password sent to you 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.010
 only on can do if you can do that too 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.030
 password we will do so times 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.190
 open the app and now we will 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.450
 asked to enter a code here 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.030
 So our password I'll do 12 34 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.420
 because I'm so creative and like that 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.140
 classic just for example 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.420
 something that is optional so 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.150
 somehow save on and I show 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.150
 to you as we lock an app now 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.440
 So we can look for an app 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.100
 which we now secure with a password 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.280
 want 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.570
 Let's take it then maybe 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.270
 Something is sometimes a few games 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.130
 he does not have to search too long 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.170
 The camera app as the camera app is 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.910
 now secured with the password 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.800
 always when i use the camera app now 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.959
 I want to open up 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.160
 to enter my password 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.989
 that was again 1234 and then I come 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.209
 only so if you have any 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.580
 For example, if you want to backup apps 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.200
 your cell phone to a buddy or yours 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.190
 Child wanted to enter with him like a couple 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.380
 games can play 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.910
 we did not want your sms and 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.150
 phone calls with the phone then leads 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.380
 can you secure it so password 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.630
 the app is not super awesome 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.709
 safe because you can easily 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.570
 uninstall and then it is natural 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.220
 the password protection is canceled so me 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.690
 would not be a complete one now 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.440
 most intimate secrets try this 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.910
 secure app 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.930
 but like I said, now just short 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.980
 my mobile phone out of hand and me 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.900
 Do not want someone on the phone 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.790
 my mobile phone is good enough for that and the 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.310
 person does not know a lot 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.870
 from in vienna super mobile phone connoisseurs that 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.239
 this app is responsible for that 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.310
 the password query comes but meaningful 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.269
 useful app may attract 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.230
 is already one or the other 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.359
 noticed 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.519
 look here above the left corner, the 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.579
 it is slightly rounded responsible 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:15.609
 that's what the app can do with it 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.650
 just round off the edges here 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.049
 angela you see now all the time 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.609
 square now I go up and she is 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.520
 here so rounded I can of course 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.230
 also make all corners or certain 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.440
 Select corners now in all selected 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.600
 and here at this little wheel can 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.730
 I adjust how much they are rounded 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.540
 So it's extremely worth it 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.550
 I do not like it 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.370
 and of course it will be just like normal 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.170
 I always like 60 and I do not know 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.990
 Why I think you will find the stylish 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.290
 if only the upper left corner is rounded 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.639
 is 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.470
 I have you guys a few months ago 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.270
 shown as with word fixed website 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.980
 and I have that too 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.780
 design element top left corner 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.240
 used simply because I rounded 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.300
 personally cool so find the top 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.950
 hire and best here 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.690
 starboot then when mobile phone goes up 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.790
 it will also be executed automatically and 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.070
 your corners are always so rounded 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.350
 also left in all munich apps like 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.210
 Here at the play store I see it's there 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.250
 cool is a gimmick but why of the 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.740
 cool android that you have stuff like that 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.970
 the funny one is the last app 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.010
 is called humana 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.660
 she is perfect for me i have 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.150

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.370
 internet radio podcast and that's too 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.200
 such an internet audio story would 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.120
 I certainly like it and that will be one 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.670
 here from professional speakers and 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.560
 readers read interesting articles 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.940
 if you go up here on romano then 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.660
 you can get a category here 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.120
 choose 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.520
 for example, entrepreneur fat 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.430
 lifestyle articles entertainment business 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.040

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.470
 on 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.020
 exactly and just read this article 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.060
 in front 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.070
 but mostly around the five minutes around 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.540

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.620
 really good title and as I said 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.990
 professional speaker 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.060
 only disadvantage is everything in English 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.590
 but if you speak the language 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.419
 then you can be real here by the way 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.210

 epilepsy missed the second video is 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.720
 a power word 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.690
 I think that's the album in Berlin 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.060
 an S-Bahn whole video necessarily 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.690

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.410
 presented and we started
