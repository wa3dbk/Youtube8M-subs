this image that has the rage in his

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.289 
this image that has the rage in his
forehead<00:00:14.860> -<00:00:15.160> I<00:00:15.309> can<00:00:15.429> just<00:00:15.580> add<00:00:15.790> a<00:00:15.849> little<00:00:16.090> bit

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
forehead - I can just add a little bit

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.450 
forehead - I can just add a little bit
of<00:00:16.330> that<00:00:16.810> shape<00:00:17.050> from<00:00:17.259> his<00:00:17.349> eyes<00:00:17.529> to<00:00:18.430> the

of that shape from his eyes to the

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.280 
of that shape from his eyes to the
character<00:00:19.180> it's<00:00:19.360> like<00:00:19.450> we<00:00:19.599> can<00:00:19.750> really<00:00:19.990> say

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
character it's like we can really say

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.440 
character it's like we can really say
okay<00:00:20.710> that's<00:00:20.919> a<00:00:21.040> really<00:00:21.460> cool<00:00:21.669> moment<00:00:21.910> then

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
okay that's a really cool moment then

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.179 
okay that's a really cool moment then
we're<00:00:22.540> gonna<00:00:22.660> push<00:00:22.899> the<00:00:23.050> camera<00:00:23.439> in<00:00:23.590> and<00:00:23.860> we're

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
we're gonna push the camera in and we're

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.859 
we're gonna push the camera in and we're
gonna<00:00:24.279> get<00:00:24.610> all<00:00:24.669> that<00:00:25.000> I<00:00:27.480> mean<00:00:28.480> there<00:00:28.630> are<00:00:28.660> two

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
gonna get all that I mean there are two

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.339 
gonna get all that I mean there are two
fundamental<00:00:29.290> changes<00:00:30.070> for<00:00:30.369> this<00:00:30.489> game<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
fundamental changes for this game the

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.700 
fundamental changes for this game the
first<00:00:32.590> is<00:00:32.829> that<00:00:33.550> it's<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.469> new<00:00:35.469> piece<00:00:35.590> of

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
first is that it's a new piece of

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.160 
first is that it's a new piece of
hardware<00:00:35.980> and<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.730> second<00:00:37.089> is<00:00:37.210> that<00:00:37.539> it's<00:00:38.019> a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
hardware and the second is that it's a

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.959 
hardware and the second is that it's a
new<00:00:38.289> character<00:00:38.679> and<00:00:39.039> those<00:00:39.219> I<00:00:39.460> think<00:00:39.609> are<00:00:39.910> the

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
new character and those I think are the

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.259 
new character and those I think are the
the<00:00:40.839> seed<00:00:41.079> decisions<00:00:41.589> that<00:00:41.980> almost<00:00:42.940> every

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
the seed decisions that almost every

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.329 
the seed decisions that almost every
other<00:00:43.359> decision<00:00:43.839> we<00:00:43.929> made<00:00:44.140> is<00:00:44.710> based<00:00:45.039> on<00:00:45.190> those

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
other decision we made is based on those

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:46.860 
other decision we made is based on those
two<00:00:45.399> decisions<00:00:46.300> and<00:00:46.449> they<00:00:46.510> were<00:00:46.629> probably

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
two decisions and they were probably

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.250 
two decisions and they were probably
made<00:00:47.199> three<00:00:47.679> years<00:00:47.710> ago<00:00:48.100> with<00:00:49.059> this<00:00:49.269> jumping

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
made three years ago with this jumping

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.349 
made three years ago with this jumping
hardware<00:00:50.589> you<00:00:50.769> really<00:00:51.010> have<00:00:51.249> you<00:00:52.179> know<00:00:52.269> the

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
hardware you really have you know the

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.619 
hardware you really have you know the
expectations<00:00:53.109> to<00:00:53.469> see<00:00:54.429> what<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.760> next-gen<00:00:55.179> and

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
expectations to see what is next-gen and

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.079 
expectations to see what is next-gen and
I<00:00:56.440> think<00:00:56.620> a<00:00:56.649> lot<00:00:56.800> of<00:00:56.829> that<00:00:56.949> is<00:00:57.100> just<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.789> photo

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
I think a lot of that is just the photo

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.380 
I think a lot of that is just the photo
graphics<00:00:58.510> better<00:00:58.719> lighting<00:00:59.069> smoother

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
graphics better lighting smoother

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.700 
graphics better lighting smoother
rendering<00:01:01.390> but<00:01:01.749> the<00:01:01.960> facial<00:01:02.260> capture<00:01:02.409> the

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
rendering but the facial capture the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.049 
rendering but the facial capture the
performances<00:01:03.370> that<00:01:03.429> are<00:01:03.670> coming<00:01:03.940> through

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
performances that are coming through

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.600 
performances that are coming through
just<00:01:04.870> this<00:01:04.960> fuller<00:01:05.320> cinematic<00:01:05.830> experience

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.650 

even<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.410> control<00:01:11.360> one<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> things

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
even that in control one of the things

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.690 
even that in control one of the things
that's<00:01:12.780> really<00:01:13.080> exciting<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.340> actually

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
that's really exciting is actually

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.360 
that's really exciting is actually
capturing<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.510> facial<00:01:15.990> animation<00:01:16.650> from<00:01:17.160> the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
capturing the facial animation from the

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.530 
capturing the facial animation from the
actors<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.790> actually<00:01:18.060> getting<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.420> those

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
actors and actually getting all those

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.300 
actors and actually getting all those
nuances<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.320> everything<00:01:19.800> that<00:01:19.950> they<00:01:20.070> bring

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
nuances and everything that they bring

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.580 
nuances and everything that they bring
to<00:01:20.370> their<00:01:20.730> performance<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.320> really

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
to their performance and it just really

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.050 
to their performance and it just really
helps<00:01:23.010> set<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.060> world<00:01:25.880> we<00:01:26.880> take

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
helps set you in that world we take

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.390 
helps set you in that world we take
