it<00:00:06.330> how<00:00:06.480> we<00:00:06.540> articulate<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.740> notes<00:00:07.950> when

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
it how we articulate the notes when

it how we articulate the notes when
we're<00:00:08.280> playing<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:09.420> simplest<00:00:09.870> articulation

we're playing the simplest articulation

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.560 
we're playing the simplest articulation
of<00:00:10.650> course<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:10.980> just<00:00:11.099> slurring<00:00:11.519> where<00:00:12.450> you

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
of course is just slurring where you

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.160 
of course is just slurring where you
basically<00:00:12.809> move<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.009> valves<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:15.170> adjust

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
basically move the valves and adjust

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.390

your<00:00:16.289> embouchure<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.650> go<00:00:16.770> from<00:00:16.949> one<00:00:17.100> note<00:00:17.279> to

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
your embouchure to go from one note to

different articulations and one of the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.029 
different articulations and one of the
things<00:00:24.000> particularly<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.810> single<00:00:25.769> tonguing

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039

more accurately and mostly we want to do
is<00:01:28.799> tongue<00:01:29.040> faster<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.140> it's<00:01:31.140> particularly

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
is tongue faster and it's particularly

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.670 
is tongue faster and it's particularly

that's why we want to fire single
tongues<00:02:26.930> when<00:02:27.110> we're<00:02:27.230> playing<00:02:27.379> a<00:02:27.530> fast

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
tongues when we're playing a fast

tongues when we're playing a fast
articulated<00:02:28.819> line<00:02:29.030> we<00:02:29.540> can<00:02:29.690> accent<00:02:30.200> any<00:02:30.440> note

we want how do you get a fast single

we want how do you get a fast single
tongue<00:02:34.060> practice<00:02:35.080> but<00:02:36.080> there's<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.290> certain

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
tongue practice but there's a certain

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.020 
tongue practice but there's a certain
way<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:36.769> can<00:02:36.920> practice<00:02:37.370> which<00:02:37.519> helps<00:02:37.819> I

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
way you can practice which helps I

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.089 
way you can practice which helps I
didn't<00:02:38.959> get<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.170> fast<00:02:39.440> single<00:02:39.769> thing<00:02:39.950> by

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
didn't get a fast single thing by

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.210 
didn't get a fast single thing by
practicing<00:02:40.730> fast<00:02:41.090> single<00:02:41.540> time<00:02:41.980> what<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.010> did

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
practicing fast single time what I did

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.110 
practicing fast single time what I did
was<00:02:43.340> play<00:02:43.610> very<00:02:43.849> slowly<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.750> very<00:02:45.650> staccato

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
was play very slowly a very staccato

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.319 
was play very slowly a very staccato
short<00:02:47.120> notes<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.720> very<00:02:48.380> loud<00:02:48.910> what<00:02:49.910> this<00:02:50.090> does

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
short notes and very loud what this does

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.660 
short notes and very loud what this does
is<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:51.170> works<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.650> muscles<00:02:52.040> in<00:02:52.250> your<00:02:52.430> tongue

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
is it works the muscles in your tongue

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.620 
is it works the muscles in your tongue
which<00:02:52.849> is<00:02:52.970> what<00:02:53.060> we're<00:02:53.180> trying<00:02:53.329> to<00:02:53.420> do<00:02:53.599> here

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
which is what we're trying to do here

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.000 
which is what we're trying to do here
we're<00:02:53.900> trying<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.110> get<00:02:54.230> our<00:02:54.349> tongue<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.620> move

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
we're trying to get our tongue to move

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.759 
we're trying to get our tongue to move
faster<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.970> technique<00:02:56.510> for<00:02:57.079> fast<00:02:57.349> single

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
faster the technique for fast single

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.319 
faster the technique for fast single
tonguing<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.190> exactly<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.730> same<00:02:58.879> as<00:02:59.060> slow

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
tonguing is exactly the same as slow

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.650 
tonguing is exactly the same as slow
single<00:02:59.720> single<00:03:00.079> tonguing<00:03:00.260> just<00:03:00.950> sped<00:03:01.160> up<00:03:01.660> okay

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
single single tonguing just sped up okay

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.300 
single single tonguing just sped up okay
so<00:03:03.140> we<00:03:03.260> don't<00:03:03.410> have<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.530> new<00:03:03.680> technique<00:03:04.010> here<00:03:04.220> we

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
so we don't have a new technique here we

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.780 
so we don't have a new technique here we
just<00:03:04.400> need<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:04.640> be<00:03:04.730> able<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:04.879> do<00:03:05.090> it<00:03:05.239> faster<00:03:05.900> and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
just need to be able to do it faster and

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.580 
just need to be able to do it faster and
better<00:03:07.790> muscles<00:03:08.209> in<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.660> tongue<00:03:08.900> will<00:03:09.440> do

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
better muscles in the tongue will do

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.020 
better muscles in the tongue will do
this<00:03:09.739> how<00:03:09.980> do<00:03:10.040> we<00:03:10.129> work<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.610> muscles<00:03:10.910> in<00:03:11.000> the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
this how do we work the muscles in the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.140 
this how do we work the muscles in the
tongue<00:03:11.329> the<00:03:11.870> best<00:03:12.140> way<00:03:12.379> is<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:13.129> play<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.730> just

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
tongue the best way is to play I just

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.559 
tongue the best way is to play I just
use<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.480> scale<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.140> play<00:03:15.829> very<00:03:16.129> short<00:03:16.640> because

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
use a scale and play very short because

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.330 
use a scale and play very short because
that<00:03:17.720> makes<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.079> tongue<00:03:18.290> allow<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.829> note<00:03:19.160> on

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
that makes the tongue allow the note on

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.650
