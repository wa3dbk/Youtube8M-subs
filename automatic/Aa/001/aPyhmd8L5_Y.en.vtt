00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:15.220
 very good I welcomed the temple of the 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.260
 time finally after a lot 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.810
 wait after hundreds of 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.130
 speculations and hundreds of rumors 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.530
 the new zelda you nintendo is here 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.960
 finally announced in his digital event that 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.720
 showed on e3 with a small trailer 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.330
 barely 50 seconds long and with 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.600
 a graphic style very similar to 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:41.050
 a mix between waters war and wind waker 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.710
 an incredible definition and that in addition 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.100
 will be released at the beginning for the year 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.290
 2015 is going to 2015 according to us 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.330
 account she numa the game will have a 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.950
 wide world full of places that 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.990
 to explore 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.810
 will be a world without limits that we can 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.340
 go where we want while in others 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.400
 titles of the saga we did not have the 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:08.500
 possibility of having an open world 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.900
 we will be completely free the trailer 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.490
 was recorded directly from the game is 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.640
 say it's not about a kinematics 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.960
 and none of that is direct material from 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.450
 game is to say what can be 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.729
 perfectly a gameplay with what I already 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.950
 we can get an idea of ​​the style 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.930
 graphic that will have the game which is 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.450
 probable only probable now is 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:35.140
 confirmed to run at 1080p and go to 60 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.850
 frames per second plus the character 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.759
 that we can see in the video on the back of 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.740
 a horse may not be a link since 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.470
 according to revealed the own numa 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.940
 he has never said that 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.940
 character be the link 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.780
 now we go with my personal opinion of 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.820
 cell with a world that fascinates me is that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.740
 fascinates me come on is something I was wearing 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.880
 asking for the saga you saw a long time ago 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.080
 finally nintendo has decided to do it 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.270
 did some tests some 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.640
 experiments with aline bring words 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.070
 giving us the possibility to choose in what 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.830
 order we wanted to go and do the dungeons 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.590
 but that's not the end it was not anymore 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.030
 that a thousandth part of what I believe 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.150
 what could we do in zelda for wii 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.430
 where it will surely resemble the world 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.260
 the sky ring the elder scrolls skyrim 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.069
 that is a completely open world 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.680
 let's go crazy freedom is concerned 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.840
 we can go there where our eyes 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.310
 can see we see the mountain of the far 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.379
 Well, we go there and we go to the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.379
 mountain we go without any limit 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.379
 and that honestly seems to me one of the 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.989
 best ideas of the last times of 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.299
 nintendo with the saga zelda seriously 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.889
 awesome let's pray with the style 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.150
 graphic after equis kate walsh by 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:53.090
 be a mix between wind waker 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.040
 virtual princess this new cd the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.340
 week seems to be a mix between sky 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.799
 wason and wind waker having a style a 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.659
 little more cartoon than this wadsworth to 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.819
 despite all the rumors aimed at 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.699
 a zelda much more adult and with a 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.669
 darker style that sense I feel 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:12.379
 A little disappointed, I do not know, I think 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.879
 it's been time to have a 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.569
 feedback a dark style to the hotel 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.730
 princess or majora's mask 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.950
 but it does not seem like an exterior 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.290
 How bad is that? I do not think it's a 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.269
 Bad graphic style for nothing is more to me 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.950
 It looks pretty good but also 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.540
 I understand the criticisms you have received 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.239
 there are people who have not done much 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.920
 grace that has that style but what 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.829
 same happens with wind waker wow 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.319
 He took an incredible amount of criticism 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.120
 for its related style looks finished 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.370
 being one of the best games of the 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.169
 saga in short that I love 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.590
 this graphic style besides this is not 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:49.239
 more than the first trailer remember as 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.889
 in hair users when they showed us the 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.260
 first trailer and everything they have 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:56.049
 graphically improved let's go this is 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.150
 it can only go for the better it also seems to be 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.310
 that will have a kind of style something 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.560
 futuristic but without exaggerating too much 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.569
 but it's not something we should miss 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.250
 since in I write the short we can see 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.040
 samples of civilizations something else 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.379
 advanced so this is also not something 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.540
 too surprising I do not know but good 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:17.019
 it's not that I have no idea how much 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.569
 point will come this futuristic style 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.639
 and I hope we do not see laser swords sni 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:24.319
 space ships nothing like that 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.539
 and it gives me shuttle I hope you have 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:28.789
 liked this video soon there will be 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.669
 more videos analyzing everything shown and 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.710
 talked about liu sow so they are 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.199
 very attentive to the channel because it is coming 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.550
 a storm of videos that the trifuerza 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.550
