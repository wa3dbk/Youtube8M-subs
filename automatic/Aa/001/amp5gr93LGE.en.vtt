time I start building this thing and so
I<00:00:16.859> hope<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.369> first<00:00:17.609> kind<00:00:17.849> of<00:00:17.910> X<00:00:18.060> Factor<00:00:18.269> the

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.509 
I hope this first kind of X Factor the

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.390 
I hope this first kind of X Factor the
video<00:00:18.720> would<00:00:18.869> be<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:19.230> basically<00:00:19.650> me<00:00:19.980> talking

obviously I need the old hammer and I

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.579 
obviously I need the old hammer and I
need<00:00:26.070> my<00:00:26.460> very<00:00:26.939> specialist<00:00:27.539> naval<00:00:28.079> pack<00:00:28.320> which

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589 
need my very specialist naval pack which

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.290 
need my very specialist naval pack which
was<00:00:28.769> given<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.070> me<00:00:30.439> so<00:00:31.439> we'll<00:00:31.560> see<00:00:31.739> how<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.949> goes

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
was given to me so we'll see how it goes

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.870 
was given to me so we'll see how it goes
what<00:00:33.300> they<00:00:33.420> also<00:00:33.570> recommend<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.680> using<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.580> a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
what they also recommend and using is a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.580 
what they also recommend and using is a
as<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.810> glue<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.920> add<00:00:38.160> additional<00:00:39.380> adhesive<00:00:40.380> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
as a glue to add additional adhesive to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.800 
as a glue to add additional adhesive to
the<00:00:40.620> ankle<00:00:40.920> joints<00:00:41.310> which<00:00:41.520> collectively<00:00:42.480> life

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810 
the ankle joints which collectively life

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.280 
the ankle joints which collectively life
together<00:00:42.990> and<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.790> can<00:00:45.030> nail<00:00:45.330> angle<00:00:45.930> but

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
together and so you can nail angle but

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.290 
together and so you can nail angle but
they<00:00:46.440> recommend<00:00:47.160> using<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.490> seven<00:00:47.820> type<00:00:48.060> of

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
they recommend using a seven type of

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.930 
they recommend using a seven type of
goal<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:48.810> is<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> polyurethane<00:00:49.590> glue<00:00:49.940> which

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
goal which is a polyurethane glue which

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.730 
goal which is a polyurethane glue which
I<00:00:51.060> presume<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.690> something<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.380> with<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
I presume is something to do with the

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.450 
I presume is something to do with the
actual<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:55.260> smell<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> gives<00:00:56.070> off<00:00:56.220> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
actual the smell that it gives off the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.070 
actual the smell that it gives off the
only<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.970> gives<00:00:57.120> off<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> actual<00:00:57.780> bees

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
only that gives off to the actual bees

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.500 
only that gives off to the actual bees
so<00:00:58.470> we'll<00:00:59.190> see<00:00:59.370> how<00:00:59.400> that<00:00:59.550> stuff<00:00:59.880> goes<00:01:00.150> but

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
so we'll see how that stuff goes but

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.249 
so we'll see how that stuff goes but
there's<00:01:01.290> a<00:01:01.350> polyurethane<00:01:01.950> as<00:01:02.400> I<00:01:02.490> said<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.259> and

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
there's a polyurethane as I said and and

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.410 
there's a polyurethane as I said and and
then<00:01:04.650> lastly<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.609> it's<00:01:05.789> all<00:01:05.909> built<00:01:06.149> which

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
then lastly what it's all built which

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.349 
then lastly what it's all built which
we're<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.719> to<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.899> next<00:01:07.109> year<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.210> they<00:01:09.210> got

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:09.359 
we're going to be next year and they got

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.029 
we're going to be next year and they got
some<00:01:09.539> good<00:01:09.570> protection<00:01:10.049> some<00:01:10.409> wood<00:01:10.590> preserver

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
some good protection some wood preserver

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.609 
some good protection some wood preserver
to<00:01:11.340> put<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.609> top<00:01:11.759> of<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:11.999> and<00:01:12.149> I'll<00:01:13.020> get<00:01:13.289> quite<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
to put on top of it and I'll get quite a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.399 
to put on top of it and I'll get quite a
lot<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.859> research<00:01:14.280> around<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.999> the<00:01:15.869> genuine

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
lot of research around this the genuine

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.919 
lot of research around this the genuine
or<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.100> general<00:01:17.420> preserve<00:01:18.420> which<00:01:18.569> is<00:01:18.689> used

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:18.929 
or the general preserve which is used

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:21.050

sometimes give us quite a bad smells of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.649

of<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.920> use<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.959> normal<00:01:57.959> pace<00:01:58.439> there<00:01:58.829> are

00:01:58.879 --> 00:01:58.889 
of if you use a normal pace there are

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:00.980 
of if you use a normal pace there are
two<00:01:59.039> problems<00:01:59.310> number<00:01:59.789> one<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.149> does<00:02:00.389> flake<00:02:00.719> in

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
two problems number one it does flake in

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.980 
two problems number one it does flake in
time

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
time

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.380 
time
it<00:02:02.200> looks<00:02:02.409> so<00:02:02.619> good<00:02:02.650> but<00:02:03.490> secondly<00:02:03.909> it<00:02:04.119> doesn't

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
it looks so good but secondly it doesn't

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.690 
it looks so good but secondly it doesn't
let<00:02:04.509> the<00:02:04.540> wood<00:02:04.810> breathe<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.490> what<00:02:06.670> that

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
let the wood breathe and what that

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.419 
let the wood breathe and what that
causes<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.270> problem<00:02:07.600> is<00:02:07.720> that<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:09.039> long<00:02:09.250> you

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
causes the problem is that the long you

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.339 
causes the problem is that the long you
have<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.819> hive<00:02:10.060> if<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.479> leave<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.140> it

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
have the hive if you leave it and it

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.800 
have the hive if you leave it and it
gets<00:02:11.530> very<00:02:11.620> hot<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:13.000> paint<00:02:13.300> actually

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
gets very hot and the paint actually

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.660 
gets very hot and the paint actually
stops<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.319> monsters<00:02:14.770> are<00:02:14.950> leaving<00:02:15.520> the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
stops the monsters are leaving the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.479 
stops the monsters are leaving the
highest<00:02:16.060> doesn't<00:02:16.390> let<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.510> hive<00:02:16.780> grieve<00:02:17.489> with

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
highest doesn't let the hive grieve with

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.100 
highest doesn't let the hive grieve with
obstacles<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.180> problem<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.750> what

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
obstacles of the problem and what

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.930 
obstacles of the problem and what
happens<00:02:20.530> if<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.680> get<00:02:20.800> built<00:02:21.099> you<00:02:21.370> grow<00:02:21.640> on<00:02:21.849> the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
happens if you get built you grow on the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.120 
happens if you get built you grow on the
inside<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.750> mold<00:02:23.140> because<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:24.040> have

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
inside and mold because you have

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.250 
inside and mold because you have
condensation<00:02:24.610> built<00:02:25.300> on<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.540> insides<00:02:26.080> of

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
condensation built on the insides of

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.020 
condensation built on the insides of
walls<00:02:26.319> which<00:02:27.190> obviously<00:02:27.489> isn't<00:02:27.700> great<00:02:28.000> for

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
walls which obviously isn't great for

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.850 
walls which obviously isn't great for
these<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:29.709> this<00:02:30.190> love<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.849> cuprinol

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
these and so this love the cuprinol

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.320 
these and so this love the cuprinol
wouldn't<00:02:32.860> protection<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.580> allows<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.150> wood

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
wouldn't protection it allows the wood

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.910 
wouldn't protection it allows the wood
to<00:02:34.360> breathe<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.930> also<00:02:35.170> should<00:02:35.470> give<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.830> a

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
to breathe and also should give it a

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.340 
to breathe and also should give it a
proof<00:02:36.160> finish<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.930> one<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.080> things<00:02:38.110> to

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
proof finish and one of the things to

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.900 
proof finish and one of the things to
make<00:02:38.500> was<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.739> fact<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.040> doesn't<00:02:39.220> flake<00:02:39.549> away<00:02:39.730> so

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
make was a fact it doesn't flake away so

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.300 
make was a fact it doesn't flake away so
it<00:02:40.299> is<00:02:40.420> gradually<00:02:41.049> fades<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.860> pop<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.250> up

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
it is gradually fades and you pop it up

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.350 
it is gradually fades and you pop it up
after<00:02:42.700> 23<00:02:43.150> years<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:45.489> also<00:02:45.850> I've<00:02:46.090> got<00:02:46.239> my

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
after 23 years so and also I've got my

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.789 
after 23 years so and also I've got my
instructions<00:02:46.870> as<00:02:47.019> well<00:02:47.049> which<00:02:47.350> is<00:02:47.410> good<00:02:47.680> and

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
instructions as well which is good and

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.130 
instructions as well which is good and
so<00:02:48.700> will<00:02:49.000> now<00:02:49.150> start<00:02:49.510> running<00:02:49.959> they<00:02:50.049> were

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
so will now start running they were

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.100 
so will now start running they were
going<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.380> start<00:02:50.620> building<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.660> sand<00:02:52.660> to

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
going to start building the sand to

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.900 
going to start building the sand to
start<00:02:53.410> with<00:02:53.620> then<00:02:54.190> I'm<00:02:54.340> gonna<00:02:54.430> go<00:02:54.640> into<00:02:54.819> the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
start with then I'm gonna go into the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.960 
start with then I'm gonna go into the
brood<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.989> big<00:02:56.200> blue<00:02:56.440> box<00:02:56.620> here<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.220> then<00:02:57.819> I'm

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
brood the big blue box here and then I'm

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.030 
brood the big blue box here and then I'm
gonna<00:02:58.060> start<00:02:58.390> doing<00:02:58.750> me<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.200> two<00:02:59.410> supers<00:02:59.920> that

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
gonna start doing me the two supers that

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.280 
gonna start doing me the two supers that
I've<00:03:00.160> got<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.489> top<00:03:00.730> here<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.290> memories

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
I've got the top here and memories

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.839 
I've got the top here and memories
itself<00:03:02.650> one<00:03:02.830> thing<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.040> still<00:03:03.250> have<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.580> do<00:03:03.700> is

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
itself one thing I still have to do is

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.810 
itself one thing I still have to do is
get<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.120> frames<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.690> go<00:03:04.810> inside<00:03:05.579> but<00:03:06.579> that's

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
get the frames to go inside but that's

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.880 
get the frames to go inside but that's
for<00:03:07.000> another<00:03:07.060> day<00:03:07.269> so<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.750> start<00:03:08.049> with<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.470> start

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
for another day so to start with I start

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.270 
for another day so to start with I start
building<00:03:09.190> this<00:03:09.310> hive<00:03:09.549> now<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.680> think<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
building this hive now I think the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.509 
building this hive now I think the
numbers<00:03:13.000> are<00:03:13.150> down<00:03:13.540> business<00:03:14.079> and<00:03:14.340> I'm<00:03:15.340> gonna

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
numbers are down business and I'm gonna

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.759 
numbers are down business and I'm gonna
start<00:03:15.760> by<00:03:15.880> building<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.329> actual<00:03:16.780> stand<00:03:17.410> that

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
start by building the actual stand that

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.220 
start by building the actual stand that
the<00:03:17.859> height<00:03:18.040> will<00:03:18.280> sizzle<00:03:18.489> now<00:03:19.299> you<00:03:19.359> built<00:03:20.049> up

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
the height will sizzle now you built up

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.590 
the height will sizzle now you built up
of<00:03:20.440> nine<00:03:20.799> pieces<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.459> individual<00:03:21.880> wood<00:03:22.060> which

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
of nine pieces of individual wood which

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.650 
of nine pieces of individual wood which
to<00:03:23.109> be<00:03:23.260> honest<00:03:23.560> look<00:03:23.739> seemingly<00:03:24.280> innocuous

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
to be honest look seemingly innocuous

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.420 
to be honest look seemingly innocuous
nothing<00:03:25.660> too<00:03:25.810> scary<00:03:26.170> about<00:03:26.320> them<00:03:26.709> you've<00:03:27.190> got

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
nothing too scary about them you've got

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.289 
nothing too scary about them you've got
two<00:03:27.700> bits<00:03:27.910> of<00:03:28.060> wood<00:03:28.299> with<00:03:29.070> small<00:03:30.070> grooves<00:03:30.489> in

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
two bits of wood with small grooves in

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.599 
two bits of wood with small grooves in
either<00:03:31.660> side<00:03:32.109> which<00:03:32.769> is<00:03:32.799> where<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.310> frame

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
either side which is where the frame

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.509 
either side which is where the frame
basically<00:03:34.150> sits<00:03:34.420> together<00:03:35.760> like<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:39.430> it

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
basically sits together like so so it

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.400 
basically sits together like so so it
goes<00:03:39.670> on<00:03:39.910> like<00:03:39.970> this<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.690> then<00:03:40.930> what<00:03:41.079> you<00:03:41.109> will

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
goes on like this and then what you will

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.080 
goes on like this and then what you will
have<00:03:41.680> n<00:03:41.980> DS<00:03:42.250> you'll<00:03:42.400> have<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.579> little<00:03:42.940> bit

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
have n DS you'll have a little bit

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.280 
have n DS you'll have a little bit
because<00:03:43.269> I<00:03:43.420> think<00:03:43.720> which<00:03:43.810> is<00:03:43.870> whether<00:03:44.109> the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
because I think which is whether the

the outside wall to the inside wall I

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.750 
the outside wall to the inside wall I
put<00:04:07.020> a<00:04:07.050> natural<00:04:07.380> stone<00:04:07.650> block<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.250> these<00:04:08.400> I

put a natural stone block to these I

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.759 
put a natural stone block to these I
thought<00:04:09.660> we<00:04:09.780> would<00:04:09.959> rather<00:04:10.140> goods<00:04:10.500> but

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
thought we would rather goods but

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.800 
thought we would rather goods but
they're<00:04:10.920> on<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.130> outside<00:04:11.550> don't<00:04:12.330> completely

they're on the outside don't completely

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.159 
they're on the outside don't completely
wrong<00:04:13.140> they<00:04:13.860> got<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.130> go<00:04:14.250> on<00:04:14.610> inside<00:04:15.150> snug<00:04:15.930> and

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
wrong they got to go on inside snug and

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.280 
wrong they got to go on inside snug and
flush<00:04:16.500> set<00:04:16.919> up<00:04:17.010> as<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.280> can<00:04:17.430> see<00:04:17.639> anything<00:04:18.290> on

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
flush set up as you can see anything on

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.740 
flush set up as you can see anything on
the<00:04:19.350> other<00:04:19.590> side<00:04:20.060> so<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.269> see<00:04:21.419> if<00:04:21.480> I<00:04:21.600> can

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
the other side so it see if I can

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.810 
the other side so it see if I can
actually<00:04:21.840> put<00:04:22.079> this<00:04:22.109> build<00:04:22.410> together<00:04:22.760> okay<00:04:23.760> so

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
actually put this build together okay so

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.970 
actually put this build together okay so
now<00:04:24.330> I've<00:04:24.450> done<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.720> base<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.620> interest

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
now I've done the base of the interest

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.610 
now I've done the base of the interest
and<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.580> because<00:04:27.540> I<00:04:27.570> know<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.870> perfect<00:04:28.050> my

little bit for you and one things are
short<00:04:37.380> I'm<00:04:37.560> not<00:04:37.710> surprised<00:04:38.100> that<00:04:38.340> these<00:04:38.520> are

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
short I'm not surprised that these are

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
short I'm not surprised that these are
sealing<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.120> little<00:04:39.330> bit<00:04:39.419> of<00:04:39.540> time<00:04:40.280> before<00:04:41.780> let

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
sealing a little bit of time before let

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.300 
sealing a little bit of time before let
me<00:04:42.900> feel<00:04:43.080> their<00:04:43.290> time<00:04:43.530> before<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:43.950> beach<00:04:44.130> it

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
me feel their time before the beach it

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.400 
me feel their time before the beach it
produced<00:04:44.700> because<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.180> glue<00:04:45.419> really<00:04:45.930> does<00:04:46.169> I

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
produced because the glue really does I

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.810 
produced because the glue really does I
mean<00:04:46.950> it's<00:04:47.460> incredibly<00:04:48.180> strong<00:04:48.540> stuff<00:04:48.900> and

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
mean it's incredibly strong stuff and

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.129 
mean it's incredibly strong stuff and
but<00:04:50.820> basically<00:04:51.210> on<00:04:51.419> this<00:04:51.570> one<00:04:51.810> I'm<00:04:51.900> just

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
but basically on this one I'm just

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.800 
but basically on this one I'm just
simply<00:04:52.350> put<00:04:53.310> in<00:04:53.400> global<00:04:53.790> natural<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.720> the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
simply put in global natural and the

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.560 
simply put in global natural and the
journey<00:04:55.139> this<00:04:55.620> is<00:04:55.800> I'm<00:04:56.790> put<00:04:57.030> on<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.210> landing

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
journey this is I'm put on the landing

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.790 
journey this is I'm put on the landing
strip<00:04:57.750> alone<00:04:58.169> so<00:04:58.500> this<00:04:58.650> could<00:04:58.770> be<00:04:58.890> fun<00:04:59.100> because

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
strip alone so this could be fun because

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.390 
strip alone so this could be fun because
it's<00:05:01.800> obviously<00:05:02.130> not<00:05:03.000> gonna<00:05:03.860> on<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:04.919> straight

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
it's obviously not gonna on a straight

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.980 
it's obviously not gonna on a straight
edge<00:05:05.669> has<00:05:05.940> been<00:05:06.120> perfectly<00:05:06.539> honest<00:05:06.840> i'm

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
edge has been perfectly honest i'm

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.020 
edge has been perfectly honest i'm
pretty<00:05:07.650> sure<00:05:07.950> you've<00:05:08.130> probably<00:05:08.340> not<00:05:08.640> meant<00:05:08.940> to

more difficult task of a broad rocks the

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.770 
more difficult task of a broad rocks the
simplest<00:06:34.789> and<00:06:35.789> everything<00:06:36.180> else<00:06:36.360> which<00:06:36.569> goes

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
simplest and everything else which goes

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.240 
simplest and everything else which goes
