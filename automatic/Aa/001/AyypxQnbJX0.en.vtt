ultrabooks here this one stands out for

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.119 
ultrabooks here this one stands out for
me<00:00:14.119> it's<00:00:14.270> the<00:00:14.420> lightest<00:00:15.020> pulse<00:00:15.650> what<00:00:15.920> there<00:00:16.039> is

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
me it's the lightest pulse what there is

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.359 
me it's the lightest pulse what there is
on<00:00:16.219> the<00:00:16.340> market<00:00:16.820> announcer<00:00:17.630> 999<00:00:18.590> grams<00:00:19.010> and

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
on the market announcer 999 grams and

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.660 
on the market announcer 999 grams and
then<00:00:19.610> came<00:00:20.029> to<00:00:20.180> the<00:00:20.270> market<00:00:20.450> at<00:00:20.750> 870<00:00:21.710> grams<00:00:21.980> so

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
then came to the market at 870 grams so

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.700 
then came to the market at 870 grams so
for<00:00:22.820> those<00:00:22.910> of<00:00:22.970> you<00:00:23.180> from<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:23.450> US<00:00:23.750> don't<00:00:24.500> know

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
for those of you from the US don't know

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.940 
for those of you from the US don't know
that's<00:00:24.950> like<00:00:26.050> 1.4<00:00:27.050> pounds<00:00:27.440> are<00:00:27.770> sort<00:00:27.920> of

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
that's like 1.4 pounds are sort of

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.880 
that's like 1.4 pounds are sort of
ridiculous<00:00:28.430> one<00:00:29.330> point<00:00:29.570> eight<00:00:29.780> okay<00:00:30.620> one

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
ridiculous one point eight okay one

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.850 
ridiculous one point eight okay one
point<00:00:31.130> eight<00:00:31.310> so<00:00:31.610> under<00:00:32.149> two<00:00:32.329> pounds<00:00:32.860> it's

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
point eight so under two pounds it's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.290 
point eight so under two pounds it's
actually<00:00:34.129> way<00:00:34.460> way<00:00:34.489> lighter<00:00:34.940> than<00:00:35.090> most

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
actually way way lighter than most

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.920 
actually way way lighter than most
netbooks

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
netbooks

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.599 
netbooks
who<00:00:36.199> netbooks<00:00:36.589> came<00:00:36.829> right<00:00:37.159> down<00:00:37.190> to<00:00:37.399> about

00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:37.609 
who netbooks came right down to about

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.149 
who netbooks came right down to about
one<00:00:37.820> point<00:00:37.969> one<00:00:38.089> kilo<00:00:38.510> this<00:00:39.260> is<00:00:39.409> about<00:00:39.649> twenty

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159 
one point one kilo this is about twenty

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:43.329 
one point one kilo this is about twenty
percent<00:00:40.280> lighter<00:00:41.089> than<00:00:41.329> that<00:00:41.620> so<00:00:42.620> I<00:00:43.039> guess<00:00:43.190> the

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
percent lighter than that so I guess the

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.759 
percent lighter than that so I guess the
downside<00:00:43.819> is<00:00:44.179> it's<00:00:44.659> gonna<00:00:44.929> probably<00:00:45.319> going<00:00:45.710> to

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
downside is it's gonna probably going to

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.340 
downside is it's gonna probably going to
have<00:00:45.949> a<00:00:46.249> smaller<00:00:46.879> battery<00:00:47.510> in<00:00:47.569> it<00:00:47.690> than<00:00:47.870> some

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
have a smaller battery in it than some

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.649 
have a smaller battery in it than some
of<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.499> others<00:00:48.859> we<00:00:49.850> don't<00:00:49.969> know<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.300> exact

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
of the others we don't know the exact

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.180 
of the others we don't know the exact
size<00:00:50.899> of<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.109> battery<00:00:51.260> doesn't<00:00:51.769> ever<00:00:52.010> put

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
size of the battery doesn't ever put

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.910 
size of the battery doesn't ever put
around<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.609> device<00:00:52.850> though<00:00:53.120> full<00:00:54.079> HDMI<00:00:54.620> USB
