00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.130
 Valley

 the fabão talks people beers is glass that 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.500
 in the new area bringing another video 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.720
 commented to you and we'll talk to you 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.970
 respect of a controversial subject that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.340
 in my morals I apologize 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.090
 Bitchy but I'm short as hell. 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.120
 old in morals had no need 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.130
 plus an unnecessary remaster comes in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.450
 Good, I do not know what's happening. 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.390
 production companies 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.059
 the same way that jane will leave the ps4 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.340
 net khugyani for those who do not know I already 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.620
 I even made a video talking about that. 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.559
 fucking came the game did not have the minimum 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.320
 need as well as numerous other 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.020
 games that made images like that there 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.899
 in china ron kong will be like flame 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.270
 sleeping dogs are connected is games on that 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.570
 style that they do not have the slightest need 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.970
 to make a game imasters because one 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.840
 maybe the game is already beautiful enough already 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.600
 it's good né in its original second form 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.610
 You will not be continued or whether it will have 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.220
 was not announced yet are already voting 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.770
 imasters and other old ones they do this 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.020
 or I do not know how old it can be for laziness 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.330
 make a new game can be by greed 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.270
 to always want to win is capitalism 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.180
 speak louder and put you in a game where 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.220
 I'll sell more, there's more in the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.530
 I just do not know how to see he has a game. 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.759
 you do not have the slightest need to 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.400
 masters series 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.939
 have games that are worth mentioning two 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.799
 examples the uncharted trilogy going 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.159
 be really worth it when it was released 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.380
 why are three games are type games 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.470
 grandly for three games there 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.850
 price of one and another will go out the boss 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.040
 next four years 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.439
 you have some reason to judge them 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.049
 new or if you will not play for the first time 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.899
 to know the franchise this is worth a lot 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.540
 another example is king lo and ludemar 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.429
 certified action throw is worth a lot 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.310
 worth buying guaranteed for everyone 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.069
 xbox one because there are several games 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.890
 another and will leave 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.680
 the glitter 5 that is this year neither will be 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.109
 reduced this year so you already have a 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.299
 reason to buy the realm of marketing 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:25.700
 collection is a game that is worth a lot 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.889
 Sorry, now which game is going? 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.540
 exit but give up this gameplay that you 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:33.019
 You are watching here is the thriller. 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.299
 remastered theoretically of protal 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.819
 old team, this is the game 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.099
 remastered that your 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.659
 brother the week at least by the trailer 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:46.609
 old, it's horrible, it's not old, it does not have 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:49.040
 human being is not the maximum of it is not 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:51.260
 another game plus a size that they 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.629
 made for the new generation to put the 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.689
 name shot that leads a modified 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:59.810
 in the lighting that the game simply 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:03.500
 the same but with the name and márcio 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.689
 I also know, there old, I do not know, I am 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.290
 Fuck the fuck because they do not do it. 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:11.090
 there if there in prototype 3 that the product is 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.909
 of 2 for me in my case was a 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.579
 shame the game is not bad but what is 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.310
 The quality of the product fell 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.220
 pep in the case the product type 1 was 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.590
 Old fuck was an excellent game that did not 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.199
 case of the two changed protagonist 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.090
 made a burden with history and I 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:32.629
 particularly did not like either I 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.879
 I played protec a product pep 2 and I do not know 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.220
 old the game had already dropped quality 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.650
 in my opinion and now go there and 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.560
 make one product and three do 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.629
 a bad game but if it is already on and loses a 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.949
 little or no sense of the 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:51.199
 logic, I do not know what your opinion is 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:53.900
 this is my opinion on moral 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:56.870
 They could make a maximum of game 5 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.900
 they could even be older the alert is only if 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.879
 prototype were launched three types already 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.599
 had announced 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:08.139
 only there the shot of the first protais 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.639
 Just for the people who did not play and such. 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:13.069
 producer an example of the galera 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.190
 here are happens with many games 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.659
 so I do not know where I 'm from. 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.759
 getting lost with this business of 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:22.099
 new game shot , I do not see it 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:24.830
 practically none there have new games 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.480
 have to fucking franchises have the producer 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.450
 more power forms 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.300
 Let's have a little notion here, what's the 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.520
 People are going to live in the past. 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.250
 create a new game and I'm sure that the 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.100
 industry will thank and the gamers 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.580
 more gamers want new games 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.500
 here 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.050
 so as I said there is information 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.950
 worthwhile, and there are others who 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.490
 perhaps this is villainy as I speak 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.170
 huh 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.270
 good people this is it there is not much more 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.430
 what to say thank you ever still 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.080
 life favorite in case you liked the video 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.790
 do not forget to sign up for the 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.280
 channel not to lose any video 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.050
 future is several days and when you 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.650
 What do you think you agree? 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.750
 that 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.990
 I do not agree, it 's not that I have a game. 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.410
 that is worth it but who plays that o 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.600
 talk, shall we? 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.000
 it's nothing against pep product but the 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.340
 The way they are doing is to 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.300
 The way the industry is following me 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.550
 I do not agree with the way that you know that 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.020
 producers are moving towards more 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.470
 That's it worth 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.470
 that hug
