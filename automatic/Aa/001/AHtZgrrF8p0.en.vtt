00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
I would encourage you to try a bunch of

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:51.439 
I would encourage you to try a bunch of
different<00:00:50.370> options<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.089> what<00:00:51.269> I've

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
different options out it's what I've

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.989 
different options out it's what I've
done<00:00:51.769> and<00:00:52.769> I<00:00:52.859> find<00:00:53.249> that<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.670> different

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
done and I find that for different

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:55.639 
done and I find that for different
situations<00:00:54.179> I<00:00:54.690> use<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> different<00:00:55.289> shoe<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.589> I

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
situations I use a different shoe so I

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.340 
situations I use a different shoe so I
first<00:00:55.829> want<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.069> go<00:00:56.190> through<00:00:56.429> is<00:00:57.350> something

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
trail runner which is going to be a lot

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.929 
trail runner which is going to be a lot
lighter<00:01:15.329> than<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:16.130> but<00:01:17.130> for<00:01:17.430> me<00:01:17.579> when<00:01:17.789> it's

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
lighter than this but for me when it's

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.090 
lighter than this but for me when it's
going<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.149> be<00:01:18.270> muddy<00:01:18.539> and<00:01:18.810> nasty<00:01:18.950> which<00:01:19.950> it

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
going to be muddy and nasty which it

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.039 
going to be muddy and nasty which it
frequently<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.789> in<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.420> Adirondacks

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
frequently is in the Adirondacks

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.289 
frequently is in the Adirondacks
sometimes<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> waterproof<00:01:23.789> shoe<00:01:23.820> like

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
sometimes I like a waterproof shoe like

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.120 
sometimes I like a waterproof shoe like
this<00:01:25.939> yes<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.149> a<00:01:27.210> little<00:01:27.450> heavier<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
this yes it's a little heavier but the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.310 
this yes it's a little heavier but the
trails<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.240> Adirondacks<00:01:30.930> tend<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> be

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
trails in the Adirondacks tend to be

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.639 
trails in the Adirondacks tend to be
very<00:01:31.740> very<00:01:32.280> stony<00:01:33.000> you're<00:01:33.869> climbing<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> lot

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
very very stony you're climbing on a lot

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.639 
very very stony you're climbing on a lot
of<00:01:34.770> boulders<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.299> sometimes<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.409> want<00:01:37.619> a

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
of boulders so sometimes you want a

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.609 
of boulders so sometimes you want a
little<00:01:37.680> more<00:01:37.979> support<00:01:39.170> especially<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
little more support especially in the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.840 
little more support especially in the
beginning<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:41.100> you're<00:01:41.250> starting<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:41.729> out

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
beginning if you're starting to get out

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.109 
beginning if you're starting to get out
of<00:01:42.000> boots<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:42.689> your<00:01:43.170> feet<00:01:43.500> will<00:01:43.799> hurt

of boots because your feet will hurt

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.209 
of boots because your feet will hurt
badly<00:01:45.119> if<00:01:45.719> you<00:01:46.020> try<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.560> jump<00:01:46.859> right<00:01:46.950> into

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
badly if you try to just jump right into

smooth<00:01:54.390> footpaths<00:01:55.189> but<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.490> Adirondacks<00:01:57.030> are

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
smooth footpaths but the Adirondacks are

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.389 
smooth footpaths but the Adirondacks are
very<00:01:57.479> rocky<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.229> sometimes<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.219> need<00:01:59.340> a

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
very rocky so sometimes you need a

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.639 
very rocky so sometimes you need a
little<00:01:59.729> extra<00:02:00.119> support<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.170> cushion<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
little extra support and cushion on the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.210 
little extra support and cushion on the
bottom<00:02:01.969> so<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.270> definitely<00:02:03.479> an<00:02:03.960> option

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
bottom so this is definitely an option

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.400 
bottom so this is definitely an option
and<00:02:05.820> as<00:02:05.970> far<00:02:06.180> as<00:02:06.240> Merrill<00:02:06.780> goes<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.140> think<00:02:07.320> they

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
and as far as Merrill goes I think they

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.050 
and as far as Merrill goes I think they
make<00:02:07.590> some<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.920> best<00:02:07.950> stuff<00:02:08.399> out<00:02:08.670> there

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
make some of the best stuff out there

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.720 
make some of the best stuff out there
period<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.440> don't<00:02:11.130> think<00:02:11.400> you're<00:02:11.550> ever

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
period so I don't think you're ever

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.190 
period so I don't think you're ever
going<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> buy<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.360> Merrill<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.870> be

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
going to buy and Merrill and be

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.320 
going to buy and Merrill and be
disappointed<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.790> only<00:02:14.970> way<00:02:15.060> you'd<00:02:15.210> be

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
disappointed the only way you'd be

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.090 
disappointed the only way you'd be
disappointed<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.470> were<00:02:16.710> expecting

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
disappointed is if you were expecting

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.820 
disappointed is if you were expecting
something<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.990> shoe<00:02:19.170> wasn't<00:02:19.560> designed

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
something that the shoe wasn't designed

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.300 
something that the shoe wasn't designed
for<00:02:20.330> or<00:02:21.330> something<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.530> nature<00:02:22.770> if<00:02:23.190> it

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
for or something of that nature if it

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.010 
for or something of that nature if it
didn't<00:02:23.550> fit<00:02:23.730> right<00:02:23.760> but<00:02:24.120> as<00:02:24.210> far<00:02:24.390> as<00:02:24.420> quality

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
didn't fit right but as far as quality

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.980 
didn't fit right but as far as quality
goes<00:02:25.110> Merrill<00:02:25.830> some<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.190> best<00:02:26.370> so

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
goes Merrill some of the best so

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.150 
goes Merrill some of the best so
definitely<00:02:27.990> something<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.470> look<00:02:28.500> for<00:02:28.890> when

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160
