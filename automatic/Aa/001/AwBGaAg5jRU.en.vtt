that a number have actually been
followed<00:01:11.070> already<00:01:15.650> throughout<00:01:16.650> Asia<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:18.420> we

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
followed already throughout Asia and we

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.950 
followed already throughout Asia and we
are<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.439> fact<00:01:19.710> all<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> way<00:01:20.250> down<00:01:20.549> here<00:01:21.030> in

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
are in fact all the way down here in

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.350 
are in fact all the way down here in
Sydney<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.830> gives<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.729> some<00:01:23.939> idea<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
Sydney so it gives you some idea of the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.240 
Sydney so it gives you some idea of the
sort<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:25.970> propagation<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.390> get<00:01:27.570> pretty

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
sort of propagation you can get pretty

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.420 
sort of propagation you can get pretty
impressive<00:01:29.250> stuff

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.639 

lots<00:01:34.430> of<00:01:34.549> darlings<00:01:34.969> coming<00:01:35.390> through<00:01:38.649> okay

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
lots of darlings coming through okay

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.980 
lots of darlings coming through okay
maybe<00:01:40.070> with<00:01:40.340> tonight<00:01:40.880> is<00:01:41.119> that<00:01:41.360> it's

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
maybe with tonight is that it's

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.960 
maybe with tonight is that it's
approximately<00:01:42.560> with<00:01:42.710> dating<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:43.280> propagation

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
approximately with dating so propagation

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.719 
approximately with dating so propagation
is<00:01:44.929> mostly<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.039> high<00:01:46.130> frequencies<00:01:46.700> that

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
is mostly to the high frequencies that

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.490 
is mostly to the high frequencies that
time<00:01:47.240> we<00:01:47.360> tuned<00:01:47.600> at<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.810> moment<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.289> think

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
time we tuned at the moment and I think

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:57.910 
time we tuned at the moment and I think
receivers<00:01:48.950> tuned<00:01:49.159> to<00:01:49.420> 26<00:01:50.420> bits<00:01:53.439> yeah<00:01:54.439> 22<00:01:55.569> ya<00:01:56.920> 21

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
receivers tuned to 26 bits yeah 22 ya 21

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.160 
receivers tuned to 26 bits yeah 22 ya 21
megabits<00:01:58.429> so<00:01:58.700> they've<00:01:59.539> given<00:01:59.689> the<00:01:59.840> time<00:02:00.020> of

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
megabits so they've given the time of

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.279 
megabits so they've given the time of
day<00:02:00.319> with<00:02:00.560> conditions<00:02:01.039> and<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:03.110> rule<00:02:03.259> of

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
day with conditions and the rule of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.929 
day with conditions and the rule of
fungal<00:02:03.740> we've<00:02:03.830> learned<00:02:04.069> it's<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.759> high<00:02:04.880> the

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
fungal we've learned it's the high the

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.449 
fungal we've learned it's the high the
Sun<00:02:05.270> behind<00:02:05.420> frequency<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:06.380> it's<00:02:06.560> into<00:02:06.950> the

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
Sun behind frequency so it's into the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.089 
Sun behind frequency so it's into the
higher<00:02:07.640> frequencies<00:02:08.149> at<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.750> moment<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:09.860> I've

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
higher frequencies at the moment so I've

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.600 
higher frequencies at the moment so I've
yeah<00:02:10.310> it's<00:02:10.429> working<00:02:10.549> poker<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.920> if<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.459> want

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
yeah it's working poker and if you want

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.089 
yeah it's working poker and if you want
to<00:02:13.670> record<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:14.390> disc<00:02:14.709> we're<00:02:15.709> currently

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
to record the disc we're currently

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.970 
to record the disc we're currently
sampling<00:02:16.760> at<00:02:18.099> one<00:02:19.099> mega<00:02:19.310> samples<00:02:19.670> per<00:02:19.790> second

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
sampling at one mega samples per second

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.170 
sampling at one mega samples per second
but<00:02:21.980> if<00:02:22.099> you<00:02:22.220> want<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.489> bump<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.760> up<00:02:22.880> you

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
but if you want to bump that up you

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.330 
but if you want to bump that up you
might<00:02:23.329> get<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:23.660> little<00:02:23.810> bit<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.250> contention<00:02:25.250> on

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
might get a little bit of contention on

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.220 
might get a little bit of contention on
the<00:02:25.610> USB<00:02:25.910> bus<00:02:26.299> in<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:27.620> situation<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:30.110> might

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
the USB bus in this situation you might

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.460 
the USB bus in this situation you might
consider<00:02:30.410> getting<00:02:30.829> a<00:02:31.130> firewire<00:02:32.470> external

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
consider getting a firewire external

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.440 
consider getting a firewire external
hard<00:02:33.650> drive<00:02:33.829> enclosure<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.670> hooking<00:02:35.030> up<00:02:35.209> by

hard drive enclosure and hooking up by

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.370 
hard drive enclosure and hooking up by
the<00:02:35.510> firewire<00:02:36.140> bus<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:39.200> don't

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
the firewire bus so that you don't

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
the firewire bus so that you don't
overwork<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.890> single<00:02:40.280> USB<00:02:40.870> bus<00:02:42.250> using<00:02:43.250> a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.680 

wow<00:02:48.430> those<00:02:48.910> planes<00:02:50.940> also<00:02:51.940> we<00:02:52.060> are<00:02:52.090> using<00:02:52.300> a

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
wow those planes also we are using a

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.860 
wow those planes also we are using a
four-element<00:02:53.380> yagi<00:02:53.890> are<00:02:53.980> talking<00:02:54.340> about<00:02:54.400> a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
four-element yagi are talking about a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.750 
four-element yagi are talking about a
22-minute<00:02:55.870> whole<00:02:56.170> mountain<00:02:57.040> top<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.220> AC

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
22-minute whole mountain top of AC

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.600 
22-minute whole mountain top of AC
rotator<00:02:58.300> so<00:02:58.720> it's<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:59.110> for<00:02:59.739> instance<00:02:59.800> we've<00:03:00.489> got

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
rotator so it's a for instance we've got

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.740
