are the LED bulbs that he recommended

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.210 
are the LED bulbs that he recommended
and<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.180> went<00:01:09.329> ahead<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.630> order<00:01:10.500> ordered<00:01:11.130> about

$10 worth they sent me five and I was

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.920 
$10 worth they sent me five and I was
shipping<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.610> think<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.820> was<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.000> 1150

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930

volt<00:01:28.830> there's<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> resistor<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.240> already<00:01:30.450> put<00:01:30.630> in

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
volt there's a resistor I already put in

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.140 
volt there's a resistor I already put in
there<00:01:30.870> so<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.140> already<00:01:31.320> rewired<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:33.060> can

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
there so it's already rewired you can

there so it's already rewired you can
see<00:01:33.360> here<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> did<00:01:34.049> was<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.260> took<00:01:34.440> an<00:01:34.920> old

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
see here what I did was I took an old

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.660 
see here what I did was I took an old
yard<00:01:35.850> lamp<00:01:36.860> took<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> housing<00:01:38.340> from<00:01:38.490> that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
yard lamp took the housing from that

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
yard lamp took the housing from that
taped<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.690> on<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:41.630> inside<00:01:42.630> there's<00:01:42.780> actually

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
taped it on to a inside there's actually

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.250 
taped it on to a inside there's actually
oh<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.430> old<00:01:44.580> wiring<00:01:44.850> actually<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.810> extra

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
oh the old wiring actually the extra

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.990 
oh the old wiring actually the extra
wiring<00:01:46.470> from<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.010> power<00:01:47.190> supply<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:47.700> my

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
wiring from a power supply for my

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.780 
wiring from a power supply for my
computer<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.260> bulbs<00:01:49.710> prongs<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.520> happened

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
computer the bulbs prongs just happened

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.340 
computer the bulbs prongs just happened
to<00:01:50.850> fit<00:01:51.000> perfectly<00:01:51.240> inside<00:01:51.659> there<00:01:52.020> I'll<00:01:52.140> show

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
to fit perfectly inside there I'll show

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.620 
to fit perfectly inside there I'll show
you<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.530> shot<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.180> once<00:01:54.510> I

you a shot of that and then once I

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.990 
you a shot of that and then once I
worried<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.350> there<00:01:55.619> right<00:01:56.280> now<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.820> one

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
worried that on there right now this one

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.300 
worried that on there right now this one
it's<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.600> finished<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.310> temporarily

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
it's not finished I just temporarily

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.270 
it's not finished I just temporarily
have<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.610> clipped<00:01:59.790> on<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.330> battery

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
have it clipped on to the battery

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.160 
have it clipped on to the battery
positive<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.400> negative<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.939> light<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.270> up<00:02:03.420> but

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
positive and negative to light it up but

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.700 
positive and negative to light it up but
this<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.650> complete<00:02:06.350> you<00:02:07.350> actually<00:02:07.619> may<00:02:07.680> be

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
this one is complete you actually may be

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.539 
this one is complete you actually may be
able<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.979> see<00:02:08.189> right<00:02:08.369> there<00:02:08.610> there's<00:02:09.269> that<00:02:10.549> we

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
able to see right there there's that we

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.670 
able to see right there there's that we
use<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.849> light<00:02:12.000> from<00:02:12.090> one<00:02:12.269> filler<00:02:12.680> well

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
use the light from one filler well

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.920 
use the light from one filler well
you'll<00:02:14.610> see<00:02:14.819> there<00:02:15.000> that's<00:02:15.299> being<00:02:15.510> held<00:02:15.689> on<00:02:15.810> by

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
you'll see there that's being held on by

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.649 
you'll see there that's being held on by
rubber<00:02:16.169> band<00:02:16.549> these<00:02:17.549> are<00:02:17.730> all<00:02:17.879> parts<00:02:18.209> from<00:02:18.480> an

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
rubber band these are all parts from an

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.940 
rubber band these are all parts from an
old<00:02:19.290> outdoor

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.149 

LED<00:02:22.950> solar<00:02:23.730> unit<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.420> was<00:02:24.569> broken<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.200> was

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
LED solar unit that was broken and was

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.830 
LED solar unit that was broken and was
really<00:02:26.519> garbage<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.629> I<00:02:27.659> reused<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:30.690> can

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
really garbage but I reused it you can

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.110 
really garbage but I reused it you can
see<00:02:31.049> there<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.620> wire<00:02:31.860> for<00:02:33.500> from<00:02:34.500> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
see there is the wire for from the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.729 
see there is the wire for from the
computer<00:02:36.120> back<00:02:36.299> up<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.750> snipped<00:02:37.349> all<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.590> ones

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
computer back up I snipped all the ones

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.320 
computer back up I snipped all the ones
I<00:02:37.830> didn't<00:02:38.040> need<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.220> use<00:02:38.549> those<00:02:38.910> wiring<00:02:39.209> for

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
I didn't need to use those wiring for

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.509 
I didn't need to use those wiring for
other<00:02:39.420> things<00:02:39.709> just<00:02:40.709> have<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:41.010> running<00:02:41.370> up

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
other things just have to running up

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.360 
other things just have to running up
here<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.819> even<00:02:42.180> used<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.480> housing<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:44.220> that

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
here I even used the housing and that

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.110 
here I even used the housing and that
one's<00:02:45.319> fully<00:02:46.319> wired<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.340> clamp

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
one's fully wired to be a clamp

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.069 
one's fully wired to be a clamp
so<00:02:49.019> use<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.590> car<00:02:49.890> or<00:02:51.590> anywhere<00:02:52.590> where<00:02:54.079> 12

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
so use it in a car or anywhere where 12

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.309 
so use it in a car or anywhere where 12
volts<00:02:55.349> on<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> battery<00:02:55.829> are<00:02:56.239> accessible

volts on a battery are accessible

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.349 
volts on a battery are accessible
they're<00:02:58.319> actually<00:02:58.650> very<00:02:58.859> bright<00:02:59.220> they<00:02:59.790> fill

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
they're actually very bright they fill

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.759 
they're actually very bright they fill
the<00:03:00.510> whole<00:03:00.660> room<00:03:00.690> really<00:03:01.079> nicely<00:03:01.260> especially

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
the whole room really nicely especially

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.490 
the whole room really nicely especially
with<00:03:02.069> two<00:03:02.220> here<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:03.180> does<00:03:03.359> the<00:03:03.510> trick<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:04.109> might

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
with two here it does the trick I might

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.280 
with two here it does the trick I might
do<00:03:04.620> some<00:03:04.799> lighting<00:03:05.010> demos<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.780> also<00:03:06.780> took<00:03:06.959> an

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
do some lighting demos I also took an

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.819 
do some lighting demos I also took an
old<00:03:08.450> battery-operated<00:03:09.450> camping<00:03:10.379> light<00:03:10.590> and

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
old battery-operated camping light and

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.220 
old battery-operated camping light and
the<00:03:11.489> batteries<00:03:11.879> had<00:03:12.090> corroded<00:03:12.780> over<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.140> it's

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
the batteries had corroded over and it's

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.680 
the batteries had corroded over and it's
pretty<00:03:13.410> funky<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.310> threw<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.150> bottom<00:03:15.420> away

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
pretty funky so I threw the bottom away

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.900 
pretty funky so I threw the bottom away
cut<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.470> bottom<00:03:16.709> out<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.010> wired<00:03:17.910> on<00:03:19.910> some

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
cut the bottom out and wired on some

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.289 
cut the bottom out and wired on some
wiring<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.720> have<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.019> as<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> either<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:23.579> car<00:03:23.879> or

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
wiring to have it as a either in car or

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.280 
wiring to have it as a either in car or
anywhere<00:03:24.599> where<00:03:24.629> there's<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.959> cigarette

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
anywhere where there's a cigarette

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.080 
anywhere where there's a cigarette
lighter<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.829> can<00:03:25.950> plug<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.310> right<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.579> now<00:03:26.790> and

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
lighter you can plug it right in now and

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.059 
lighter you can plug it right in now and
it's<00:03:27.750> running<00:03:27.900> one<00:03:28.049> of<00:03:28.139> these<00:03:28.230> bulbs<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.769> left

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
it's running one of these bulbs I left

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.909 
it's running one of these bulbs I left
it<00:03:29.220> on<00:03:29.340> all<00:03:29.579> night<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.930> didn't<00:03:31.290> change<00:03:31.349> my

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
it on all night and it didn't change my

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.800 
it on all night and it didn't change my
battery<00:03:32.310> voltage<00:03:32.730> at<00:03:32.910> all

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
battery voltage at all

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.839 
battery voltage at all
right<00:03:34.319> now<00:03:34.440> my<00:03:34.590> battery<00:03:34.889> voltage<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.340> low<00:03:35.579> just

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
right now my battery voltage is low just

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.930 
right now my battery voltage is low just
because<00:03:36.180> I've<00:03:36.450> been<00:03:36.959> doing<00:03:37.169> stuff<00:03:37.470> all<00:03:37.650> day

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
because I've been doing stuff all day

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.870 
because I've been doing stuff all day
but<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:40.620> was<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.769> twelve<00:03:41.099> point<00:03:41.280> six<00:03:41.519> volts

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
but it was a twelve point six volts

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.610 
but it was a twelve point six volts
right<00:03:42.000> now<00:03:42.150> it's<00:03:42.870> also<00:03:43.019> been<00:03:43.169> really<00:03:43.290> cloudy

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
right now it's also been really cloudy

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.099 
right now it's also been really cloudy
so<00:03:43.859> I<00:03:43.889> went<00:03:44.099> ahead<00:03:44.250> additional<00:03:44.940> charge<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.049> I'm

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
so I went ahead additional charge so I'm

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.599 
so I went ahead additional charge so I'm
gonna<00:03:46.230> have<00:03:46.319> to<00:03:46.380> turn<00:03:46.650> this<00:03:46.709> guy<00:03:46.980> off<00:03:47.010> soon

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
gonna have to turn this guy off soon

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.699 
gonna have to turn this guy off soon
but<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.329> see<00:03:48.510> it's<00:03:48.870> not<00:03:49.169> running<00:03:49.470> off

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
but you can see it's not running off

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.580 
but you can see it's not running off
this<00:03:49.889> inverter<00:03:50.900> these<00:03:51.900> lights<00:03:52.139> are<00:03:52.260> directly

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
this inverter these lights are directly

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.420 
this inverter these lights are directly
power<00:03:52.829> DC<00:03:53.400> 12-volt<00:03:54.060> off<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.889> battery<00:03:55.889> backup

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
power DC 12-volt off the battery backup

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.309 
power DC 12-volt off the battery backup
and<00:03:59.120> fairly<00:04:00.120> easy<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.450> turn<00:04:00.630> off<00:04:00.840> if<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.079> needed

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
and fairly easy to turn off if I needed

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.740 
and fairly easy to turn off if I needed
to<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:02.720> then<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.750> just<00:04:05.120> clamp<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.239> on<00:04:06.480> for

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
to and then I just clamp that on for

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.039 
to and then I just clamp that on for
safety<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:08.790> can<00:04:08.970> see<00:04:09.209> these<00:04:09.359> things<00:04:09.599> are

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
safety and you can see these things are

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.219 
safety and you can see these things are
very<00:04:11.900> bright<00:04:14.329> and<00:04:15.329> I'll<00:04:15.540> have<00:04:15.720> like<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:15.989> said

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
very bright and I'll have like I said

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.960 
very bright and I'll have like I said

done anything on my solar for a while
I've<00:04:27.060> been<00:04:27.090> experimenting<00:04:27.720> with<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:27.990> lot<00:04:28.050> of

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
I've been experimenting with a lot of

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.190 
I've been experimenting with a lot of
stuff<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:29.760> should<00:04:29.789> be<00:04:30.030> getting<00:04:30.630> more<00:04:30.840> from<00:04:31.050> me

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
stuff you should be getting more from me

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.560 
stuff you should be getting more from me
soon

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.129 

other<00:04:34.570> than<00:04:34.690> that<00:04:36.720> funding<00:04:37.720> I<00:04:37.810> can't<00:04:38.020> really

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
other than that funding I can't really

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.659 
other than that funding I can't really
expand<00:04:38.530> so<00:04:38.770> right<00:04:38.949> now<00:04:39.070> I'm<00:04:39.160> going<00:04:39.370> more

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
expand so right now I'm going more

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.050 
expand so right now I'm going more
recycled<00:04:40.180> route<00:04:40.330> these<00:04:41.050> lamps<00:04:41.880> you<00:04:42.880> could

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
wire up to daisy chain them if you

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.580 
wire up to daisy chain them if you

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
wanted to 12 volts right off of it it's

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.129 
wanted to 12 volts right off of it it's

this isn't weather tolerant because

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.020 
this isn't weather tolerant because
there's<00:05:01.870> a<00:05:01.930> gap<00:05:02.139> in<00:05:02.350> here<00:05:02.620> and<00:05:02.850> I'd<00:05:03.850> have<00:05:04.000> to

there's a gap in here and I'd have to

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.129 
there's a gap in here and I'd have to
seal<00:05:04.330> it<00:05:04.509> but<00:05:04.800> it<00:05:05.800> is<00:05:06.510> useful<00:05:07.510> in<00:05:07.840> a<00:05:07.960> power

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
seal it but it is useful in a power
