using<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.360> strange<00:00:42.780> magnetic<00:00:43.140> caverns<00:00:44.070> found

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
using the strange magnetic caverns found

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.180 
using the strange magnetic caverns found
below<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.480> vehicle<00:00:46.079> speeds<00:00:46.500> past<00:00:46.890> enemies

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
below this vehicle speeds past enemies

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.160 
below this vehicle speeds past enemies
and<00:00:47.700> quickly<00:00:48.660> disposes<00:00:49.620> them<00:00:53.449> all<00:00:54.449> right<00:00:54.840> so

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and quickly disposes them all right so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.350 
and quickly disposes them all right so
this<00:00:55.350> set<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.860> actually<00:00:56.699> made<00:00:56.910> from<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
this set is actually made from the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.529 
this set is actually made from the
leftover<00:00:57.600> parts<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.680> bintang<00:00:59.280> fight<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.300> that

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
leftover parts of bintang fight so that

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.139 
leftover parts of bintang fight so that
means<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.530> make<00:01:01.739> both<00:01:01.980> bit<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.609> byte<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
means you can make both bit and byte and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.380 
means you can make both bit and byte and
the<00:01:03.719> beast<00:01:03.960> machine<00:01:04.439> at<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.070> same<00:01:05.339> time<00:01:05.670> so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the beast machine at the same time so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.570 
the beast machine at the same time so
with<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.900> said<00:01:07.260> let's<00:01:07.799> move<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
with that said let's move on with the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.120 
with that said let's move on with the
build<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.479> one<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.350> right<00:01:10.560> now<00:01:10.740> working

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
build for this one so right now working

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.719 
build for this one so right now working
on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.820> seat<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.260> Beast<00:01:13.979> pilot<00:01:14.549> is

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
on the seat that the Beast pilot is

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.929 
on the seat that the Beast pilot is
clamped<00:01:15.240> into<00:01:16.009> you<00:01:17.009> can't<00:01:17.280> actually<00:01:17.460> fit

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
clamped into you can't actually fit

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.760 
clamped into you can't actually fit
because<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.689> his<00:01:18.810> head<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> little<00:01:19.650> too

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
because of his head it's a little too

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.850 
because of his head it's a little too
big<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.610> think<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.570> good<00:01:21.720> trade-off<00:01:22.049> so

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
big but I think it's a good trade-off so

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.740 
big but I think it's a good trade-off so
we<00:01:23.549> got<00:01:23.790> his<00:01:24.420> Talon<00:01:24.990> arms<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:26.580> working<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.509> his

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
we got his Talon arms and working on his

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
we got his Talon arms and working on his
Talon<00:01:28.680> legs

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
Talon legs

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.700 
Talon legs
he<00:01:31.729> has<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:31.850> lot<00:01:32.149> of<00:01:32.299> talents<00:01:35.320> alright<00:01:36.320> so<00:01:36.560> we've

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
he has a lot of talents alright so we've

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.219 
he has a lot of talents alright so we've
got<00:01:36.829> these<00:01:37.039> little<00:01:37.280> heal<00:01:37.609> parts<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.359> then

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
got these little heal parts and then

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.490 
got these little heal parts and then
these<00:01:39.710> parts<00:01:40.509> so<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:41.570> stick<00:01:41.810> those<00:01:42.020> parts

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
these parts so you stick those parts

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.859 
these parts so you stick those parts
onto<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.490> part<00:01:43.819> and<00:01:44.750> now<00:01:44.869> it's<00:01:45.049> a<00:01:45.110> big<00:01:45.289> part

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
onto that part and now it's a big part

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.949 
onto that part and now it's a big part
all<00:01:47.869> right<00:01:48.079> working<00:01:48.530> on<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.209> sort<00:01:50.209> of<00:01:50.329> organic

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
all right working on the sort of organic

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
shoulder pad type of things well that

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.160 
shoulder pad type of things well that
was<00:01:53.780> quick<00:01:54.369> now<00:01:55.369> working<00:01:55.850> on<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.920> head<00:01:57.920> tail

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
was quick now working on the head tail

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.389 
was quick now working on the head tail
thing<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:01.340> should<00:02:01.610> stuff<00:02:02.590> all<00:02:03.590> right<00:02:03.649> so

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
that's done now we can stick it all

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.919 
that's done now we can stick it all
together<00:02:07.549> oh<00:02:07.970> sorry

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
together oh sorry

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.100 
together oh sorry
working<00:02:09.410> on<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.649> pilot<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:11.090> simple<00:02:11.780> hair

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
working on the pilot the simple hair

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.300 
working on the pilot the simple hair
factory<00:02:12.530> build<00:02:12.890> except<00:02:13.880> for<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> few<00:02:14.390> changes

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
factory build except for a few changes

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.569 
factory build except for a few changes
got<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.340> little<00:02:16.519> peg<00:02:16.819> there<00:02:17.150> stick<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.989> head<00:02:18.170> on

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
got a little peg there stick the head on

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.890 
got a little peg there stick the head on
and<00:02:19.579> there<00:02:20.390> we<00:02:20.510> go

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
and there we go

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.479 
and there we go
just<00:02:21.440> clamp<00:02:21.799> them<00:02:22.010> in<00:02:23.049> and<00:02:24.049> now<00:02:24.290> we<00:02:25.010> stick<00:02:25.310> on

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
just clamp them in and now we stick on

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:34.479 
just clamp them in and now we stick on
the<00:02:25.790> wings<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:28.430> shooter<00:02:29.329> tape<00:02:33.459> so<00:02:34.459> you

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
the wings and the shooter tape so you

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.250 
the wings and the shooter tape so you
stick<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.030> all<00:02:35.120> together<00:02:35.269> like<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.750> and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
stick it all together like that and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.370 
stick it all together like that and
close<00:02:37.160> it<00:02:37.370> up<00:02:38.829> and<00:02:39.829> you're<00:02:40.340> done

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
close it up and you're done

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.250 
close it up and you're done
so<00:02:42.380> working<00:02:42.859> on<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.430> transformation<00:02:44.329> this<00:02:45.139> is

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
so working on the transformation this is

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.559 
so working on the transformation this is
actually<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.769> triple<00:02:46.040> changer<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:47.000> it's<00:02:47.359> kind

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
actually a triple changer so it's kind

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.180 
actually a triple changer so it's kind
of<00:02:47.630> complicated<00:02:49.630> fold<00:02:50.630> those<00:02:50.900> out<00:02:51.200> fold<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
of complicated fold those out fold the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.020 
of complicated fold those out fold the
