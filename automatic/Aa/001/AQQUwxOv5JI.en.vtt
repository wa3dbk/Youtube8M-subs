00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 watch out for this mxgp sleeve 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.099
 the big ones the four and 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.200
 half go it's gone we see a 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.700
 superb departure of gautier paulin fair 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.139
 but here it is a big following 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.690
 behind but fall in the back we could 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.869
 be suzuki your ktm and it's a 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.760
 question that these matiss karro and one to 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.220
 gravel blog also xavier boc fell 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.199
 matiss karro and also look behind 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.119
 it's steven frossard who left very 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.679
 early in any case in head paulin 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.300
 we have second at the price we have also 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.340
 the Italian who started the number 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.079
 19 it's philippe hertz and jeremy van 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.030
 der au bac is in the short we do not have 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.480
 still seen antonio cairoli this is a 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.760
 good thing 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.190
 gautier paulin who takes directly the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.780
 leadership of this first round in 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.899
 all the cases olic a little further with 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.850
 his yellow boots we saw him pass 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.360
 actually that was it paid to the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.500
 paulin gautier's strategy of positioning himself 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.820
 we will have a little different on the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.080
 starting grid he realized the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.060
 holeshot and is doing a 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.160
 very very nice early race 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.330
 on the return of antonio cairoli on 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.360
 knows we know he'll come back pretty 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.360
 quick 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.479
 so in the meantime we will wait for a 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.540
 little bit to give you a 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:19.330
 reliable reclassification it then follows through 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.530
 abandoning this turn there we at paulin sometimes 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.390
 ahead of the rebels who are attacking so 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.400
 he passed 2nd jeremy van horebeek on 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.619
 the yamaha very fit right now 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.820
 bobryshev third worries half 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.979
 injured it's a bit complicated 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.650
 injury to finally understand short we have 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.060
 also philippe hertz we had a clement 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.200
 Desalle also worried Leman Lake 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.590
 rooms is right behind him 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.869
 antonio cairoli who is already attacking 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.160
 assaulted acquired in cash which is in 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.330
 the group that is in the group of 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.660
 leaders and who is coming back 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.399
 strong enough and relay that by peace not 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.440
 always in front of the most often 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.150
 beautiful lifts 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.680
 go gautier paulin has leader but 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.580
 jeremy van horebeek is in the process of 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.250
 to do the forcing 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.900
 is it going to pass happened is 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.900
 past for jeremy van der hoeven
