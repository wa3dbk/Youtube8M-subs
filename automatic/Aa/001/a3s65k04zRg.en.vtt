fairly bright lights in here and we see
our<00:02:05.590> display<00:02:06.220> up<00:02:06.400> here<00:02:06.640> on<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:06.880> screen<00:02:07.060> I'm

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
our display up here on the screen I'm

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.639 
our display up here on the screen I'm
going<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.600> turn<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.900> lights<00:02:08.110> off<00:02:08.319> in<00:02:08.379> this

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
going to turn the lights off in this

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.729 
going to turn the lights off in this
room<00:02:08.799> and<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:10.420> can<00:02:10.599> see<00:02:10.780> this<00:02:10.959> unit<00:02:11.170> adjusts

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
room and you can see this unit adjusts

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.100 
room and you can see this unit adjusts
accordingly<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.700> we<00:02:13.180> still<00:02:13.510> have<00:02:13.689> just<00:02:14.019> a

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
accordingly and we still have just a

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.250 
accordingly and we still have just a
phenomenal<00:02:14.769> quality<00:02:15.430> image<00:02:15.819> all<00:02:16.360> at<00:02:16.750> 30

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
phenomenal quality image all at 30

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.510 
phenomenal quality image all at 30

so<00:02:20.520> there's<00:02:20.850> really<00:02:21.090> no<00:02:21.360> loss<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:21.660> performance

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
so there's really no loss in performance

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.350 
so there's really no loss in performance
as<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.860> light<00:02:23.190> level<00:02:23.460> drops<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.030> classroom

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
as the light level drops in a classroom

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.960 
as the light level drops in a classroom
