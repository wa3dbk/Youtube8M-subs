00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.859
 hi esteemed friends of your shop give 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.410
 on this day we will make a 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:13.679
 comparative speed between the xperia 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:16.330
 play 4g and the samsung galaxy s plus 3g 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.160
 both work with movistar 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.380
 currently the exposed inter 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.740
 Movistar both have the plan 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.810
 of network which we are going to compare 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.929
 which one is faster 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.900
 obviously the samsung galaxy is less 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:35.800
 faster than in expedia play since 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.860
 this is 3g and this is 4g 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.399
 let's verify it by starting a 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.399
 google search 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.660
 both cell phones 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.420
 has an 'android' eye system 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.100
 and we will start the search by itself 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.989
 perhaps I have them both with their micas 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.480
 minimal originals to each has dynamics 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.510
 of celestial color because it is original 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.550
 has taken out of the box to prove it and to 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.720
 just like this samsung here and 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.240
 I'm only doing it for 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.160
 check the speeds then we go 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.160
 to start a page for example hotmail 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.200
 with mail.com 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.920
 now we go 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.740
 ya.com let's see which of them load 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.740
 faster and we will realize that here 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.540
 the winner will be the sony ericsson 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.540
 xperia play 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:10.440
 let's see let's start the 2 12 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.440
 3 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.090
 we see that both are loading themselves 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.320
 pages 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.630
 we see that first he finished loading the 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.020
 sound of xperia play and we see that the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.730
 samsung when saying is still loading 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.920
 we see that it is still charging and just 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.140
 has finished while doing a 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.590
 good time has already ended sony ericsson 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.420
 xperia play 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.530
 to verify if some cell phones 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.599
 4g is very simple we can see it in the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.990
 Top of the phone I will do 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.950
 a small zoom 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.730
 and we are going to verify that there is 3 g says 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.709
 this is a 3g speed of this sensor 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.879
 now let's see the sony ericsson 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.879
 xperia play 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:08.540
 and see we can see the following 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.700
 we see a letter h h more 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.060
 in this part of here the side of the 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.050
 bars 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.739
 here says h more is distinguished very well 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.400
 but when one cell phones 4g sh more 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.400
 it will always appear 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.390
 it's the difference as we can see seen 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.850
 maybe speed was 1 of 2 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.380
 3 seconds the difference but when they are 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.650
 much bigger files that 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.810
 expected speed can be tripled 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.460
 so it is necessary to know the 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.970
 speeds that you want do not want 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.610
 drop a cell fast with efficiency 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:51.760
 for internet you need a sony 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:54.770
 ericsson xperia play 4g if its your 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.500
 need is not the internet would be 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.360
 recommended a samsung galaxy are 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.510
 also for the costs in a sony 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.720
 ericsson xperia pre 4g is costing a 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.060
 little more than you use a good galaxy esplÃºs 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.130
 thank you very much friends for watching this video 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.070
 and we will be seeing one next 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.430
 comparative of other teams many 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.430
 Thank you
