00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
but can try to fix it today so basically

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.400 
but can try to fix it today so basically
the<00:00:19.350> problem<00:00:19.530> that<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:19.800> noticed<00:00:20.220> was<00:00:21.410> this

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the problem that we noticed was this

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.200 
the problem that we noticed was this
part<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.770> the<00:00:22.830> trunk<00:00:23.040> lid<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.640> third<00:00:23.970> brake

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
part of the trunk lid with third brake

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.690 
part of the trunk lid with third brake
light<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.500> center<00:00:25.800> plastic<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.490> top

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
light the center plastic and the top

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.140 
light the center plastic and the top
plastic<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:28.230> not<00:00:28.440> a<00:00:28.470> tight<00:00:28.740> seal<00:00:29.040> so<00:00:29.430> every

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
plastic it's not a tight seal so every

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.299 
plastic it's not a tight seal so every
time<00:00:30.270> base<00:00:30.540> hits<00:00:30.780> those<00:00:31.050> things<00:00:31.290> tend<00:00:31.680> to<00:00:31.740> jump

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
time base hits those things tend to jump

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.849 
time base hits those things tend to jump
up<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.579> down<00:00:32.789> and<00:00:33.030> make<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.269> rattling<00:00:33.600> noise

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:33.859 
up and down and make that rattling noise

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.329 
up and down and make that rattling noise
sounds<00:00:34.859> really<00:00:35.190> really<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.780> um<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.859> fix<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
sounds really really so um to fix a

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.599 
sounds really really so um to fix a
problem<00:00:38.519> we<00:00:39.390> got<00:00:39.570> weather<00:00:39.899> stripping

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
problem we got weather stripping

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.560 
problem we got weather stripping
hopefully<00:00:41.609> that<00:00:41.699> should<00:00:41.820> eliminate<00:00:42.179> almost

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
hopefully that should eliminate almost

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.470 
hopefully that should eliminate almost
all<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> bass<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.620> mean<00:00:44.129> all<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.149> rattling

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
all the bass I mean all that rattling

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.560 
all the bass I mean all that rattling
noise<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> I'll<00:00:47.699> just<00:00:47.879> continue<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.449> video

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
noise so I'll just continue the video

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.860 
noise so I'll just continue the video
after<00:00:49.140> taking<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.589> rear<00:00:49.739> trunk<00:00:50.010> lid<00:00:50.280> off<00:00:50.870> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
after taking the rear trunk lid off the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.340 
after taking the rear trunk lid off the
deck

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
deck

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.459 
deck
so<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.769> access<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.219> root<00:00:53.399> UNK<00:00:53.670> lid<00:00:54.350> found<00:00:55.350> out

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
so the access to root UNK lid found out

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.869 
so the access to root UNK lid found out
that<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> remove<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> seeds<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
that we have to remove the seeds and the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.139 
that we have to remove the seeds and the
side<00:00:57.089> bolsters<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> top<00:00:58.859> panels<00:00:59.819> then

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
side bolsters then the top panels then

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.000 
side bolsters then the top panels then
the<00:01:00.269> front<00:01:00.420> leg<00:01:00.539> comes<00:01:00.719> out<00:01:00.839> so<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.710> start<00:01:01.949> off

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the front leg comes out so to start off

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.280 
the front leg comes out so to start off
with<00:01:02.159> the<00:01:02.249> seat<00:01:02.550> there's<00:01:03.420> two<00:01:03.690> Clips<00:01:03.929> one<00:01:04.050> on

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
with the seat there's two Clips one on

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.200 
with the seat there's two Clips one on
this<00:01:04.410> side<00:01:04.590> one<00:01:04.800> over<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.130> is<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.880> gently

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
this side one over here is it to gently

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.570 
this side one over here is it to gently
push<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.800> slowly<00:01:07.800> on<00:01:07.980> both<00:01:08.100> sides<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
push it up slowly on both sides and it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.010 
push it up slowly on both sides and it
comes<00:01:08.730> out<00:01:10.190> just<00:01:11.190> like<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.340> seat<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.900> up

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
comes out just like that seat so it's up

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.020 
comes out just like that seat so it's up
just<00:01:13.260> slide<00:01:13.440> up<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> seat<00:01:13.860> belts

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.399 

and<00:01:20.030> then<00:01:20.600> we'll<00:01:20.750> just<00:01:20.869> continue<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.290> video

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
and then we'll just continue the video

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.609 
and then we'll just continue the video
to<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.740> next<00:01:21.950> step<00:01:23.049> okay<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:24.140> another<00:01:24.530> thing

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
to the next step okay so another thing

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.020 
to the next step okay so another thing
forgot<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.040> mention<00:01:25.159> is<00:01:25.460> on<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.610> rear<00:01:25.790> seats

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
forgot to mention is on the rear seats

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.450 
forgot to mention is on the rear seats
there's<00:01:26.600> one<00:01:26.840> bolt<00:01:27.049> I'm<00:01:27.680> going<00:01:28.159> to<00:01:28.220> show<00:01:28.310> them

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
there's one bolt I'm going to show them

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.840 
there's one bolt I'm going to show them
down<00:01:28.640> here<00:01:28.820> like<00:01:29.119> really<00:01:29.570> there's<00:01:30.320> one<00:01:30.470> bolt

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
down here like really there's one bolt

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.520 
down here like really there's one bolt
that<00:01:31.850> holds<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.390> rear<00:01:32.600> seats<00:01:32.840> in<00:01:33.080> over<00:01:33.409> here

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
that holds the rear seats in over here

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.380 
that holds the rear seats in over here
so<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.250> just<00:01:34.460> pull<00:01:34.640> up<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.759> leather<00:01:35.030> I<00:01:35.149> guess

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
so you just pull up the leather I guess

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.230 
so you just pull up the leather I guess
slightly<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.050> it's<00:01:36.200> a<00:01:36.290> 10<00:01:36.470> millimeter<00:01:36.860> bolt

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
slightly and it's a 10 millimeter bolt

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.430 
slightly and it's a 10 millimeter bolt
so<00:01:38.240> once<00:01:38.390> that<00:01:38.450> comes<00:01:38.720> out<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.990> rear<00:01:39.140> seats

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
so once that comes out the rear seats

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.899 
so once that comes out the rear seats
just<00:01:39.710> swap<00:01:40.070> out<00:01:40.280> next<00:01:41.060> step<00:01:42.040> is<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:43.640> take<00:01:43.759> out

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
just swap out next step is to take out

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.609 
just swap out next step is to take out
the<00:01:43.940> side<00:01:44.180> bolsters<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.659> remove<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.440> side

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
the side bolsters to remove the side

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.350 
the side bolsters to remove the side
panel<00:01:45.649> I<00:01:46.130> guess<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.670> make<00:01:46.759> it<00:01:46.909> easier<00:01:47.149> to<00:01:47.270> take

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
panel I guess to make it easier to take

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.480 
panel I guess to make it easier to take
them<00:01:47.479> out<00:01:47.630> anyways<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.649> for<00:01:48.830> that<00:01:48.920> there's

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
them out anyways so for that there's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.859 
them out anyways so for that there's
another<00:01:49.729> 10<00:01:49.970> millimeter<00:01:50.420> bolt<00:01:50.630> at<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.780> bottom

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
another 10 millimeter bolt at the bottom

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.370 
another 10 millimeter bolt at the bottom
and<00:01:51.860> then<00:01:52.399> all<00:01:52.550> you<00:01:52.640> got<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.820> do<00:01:52.940> is<00:01:53.149> push<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.170> up

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
and then all you got to do is push it up

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.180 
and then all you got to do is push it up
and<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.100> comes<00:01:55.130> out<00:01:55.429> a<00:01:55.640> lot<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.890> might<00:01:58.039> be<00:01:58.159> a

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
and it comes out a lot it might be a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.680 
and it comes out a lot it might be a
struggle<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:58.789> kind<00:01:58.970> of<00:01:59.000> goes<00:01:59.149> slowly<00:01:59.360> upper

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
struggle so it kind of goes slowly upper

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.540 
struggle so it kind of goes slowly upper
so<00:01:59.780> you<00:01:59.869> don't<00:01:59.990> break<00:02:00.259> any<00:02:00.440> clips<00:02:00.679> so<00:02:01.429> I'll

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
so you don't break any clips so I'll

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.990 
so you don't break any clips so I'll
continue<00:02:01.759> after<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.240> next<00:02:02.920> okay<00:02:03.920> next<00:02:04.100> to

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
continue after the next okay next to

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.399 
continue after the next okay next to
remove<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:05.330> rear<00:02:05.450> trunk<00:02:05.750> lid<00:02:05.929> you<00:02:06.110> also<00:02:06.259> have

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
remove the rear trunk lid you also have

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.559 
remove the rear trunk lid you also have
to<00:02:06.470> remove<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.800> seat<00:02:07.039> pillars<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.360> make<00:02:08.539> it

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
to remove the seat pillars so to make it

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.509 
to remove the seat pillars so to make it
easier<00:02:09.019> just<00:02:09.649> take<00:02:09.769> out<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:09.950> rear<00:02:10.100> headrests

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
easier just take out the rear headrests

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.610 
easier just take out the rear headrests
slide<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.510> up<00:02:11.630> there's<00:02:11.870> little<00:02:12.110> button<00:02:12.350> push

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
slide it up there's little button push

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.870 
slide it up there's little button push
it<00:02:12.800> headrest<00:02:13.459> comes<00:02:13.640> out<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:16.130> take<00:02:16.370> this<00:02:16.610> out

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
it headrest comes out to take this out

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.640 
it headrest comes out to take this out
right<00:02:19.880> around<00:02:20.000> here<00:02:20.420> there's<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.930> special<00:02:21.530> type

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
right around here there's a special type

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.229 
right around here there's a special type
of<00:02:21.799> clip<00:02:22.010> we<00:02:22.190> take<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.459> off<00:02:22.549> of<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.000> other

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
of clip we take it off of the other

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.100 
of clip we take it off of the other
c-pillar<00:02:24.110> over<00:02:24.920> here<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.510> have<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.900> hit<00:02:26.989> it

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
c-pillar over here so you have to hit it

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.470 
c-pillar over here so you have to hit it
in<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.230> top<00:02:27.500> section<00:02:27.920> over<00:02:28.280> there<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.640> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
in the top section over there and the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.880 
in the top section over there and the
green<00:02:29.660> clip<00:02:29.840> slides<00:02:30.079> back<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.410> makes<00:02:30.769> it

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
green clip slides back and makes it

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.710 
green clip slides back and makes it
easier<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.160> pull<00:02:31.310> out<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.299> let's<00:02:32.480> see<00:02:32.600> if<00:02:32.660> we

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
easier to pull out so let's see if we

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.180 
easier to pull out so let's see if we
could<00:02:32.900> try<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.170> replicate<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.680> on<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.160> side

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:51.340 

then<00:02:40.190> right<00:02:40.579> around<00:02:40.760> here

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:08.030 

almost<00:03:06.650> there<00:03:07.650> we<00:03:07.740> go

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
almost there we go

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.640 
almost there we go
and<00:03:09.000> it's<00:03:09.180> open<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.900> rest<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.200> them<00:03:10.320> just

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
and it's open so the rest of them just

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.130 
and it's open so the rest of them just
slowly<00:03:11.250> slide<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.910> back<00:03:12.060> because<00:03:12.870> there's

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
slowly slide it back because there's

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.820 
slowly slide it back because there's
about<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.560> put<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.830> clips<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:18.830> we'll

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
about to put the clips and we'll

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.890 
about to put the clips and we'll
continue<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.370> next<00:03:20.459> step<00:03:20.640> okay<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:21.600> to

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
continue to the next step okay so to

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.020 
continue to the next step okay so to
remove<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.380> root<00:03:22.530> trunk<00:03:22.890> lid<00:03:23.370> like<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:23.910> did

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
remove the root trunk lid like we did

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.740 
remove the root trunk lid like we did
over<00:03:24.120> here

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
over here

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.120 
over here
there<00:03:25.709> were<00:03:26.130> actually<00:03:26.700> eight<00:03:26.910> clips<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:28.709> you

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
there were actually eight clips that you

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.380 
there were actually eight clips that you
have<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:31.280> squeeze<00:03:32.280> from<00:03:32.790> underneath<00:03:33.180> the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
have to squeeze from underneath the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
have to squeeze from underneath the
trunk<00:03:33.600> over<00:03:33.780> here<00:03:34.430> down<00:03:35.430> here<00:03:35.880> all<00:03:36.720> around

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
trunk over here down here all around

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.130 
trunk over here down here all around
eight<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.340> gray<00:03:38.489> ones<00:03:38.780> all<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.900> have<00:03:40.020> to

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
eight of the gray ones all you have to

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.390 
eight of the gray ones all you have to
do<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.590> use<00:03:41.100> some<00:03:41.130> needle<00:03:41.610> nose<00:03:41.760> pliers<00:03:42.090> and

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
do is use some needle nose pliers and

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.449 
do is use some needle nose pliers and
squeeze<00:03:44.400> them<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.260> push<00:03:46.260> them<00:03:46.290> up<00:03:46.650> through

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
squeeze them and push them up through

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.340 
squeeze them and push them up through
the<00:03:47.580> trunk<00:03:47.790> lid<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.690> main<00:03:48.840> rattle<00:03:49.200> that

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
the trunk lid so the main rattle that

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.770 
the trunk lid so the main rattle that
was<00:03:49.470> happening<00:03:49.800> was<00:03:50.010> through<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.550> thing<00:03:50.820> so

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
was happening was through this thing so

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.090 
was happening was through this thing so
we're<00:03:51.930> going<00:03:52.020> to<00:03:52.110> open<00:03:52.320> this<00:03:52.470> thing<00:03:52.530> up<00:03:52.830> and

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
we're going to open this thing up and

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.670 
we're going to open this thing up and
just<00:03:53.280> go<00:03:53.400> around<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.730> seals<00:03:54.230> duct<00:03:55.230> tape<00:03:55.440> it

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
just go around the seals duct tape it

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.210 
just go around the seals duct tape it
and<00:03:55.950> use<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.670> double-sided<00:03:56.940> insulation<00:03:57.600> foam

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
and use the double-sided insulation foam

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.009 
and use the double-sided insulation foam
to<00:03:59.220> help<00:03:59.430> lower<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.180> down<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:01.670> I<00:04:03.019> guess

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
to help lower that down and I guess

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.729 
to help lower that down and I guess
we'll<00:04:04.290> continue<00:04:04.530> this<00:04:04.860> after<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.310> break<00:04:06.739> okay

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
we'll continue this after the break okay

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.330 
we'll continue this after the break okay
for<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.370> c-pillar<00:04:08.790> on<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:10.739> portion<00:04:11.130> that<00:04:11.160> we

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
for the c-pillar on the portion that we

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.940 
for the c-pillar on the portion that we
had<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.549> hit<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.970> was<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:13.019> clip<00:04:13.560> over<00:04:13.769> here

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
had to hit it was this clip over here

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.789 
had to hit it was this clip over here
the<00:04:14.160> screen<00:04:14.400> clip<00:04:14.640> once<00:04:15.540> we<00:04:15.630> hit<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.870> push<00:04:16.290> all

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
the screen clip once we hit it push all

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.190 
the screen clip once we hit it push all
the<00:04:16.950> way<00:04:16.979> down<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.640> reset<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.299> pretty<00:04:19.049> much

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
the way down so to reset it pretty much

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.180 
the way down so to reset it pretty much
all<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.410> did<00:04:19.620> was<00:04:19.769> use<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:20.220> little<00:04:20.489> flathead<00:04:20.700> and

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
all I did was use a little flathead and

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.640 
all I did was use a little flathead and
pull<00:04:23.190> this<00:04:23.340> portion<00:04:23.790> back<00:04:24.410> lifting<00:04:25.410> it<00:04:25.500> back

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
pull this portion back lifting it back

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.110 
pull this portion back lifting it back
slipping<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.130> piece<00:04:26.280> of<00:04:26.400> tape<00:04:26.550> underneath<00:04:26.940> of

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
slipping a piece of tape underneath of

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.830 
slipping a piece of tape underneath of
it<00:04:27.240> so<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:32.520> was<00:04:32.640> like<00:04:32.970> great<00:04:33.150> leverage<00:04:33.510> so

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
it so that was like great leverage so

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.950 
it so that was like great leverage so
the<00:04:34.020> little<00:04:34.620> hooks<00:04:34.740> doesn't<00:04:35.070> get<00:04:35.160> stuck<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:36.750> I

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
the little hooks doesn't get stuck and I

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.219 
the little hooks doesn't get stuck and I
just<00:04:37.140> use<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.530> screwdriver<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:38.040> slowly<00:04:39.229> pry

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
just use the screwdriver to slowly pry

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:47.840 
just use the screwdriver to slowly pry
it<00:04:40.290> up<00:04:44.960> still<00:04:45.960> caught<00:04:46.169> under<00:04:46.440> something<00:04:46.850> I've

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
it up still caught under something I've

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.969 
it up still caught under something I've
do<00:04:48.030> from<00:04:48.210> all<00:04:48.330> right<00:04:48.479> I<00:04:48.720> guess<00:04:48.990> so<00:04:49.229> I'll<00:04:49.830> just

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
do from all right I guess so I'll just

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.800 
do from all right I guess so I'll just
continue<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.370> video<00:04:50.580> after<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:51.270> remove<00:04:51.630> that

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
continue the video after I remove that

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.420 
continue the video after I remove that
just<00:04:52.410> takes<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.620> bit<00:04:52.710> of<00:04:52.740> time<00:04:52.860> just<00:04:53.130> don't<00:04:53.250> rush

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
just takes a bit of time just don't rush

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.390 
just takes a bit of time just don't rush
it<00:04:53.550> otherwise<00:04:53.700> you<00:04:53.820> can<00:04:53.910> break<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.950> okay<00:04:55.950> so<00:04:56.100> to

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
it otherwise you can break it okay so to

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.940 
it otherwise you can break it okay so to
reinstall<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.360> c-pillar<00:04:57.840> like<00:04:58.110> we<00:04:58.620> did<00:04:58.830> on
