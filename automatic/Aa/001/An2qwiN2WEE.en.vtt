00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.639
Welcome to Parents TV on demand.

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.530
A place for parents to learn, share and develop
a healthy family together.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.530
Parents TV.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.059
Our families, our lives.

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.690
Hi, I'm Anne Ebeling.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.269
You're watching Parents TV.

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.939
Now, setting up a nursery like this one takes
a lot of work.

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.550
Parents TV's Dennis House shows us how he
made room for his new baby.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.961
&gt;&gt;The room we chose for a nursery is a small
room but it's got some great shelves and a

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:26.320
pretty big closet.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.519
It was used as a nursery by the previous owners,
some 32 years ago.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.980
Best of all, it's location.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.960
It's next to the bathroom and it's also next
to the laundry room.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.620
And this is great because little babies produced
lots and lots of dirty laundry.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.500
And here it is, right now it's a junk room
with lots and lots of junk.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.350
This is the closet filled with a coin collection
from my childhood.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.550
Also, it's a close -- a plastic owl.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.739
I told Kara, so this would be very nice for
nursery, she said, no.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:54.739
All right.

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:55.739
Over here, we've got some great shelves.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.000
This is where all the baby stuff will go;
lotions and clothes, diapers, things like

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.160
We need to repaint all of this and get rid
of all this junk.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.330
We have a potpourri of stuff, all of which,
needs to go somewhere.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.610
I'm gonna start emptying out this room.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.470
We're gonna start with this bookshelf.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.560
Excuse, do you mind?

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.560
We gotta move.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.560
We gotta move.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.560
Let's go.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.800
Next time you see this place, it's gonna look
vastly different.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:46.570
&gt;&gt;And here it is -- the renovated room baby
Helena now calls home.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.090
But some Moms and Dads are just too busy to
set up a nursery themselves.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.270
So, now we'll introduce you to a full service
company dedicated to make you a room for baby

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.000
and making it easier on Moms- to- be.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.090
&gt;&gt;Baskets and Pottery Barn or even Target
or Bye- Bye Baby.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.470
&gt;&gt;Meet Vera Kessler.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.220
She answers the prayers of expected mothers
on the run by setting up nurseries like this

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.100
one from scratch.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.110
&gt;&gt;I help Moms clean and organize their nursery.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.769
Once they have their baby shower, once they
have everything they need for the baby oftentimes

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.150
they are at a loss of where to put it.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.019
There's so many things that the baby has.

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.569
So many clothes and toys and accessories and
people -- especially parents who don't have

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.499
another baby, they're not sure where everything
goes.

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:38.000
And I help them decide how to maximize space
and minimize clutter and make sure the nursery

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
is very efficient.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.170
So, when they're changing diapers in the middle
of the night, they have the diapers, the wipes

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.989
and the ointment very accessible to them.

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.680
&gt;&gt;Vera went through a rough pregnancy with
her son Jeremy, which left her with little

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.390
time to prepare for his arrival.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.709
&gt;&gt;I was very sick and I couldn't end up set
up the nursery.

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.459
I didn't know exactly what to register.

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.069
I was the first of my friends to have a baby
and I really didn't know the appropriate things

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.409
that I needed to do, and also, the resources
that were available to me as a Mom.

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.349
&gt;&gt;So, she started her own company called Nursery
101 to help other women get ready for their

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:08.349
babies.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.349
&gt;&gt;It feels great.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.020
I'm really, really fortunate to be able to
pass on the knowledge and the experience that

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.609
I've gained with my baby and help other women
go through their experience with their children.

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:23.799
So -- really, it's very rewarding.

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:31.390
&gt;&gt;With her hectic schedule, Atty.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.329
Sheila Osmond had no time to shop for the
coming of her baby girl Jordana.

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.379
&gt;&gt;Even though I had a normal pregnancy, there's
going to the doctor all the time and working

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:49.370
[ unk ] a lot of time to do research, [ unk
] a lot of different kinds of furniture, cribs,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.569
car seats, strollers, all that kind of stuff
and just actually set up the nursery.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.049
&gt;&gt;So she called on Vera in Nursery 101.

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.519
&gt;&gt;And she showed us how we should organize
things just the good way of setting things

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.560
up to make it as easiest as possible for us
coming home with the newborn.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.969
&gt;&gt;Sheila let Vera know she wanted the classic
style.

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:14.060
And Vera suggested this furniture set that
will grow with Jordana.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.620
&gt;&gt;We sort of repel her knick knacks and they're
now -- and then when she gets old, they're

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.390
ready for books in it for school and whatnot.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.830
&gt;&gt;And when it was time to bring Jordana home,
Sheila and her husband were ready.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:33.970
&gt;&gt;It was really nice because it was a petty,
clean, well- organized place and, you know,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.880
I thought the baby didn't know what was going
on -- you know, at the time we brought her

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.880
home.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.620
We knew and we were comfortable, we were comfortable
bringing your home to a clean and neat and

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.620
organized environment.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.620
&gt;&gt;But if you still insist on going it alone,
Vera has a few simple tips for setting up

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.620
a nursery.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.160
&gt;&gt;Well, having a baby can be expensive.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.320
But there are certain things you can do to
minimize your cost.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.510
For example, you can invest in furniture that
grows with your child.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.750
Instead of getting a stand- alone changing
table, parents might wanna think of getting

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.020
a dresser with a changing pad on top.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.190
Also, parents may wanna think of getting a
convertible crib instead of a drop- side crib.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.960
[ unk ] to be smart about your storage solutions.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.820
You might wanna think of investing in a bureau
that has multiple shelves as well as storage

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.820
compartments.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.870
This way you can store items on a shelf as
well as inside of the drawers.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.990
Another storage solution is to get little
baskets.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.060
You can get these beautiful baskets in Pottery
Barn or even Target or Bye- Bye Baby and you

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.470
can fill them with books, you can fill them
with toys, stuffed animals and they can just

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.930
slip right under your bed.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.420
They can serve as beautiful accents to your
room.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.890
Don't buy everything you see.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.290
You don't necessarily need 36 one [ unk ] in
size newborn.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.800
Choosing [ unk ] that grows rapidly.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.610
Buy a very few items in a newborn- size.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.930
Start out your child in size 3 months, 6 months,
9 months and get more clothes as they grow

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.930
older.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.180
And also, you can ask the baby consultant.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.180
They're there to help you.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.210
