00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hi everyone, how are you? I'm here for today. 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.270
 give some poems to you is from 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.099
 hold the skin more shouts but 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.960
 mainly healthier 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.210
 were things that I learned 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.130
 over time and has been applied to 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.440
 my skin and I think they give super 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.420
 sure sandy who is super simple that with 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.520
 sure you had already spoken in the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.619
 From the video I tried to adapt myself 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.170
 to find you easier could 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.090
 make it easier and finally follow all 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.609
 steps a mistake i made very good 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.040
 had oily skin was to wash the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.530
 face many times a day because it is 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.870
 terrible to feel proud and see 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.550
 shining and I thought yes I was going 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.140
 eliminate the oiliness of my skin and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.239
 quite the opposite 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.520
 advise and act more shopkeepers 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.309
 or less talked about is three to four times 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.890
 by day maximum reach Baltic ten 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.360
 times a day is because every time 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.039
 there was some idleness in some 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.660
 and washing her face. 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.280
 This is wrong people because according to him 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.440
 is also important for clear skin 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.239
 not in excess but he is also 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.859
 important for the skin and as every time 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.439
 that just to be producing the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.299
 university you are taking the organism 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.549
 understands that it does not stop counting then 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.200
 it will produce even more until called 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.780
 rebound effect that when the body 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.729
 understands that it needs to produce more 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.229
 which makes the situation worse now 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.939
 You're charmed by what I just did. 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.320
 talking is very important to you. 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.750
 attention to the products you are 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.330
 using is mainly think used 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.009
 and the Olympians I even used 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.390
 for a while an astringent that I 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.640
 I think it was from the clinic 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.079
 I adored it because as it postpones the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.119
 I thought I was doing the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.120
 His role is very good and I have already heard 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.290
 some bruises 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.360
 saying that he has a concentration 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.250
 That's a lot of class with this, it's over. 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.750
 also favoring that effect 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.430
 rebound and a product that is very 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.310
 known that I think is the time of the 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.710
 My life, Grandma is Alex Boggis, the milk of 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.060
 colony and it also causes an effect 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.140
 have a concentration of something very 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.030
 large then it is preferable to choose 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.430
 not so aggressive products and if you 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.050
 can be clear from an indication of the 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.510
 your dermatologist would be better still 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.910
 but not only prevents students 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.860
 have a lot of something is because it's over 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.690
 favoring the rebound effect and also 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.490
 you have sensitive skin they can 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.550
 can cause some lines 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.260
 then it is good to avoid a step that 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.900
 I do not think I even need to comment on it. 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.640
 about removing makeup very well 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.310
 so people do not need all that 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.140
 ritual course that the more you care 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.790
 your skin the more result you will have 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.130
 but since you take off your makeup 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.960
 hydrate the skin you sure already do 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.430
 feel a very big difference I 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.870
 I usually say that there is no excuse 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.210
 because I know some makeup removers 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.610
 They are more expensive and if you wear makeup 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.350
 Everyday you're going to spend a lot of new money. 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.230
 maclellan china because they do not last 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.390
 so much time is one of my favorites 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.700
 mary kay is one of my make-up artists 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.070
 favorites I've already tested so new 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.600
 need not take to indicate does a 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.360
 since I'm testing the 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.430
 avon biphasic and I'm there looking at him 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.650
 takes makeup well only clear 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.270
 Like any two-phase make-up remover you do not 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.709
 You can leave it in the face, right? 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.200
 so you have to go after the other one 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.790
 normal make-up remover or take with water 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.010
 as soap had also exist 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.600
 various soaps specific to the boy 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.120
 This is very important to us because the 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.160
 ph of the body and face are different 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.650
 so you do not want to use a 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.780
 body product at the stand is not going to 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.239
 have the same effect and even I can think 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.430
 that finally resolves the daughter always 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.750
 specific products for the face and 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.190
 What I'm talking about is good, I think 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.410
 It's a very easy mark for everyone. 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.380
 find and be able to buy I really like 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.720
 facial cleansing gel and it is super 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.190
 practical despite the bath 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.200
 Even then there's no excuse not to 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.900
 Take off the makeup a tip that works 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.240
 many if you had your products 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.580
 this can use a shampoo 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.770
 predicts descent john knows that those who 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.050
 they are well the trio so you can use 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.910
 a stand including it is very indicated 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.280
 by dermatologists then you can 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.210
 Let 's take the bulk of the makeup, let's 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.430
 same shower 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.080
 another tip that gives very certain is that 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.900
 You're lazy to take the 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.120
 Make sure always leave the side 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.980
 of the bed and make-up remover and a 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.020
 washcloth for many times I stayed there 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.510
 feeling kind of bad for using both 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.090
 cotton then cost in half 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.910
 I finally found the towel. 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.380
 and it works very well then you only have to apply 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.660
 your product that you 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.030
 using your line and the bass 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.620
 you rub the towel on your face and 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.260
 this is cool too because the texture of the 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.970
 towel is rougher on then it is already going 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.550
 help a little remove the cells 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.350
 dead and then you have the kingdom 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.120
 arrived in a super tired place I 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.160
 I always make the top of my pajamas or 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.450
 under the discovery and the mji statue 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.000
 so just get a makeup remover 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.710
 applied the line and make the goal 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.020
 something that is also essential that the 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.150
 people listen very close to removing the 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.040
 makeup is to choose the course and the people in the 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.070
 there are several choices then 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.930
 you can tailor your pocket but love 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.850
 that I really like to do that 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.040
 I think it's often even better than 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.050
 that the experienced with meadow is honey and 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.850
 sugar then the recipe is a spoon 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.380
 sugar and a spoonful of honey and stir 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.450
 well and apply on the face in movements 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.430
 circular and the result is great you 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.470
 gets the right poppet skin and sends 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.210
 although all cells and things that do not 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.710
 should talk to your skin do 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.390
 reflect more or less once per 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.910
 week can not be done with much 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.430
 people 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.140
 also not to damage the skin I 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.090
 I really like to make you resent it 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.010
 go my face and apply another 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.630
 reciitinha that was clear of the goal 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.820
 Then you must be thinking that I am the 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.610
 Cinnamon or leave was again but not 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.440
 gentle to clear does not smell and to 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.440
 Separating is also very easy so you just 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.090
 make a hole in the egg shell and turn 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.280
 that the first thing that will happen is 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.020
 clear then you can apply let 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.940
 half an hour at 15 minutes a half 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.680
 and she will even start making a 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.080
 film in the pocket will not start 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.610
 hard and then when you get there 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.470
 point you can already take 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.080
 if you search we snake the 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.560
 vanish on many light properties 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.930
 finally and the skin is the tip kiss and stay 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.970
 very good skin and especially if 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.400
 You do then clarify later. 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.440
 this recipe had the clear gives a lot 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.140
 sure and you'll realize the 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.330
 in the skin texture and the 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.610
 routine that would not be something to 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.860
 treatment but it is another moment of 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.140
 union if you do not have the first go 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.120
 see it helps to fix the makeup him 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.090
 will help close the pores 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.220
 there is something natural that is very sure is ice 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.380
 so you always put it somewhere 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.000
 will not put the joão straight in the pocket 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.920
 put something like this 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.080
 not to burn and the clientele 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.360
 especially in the t nec and the forehead 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.220
 nose and chin and ice and help close 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.350
 the pores and causes the makeup 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.790
 consequently on animals and I like 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.930
 much in the summer before going to some 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.880
 place that I will stay a long time 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.710
 makeup and it works great 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.419
 so this is personal I hope you 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.070
 have enjoyed the 500 are things 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.140
 simple but that make all the difference 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.419
 if you spend a little bit like yours 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:49.150
 Time and time again, thank you very much for having 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:51.870
 until now a super kiss and until 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.870
 the next video 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:58.389
 and it really is
