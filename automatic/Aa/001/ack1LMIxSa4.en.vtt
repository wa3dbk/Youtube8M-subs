we<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.430> some<00:01:11.700> platinum<00:01:12.150> sputtering<00:01:12.630> which<00:01:12.930> is

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
we do some platinum sputtering which is

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.340 
we do some platinum sputtering which is
very<00:01:13.740> unique<00:01:14.039> and<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> what's<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.079> reasoning

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
very unique and so what's the reasoning

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.529 
very unique and so what's the reasoning
for<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> Platinum<00:01:16.950> sputtering<00:01:17.549> well<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
for the Platinum sputtering well the

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.620 
for the Platinum sputtering well the
platinum<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.590> gives<00:01:19.829> you<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> whole<00:01:20.159> nother

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
platinum it gives you a whole nother

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.690 
platinum it gives you a whole nother
whole<00:01:21.630> nother<00:01:21.840> sound<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.469> like<00:01:22.649> it<00:01:23.369> takes<00:01:23.399> it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
whole nother sound it's like it takes it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.830 
whole nother sound it's like it takes it
to<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> completely<00:01:24.149> new<00:01:24.450> level<00:01:24.659> yeah<00:01:25.789> but<00:01:26.789> uh

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
to a completely new level yeah but uh

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.840 
to a completely new level yeah but uh
this<00:01:27.840> one<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.369> everyone<00:01:29.369> seems<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.640> like
