 hello we're all a boyfriend of gta 5 and 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.090
 today I bring you a new video in which 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.889
 I'm leaving the pot literally good and 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.599
 he made a video so it was the one of the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.460
 rarest cars on the market I think that 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.440
 was that it was from gta 4 a mod that puts 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.150
 the cars so super weird you'll have the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.220
 description or in a comment what 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.230
 I will have put in this video and good 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.380
 thing is that I've found several 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.750
 videos by forums and that already requested permission 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.670
 to people not because some videos are not 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.960
 mine and I've asked people for permission 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.120
 that I can upload to make this video has 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.489
 it's been soft so I'm not even the best 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.219
 bender nor the best doing this but 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.480

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.780
