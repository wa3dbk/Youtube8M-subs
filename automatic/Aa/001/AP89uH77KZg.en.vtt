00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:09.980
 we are in a small lea with 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.070
 in all these vaults not good by 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.070
 example 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.689
 a village lady I do not come to deal with 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.450
 you rule I come to tell you that I want 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.099
 I want to buy your village no no I do not want 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.600
 buy your village I want to buy your 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.560
 villagers 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.800
 for me but please have also 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.590
 new species but wait I have is 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.190
 looks I already have one how many two of no 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.190
 he gives me for them 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:47.230
 do not wait, sir, he did not take it or not 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.640
 I carry I waited for my goals are 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.230
 multiplied I think it's magical 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:57.960
 can multiply 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.960
 Yes and no 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.350
 or really I can not take you but 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.350
 a deal 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.480
 the gentlemen let's go shopping 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:22.460
 cheap labor nails yes and you what 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:26.870
 do you here you go good welcome 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.790
 to the waterfalls tutorial or if 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.350
 water shells that go up is 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.870
 I do not know what to call it seriously where 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.420
 but they are pretty rare water shells 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.880
 here you see an example is not money 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.159
 dry will have escaped us but you see what 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.479
 well this is better said I'll explain 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.610
 later as the fact because you should not 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:50.160
 understand well the tutorial goes on this 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:57.100
 You 'll see I put you here and I'm going up 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:59.190
 but this is normal is minecraft nothing is 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.190
 real 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.150
 perfect well let's say as I have 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.020
 fact is pretty basic let's 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:17.320
 need any stairs block or 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:20.500
 slabs slabs and a poster and there are 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.840
 that adding a bucket worth of water is very 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.390
 simple to do simply say that 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.280
 here in this you can not put or 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.680
 stairs neither signs nor a block 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.630
 whole is worth only things that are 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.210
 half block is worth I think the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.160
 swindler is not worth I have not tried 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.890
 let's try now more attractive 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.230
 OK 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.220
 yes 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.500
 Yes, but no, no, it's not worth it, because it's 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.790
 too small has to be a slab 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.819
 or a ladder because although I'm going to 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.549
 teach to do it easily ok let's go 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.110
 to do it more well here on the ground it's worth 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.900
 let's go good before doing it on the ground 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.220
 I want to explain things about the water or if you see 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.980
 goes 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.910
 let's see how much distance to the water you 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.060
 where do you put a block of water 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.740
 let's call it block one you have 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.740
 that expand another seven block better 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.800
 that has to be block two block 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:20.080
 in 34.5 block six what seven euros 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:23.500
 monthly what 11 + 7 8 11 17 as well 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.890
 perfect well it 's okay to say that we can 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.930
 do from this distance a rise of 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.930
 This way we put a slab 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.530
 stone is worth it and now we would have to put 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.010
 here a poster because because the poster 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.810
 it will be 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.430
 what's going to make the water here do not 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.349
 come this side as you see I am going up 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.700
 until that because it is a medium 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.620
 block and if I put a ladder 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.720
 I also upload why because it has medium 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.379
 block and a broker in the case of the 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.720
 What I would do is climb here 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.069
 up but good does not matter because it's 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.769
 half block are worth because what is going to 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:02.159
 boost is half the half block is 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.109
 say what is you see my course what is 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.359
 on the right so that's why I 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.329
 Validity stairs let's put here 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.549
 four blocks and we have to put a 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.609
 bucket of water and that way as you see 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.500
 this is the magic thing the book is going up 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.079
 the water up is something that 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.950
 minecraft does not realist us well 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:25.370
 now we put here 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.320
 and we go up and down again but well 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.440
 this is torture because you can 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.480
 make a straight line 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.460
 a line of line that has for example 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.440
 here a stream of water on one side is 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.000
 say that instead of being water like that 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.910
 have the water like this 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.210
 although it does not wait I got confused 5 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.210
 it should be 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.449
 Well, it would not be worth this 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.900
 It would have to be like before and perfect 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:57.150
 well the thing would be to do this for 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.699
 make your life for for example that is 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.159
 transport pigs or what is to make a 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.790
 thing with villagers, you just do 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.950
 this 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.020
 As you can see, I've done it and pumba 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.120
 you start to upload or just do 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.790
 some stairs some stairs to a 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.260
 supermarket a server something 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.420
 it's good or something like to commit suicide 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.010
 good is to wash down something so well 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.560
 this how it works with the villagers 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.210
 very easy we are going to catch a villager or a 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.460
 pig let's catch a pig 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.410
 you will see that the pig will be 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.889
 going up and it's not going to drown because 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.169
 because your block goes up, you do not drown, you do not 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.289
 you drown well between the rise up and 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.379
 Kate 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.839
 what happens if I put a block of these 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:42.869
 that will happen to see what will happen not 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:44.759
 gets stuck if there was something that could not 

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:47.129
 climb up would be perfect as is 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.990
 pistons you put pistons that detects a 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:51.449
 raise them but it would be a mess between 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.149
 circuits and I would spend a lot of money 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.009
 Well, I've experimented with this 

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:57.779
 circuit look what you have experienced 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.399
 something pretty cool I do not know for example 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:05.360
 You are at home and you want to bring 

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:05.360
 a villager it was easy to be with me 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.770
 Well, here, trade here, you have others already 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:18.570
 you do not work with him it's like a cage 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:21.970
 for husbands but quite simple 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.770
 and well to do this here that I do not 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.120
 I have said before simply for those who 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.980
 they earn a trench and they told us how 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.570
 does that because it's pretty simple 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.250
 you just have to do this like this 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.650
 how am I doing I put a block 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.150
 here and for example let's put 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:40.440
 the slab of all water 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.910
 and we count 123 because not here because 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.740
 as you can see the water is standing and when 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.960
 I do this stop I do not have is when there 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.520
 two blocks you move and you go up what 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.390
 you have seen not so well once 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.620
 we have done this we do this and where 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.660
 is the block that flows ie 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:58.020
 second block the two block of water 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.480
 we put a poster and then up here 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.680
 we would have to put this if we want 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.000
 that go up or so if 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.120
 we simply want it to go for 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.470
 alante in this case we are going to do well 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.050
 as well 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:13.030
 we put a bucket of water and there is a 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.250
 small rise as you see 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.620
 it's this but if instead we want 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.630
 to change direction is not to say that 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.400
 instead of it going up going up 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.890
 up we want it to go for a 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:27.220
 side then very simple although this what 

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.450
 we can do simply as saying 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.480
 simply that there is a current 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.580
 of water and let's do this because this is going 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.920
 to help change direction 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.980
 easily so let's see what I'm going to put 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.750
 here this so that you do not kill that there 

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.820
 perfect for example we put ourselves here and 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.950
 now let's throw for the extra turn to 

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.450
 the perfect right and it takes us to 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:50.290
 there by influence as you see is the 

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:53.050
 center well this has been all very 

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:55.330
 simple summary waterfall of water that goes 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.490
 up is already has no more 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.410
 mystery so that is the spirit itself and 

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.990
 see you in the other curious guide of 

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.540
 minecraft in another guide 

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.910
 of these that are wuxi bus we 

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.010
 we take advantage of them so see you 

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.110
 in the next episode and I hope 

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:16.020
 recruit more villagers for my next 

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:16.020
 shakespeare and trans experiments and goodbye
