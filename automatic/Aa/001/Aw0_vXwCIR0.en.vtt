00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Today I'm going to teach how to make a blackboard. 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.500
 homemade 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.260
 You're going to need lots of ingredients. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.099
 simple with very cheap the main 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.529
 of them is the tile grout if you 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.320
 never heard of a tile scheme and 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:24.000
 that little girl who goes between the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.550
 tile that we cost in the 53 reais they have 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.500
 absolutely any store of material 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.210
 construction will also need to be 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.460
 white glue may be adhesive in its 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.780
 easy to find school and an item 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.700
 optional black ink is dye is this 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.170
 dye is what is used to mix in the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 ink usually the staff makes ink 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.950
 with this dye and put it in the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.969
 white color is found in any 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.739
 tinga for less than 30 years and of course I 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.140
 I have forgot to tell if will need 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.860
 a surface where you will create your 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.890
 lusa 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.449
 can be on the wall can be the door can 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.829
 be in any place where the glue 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.020
 white pec 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.719
 I'll do it here using a piece of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.920
 mdf 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.020
 first you put some cola 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.320
 white on top of the plate is placing 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.670
 grout until it forms a 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.920
 mass that you imagine will give a 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.610
 good texture to pass in the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.590
 wood 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.110
 and then when it comes a good texture you 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.240
 drops a few drops of dye to this 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.740
 completely black dough 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.310
 The next step is to get a 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.490
 dishwashing sponge 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.040
 passing over the wall to you 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.240
 paint your entire song when you 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.430
 it's ending you can give a 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.229
 lightly pass with responds above 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.040
 only to the surface was a little more 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.049
 lisa 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.990
 How can you tell I've spent? 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.640
 almost no grout or glue and 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.280
 I could paint about a meter 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.780
 square of wood then I will stop 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.780
 stay and let's test 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:02.420
 This is here to be our home fight. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:14.080
 but to know if it works only by testing 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:16.640
 [Music] 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.190
 it worked and you will realize that there is 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.970
 one advantage and one disadvantage in the other 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.890
 T-shirt 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.020
 the advantage is that what we write 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.670
 It looks very beautiful because she's more 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.260
 rough that a common store 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.110
 You can see that it looks great. 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.550
 The disadvantage of writing is that it is 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.290
 take it out here with an eraser if you 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.570
 pay pass the payer will get mean 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.260
 spotted then you'll have to pay 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.540
 using a cloth 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.540
 [Music] 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.440
 two important tips for you to do 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.390
 this at home 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.070
 the first one when you go 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.410
 mixing the ingredients is always better 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.450
 then exaggerate in glue 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.489
 doubts puts a school because if you 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.440
 put more grout than it should 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.750
 at the time you pass a cloth in the store 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.390
 to pay is going to come out a lot of grout 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.620
 in the cloth when it will turn black so do not 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.299
 it's interesting 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.769
 The second tip is that you have to 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.480
 expect to dry well sometimes it can take a long time 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.190
 two or three days to get it right 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.890
 ideal is to leave some time 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.690
 letting the time be necessary to dry 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.790
 right will happen the same thing goes 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.790
 be regent in the cloth and may even be a 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.019
 piece of slate then exaggerate in glue 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.019
 let it dry properly 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.960
 [Music] 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.650
 It's a tremendous job for us. 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.510
 reach this final recipe 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.489
 this is the board that we used in the 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.920
 start to test the recipes I think 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.739
 this was with paint using a little 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.730
 of ink also but less black dye 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.609
 this one was with a red and no glue there 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.069
 when you pass the cloth he start 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.769
 boot ink here we are the 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.609
 tests also what worked the most was the 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:01.189
 oo grout only with glue and a little 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.950
 from dye to black was the recipe for laws 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:05.930
 here so we found it here 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.310
 manual of the world and when we do 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.750
 these things at home will always have 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.030
 Someone already had to put us in 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.430
 comments make it easier to buy one 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.500
 new house is either talking or easy 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.539
 buy the paint to make lusa 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.150
 It's easier for those who have not 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.000
 has creativity because what is legal is 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.520
 you make your own lusa and will not have light 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.080
 itself is good for those who like to do 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.410
 stuff like that at home and I'm leaving 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.320
 here below two links of things you 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.870
 can write that side here how to do 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.960
 how to print a shirt using chalk 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.699
 wax and on the other side here I am 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.090
 leaving the link how to write a 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:49.440
 glass using genius
