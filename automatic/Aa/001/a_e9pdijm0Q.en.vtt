first one let's take a look at a barrier

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.749 
first one let's take a look at a barrier
this<00:00:13.089> is<00:00:13.269> one<00:00:13.659> of<00:00:13.749> my<00:00:13.839> favorite<00:00:14.200> one<00:00:14.519> now<00:00:15.519> what

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.670 
you can see the cube one gives you a bit
of<00:00:51.940> that<00:00:52.149> cube<00:00:52.570> effect<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.559> second<00:00:56.559> one

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
of that cube effect and the second one

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.170 
of that cube effect and the second one
what<00:00:56.829> are<00:00:56.920> we<00:00:57.010> looking<00:00:57.340> at<00:00:57.430> is<00:00:57.550> called<00:00:57.760> special

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
it's I put mines on random as watched

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.810 
it's I put mines on random as watched
lock<00:01:06.640> screen<00:01:07.060> boom<00:01:07.810> right<00:01:08.200> there<00:01:08.670> gives<00:01:09.670> it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
lock screen boom right there gives it

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
going to be looking at is gravity board

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.020 
going to be looking at is gravity board
now<00:01:40.720> gravity<00:01:41.200> board<00:01:41.650> comes<00:01:42.189> with<00:01:42.490> activator

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
now gravity board comes with activator

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.859 
now gravity board comes with activator
also<00:01:43.509> this<00:01:44.110> lets<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.560> make<00:01:44.920> key<00:01:45.189> shortcuts<00:01:45.869> to

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
also this lets you make key shortcuts to

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.469 
also this lets you make key shortcuts to
you<00:01:47.380> know<00:01:47.500> either<00:01:48.189> apps<00:01:48.640> or<00:01:49.030> whatever<00:01:49.330> you

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479

want it to and i'm going to give you an
example<00:01:52.060> right<00:01:52.360> now<00:01:52.390> let's<00:01:53.140> go<00:01:53.409> in<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:54.070> a

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
example right now let's go in so a

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.080 
example right now let's go in so a
double-click<00:01:54.880> would<00:01:55.210> let's<00:01:55.840> say<00:01:56.140> compass<00:01:56.770> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
double-click would let's say compass a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.440 
double-click would let's say compass a
double<00:01:58.090> click<00:01:58.390> would<00:01:59.070> let<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.310> go<00:02:01.180> to<00:02:01.240> your

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
double click would let you go to your

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.069 
double click would let you go to your
compass<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:03.009> watch<00:02:03.220> what<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.490> do<00:02:03.579> here<00:02:03.909> as<00:02:04.119> I

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
compass so watch what I do here as I

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.890 
compass so watch what I do here as I
double-click<00:02:05.680> it<00:02:06.240> brings<00:02:07.240> me<00:02:07.329> straight<00:02:07.720> to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
double-click it brings me straight to

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.650 
double-click it brings me straight to
compass<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:10.149> know<00:02:10.270> there's<00:02:10.509> like

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
compass and you know there's like

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.160 
compass and you know there's like
different<00:02:11.430> key<00:02:12.430> varieties<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.270> can<00:02:13.450> do

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
different key varieties that you can do

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.300 
different key varieties that you can do
to<00:02:14.530> set<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:14.890> all<00:02:15.010> up<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:16.530> also<00:02:17.530> when<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:17.890> shake

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
to set it all up and also when I shake

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.790 
to set it all up and also when I shake
it<00:02:19.739> watch<00:02:20.739> this<00:02:21.120> Yeah<00:02:22.120> right<00:02:22.150> there<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:23.560> is

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
it watch this Yeah right there this is
