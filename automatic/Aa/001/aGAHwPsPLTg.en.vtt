address a very common experience amongst
many<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.670> at<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.000> time<00:00:12.330> there<00:00:13.290> are<00:00:13.320> many

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
many of you at this time there are many

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.320 
many of you at this time there are many
of<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.099> who<00:00:14.130> are<00:00:14.460> feeling<00:00:14.880> particularly

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
of you who are feeling particularly

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.599

stuck<00:00:15.809> at<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.199> time<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:17.250> would<00:00:17.400> like<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
stuck at this time and we would like to

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.939 
stuck at this time and we would like to
take<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.150> time<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.480> expand<00:00:19.109> further<00:00:19.439> upon

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
take this time to expand further upon

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.370 
take this time to expand further upon
why<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.609> many<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.150> felt<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.570> low<00:00:21.779> or<00:00:22.020> drop

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
why so many have felt this low or drop

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.490 
why so many have felt this low or drop
in<00:00:22.560> energy<00:00:22.740> enthusiasm<00:00:23.359> or<00:00:24.359> motivation<00:00:25.350> to

we<00:00:59.699> would<00:00:59.850> agree<00:01:00.230> let<00:01:01.230> us<00:01:01.379> further<00:01:01.710> explain

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
we would agree let us further explain

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.270 
we would agree let us further explain
you<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.989> perceive<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> integration

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
you see we perceive the integration

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.609 
you see we perceive the integration
period<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.820> being<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.659> valuable<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.470> the
