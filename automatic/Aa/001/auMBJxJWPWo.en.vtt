00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 the thin one said it and when I saw a ball 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.870
 that covered I remembered I said in the few that 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.230
 he was called to have there are males 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.450
 It was like all night but 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.960
 again we see of rosemary an archer 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.029
 very participatory in the scheme in 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.640
 Regarding the possession of the ball, there is no 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.859
 uses a lot from the defenders 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:30.599
 playing backwards so that it distributes 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:33.210
 the game and that made it easier for the referee 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.149
 see that he risked playing passes like this 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.090
 internal like this one committed but 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.850
 very firmly with great ease I think 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.649
 that you account for only two errors with 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.590
 the foot and the two about the end of 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.770
 second time did not have much much 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.860
 participation and in those that had to 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.440
 to be there and in a great way how 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.809
 the actions that we are going to see in about 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.750
 moments in the second time that auction 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.540
 under which he had a very good intervention 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.910
 notice this has not been 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.130
 how do you risk it and notice how good it is 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.220
 Distribute does not find a pass nearby 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.160
 as it divides into an external zone close to 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.080
 half of field at the apex of the sector 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:23.010
 right as it is not fully defined 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.920
 1 and 2 and if there are any doubts 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.260
 today it happens to be for the third 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.750
 place 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.700
 but that also has been shaping up 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.030
 the side of oriÃ³n and by the side to like 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.190
 and in the second instance it seems to me I do not think 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.230
 that the subject of archers is something that 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.850
 is very clear in the national team 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.830
 is the slice that we said a silver 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.320
 very difficult with people ahead that the 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.870
 cap reacts very well on that ball 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.940
 low and here we are going to see one of the 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:55.190
 balls that ends up failing yes a little 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.670
 hastened a bad delivery in this case 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.890
 today we are going to see one more after very 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.380
 sober very easy 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.850
 the other ball but already we said 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.240
 note the trust of his classmates 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.170
 give it now well and in your confidence 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.020
 own it seems that 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.440
 comes with a string of matches in 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:21.660
 his club and in the selection he already does 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.660
 face the competition in another way
