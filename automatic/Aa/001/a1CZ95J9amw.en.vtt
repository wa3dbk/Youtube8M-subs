00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.969
 hello, welcome to another video of 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.969
 economy management shock 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.369
 today we will learn how to go to the moon 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.650
 but first meeting I put our 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.670
 It will ship in orbit of the pro briefing 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.609
 our mission our mission begins with 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:30.189
 ship in orbit kerb also with the moon 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:33.770
 obviously work want but how to get there 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:37.250
 The easiest way is to turn the engine 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.300
 for our contribution and what more 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.590
 high as high as the moon's orbit 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.780
 but also has a power 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.600
 we have questioned mounted the moment 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.080
 so that while our ship 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:56.360
 reach oasis is the most habitual point you 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:01:00.550
 of orbit meets and the moon we can 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.690
 simply mark our orbit with 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.710
 points of maneuver 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.020
 so we'll know exactly where the 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.890
 Our ship will find the moon that is 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.260
 one thing but if you are in the mood 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.700
 career has not yet released this 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.980
 Function 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.640
 the perfect angle to start the engine is 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.670
 as it is about 90 degrees 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 to the moon or practically telling the 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.800
 You just rode and you get there and 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.770
 get this worth from that angle is worth 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.240
 just for the moon - there's another one different 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.240
 but there is a different 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.730
 When is it that we come near our moon? 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.520
 ship will be very very fast and will not 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.380
 will be able to orbit 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.490
 then it will be necessary we will call 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:02:00.190
 engine at perigee the switch - engine 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:03.790
 new beavis of the nuclear moon of our 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.710
 the moon's trajectory to diminish our 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.730
 speed and we got into 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.890
 orbit 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.520
 otherwise we will simply pass 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.520
 direct 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.190
 so come on let's start our new 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.560
 It's already in the optics. 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.290
 she is a little more inclined than 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.680
 Good orbit 1.6 degrees steeper 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.200
 but as it is a very close body and 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.240
 very large and if the general council does not 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.630
 it will make a lot of difference if you do not 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.580
 we were going to me - 2 plays a 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.270
 Good difference, I might not find 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.370
 minutes 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.760
 if you give Mars or a planet 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.370
 distant and if a degree is certainly 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.739
 make a lot of difference but the street is in the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.900
 next we can continue 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:56.099
 so first we select the moon 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.349
 as an album and put a point 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.890
 maneuver 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:04.829
 we accelerate it and such that it 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.290
 meets and the moon more or less that way 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:12.780
 enough is enough 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.620
 if we select the moon as focus we 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.750
 we can see exactly how our name 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.980
 will interact with the moon with enough 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.160
 next 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.019
 in that case our ship is going to hit the moon 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.739
 but we can handle this problem 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:32.040
 then it will be more efficient if we 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.470
 they adjusted it later when our ship 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.090
 is a little closer to the moon by 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.489
 while that is enough 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:46.349
 now we go to the last work for the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.530
 mop and we drive the engine is this stage 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.120
 It was not meant to be triggered. 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.769
 achieve in a very economical way 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.099
 so I have one more stage of 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.750
 rocket that is extremely slow 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.440
 it will take more than two minutes to 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:05.370
 accelerating this maneuver is a duty of 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.790
 choose the other motor but okay will 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.790
 to be all right 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.799
 this white speed up safely 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.940
 Prom, let's get on well. 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.090
 now we can handle that 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.900
 the problem of orbit without 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.370
 It worked to intercept it at very high angle. 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.520
 weird 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.620
 we will correct this vector more 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.289
 near the moon because our lava is 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.360
 slower and the slower you go. 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:44.139
 spending less fuel is needed 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.840
 to correct and correct the direction then 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:51.010
 Let's put more or less here and 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.289
 begin to tinker until until our 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.870
 peri aces of the moon tim already more or less 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:05:00.850
 between 15 and 50 kilometers or so 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.970
 because the one with this is not the way 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.850
 more efficient and even the moon has 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.229
 to cook a little more fuel 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.380
 but that way easier then 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:16.199
 masseur would receive rehearsals for more 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:19.120
 or less 15 kilometers once more 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:22.780
 we give the time warner and until the next 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:26.689
 point of maneuver and start the engine 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.280
 these small corrections and correct these 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:29.719
 minor fixes 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.889
 they consume very little fuel 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:36.289
 very little delta to see and they can 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.689
 exactly the second 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.449
 accurate but they need to be more accurate 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:43.969
 if it is possible to speed 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:48.319
 if you really need to put the head of 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:50.840
 isaac 11 a new higher pede may have 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:52.370
 a small difference gives a large 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.490
 difference at the end 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.259
 in that part or the instant that the engine 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.900
 it is important the duration of the 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.939
 maneuver is not important but what it is 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.490
 more important is the strength that you 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:10.240
 apply to drivers exactly the 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.240
 speed you have programmed 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.520
 we managed to overcome and generated 14 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.919
 kilometers is a little low but it 's asking 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.930
 It played really cool to get 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.139
 now we just need to score a little 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.879
 maneuver so that our ship in the 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.849
 space by the moon we need 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:31.389
 slow down, not at all well in the 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:38.270
 ppa zes of the moon 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:41.180
 we put the work pd after 20 periods 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:46.069
 of 18 is a very cool orbit for you 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:53.810
 land on the moon and switch - off and the team 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:55.789
 we waited until opa peraÃ­ passing this is 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.580
 a national problem has enough 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:03.370
 fuel for this type of emergency 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:07.240
 so let's speed yourself up and 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:11.270
 recover this work we are calm 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:14.330
 is the danger after a little higher than 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:17.870
 I wanted to but it was only when I arrived. 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.150
 piazzi slows down a bit faster 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.700
 Mission accomplished We are limiting the moon 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.490
 and in the next video we'll learn from 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:30.820
 land on the moon and put our 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.820
 flag and everything else then even more
