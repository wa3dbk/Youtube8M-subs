water will start to run up through here

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.610 
water will start to run up through here
and<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.340> it'll<00:00:35.340> run<00:00:35.700> down<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:37.320> out

back into my reservoir and what I did

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.029 
back into my reservoir and what I did
was<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.360> put<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:43.280> piece<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.309> plastic<00:00:45.739> 3/8<00:00:46.739> line

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
pretty much takes care of that my cycle

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.410 
pretty much takes care of that my cycle
so<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.380> totally<00:02:31.890> eliminated<00:02:32.459> my<00:02:32.610> bell<00:02:32.850> siphon<00:02:33.120> I

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
so I totally eliminated my bell siphon I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.960 
so I totally eliminated my bell siphon I
watched<00:02:34.220> experiment<00:02:35.220> I've<00:02:35.550> seen<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.820> lot<00:02:35.940> of

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.810 
watched experiment I've seen a lot of
videos<00:02:36.150> on<00:02:36.540> YouTube<00:02:36.930> about<00:02:37.050> gel<00:02:37.770> siphons<00:02:38.310> and

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
videos on YouTube about gel siphons and

anybody<00:02:39.720> who<00:02:39.959> has<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:40.290> bell<00:02:40.560> siphon<00:02:40.800> knows

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
anybody who has this bell siphon knows

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.960 
anybody who has this bell siphon knows
that<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:44.160> know<00:02:44.220> there's<00:02:44.430> not<00:02:44.550> much<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.940> it

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
that you know there's not much to it

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.940 
that you know there's not much to it
takes<00:02:45.300> up<00:02:45.480> some<00:02:45.690> room<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.500> what<00:02:46.620> actually

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
takes up some room and what actually

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.720 
takes up some room and what actually
will<00:02:47.250> happen<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.880> this<00:02:48.660> basket<00:02:49.230> here<00:02:49.730> what

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
will happen is this basket here what

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.940 
will happen is this basket here what
I'll<00:02:50.820> do<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.450> can<00:02:51.720> take<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.380> room<00:02:52.680> for<00:02:52.890> a

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
I'll do is I can take that room for a

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.220 
I'll do is I can take that room for a
bell<00:02:53.160> siphon<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:54.239> I<00:02:54.330> could<00:02:54.510> stick<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.750> plan<00:02:55.050> in

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
bell siphon and I could stick a plan in

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.670 
bell siphon and I could stick a plan in
here<00:02:55.470> I'll<00:02:56.390> cut<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.540> out<00:02:57.750> stick<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.560> the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
here I'll cut this out stick it on the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.190 
here I'll cut this out stick it on the
outside<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.430> way<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.850> can<00:03:00.570> put<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.930> plan

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
outside and that way I can put a plan

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.870 
outside and that way I can put a plan
and<00:03:01.410> have<00:03:01.620> some<00:03:01.860> usable<00:03:02.280> space<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.610> it

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
and have some usable space so that is it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.550 
and have some usable space so that is it
and<00:03:06.090> what's<00:03:06.360> this<00:03:06.540> range<00:03:06.900> all<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.140> way<00:03:07.230> down

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
and what's this range all the way down

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.710 
and what's this range all the way down
to<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.830> bottom<00:03:07.980> as<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.340> can<00:03:08.459> see<00:03:10.220> down<00:03:11.720> it

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
to the bottom as you can see down it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.620 
to the bottom as you can see down it
will<00:03:12.840> go<00:03:12.930> about<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.230> half<00:03:13.320> inch<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.630> air

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
will go about a half inch and the air

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.420 
will go about a half inch and the air
will<00:03:15.810> come<00:03:15.959> up<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.410> it'll<00:03:16.980> quit<00:03:18.260> siphoning<00:03:19.430> so

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
will come up and it'll quit siphoning so

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.789 
will come up and it'll quit siphoning so
it<00:03:20.519> does<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:20.970> can<00:03:21.360> say<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.690> fills<00:03:22.470> up<00:03:22.620> about

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
it does that I can say it fills up about

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.370 
it does that I can say it fills up about
a<00:03:22.860> half<00:03:23.040> hour<00:03:23.250> 45<00:03:23.670> minutes<00:03:24.120> I'd<00:03:24.360> agree<00:03:24.690> took

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
a half hour 45 minutes I'd agree took

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.380 
a half hour 45 minutes I'd agree took
time<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.769> measure<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.220> all<00:03:26.340> but

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
time to measure it all but

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.080 
time to measure it all but
that's<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.650> see<00:03:28.830> waters<00:03:29.520> roughing<00:03:29.940> in

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
that's it you can see waters roughing in

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.450 
that's it you can see waters roughing in
there<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:34.350> can<00:03:34.500> see<00:03:34.680> how<00:03:34.770> much<00:03:34.920> has<00:03:35.130> drain

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
there and you can see how much has drain

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.880 
there and you can see how much has drain

below if you want to know how to build

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.480 
below if you want to know how to build
one<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.310> these<00:03:50.490> I<00:03:50.760> can<00:03:51.210> show<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:52.040> not<00:03:53.040> much<00:03:53.220> to

one of these I can show you not much to

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.090 
one of these I can show you not much to
it<00:03:53.520> you<00:03:54.420> don't<00:03:54.540> need<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.780> dump<00:03:54.990> fancy<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.770> could

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
it you don't need to dump fancy I could

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.100 
it you don't need to dump fancy I could
say<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.310> just<00:03:56.400> cut<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.170> top<00:03:58.910> spec<00:03:59.910> my<00:04:00.090> piece<00:04:00.900> in

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
say I just cut the top spec my piece in

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.000 
say I just cut the top spec my piece in
there<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:01.560> then<00:04:02.660> ran<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.930> hose<00:04:04.530> all<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.920> way

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
there and then ran the hose all the way

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.770 
there and then ran the hose all the way
to<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.280> back<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:05.820> eliminates<00:04:06.480> all<00:04:06.660> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
to the back and that eliminates all the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.730 
to the back and that eliminates all the
air<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.890> is<00:04:08.040> all<00:04:08.220> silicone<00:04:08.670> clear<00:04:09.209> silicone

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
air this is all silicone clear silicone

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.490 
air this is all silicone clear silicone
and<00:04:10.740> on<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.220> run<00:04:11.400> stop<00:04:11.700> back<00:04:12.030> around<00:04:12.380> you<00:04:13.380> know
