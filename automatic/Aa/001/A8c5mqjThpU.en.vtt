that and the basic idea here is that
this<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.760> an<00:00:47.879> audio<00:00:48.270> recorder<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.840> sound

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
doesn't work in the same direction as

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.200 
doesn't work in the same direction as
most<00:00:52.559> most<00:00:52.890> data<00:00:53.070> recorders<00:00:53.550> go<00:00:53.699> forward<00:00:54.090> as

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
most most data recorders go forward as

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.029 
most most data recorders go forward as
you<00:00:54.239> hit<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> button<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.559> records<00:00:55.949> everything

you hit the button it records everything
from<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.730> until<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.090> tell<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.480> stop<00:00:57.770> this

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
from here until you tell it to stop this

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.319 
from here until you tell it to stop this
records<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.370> different<00:00:59.730> fashion<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.300> you

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
records in a different fashion as you

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.459 
records in a different fashion as you
can<00:01:00.510> see<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:00.809> actually<00:01:01.140> hearing<00:01:01.320> my<00:01:01.440> voice

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
can see it's actually hearing my voice

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.050 
can see it's actually hearing my voice
in<00:01:02.149> moving<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.799> sound<00:01:04.799> bar<00:01:05.010> along<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.580> top<00:01:05.700> as

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
in moving the sound bar along the top as

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.810 
in moving the sound bar along the top as
i<00:01:06.510> talk<00:01:06.720> those<00:01:07.619> positive<00:01:08.010> or<00:01:08.250> add<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.430> show<00:01:08.760> you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
i talk those positive or add to show you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.219 
i talk those positive or add to show you
how<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.030> works<00:01:09.330> by<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.630> way<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.810> wasn't

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
how that works by the way I wasn't

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.230 
how that works by the way I wasn't
actually<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.710> getting<00:01:10.920> english<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.119> it

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
actually for getting english but as it

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.940 
actually for getting english but as it
goes<00:01:12.360> along<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.869> recording<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> idea

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
goes along it is recording and the idea

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.109 
goes along it is recording and the idea
here<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.580> set<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.880> timer

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
here is that you can set this timer

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.630 
here is that you can set this timer
along<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> bottom<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.080> then<00:01:16.890> actually<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
along the bottom and then actually I you

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.399 
along the bottom and then actually I you
know<00:01:17.939> plug<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> button<00:01:18.659> itself<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.290> it

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
know plug the button itself and then it

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.080 
know plug the button itself and then it
saves<00:01:19.619> whatever<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.340> heard<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.759> that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
saves whatever just heard up to that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.060 
saves whatever just heard up to that
point<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.110> sense<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.439> goes<00:01:22.619> reversed

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
point so in this sense it goes reversed

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.350 
point so in this sense it goes reversed
instead<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.820> forward<00:01:24.119> which<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
instead of going in forward which is a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.929 
instead of going in forward which is a
brilliant<00:01:24.780> concept<00:01:25.159> for<00:01:26.159> instance<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.670> hit

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
color palette itself could use a little

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.800 
color palette itself could use a little
rework<00:03:45.460> too<00:03:45.670> but<00:03:45.880> on<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.060> whole<00:03:46.180> desert<00:03:46.570> kind

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.970 
of just niggles in the face of a ax much
larger<00:03:49.840> functionality<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:50.620> all<00:03:50.770> i'll

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
larger functionality so all i'll

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.320 
larger functionality so all i'll
remember<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.400> is<00:03:51.610> quite<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:51.940> impressive

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330

utility blue the price to we do feel

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.370 
utility blue the price to we do feel
slightly<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.480> know<00:03:55.600> a<00:03:55.630> slightly<00:03:55.990> high<00:03:56.170> by

slightly you know a slightly high by

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.800 
slightly you know a slightly high by
exactly<00:03:56.710> one<00:03:56.920> dollar<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:58.000> instead<00:03:58.240> of<00:03:58.300> a<00:03:58.420> one

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
exactly one dollar so instead of a one

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.300 
exactly one dollar so instead of a one
dollar<00:03:58.900> ninety-nine<00:03:59.470> cents<00:03:59.800> of<00:03:59.920> course<00:04:00.130> we

would have liked have seen us at 99

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.300 
would have liked have seen us at 99
cents<00:04:02.140> not<00:04:02.650> because<00:04:02.950> of<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.130> lack<00:04:03.250> of

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
cents not because of a lack of

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.010 
cents not because of a lack of
functionality<00:04:04.000> but<00:04:04.120> simply<00:04:04.570> because<00:04:04.600> this

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
functionality but simply because this

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.710 
functionality but simply because this
app<00:04:05.230> is<00:04:05.380> still<00:04:05.650> somewhat<00:04:05.950> of<00:04:06.070> a<00:04:06.130> novelty<00:04:06.720> and

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
app is still somewhat of a novelty and

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.120 
app is still somewhat of a novelty and
we<00:04:07.900> know<00:04:08.020> we<00:04:08.320> feel<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.620> price<00:04:08.800> could've<00:04:09.040> been

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
we know we feel the price could've been

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.260 
we know we feel the price could've been
a<00:04:09.160> little<00:04:09.280> bit<00:04:09.460> lower<00:04:09.580> for<00:04:09.670> something<00:04:10.090> that's

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
a little bit lower for something that's

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.630 
a little bit lower for something that's
essentially<00:04:10.660> just<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.680> you<00:04:12.220> know<00:04:12.340> at<00:04:12.520> the

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
essentially just a you know at the

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.240 
essentially just a you know at the
moment<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:13.150> trick<00:04:13.780> that's<00:04:14.050> nice<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.410> have<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:15.160> is

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
moment a trick that's nice to have it is

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.920 
moment a trick that's nice to have it is
not<00:04:15.430> completely<00:04:16.030> necessary<00:04:16.060> though<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.810> is

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
not completely necessary though it is

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.060 
not completely necessary though it is
quite<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.170> nice<00:04:17.320> trick<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.710> will<00:04:17.799> definitely

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
quite a nice trick it will definitely

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.039 
quite a nice trick it will definitely
keep<00:04:18.250> everyone<00:04:18.640> entertained<00:04:18.760> for<00:04:19.299> hours<00:04:19.359> and
