00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.609
 correct ignition for wood-burning systems 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.890
 the new ignition method for 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.960
 wood burning fireplaces and boiler is one way 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.820
 simple and effective to reduce the 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.890
 emissions of harmful substances 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.840
 chimneys that emit a lot of smoke not 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.880
 must be the rule with the new 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.730
 ignition method possible for 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.890
 closed fireplace or wood-fired boiler 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.810
 avoid it and do better 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.669
 so far under the stacked wood 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.820
 newspapers and fine wood were put up for 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.490
 turn on the fire 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.650
 and the method learned by our grandparents 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.390
 new research has shown that 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.870
 if the wood burns from above towards the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.600
 bass 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.030
 as with candles, emissions 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.030
 atmospheric are reduced and by a lot 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.530
 let's show now how you can turn on a 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.559
 optimally fire 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.360
 proper ignition is very important 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.000
 the new method causes a few minutes 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.769
 after ignition the fire does not generate 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.550
 more smoke as many show 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.550
 measurements 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.049
 for a low emission ignition ci 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.090
 wants the so-called ignition module 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.460
 which initially burns only a part 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.790
 wood piled and then hard e 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.790
 slowly 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.609
 the ignition module can be 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.520
 made by each and replaces the 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.920
 newsprint 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.710
 consists of four diabetes games with 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.130
 a cross-section of about 3 x 3 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.800
 centimeters and 20 centimeters long and of 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.150
 wood wool impregnated with wax 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.920
 for walk 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.760
 the hague line needs pieces of 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.430
 very dry and natural wood 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.440
 first of all they are fully opened 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.480
 the area grips and the hood of the 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.850
 cane the pieces of wood come 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.400
 stacked at a certain distance one 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.090
 on the other under the larger pieces and 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.130
 above the smaller ones in rooms of 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.770
 burning the big pieces are 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.930
 layered perpendicularly while 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.729
 in narrow combustion chambers are 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.979
 arranged vertically 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.660
 just put as much wood as indicated 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.660
 in the instructions for use of the boiler 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.390
 and here is the novelty the ignition module 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.480
 it is placed over the wood 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.480
 piled 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.480
 a match is enough and the fire is lit. 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.430
 fire burns during combustion 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.530
 from above 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.750
 the downward combustion more 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.219
 slow more controlled and above all 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.010
 it produces less smoke than the method 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:50.260
 traditional gases with the new method 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.420
 generated flow through the flame 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.079
 hot and burn almost 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.079
 full 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.400
 already after a few minutes from 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.380
 maximum smoke will be seen in a column 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.990
 of harmless water vapor 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.000
 if this is not the case please contact 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.600
 to your chimney sweeper or a technician 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.600
 of the sector 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.810
 they must not be during combustion 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.540
 closed the vents or the club of the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.660
 These flue pipes would cause strong 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.610
 emissions the air intake must remain 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.160
 completely open throughout 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.930
 combustion process before 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.400
 add more wood make sure that 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.140
 the embers burn 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.040
 here is the ideal time to reach 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.040
 a log of wood 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.569
 when the arms 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.370
 they are off they can be closed 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.510
 air and the hood to avoid the 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.510
 dispersion of the heat produced 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.430
 further information can be obtained 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:14.030
 at the responsible offices from 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:18.980
 internet or from the chimney sweep www.ti.ch 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.980
 back air slash or 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.720
 Thank you for using the new one 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.510
 ignition method contribute to 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.340
 avoid further atmospheric loads the 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.510
 warmth of your fireplace and so 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.510
 even more enjoyable
