cream lipsticks and I was super

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.359

impressed with it the texture is super
creamy<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.030> because<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:09.840> narrow<00:02:10.110> it's

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
creamy and because it's so narrow it's

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.710 
creamy and because it's so narrow it's
super<00:02:10.890> easy<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.160> apply<00:02:11.490> I<00:02:11.910> really<00:02:12.569> like

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
yeah I just really like the way it looks

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.500 
yeah I just really like the way it looks
so<00:02:22.950> then<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.250> go<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.819> lip<00:02:24.000> color<00:02:24.239> that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
so then to go with the lip color that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.190 
so then to go with the lip color that
Erica<00:02:24.870> pick

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
Erica pick

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.199 
Erica pick
out<00:02:25.290> for<00:02:25.470> me<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.590> decided<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:26.280> use<00:02:26.459> my<00:02:26.489> mac<00:02:26.940> blush

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
out for me I decided to use my mac blush

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.750 
out for me I decided to use my mac blush
in<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.480> color<00:02:27.599> love<00:02:28.080> cloud<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.280> similar

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
in the color love cloud it is a similar

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.880 
in the color love cloud it is a similar
tone<00:02:30.060> pink<00:02:30.510> color<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.530> few<00:02:31.709> shades

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
tone pink color but it's a few shades

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.470 
tone pink color but it's a few shades
lighter<00:02:32.069> so<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.580> doesn't<00:02:33.000> clash<00:02:33.239> with<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
lighter so it doesn't clash with the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.809 
lighter so it doesn't clash with the
lipstick<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.260> also<00:02:34.410> isn't<00:02:34.800> too<00:02:35.190> bold<00:02:35.489> so

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
lipstick but it also isn't too bold so

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.610 
lipstick but it also isn't too bold so
it<00:02:35.940> still<00:02:36.209> lets<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.629> lip<00:02:36.810> color<00:02:37.050> stand<00:02:37.410> out

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
it still lets the lip color stand out

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.770 
it still lets the lip color stand out
and<00:02:37.860> since<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> lip<00:02:38.550> color<00:02:38.819> is<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.300> bold<00:02:39.569> I

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
and since the lip color is so bold I

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.110 
and since the lip color is so bold I
decided<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.379> go<00:02:40.590> for<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.950> really<00:02:41.280> neutral<00:02:41.730> I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
decided to go for a really neutral I

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.240 
decided to go for a really neutral I
look<00:02:42.360> using<00:02:42.599> my<00:02:42.900> naked<00:02:43.260> basics<00:02:43.440> palette<00:02:43.739> I

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
faint in the crease to add some

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.820 
faint in the crease to add some
dimension<00:02:51.239> in<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.989> eyelid<00:02:52.319> but<00:02:52.560> still

dimension in the eyelid but still

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.470

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.380 
looking and then I used my Stila stay
all<00:02:58.260> day<00:02:58.500> waterproof<00:02:58.680> eyeliner<00:02:59.489> to<00:03:00.000> create<00:03:00.360> a

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
all day waterproof eyeliner to create a

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.839 
all day waterproof eyeliner to create a
winged<00:03:00.780> line<00:03:01.110> on<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.590> top<00:03:01.799> lash<00:03:02.069> line<00:03:02.099> because

balances<00:03:05.400> out<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.880> lip<00:03:06.180> color<00:03:06.450> really<00:03:06.840> well
