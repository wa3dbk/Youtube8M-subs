this track your leg also has a brand new
track<00:00:13.870> mark<00:00:14.230> heaters<00:00:14.530> built<00:00:14.770> in<00:00:14.950> so<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:15.340> scale

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
track mark heaters built in so the scale

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.730 
track mark heaters built in so the scale
of<00:00:15.700> the<00:00:16.060> jumps<00:00:16.450> and<00:00:16.600> everything<00:00:16.750> here<00:00:17.410> are

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
of the jumps and everything here are

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.040 
of the jumps and everything here are
bigger<00:00:18.640> than<00:00:18.910> normal<00:00:19.090> but<00:00:19.600> they<00:00:19.750> make<00:00:19.930> this

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
bigger than normal but they make this

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.440 
bigger than normal but they make this
right-hander<00:00:20.800> in<00:00:21.010> this<00:00:21.190> massive<00:00:21.880> tabletop

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
right-hander in this massive tabletop

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.060 
right-hander in this massive tabletop
it's<00:00:22.900> gonna<00:00:23.020> be<00:00:23.140> tough<00:00:23.350> to<00:00:23.380> make<00:00:23.529> up<00:00:23.860> for<00:00:23.950> these

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
it's gonna be tough to make up for these

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.870 
it's gonna be tough to make up for these
two<00:00:24.130> 50s

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
two 50s

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.080 
two 50s
yeah<00:00:25.060> little<00:00:25.330> tabletop<00:00:25.900> and<00:00:26.050> a<00:00:26.140> huge<00:00:27.090> 90-foot

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
yeah little tabletop and a huge 90-foot

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.540 
yeah little tabletop and a huge 90-foot
tabletop<00:00:28.720> to<00:00:28.840> this<00:00:28.990> tabletop<00:00:29.470> to<00:00:29.860> to<00:00:30.070> 50s

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
tabletop to this tabletop to to 50s

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.270 
tabletop to this tabletop to to 50s
we're<00:00:30.880> having<00:00:31.119> trouble<00:00:31.450> even<00:00:31.570> making<00:00:32.020> it<00:00:32.080> is

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:32.280 
we're having trouble even making it is

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.160 
we're having trouble even making it is
massive<00:00:34.739> big<00:00:35.739> tabletop<00:00:36.220> was<00:00:36.430> definitely<00:00:36.879> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
massive big tabletop was definitely a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.660 
massive big tabletop was definitely a
super<00:00:38.170> big<00:00:38.320> right<00:00:38.590> out<00:00:38.739> of<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:39.040> coming<00:00:39.460> over

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
super big right out of the coming over

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.780 
super big right out of the coming over
like<00:00:39.820> a<00:00:39.850> tunnel<00:00:40.120> roller<00:00:40.449> then<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.290> small<00:00:41.800> inside

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
like a tunnel roller then a small inside

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.310 
like a tunnel roller then a small inside
roller<00:00:43.089> and<00:00:43.360> then<00:00:43.449> right<00:00:43.690> into<00:00:43.900> you<00:00:44.199> know

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
roller and then right into you know

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.290 
roller and then right into you know
massive<00:00:45.100> base<00:00:45.309> that<00:00:45.580> definitely<00:00:45.940> one<00:00:46.120> of<00:00:46.150> the

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
massive base that definitely one of the

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.829 
massive base that definitely one of the
biggest<00:00:46.510> jumps<00:00:47.350> on<00:00:47.470> the<00:00:47.559> circuit<00:00:48.839> yeah

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
biggest jumps on the circuit yeah

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.899 
biggest jumps on the circuit yeah
there's<00:00:50.080> a<00:00:50.170> big<00:00:50.739> table<00:00:50.890> top<00:00:51.159> here<00:00:51.339> Elsinore

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
there's a big table top here Elsinore

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.210 
there's a big table top here Elsinore
and<00:00:52.089> I<00:00:52.120> think<00:00:52.390> they<00:00:53.199> peaked<00:00:53.739> it<00:00:53.890> up<00:00:53.979> a<00:00:54.070> little

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
and I think they peaked it up a little

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.250 
and I think they peaked it up a little
bit<00:00:54.370> for<00:00:54.519> that<00:00:54.550> second<00:00:54.940> motor<00:00:55.089> but<00:00:55.390> um<00:00:55.570> it's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
bit for that second motor but um it's

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.930 
bit for that second motor but um it's
actually<00:00:56.409> wide<00:00:56.860> open<00:00:57.220> pretty<00:00:57.430> much<00:00:57.610> for<00:00:57.790> me

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
actually wide open pretty much for me

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.280 
actually wide open pretty much for me
and<00:00:58.420> I'm<00:00:58.540> sure<00:00:58.659> the<00:00:58.750> lights<00:00:58.900> guys<00:00:59.110> are

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
and I'm sure the lights guys are

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.110 
and I'm sure the lights guys are
struggling<00:00:59.589> they<00:00:59.710> get

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
struggling they get

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
struggling they get
but<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.920> race<00:01:02.190> had<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
but I think it was this race had the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.460 
but I think it was this race had the
coolest<00:01:02.670> dumps<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:03.270> surf<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
coolest dumps for surf with that and the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.930 
coolest dumps for surf with that and the
big<00:01:04.619> double<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.979> think<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.729> place

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
big double I think that on this place

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.100 
big double I think that on this place
for<00:01:06.240> sure<00:01:06.270> at<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> best<00:01:06.810> Oh

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.290 

right<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.250> corner<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.730> sure<00:01:14.910> maybe<00:01:15.120> not

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
right out of a corner for sure maybe not

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.580 
right out of a corner for sure maybe not
the<00:01:15.420> longest<00:01:15.630> distance<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.260> one<00:01:16.440> of<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the longest distance but one of the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.660 
the longest distance but one of the
biggest<00:01:16.770> ones<00:01:17.040> were<00:01:17.190> right<00:01:17.400> out<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.550> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
biggest ones were right out of the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090 
biggest ones were right out of the
corner<00:01:17.990> practice<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.260> press<00:01:19.440> day<00:01:19.620> nobody<00:01:19.890> can

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
corner practice and press day nobody can

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.730 
corner practice and press day nobody can
make<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.780> track<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.260> beating<00:01:22.590> was

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
make it and as the track up beating was

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.460 
make it and as the track up beating was
definitely<00:01:23.160> super<00:01:23.790> hard<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.990> had<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
definitely super hard but I just had to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.950 
definitely super hard but I just had to
give<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.980> see<00:01:26.130> bouncing<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.450> landing<00:01:27.780> was

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
give it and see bouncing the landing was

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.300 
give it and see bouncing the landing was
litora

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.100 

you<00:01:34.729> know<00:01:34.850> just<00:01:35.540> because<00:01:35.659> you<00:01:35.810> can't<00:01:35.990> make

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
you know just because you can't make

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.330 
you know just because you can't make
things<00:01:36.350> on<00:01:36.500> press<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.860> yourself

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
things on press to yourself

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.490 
things on press to yourself
you<00:01:38.030> know<00:01:38.119> as<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.420> gets<00:01:38.600> beating<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:39.140> gets<00:01:39.290> hard

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
you know as it gets beating it gets hard

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.960 
you know as it gets beating it gets hard
packed<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:39.920> get<00:01:40.040> a<00:01:40.070> lot<00:01:40.220> more<00:01:40.250> attraction<00:01:40.820> and

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
packed you get a lot more attraction and

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.820 
packed you get a lot more attraction and
kind<00:01:41.570> of<00:01:41.600> crazy<00:01:41.869> how<00:01:42.020> much<00:01:42.260> farther<00:01:42.530> you<00:01:42.799> can

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
kind of crazy how much farther you can

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.399 
kind of crazy how much farther you can
go<00:01:43.070> from<00:01:43.310> practice<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.330> you<00:01:44.509> know<00:01:44.630> halfway

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
go from practice that you know halfway

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.160 
go from practice that you know halfway
through<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.650> day

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
through the day

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.520 
through the day
it's<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:47.100> got<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.790> rhythm<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:48.540> comes<00:01:49.290> up<00:01:49.440> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
it's really got a rhythm here comes up a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.320 
it's really got a rhythm here comes up a
little<00:01:49.710> short<00:01:49.800> on<00:01:50.190> that<00:01:50.220> tabletop<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.060> he<00:01:51.150> has

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
little short on that tabletop and he has

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.730 
little short on that tabletop and he has
been<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:51.900> aggressor

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
been the aggressor

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.530 
been the aggressor
it<00:01:52.800> definitely<00:01:53.040> wasn't<00:01:53.460> make<00:01:53.730> a<00:01:53.760> break<00:01:54.030> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
it definitely wasn't make a break you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.660 
it definitely wasn't make a break you
can<00:01:54.660> scuff<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.890> was<00:01:56.010> fairly<00:01:56.220> any<00:01:56.490> bit

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
can scuff it it was fairly any bit

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:08.340 
can scuff it it was fairly any bit
slower

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.410 

you
