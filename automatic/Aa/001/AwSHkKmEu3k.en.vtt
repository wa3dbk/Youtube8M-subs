00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:59.350 
like as long as I think you'll tuck your
hair<00:03:57.069> I'm<00:03:58.069> gonna<00:03:58.220> wash<00:03:58.489> it<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:58.880> I'll<00:03:59.000> cut<00:03:59.209> the

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
hair I'm gonna wash it and I'll cut the

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.699 
hair I'm gonna wash it and I'll cut the
rest<00:03:59.650> okay<00:04:01.630> so<00:04:02.630> do<00:04:02.810> you<00:04:02.900> want<00:04:03.080> a<00:04:03.170> little<00:04:03.530> bit

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
rest okay so do you want a little bit

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.670 
rest okay so do you want a little bit
angled<00:04:03.980> or<00:04:04.250> do<00:04:04.549> you<00:04:04.670> like<00:04:04.880> your<00:04:05.030> pre<00:04:05.239> straight

here<00:04:06.680> this<00:04:06.890> I<00:04:07.160> think<00:04:07.970> that<00:04:08.060> angle<00:04:08.390> would<00:04:08.450> be

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
here this I think that angle would be

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:21.240 
here this I think that angle would be
nice<00:04:08.810> line<00:04:12.760> she<00:04:13.760> is<00:04:13.880> done<00:04:14.180> really<00:04:14.360> good<00:04:14.630> I
