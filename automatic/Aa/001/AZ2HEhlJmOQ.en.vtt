00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.290
 hello friends today we are going to continue with the 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.950
 theme of urban vegetable garden or what I'm going to 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.959
 to germinate are the peas as 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.129
 we call in Argentina in other places 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:17.360
 they are also called beans and peas 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.680
 Well, I'm going to show you why 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.680
 materials that we will use 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.520
 good what we 're going to need is for a 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.099
 paid earth side 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.710
 our peas that I did here 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.660
 is already open it and what you can observe 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.910
 because these were pretty pasaditas 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.820
 is that I had left to be able 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.020
 finish what we can observe is 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:51.270
 Look, they're already coming out 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.610
 the roots to each of the bees and 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.410
 then what we are going to use is a 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.420
 I use a bottle of 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.420
 transparent a bottle of soda and you 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.240
 I made some small holes down to 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.150
 can use it as good pots 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.060
 until then let's open one let's go 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.090
 open another one so they can see how 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.090
 some of the bees already have 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:24.280
 has a little tip so they are already 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.010
 finished had already germinated in 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.490
 of your good cause then what are we going 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:34.380
 to do now 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.740
 it is first we are going to place earth in the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.740
 flower pot 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.030
 and we will go placing 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.430
 our peas yes 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.820
 well let's go placing the little ears 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.820
 here 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:06.840
 we download them a little so that 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.840
 let's have the seedlings separated 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.800
 and what we are going to do now is 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.800
 put more paid land 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.410
 and we are going to water them 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.050
 trying to add daily and in the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.240
 next tutorial let's see the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.790
