basically it's like the informal way of
transportation<00:00:11.429> here<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.570> Philippines

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
transportation here in the Philippines

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.259 
transportation here in the Philippines
and<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.799> can<00:00:13.920> just<00:00:14.070> jump<00:00:14.309> on<00:00:14.460> jump<00:00:14.670> off<00:00:15.000> it's

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
and you can just jump on jump off it's

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.790 
and you can just jump on jump off it's
really<00:00:15.330> really<00:00:15.809> cheap<00:00:16.049> especially<00:00:16.500> compared

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
really really cheap especially compared

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.550 
really really cheap especially compared
to<00:00:16.830> taxis<00:00:17.310> it's<00:00:18.000> for<00:00:18.420> us<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.510> move<00:00:18.869> about<00:00:19.199> like

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
to taxis it's for us to move about like

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.130 
to taxis it's for us to move about like
45<00:00:20.400> minutes<00:00:20.640> half<00:00:21.150> an<00:00:21.270> hour<00:00:21.390> 45<00:00:21.630> minutes<00:00:21.990> it's

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.620 

just<00:00:42.380> started<00:00:42.740> raining<00:00:42.950> here<00:00:43.400> not<00:00:44.270> too<00:00:44.420> heavy

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
just started raining here not too heavy

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.020 
just started raining here not too heavy
yet<00:00:44.870> but<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.800> way<00:00:45.920> rain<00:00:46.160> usually<00:00:46.430> goes<00:00:46.760> a

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
yet but the way rain usually goes a

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.400 
yet but the way rain usually goes a
little<00:00:47.180> bit<00:00:47.420> of<00:00:47.510> rain<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:47.810> it<00:00:47.930> turns<00:00:48.140> into<00:00:48.320> a

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
little bit of rain and it turns into a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.440 
little bit of rain and it turns into a
massive<00:00:48.950> downpour<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.090> we<00:00:50.270> might<00:00:50.420> find

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
massive downpour so we might find

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.940 
massive downpour so we might find
ourselves<00:00:50.720> getting<00:00:51.050> soaked<00:00:51.410> I'm<00:00:51.590> gonna<00:00:51.800> put

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
ourselves getting soaked I'm gonna put

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.950 
ourselves getting soaked I'm gonna put
away<00:00:52.040> in<00:00:52.160> my<00:00:52.250> electronics<00:00:52.820> but<00:00:53.630> at<00:00:53.750> any<00:00:53.900> time

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
away in my electronics but at any time

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.380 
away in my electronics but at any time
in<00:00:54.320> touch<00:00:54.530> it's<00:00:55.040> a<00:00:55.100> really<00:00:55.340> nice<00:00:55.460> like<00:00:56.120> change

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
in touch it's a really nice like change

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.850 
in touch it's a really nice like change
of<00:00:56.540> temperature<00:00:56.810> actually<00:00:57.470> kind<00:00:57.620> of<00:00:57.650> cooled

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
of temperature actually kind of cooled

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.550 
of temperature actually kind of cooled
down<00:00:58.010> a<00:00:58.070> bit<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:58.610> the<00:00:59.480> rain<00:00:59.630> feels<00:00:59.840> good

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.780 

they're<00:01:03.560> trying<00:01:03.770> to<00:01:03.800> scare<00:01:04.040> these<00:01:04.190> ox<00:01:04.430> away<00:01:04.730> so

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
they're trying to scare these ox away so

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.590 
they're trying to scare these ox away so
they<00:01:05.030> can<00:01:05.120> fill<00:01:05.390> up<00:01:05.480> some<00:01:05.660> water<00:01:07.600> territorial

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
they can fill up some water territorial

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.750 
they can fill up some water territorial
but<00:01:08.930> there's<00:01:09.710> so<00:01:09.950> many<00:01:10.100> ox<00:01:10.370> out<00:01:10.610> in<00:01:10.670> the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
but there's so many ox out in the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.290 
but there's so many ox out in the
countryside<00:01:11.090> in<00:01:11.300> their<00:01:11.570> masses

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.180 

I<00:01:15.360> guess<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.170> pour<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.530> there<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.830> engine

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
I guess we pour it in there for engine

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.370 
I guess we pour it in there for engine
coolant<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> engine<00:01:17.970> gets<00:01:18.120> too<00:01:18.300> hot<00:01:18.450> Sun<00:01:19.260> just

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
coolant the engine gets too hot Sun just

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.680 
coolant the engine gets too hot Sun just
working<00:01:19.800> really<00:01:19.980> hard<00:01:20.300> yeah<00:01:21.300> it's<00:01:21.510> like<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
working really hard yeah it's like the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.060 
working really hard yeah it's like the
car<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.990> rented<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:22.560> had<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> car<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.010> would

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
car we rented we had a car that would

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.620 
car we rented we had a car that would
has<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.400> cooled<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:23.850> every<00:01:24.120> friggin<00:01:24.330> five

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
has to be cooled like every friggin five

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:36.710 
has to be cooled like every friggin five
minutes

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.700 

Lauren<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:37.810> keep<00:01:37.990> getting<00:01:38.110> whipped<00:01:38.470> in<00:01:38.650> the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
Lauren I keep getting whipped in the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.740 
Lauren I keep getting whipped in the
face<00:01:38.920> by<00:01:39.130> branches<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:39.820> vines<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.450> all<00:01:40.630> the

I think we got steel our next stop will
be<00:04:40.290> Porto<00:04:40.890> Princesa<00:04:41.340> but<00:04:41.730> we're<00:04:41.850> basically

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
be Porto Princesa but we're basically
