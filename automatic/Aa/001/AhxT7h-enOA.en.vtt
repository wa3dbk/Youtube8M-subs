00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.299
 and criticism that today I bring you a video 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.650
 tells us minecraft x a 0.12 point 0 and 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.720
 this and let's talk about what already such 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.220
 time for you use news maybe for 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.380
 you already saw it everywhere in 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.730
 twitter and others but well I have not 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.349
 talked about this and really that was what 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.460
 that I cared enough and decides to do 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.009
 the video because they were not watching my 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.109
 opinion on the subject and it really is 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.789
 very important this since good tomÃ¡s 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.820
 added what a switch is in settings 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.290
 to activate or deactivate the 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.930
 separate button that I showed you the video 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.370
 just as before and that I will 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.720
 he commented that he might take to putting 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.760
 a switch but take a child who is going to 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.409
 take a long time and decreeing took almost 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.500
 nothing I say yes 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.580
 and then really that is very comfortable 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.369
 because many people do not like it 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.570
 so much for example here the east yes 

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:55.699
 he agreed that there was that 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.430
 that that separate button because really 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.989
 the parkour is very difficult and my first 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.790
 this on this issue is that everyone is going to 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.400
 think what pleases me best in me in my 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.220
 I have already mentioned the parkour 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.140
 I can not do it because the arrows 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.240
 and the little circle of briqa are very close together 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.409
 and I sweat a lot the hand goes to 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.750
 say I'm crazy but here where 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.800
 I live very hot I sweat enough 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.410
 sweat a lot 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.760
 although they laugh is the truth and it is very 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.140
 difficult to do parkour in fact with 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.210
 when I get more nervous with the 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.650
 party sweats my hand more and the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.210
 screen and it does not respond just as well 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.130
 so I want to make it slide the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.690
 finger that many tell me monsters is very 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.550
 easy just slide this finger and 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.320
 jump when I want to do it but not 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.020
 serves does not answer the screen by the 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.960
 I can not do boat sweat then 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.460
 that along with the controls to 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.969
 those of the switch this one along with the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.590
 normal controls will be amazing 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.840
 because we are going to be able to those that we could not 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.939
 do parkour how to take about it and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.780
 I have many more, not only us 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.819
 there are many people who really 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.590
 battle with parkour we are going to be able to 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.439
 do parkour freely then in my 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.060
 opinion is very cool the truth if 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.380
 you do not like that so good to be able 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.569
 play normally to auction the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.130
 switch in settings what is today for me 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.509
 subs that did not know about this because I have 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.289
 many that if of plane they were me 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.790
 asking so what happened to this already 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.230
 do not talk more about this than if you take only goes 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.400
 implement not so good here is yes 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.319
 he will implement it with his switch 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.790
 and it will be very comfortable for all 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.010
 belong as I explain controls that 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.980
 they have their switches and they can turn it off 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.720
 activate who you like and well I do not know anymore 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.629
 I am very excited because I have many 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.370
 subs maps that have parkour and that 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.049
 if I brought them some but it's not the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.970
 parkour I showed them nothing but flying 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.790
 then in my opinion it will be very 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.560
 great because I really though 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.239
 they laugh at me I can not see gourdes from 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.670
 flat my hands do not let me do 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.109
 parkour sweat a lot then I hope 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.180
 someone really understand me and if 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.099
 you pass them your problem comment is 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.930
 normal on tablets when they have the 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.060
 sweaty or wet hands that do not respond 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.069
 ok the touch and then this is a 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.659
 problem that I hope already with this button 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.099
 new can be solved if sure yes 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.209
 because in the most games that the 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.489
 separate button could jump 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.379
 perfectly and there is no problem 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.620
 how do i tell you order 2 wide mini 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.480
 carnival gta san andreas you can also 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.010
 walking separately jump has them 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.629

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.459

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.909
 leave in the description and you know that 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.639

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.170
 of what is the sales of windows like this 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.300
 that I will be 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.410
 it's early for people to give 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.450
 windows and for the people just like you 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.280
 interesting to see what will happen with everything 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.319
 this and good for everything for this video is 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.849
 they take care of a giant hug they leave their like 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.580
 seriously, they are quite useful because 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.489
 that's how the video stayed and it drives me 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.709
 to bring you more videos of type then 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.709
