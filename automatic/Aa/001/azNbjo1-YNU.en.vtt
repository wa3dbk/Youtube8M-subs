00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.560
 mim 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.279
 it 's getting up slowly as you do 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.410
 There are no crunches here 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.820
 already a first partial success the first 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.680
 Weeks was not so easy I am me 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.020
 already had great pain and also 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.520
 really big problems and little to do 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.770
 I lost everything at home 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.169
 get what a certain time afterwards 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.660
 is quite pleasant but then yes 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.059
 it does not have to be and we have to 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.579
 Tanja and go up is satisfied 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.899
 and shall bind 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.280
 so I set myself no goal so 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.410
 The therapist would like to discuss this 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.690
 that we want defensive because he wants 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.609
 because he's from seven to eight months 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.350
 goes out and everything comes then what 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.999
 Of course it used to be a success 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.410
 contact under pressure are said to 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.390
 five months back in the square stand 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.489
 and then start too soon and then again 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.260
 I get problems from that 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.600
 rather defensive we do not do any 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.199
 pressure and I think the chances of healing 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.260
 be that is very strange 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.900
 i also have to say the tension when 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.240
 I play is significantly less than 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.130
 audience that's already nothing more 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.440
 My nerves so I prefer to 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.850
 I stand there anyway 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.100
 have complete confidence in the boys 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.240
 and they do that in the back as well 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.700
 well we have very little goals 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.950
 so far and that fits 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.870
 actually , of course, I always have 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.550
 again I am in contact with the boys 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.770
 already with a steady exchange binz 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.840
 I know I will be there every day 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.850
 tomorrow with drive to dresden and 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.440
 as far as I can support them I am 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.670
 of course, and try 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.170
 to cheer and also a small one 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.150
 to contribute in part 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.120
 and of course hope for the big goal 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.620
 but after all over there win yes 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.850
 I say so finally we had 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.450
 at the end on the foot the game still 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.750
 to win 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.100
 have the frankfurter I was eleven 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.160
 man stood in his own half 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.140
 it was difficult to play on 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.800
 There is also just not enough 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.570
 passed through 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.010
 in the back we were well and 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.630
 The chances we actually had said 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.670
 And finally it does not have the victory 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.260
 served and still have it 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.090
 an initial position is such that 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.009
 we have a victory on sunday 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.510
 and different weeks had it 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.000
 I do not think so dared and 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.470
 therein is our chance it will be 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.780
 of course a fighting game and allowed 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.830
 be influenced by the crisis or 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.290
 impress 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.069
 they will be mostly against us 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.540
 all 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.920
 and I think so too 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.930
 cool I think most guys 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.879
 exciting degree on such a 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.799
 pressure situation bochum was also already 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.989
 some pressure in a stadium very full 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.909
 so I'm sure ours 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.549
 Young rather upset and yes that 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.319
 It would be a good game 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.439
 because we this a sworn teams 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.439
 are
