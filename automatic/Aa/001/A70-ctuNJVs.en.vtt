stay low back up and give you a hard
time<00:00:45.600> early<00:00:46.170> what's<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.950> little<00:00:47.640> bit<00:00:47.820> yeah

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
time early what's I do a little bit yeah

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.569 
time early what's I do a little bit yeah
so<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> knew<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.920> would<00:00:50.039> happen<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.550> I

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
so I knew that that would happen but I

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.770 
so I knew that that would happen but I
kind<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.000> wanted<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> stay<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> course

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
kind of just wanted to stay the course

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.380 
kind of just wanted to stay the course
and<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.949> focus<00:00:53.219> was<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.520> continue<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.239> move

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
and so the focus was to continue to move

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.869 
and so the focus was to continue to move
continue<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.050> work<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:56.250> angles<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.789> then

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
continue to work and get angles and then

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.250 
continue to work and get angles and then
obviously<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.329> thought<00:00:57.629> he<00:00:57.780> would<00:00:57.930> break<00:00:58.109> her

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
obviously I thought he would break her

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.439 
obviously I thought he would break her
break<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.039> little<00:00:59.309> bit<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.820> end<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.239> I

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
break a little bit in the end and so I

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.990 
break a little bit in the end and so I
was<00:01:00.660> fortunate<00:01:00.870> enough<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.410> uh<00:01:02.000> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
was fortunate enough to do that uh you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
was fortunate enough to do that uh you
know<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> didn't<00:01:03.449> kind<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.199> start<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> match

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
know I didn't kind of start the match

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.410 
know I didn't kind of start the match
the<00:01:05.220> way<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> wanted<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> thought<00:01:05.939> took

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the way I wanted to I thought took

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.210 
the way I wanted to I thought took
multiple<00:01:06.810> shots<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.320> they<00:01:07.439> weren't<00:01:07.619> as<00:01:07.830> solid

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
multiple shots but they weren't as solid
