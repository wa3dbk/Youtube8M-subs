each tin that we found has a little bit
of<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.430> different<00:02:45.730> consistency<00:02:46.060> like<00:02:46.840> the

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
of a different consistency like the

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.229 
of a different consistency like the
purple<00:02:47.409> is<00:02:47.590> super<00:02:48.010> loose<00:02:48.219> and<00:02:48.790> kind<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.090> see<00:02:49.209> I

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
purple is super loose and kind of see I

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.569 
purple is super loose and kind of see I
can<00:02:49.450> just<00:02:49.480> go<00:02:49.689> like<00:02:49.870> that<00:02:50.019> with<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.409> and<00:02:50.579> then

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
can just go like that with it and then

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.520 
can just go like that with it and then
the<00:02:52.000> blue<00:02:52.209> here<00:02:52.629> is<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.620> little<00:02:54.010> bit<00:02:54.099> drier<00:02:54.430> and

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the blue here is a little bit drier and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.110 
the blue here is a little bit drier and
so<00:02:56.530> if<00:02:56.859> you<00:02:57.010> do<00:02:57.159> have<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.340> little<00:02:57.549> bit<00:02:57.639> drier<00:02:57.849> one

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120

all right and I'm happy with how that
looks<00:05:41.550> so<00:05:41.789> that<00:05:41.970> took<00:05:42.270> all<00:05:42.750> of<00:05:42.810> just<00:05:43.740> about<00:05:44.039> two

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
looks so that took all of just about two

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.969 
looks so that took all of just about two
minutes<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:45.210> you'll<00:05:46.199> see<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:46.530> difference

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
minutes and you'll see the difference

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.309 
minutes and you'll see the difference
between<00:05:47.190> the<00:05:47.460> original<00:05:47.580> and<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.240> new<00:05:48.270> one<00:05:48.539> now

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 
between the original and the new one now

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:50.390 
between the original and the new one now
