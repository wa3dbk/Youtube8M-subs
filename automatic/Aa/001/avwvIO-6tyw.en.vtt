it's<00:00:20.010> really<00:00:20.430> important<00:00:20.940> to<00:00:21.090> make<00:00:21.210> sure<00:00:21.450> that

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
it's really important to make sure that

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.750 
it's really important to make sure that
the<00:00:21.780> butter<00:00:21.990> cream<00:00:22.320> icing<00:00:22.500> you're<00:00:22.860> using<00:00:23.190> is

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the butter cream icing you're using is

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.850 
the butter cream icing you're using is
really<00:00:24.000> light<00:00:24.360> and<00:00:24.600> fluffy<00:00:24.780> because<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.440> helps

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
really light and fluffy because it helps

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.170 
really light and fluffy because it helps
when<00:00:26.010> you're<00:00:26.160> pushing<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.640> through<00:00:26.790> the<00:00:27.000> bag

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
when you're pushing it through the bag

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.180 
when you're pushing it through the bag
if<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.720> got<00:00:27.869> big<00:00:28.260> flecks<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.770> air<00:00:28.950> in<00:00:29.100> it

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
if it's got big flecks of air in it

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.010 
if it's got big flecks of air in it
that's<00:00:29.520> going<00:00:29.700> to<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.820> really<00:00:30.180> easy<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.420> pipe

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
that's going to be really easy to pipe

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.170 
that's going to be really easy to pipe
probably<00:00:31.470> takes<00:00:31.710> about<00:00:31.830> seven<00:00:32.400> minutes<00:00:32.700> using

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
probably takes about seven minutes using

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.820 
probably takes about seven minutes using
a<00:00:33.330> hand<00:00:33.600> mixer<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:34.020> get<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.650> stage

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
a hand mixer to get it to that stage

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.880 
a hand mixer to get it to that stage
take<00:00:35.700> your<00:00:35.910> nozzle<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.570> place<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.379> into<00:00:37.559> your

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
take your nozzle and place it into your

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.880 
take your nozzle and place it into your
icing<00:00:38.280> bag<00:00:38.460> give<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> little<00:00:39.540> shape<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.260> you

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
icing bag give it a little shape and you

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.650 
icing bag give it a little shape and you
need<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.129> cut<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> end<00:00:41.670> off<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
need to cut the end off so that the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.600 
need to cut the end off so that the
nozzle<00:00:43.020> pokes<00:00:43.230> through<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:44.070> leaves<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
nozzle pokes through that leaves the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.790 
nozzle pokes through that leaves the
nozzle<00:00:44.820> free<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:45.870> make<00:00:46.080> sure<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.379> no

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
nozzle free but make sure that no

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.170 
nozzle free but make sure that no
buttercream<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.400> going<00:00:47.580> to<00:00:47.670> slip<00:00:47.910> through<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
buttercream is going to slip through the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.410 
buttercream is going to slip through the
edges<00:00:48.449> there<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.290> fill<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.890> icing<00:00:50.340> bag<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.820> use

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
edges there to fill the icing bag I use

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.540 
edges there to fill the icing bag I use
a<00:00:51.720> pint<00:00:51.989> glass<00:00:52.079> because<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.100> see<00:00:53.310> through

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
a pint glass because you can see through

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.130 
a pint glass because you can see through
it<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.060> see<00:00:54.210> how<00:00:54.420> much<00:00:54.630> buttercream

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it so you can see how much buttercream

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.690 
it so you can see how much buttercream
you<00:00:55.260> put<00:00:55.440> into<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.739> bag<00:00:55.920> spoon<00:00:56.520> the

buttercream in now only fill it to about
halfway<00:01:00.440> anymore<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.739> becomes<00:01:02.010> quite

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
halfway anymore and it becomes quite

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.790 
halfway anymore and it becomes quite
heavy<00:01:02.809> also<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.870> risk<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.440> buttercream

then there's less chance of it sort of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.170 
then there's less chance of it sort of
scooting<00:01:31.500> around<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:32.280> make<00:01:32.580> sure<00:01:32.909> though<00:01:33.150> that

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180
