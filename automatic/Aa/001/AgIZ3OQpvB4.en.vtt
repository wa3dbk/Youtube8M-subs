00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.379
 I expel what I say guys because 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.689
 many people who are not in crisis 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.219
 here it is but it does not play is that 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.139
 clear lead to bears and with assets 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.270
 it is very complicated to pass them wallride 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.730
 very, very difficult 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.650
 to see an der is a very good car if 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.540
 you go straight if it's a circuit that does not 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.740
 has many curves if it's a circuit to 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.630
 the best you have to have more 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.220
 speed than agility but a DNA in 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.650
 how much do you put a little more curves 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.330
 when you jump, too, but 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.510
 when you put on wallride loopings things 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.620
 those are going a lot but good as 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.120
 we are seeing that this we are going to 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.440
 spend in life I hope that I have 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.000
 liked I'll cut here the video 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.860

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.450
