 we will prepare cupcakes with fruits of 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:33.380
 woodland a raw dessert to make 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:38.120
 cupcakes that will need trays 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:41.610
 little ones tongue in a food processor 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:46.310
 and finally an immersion blender 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.160
 the ingredients for making cupcakes are 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:53.040
 two cups of almonds and a cup of 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.050
 dates the proportion in each case is 2 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.640
 to 1 of vanilla powder 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.800
 we had a berry we have 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.899
 grated if you have the vanilla in 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.740
 powder and better than cinnamon 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:13.049
 ginger and 2 tablespoons of linseed oil 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.060
 cold pressed 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.270
 if you don't have linseed oil that's fine 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.630
 any other oil as long as squeezed in 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.479
 cold that has a delicate taste like 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.020
 that of corn the grated rind of 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.609
 a lemon 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.329
 for the strawberry cream we will need the 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.939
 not mature lawyer pulp half 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.229
 excessively mature and not even immature 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.799
 ripe a bowl of strawberries that we 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.889
 we have already cut into pieces of the 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.549
 almond milk and 3 tablespoons of 

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:54.109
 syrup from quarries we will cover the cupcakes 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.929
 with berries, raspberries and blackberries 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:02:00.209
 pour into the mixer in the chopper i 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.819
 ingredients to play the part 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:05.790
 almonds that we already have as you see 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:09.330
 soaked and skinned for 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.840
 I have to look for work we are the cut 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.820
 dates before putting them in 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:26.070
 container and we also insert dates a 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:30.600
 we are vanilla cinnamon a 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:36.000
 teaspoon of spices is fine teaspoon 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:45.240
 of ginger and 2 tablespoons of seed oil 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:48.080

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.080
 grated lemon 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.450
 we got a rather compound 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:01.860
 homogeneous and extremely compact as well 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.610
 sticky due precisely to the presence of 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.570
 dates we are shaping the basis of 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.570
 our cupcakes 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:18.489
 Here is good, now we do n't have to do 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:21.849
 other than laying the foundations of ours 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.730
 cupcakes in the fridge and wait for that 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:28.329
 let's put ourselves in the container 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.159
 of the blender the lawyer the proposal 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.750
 of the lawyer we have in the meantime 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.569
 wet with a little lemon juice per 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:43.260
 avoid the lawyer oxidizes and then 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:53.650
 add the strawberries 3 tablespoons of 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:57.510
 syrup from quarries 2 and 3 we start with the 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:03.669
 put some almond milk 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:06.250
 we whisk well we kept a cream 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.799
 very velvety 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.680
 now we can start preparing the 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:15.909
 our cupcakes in the meantime they are 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.820
 certainly hardened we lay a layer 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:26.550
 quite generous with cream 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:26.550
 strawberries on our cupcakes on a base 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:43.790
 the berry tarts are ready and 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:46.360
 sr definitely go rosetto and we hope that 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:50.960
 may be to your liking 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:54.160
