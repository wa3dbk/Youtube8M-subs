00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.910
 hello everyone with you club diamond and now 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.049
 we 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.550
 our knife coach of the year michael 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.270
 ask about this situation 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.250
 you're on the street and the kids are down the street 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.529
 dark alley and then meet you 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.320
 some kind of incomprehensible man start with 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.109
 knife and you understand that lissandra 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.739
 there is no sense in picking up a knife 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.010
 escape from some her fear they are not the way 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.170
 do you need a knife in the back and should run and if 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.530
 run then how we ask this question how 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.050
 just leave your question and it is not well in the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.520
 First you need to evaluate 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.739
 adversary on his mental state 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.239
 just adequate offender well 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.010
 as far as possible adequate 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.449
 the criminal he start the unthinkable 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.079
 will lose burning it mentally 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.090
 unbalanced to keep in a straight line from the knife 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.149
 in fact in our throwing a lot 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.559
 myths all watched a lot of movies 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.630
 there are especially old Soviet flies 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.830
 Basmachi skete that shoot now there 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.130
 Generally a computer game 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.140
 practically people don't even fly the same 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.030
 throwing into circulation without turning us very 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.860
 important feeling of distance you slept saga 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.409
 man made back and forth and everything with us 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.590
 it wo n't come as planned in 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.270
 throw if you run on reception if you run 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.130
 a direct chance of course so that you have 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.710
 a man will fall but the same as the drawings 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.560
 mid stone chance he will hit the blade 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.079
 also not to see if if you still 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.119
 you see that the person there is going to throw 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.920
 better run like this in the army is called 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.490
 anti-bullet zigzag that is so so 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.280
 then he will not get that you probably 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.570
 it makes sense to learn what knives 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.840
 throwing 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.900
 and the nose is not normal balancing 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.190
 yes yes different balancing 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.500
 naturally throwing a knife not 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.060
 special simple us even more difficult but 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.030
 again there is for example some kind of us there 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.160
 heavy heavy blade will be received but 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.470
 In principle, the most dangerous 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.259
 this is something multifaceted and by asterisks 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.090
 or the dam there is one thing well, because those 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.610
 that they are of any axis 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.830
 what are any facets 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.830
 chances like 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:27.319
 run on a man armed with a knife 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:29.150
 need to run don't think if you saw in 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.739
 dancing trying to throw at the ready 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.500
 then you just have to keep them 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.230
 and all the odds will get him 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.500
 practically 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:43.069
 you palmas write comments put 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.219
 likes and we will shoot you another video on 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.930
 our fight by the way write your questions in 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:51.310
