00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.620
 again another day making another video and in 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.240
 today's video the insurance that 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.240
 you will remember that a year ago 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.189
 approximately in almost a year it has already gone up 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.800
 a video of how they applied the manicure 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.540
 Permanent gel with a kit of better 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.480
 then you can do it in our 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.790
 own house, well, if you do not remember 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.840
 what is the video I will put it for some 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.730
 site for them to carry indirectly and 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.530
 well that 's for also if you do not 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.059
 you have seen I wanted to remember it and also 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.550
 so you can see how the procedure 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.000
 apply a permanent gel manicure and 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.730
 good in the kit is in principle what 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.220
 it came was small enamel for 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.230
 take away the permanent manicure 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.510
 in which to remove and good 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.730
 to take off his nails with this was a 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.190
 authentic roll took a lot and 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.220
 it was super heavy what had to be done 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.410
 was to throw it all over the nail to cover 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.869
 with silver foil wait for a while 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.900
 and then remove it and it was with a stick 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.940
 of orange trees but you had to work hard 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.250
 and the truth is that it was quite uncomfortable 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.530
 I do tell you the truth honestly and 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.259
 the manicure leaves the middle a boom that yes 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.090
 I liked it a lot 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.860
 I know maybe four or five times 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.170
 followed because I like quite how 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.869
 it remained in my painting quite 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.610
 When I put it off, it seemed like a 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.170
 authentic roll and like that is me 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.850
 there was a little bit the desire to return to 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.229
 do then well that gave me a boom 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.380
 that yes it tells me many times though 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.120
 I had to take them off with the dance 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.300
 it looked like 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.790
 Well now and this same brand as 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.800
 has realized that this was a 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.690
 little roll every time it 's action the 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.470
 Permanent manicure riding all of chile 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.900
 or has brought out a new method that is like 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.360
 a kind of oil 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.460
 that they remove their nails apparently 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.110
 much faster and without damaging both the 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.640
 nail because as he said he knows that 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.830
 work it really the unity 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.070
 I suffered a lot 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.220
 Then I have done my manicure 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.840
 permanent with this glaze that is called 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.090
 page and that is also from a collection 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.520
 new that has dried as of 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.790
 spring that some pastel colors like that 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.700
 very cool pink I'll teach it now 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.450
 It has about two weeks as you see it is already 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.480
 from the bottom part that has grown me 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.040
 the model of the nail but good and follow 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.530
 in enamel we have not been presented 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.140
 none simply what you 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.090
 I say a little bit the bottom and well I'll 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.710
 to try right now in a live 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.410
 while playing the video to see how 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.870
 this works and if it is true that it is 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.080
 much more comfortable than the other 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.330
 nail polish remover to use this type of 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.760
 This kind of how bad you not with 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.050
 the other with some dissolved with this 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.660
 You must have waited with what is 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.540
 a little bit the nail and contain it like me 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.579
 has already started to grow 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.230
 and good to copy the video now so that 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.150
 you yourselves can see the result 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.849
 and he said drop yourselves to see what 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.340
 such works it is worth to remove the nails to 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.780
 part of stories Tuesday this oil what 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.849
 What you need is a bowl of water 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.359
 Warmly has to 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:19.000
 be about 40 degrees but we're going to 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:21.489
 be cool that we do not 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.810
 grass but that is warm and 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.299
 while warmer because he supposes that 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.609
 more effective is and so to take away the 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.980
 the enamel then an orange stick or 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.350
 as the water itself is supposed to 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.870
 remove 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.140
 The first thing to do is take the 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.800
 oil and take a good spray through the 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.510
 cuticle 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.010
 and a cord that you put a towel 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.010
 below per week or whatever 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.230
 ok and once this is done put your hand 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.870
 in the hot water about three minutes 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.030
 approximately 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.420
 I'm going to move on after 3 minutes I'm going to take 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.420
 hand 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.630
 and now what you have to do is take the 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.660
 Palito este de naranjo and with patience and 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.010
 little by little go lifting the nail 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.010
 good the nail not the enamel 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.940
 if you see that you can not or what is 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.290
 still a little hard then what to do 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.590
 is to return to oil and return it to 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.680
 submerge but come on I think I'm 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.729
 waiting to return 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.729
 for now 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:01.780
 I think more than with the stick 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.330
 after about five minutes 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.220
 scratching with patience I've already got 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.720
 completely remove the evil from this hand 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.910
 I would just stay the other time 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.740
 all the remains of enamel and 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.440
 nothing is taken away the truth is that without much 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.480
 difficulty we are entertained and the best 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.670
 that has the oil this is that leaves a 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.370
 as very hydrated and does not suffer at all 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.830
 colors that with the other as there was that 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.140
 scratch a little the nail because the truth is 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.250
 that was quite unpleasant and it 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:10.670
 apart from taking longer and spoiling a 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.680
 little nail so good I think this 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.570
 method is much better than nothing is left of 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.700
 repeat the other hand as it is the 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.680
 final result and the nails completely 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.270
 clean of enamel among others what 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.340
 that I will have been slow to do everything with 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.380
 preparation and everything about 15-20 minutes 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.880
 pretty much less than what 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.680
 took with the other one that I could throw 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.200
 half an hour quietly among which 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.639
 ends with the stick to remove the 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.909
 enamel 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:37.759
 but how does the oil stay like 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:40.279
 goes inside the enamel and fingernail 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:42.650
 and it takes off super easy is a meeting 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:44.060
 much less work so with this 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.800
 method I hope to do the manicure 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.289
 permanent with a little more frequency 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.240
 well if you have been interested I will put everything in 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:51.770
 order by the information box for 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.349
 that you can see the product on the web 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.300
 then where can you buy and so on 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:07:02.560
 and good finally I also wanted 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:02.560
 show you this nail file in plan 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.730
 of crystal that I had the bad luck to 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.689
 that fell and it broke but good 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.969
 I still can not continue using 

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:15.039
 and well, I'm going to touch up a little bit 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:16.779
 the nails with the limits and I'll go back to 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:19.029
 put the permanent mold again 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:21.519
 because I love it I think I'm going to 

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:23.379
 use the same color even and nothing 

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:24.699
 I hope you liked the video and if 

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:27.819
 Do you have any doubts regarding the 

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:30.059
 application so you can ask me 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:30.059
 bye
