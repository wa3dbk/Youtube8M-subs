faster<00:01:02.579> than<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> other<00:01:03.120> part<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.290> will

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
faster than the other part and that will

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.480 
faster than the other part and that will
make<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.680> very<00:01:04.710> thin<00:01:05.309> or<00:01:06.030> very<00:01:06.840> Brown<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:08.159> you

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
make it very thin or very Brown just you

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.359

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
know not as tasty as the rest of it so

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.740 
know not as tasty as the rest of it so
I'm<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.640> tapping<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.090> down<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.510> kind<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
I'm just tapping it down here kind of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.460 
I'm just tapping it down here kind of
smoothing<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:14.780> using<00:01:15.780> my<00:01:15.990> knuckles<00:01:16.350> like

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
smoothing it out using my knuckles like

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.780 
smoothing it out using my knuckles like
this<00:01:16.710> because<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.100> easier<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.549> press<00:01:17.729> down

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
this because it's easier to press down

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.130 
this because it's easier to press down
for<00:01:18.210> me<00:01:18.330> there's<00:01:18.540> no<00:01:18.659> right<00:01:18.840> or<00:01:18.869> wrong<00:01:19.080> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
for me there's no right or wrong you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.539
