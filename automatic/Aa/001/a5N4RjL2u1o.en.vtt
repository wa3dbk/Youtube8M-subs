00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.210
People would ask me when I was little, 'what do you want to be when you grow up?' I want to be a physician.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.200
The only thing that kept me going in school

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.000
was really my love and desire to heal.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.029
I remember faking that I was sick because I wanted my mom to take

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.330
me to the doctor because I just loved the environment.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.390
When I rotated on cardiothoracic surgery 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.510
that's when all of the pieces of the puzzle really came together.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.830
It was another one of those moments in
life where I just knew that this was what

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.980
I was meant to do.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.670

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.340
From 0 to 7

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.890
I grew up in the landfills
near San Felipe, which is

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.770
pretty much the outskirts Mexico (City). The memories are kind of blurry but 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.390
they're really painful.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.489
My childhood was mainly kind of growing
up on my own.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.610
I didn't really do any extracurricular activities 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.810
because there was no one to take us.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.739
My parents were migrant farm workers. 
Growing up we

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.470
spent afternoons working with them after
school

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.670
By the time I was a senior in high
school 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.570
I met my wife Rita

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.260
we had a son, so we were teenage parents.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.240
My parents came here from Mexico.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.140
They didn't go to college. My dad only went

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.200
to middle school. 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200
It wasn't a very obvious         

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.360
path to medicine for me. 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.520
Prep Medico definitely will have a big
big, big impact for

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.290
Latino students who come from
similar backgrounds as myself.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.950
Having a program like Prep Medico, I think

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.420
would be very beneficial to help be like a beacon to guide 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.320
students along who don't necessarily have the 
mentorship from their parents or

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.320
don't have family members who have gone
through the process.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.170
"Hey, Luis...."      A mentorship is very powerful

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.220
thing. "It's good to see you..."  I

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.000
actual met Dr. (Frank) Sousa when I was
applying for the post baccalaureate

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.910
program.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.300
I showed up in my nice suit, nervous as
heck, and he was the interviewer that

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.850
day. it was the first day I met him.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.320
I felt a strong connection with
them

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.840
from the very beginning.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.740
Once you're in medical school,,,yes, you're in medical school but

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.940
the struggle still continues.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.730
Even just having someone to be like 'you
can do it, you can do this. Just 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.300
having someone on your team...

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.920
It's kind of tough to ask for help because
we're raised with

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.819
'You have to pull forward, you should not
depend on

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.160
anybody else.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.349

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.580
But I learned really fast through the post baccalaureate (program), I know, we are in a world where 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.370
you have to ask for help when you need help to grow

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.870
in order to be smart.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.689
Getting someone to help you with your MCAT prep,
because that is just scary in itself.

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.909
If I had done the MCAT by myself, I feel
like after the first try I would've been like,

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.870
'Well, I can't do it, so let me change careers.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.909

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.020

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.000
Clinica Tepati definitely gave me
hands-on experience of

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.030
not only learning the science of it, like
blood pressure...

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.190
You also do the patient interaction (speaks to the patient in Spanish)

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.709
You can be a really smart physician, but if 
you lack that communication between

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:49.740
patients

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.430
you won't get much out of it. They'll just sit there and nod.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.650
(speaking to the patient)

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.190
Having made it to this level, where I'm
working in the hospital,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.450
there is a huge need for Spanish-speaking,

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.390
culturally competent physicians.

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.840

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.880
There is a disparity out there. We need to
address it. 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.800
My grandpa, he is one of the main reasons I'm here. He
struggled with diabetes

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.860
for as long as I can remember. He passed
away during my junior year of college,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.410
so just seeing how much medicine impacts an entire family

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.949
that just motivated me to want to do primary
care because I can treat the baby 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.330
and the grandpa.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.120
Even when I go now to my doctor, I always try to find someone who 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.120
looks like me or speaks like me, and 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.080
it's kind of hard to find someone like
that. 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.940
More importantly, I think, is to bring in Latino students

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.960
who will treat any race with the same heart and love.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.060
I think before it even starts,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.320
Prep Medico, just announcing it...or just

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.229
talking about what it is. I mean I wish I could sign up for it already.

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.210
Just helping me visualize that path, you
would have saved me a lot of stresses in between.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.900
I would have gotten to medical school a lot
younger. I would have been productive as

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.789
a physician a lot younger.

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.210
My dad has told me that, you know, 'I would have 
loved to have gone to college.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.249
And so to see you living your dreams, just means so much to me.

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:23.179
