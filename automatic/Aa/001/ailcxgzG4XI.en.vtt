supports<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.580> scuzzy<00:01:21.000> AFP<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.990> NFS<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.130> that

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
supports I scuzzy AFP and NFS so that

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.590 
supports I scuzzy AFP and NFS so that
means<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.939> use<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.270> across

different<00:01:25.020> platforms<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.740> well<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.250> will

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
different platforms as well so it will

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960 
different platforms as well so it will
work<00:01:26.430> with<00:01:26.939> Windows<00:01:27.420> Mac<00:01:27.840> Linux<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.500> UNIX<00:01:29.130> now

work with Windows Mac Linux and UNIX now
let's<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> look<00:01:30.450> at<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.900> device<00:01:31.229> itself

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
let's have a look at the device itself

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.249 
let's have a look at the device itself
so<00:01:32.220> here's<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.729> QNAP<00:01:33.270> device<00:01:33.600> itself<00:01:34.049> but

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
so here's the QNAP device itself but

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.719 
so here's the QNAP device itself but
before<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> show<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.860> around<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.520> want<00:01:35.670> to

the unit is powered on you could take

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.009 
the unit is powered on you could take

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
out with a fresh one now we also got

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.850 
out with a fresh one now we also got
some<00:03:43.640> status<00:03:44.239> LEDs<00:03:44.720> across<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.230> top<00:03:45.440> here<00:03:45.470> and

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
some status LEDs across the top here and

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.160 
some status LEDs across the top here and
I<00:03:46.370> should<00:03:46.430> mention<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.810> reason<00:03:47.930> you've

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
I should mention that the reason you've

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.080 
I should mention that the reason you've
got<00:03:48.260> four<00:03:48.650> bays<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.489> you<00:03:49.550> can<00:03:49.700> actually

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
got four bays is that you can actually

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.050 
got four bays is that you can actually
put<00:03:50.330> in<00:03:50.450> maybe<00:03:50.720> two<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.860> terabyte<00:03:52.400> drives<00:03:52.730> and

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
put in maybe two to terabyte drives and

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.910 
put in maybe two to terabyte drives and
a<00:03:53.090> couple<00:03:53.390> of<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.570> four<00:03:53.750> terabyte<00:03:54.260> drives<00:03:54.590> and

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
a couple of the four terabyte drives and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.070 
a couple of the four terabyte drives and
you<00:03:55.430> could<00:03:55.670> actually<00:03:55.910> write<00:03:56.390> these<00:03:56.690> so<00:03:56.930> you've

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
you could actually write these so you've

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.780 
you could actually write these so you've
got<00:03:57.200> some<00:03:57.410> data<00:03:57.650> redundancy<00:03:58.070> and<00:03:58.519> what<00:03:58.640> that

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
got some data redundancy and what that

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.460 
got some data redundancy and what that
means<00:03:58.970> is<00:03:59.209> if<00:03:59.330> one<00:03:59.540> drive<00:03:59.810> fails

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
means is if one drive fails

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.530 
means is if one drive fails
you've<00:04:00.920> got<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:01.310> Betty<00:04:01.489> got<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.760> mirror<00:04:02.060> of<00:04:02.360> your

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
you've got to Betty got a mirror of your

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.259 
you've got to Betty got a mirror of your

little<00:04:23.550> fan<00:04:23.760> here<00:04:24.150> now<00:04:24.690> this<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.560> not<00:04:25.950> going<00:04:26.190> to

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
little fan here now this is not going to

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.400 
little fan here now this is not going to
really<00:04:26.730> disturb<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:27.240> too<00:04:27.450> much<00:04:27.660> you<00:04:27.810> can<00:04:28.050> hear
