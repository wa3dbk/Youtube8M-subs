couple of months that reduced one one

because of that is not going to have the
long-term<00:01:03.510> side<00:01:03.780> effects<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.199> would<00:01:04.409> come

long-term side effects that would come

show our viewers of the difference of
the<00:01:17.280> brain<00:01:17.610> tumor<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.299> what<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:18.750> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the brain tumor and what it was that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.749 
the brain tumor and what it was that
happened<00:01:19.080> there<00:01:19.380> after<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.950> couple<00:01:20.400> weeks<00:01:20.610> can

happened there after a couple weeks can
you<00:01:20.850> explain<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.360> us<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.780> more<00:01:21.900> detail

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
you explain that for us in more detail

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.219 
you explain that for us in more detail
yes<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> large<00:01:24.000> white<00:01:24.330> center<00:01:24.720> area<00:01:25.049> is

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
yes that a large white center area is

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.800 
yes that a large white center area is
the<00:01:25.409> tumor<00:01:25.740> um<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:27.420> were<00:01:27.479> putting

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the tumor um and they were putting

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.840 
the tumor um and they were putting
cannabinoid<00:01:28.680> oils<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.250> baby's<00:01:29.579> pacifier

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
cannabinoid oils on the baby's pacifier

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.319 
cannabinoid oils on the baby's pacifier
twice<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> day<00:01:31.520> increasing<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> dose<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
twice a day increasing the dose and it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.450 
twice a day increasing the dose and it
was<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> three<00:01:33.840> point<00:01:34.079> eight<00:01:34.200> percent<00:01:34.409> CBD<00:01:35.250> so

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
was a three point eight percent CBD so

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.270 
was a three point eight percent CBD so
as<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> high<00:01:35.820> CBD<00:01:36.060> tincture<00:01:36.720> or<00:01:36.900> oil<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.710> within

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
as a high CBD tincture or oil and within

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.679 
as a high CBD tincture or oil and within
two<00:01:38.549> months<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:38.970> was<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> dramatic

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
two months there was a dramatic

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.690 
two months there was a dramatic
reduction<00:01:39.840> enough<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.070> pediatric

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
reduction enough that the pediatric

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.560 
reduction enough that the pediatric
oncologist<00:01:42.920> allowed<00:01:43.920> them<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.759> go<00:01:44.970> ahead<00:01:45.299> with

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
oncologist allowed them to go ahead with

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.319 
oncologist allowed them to go ahead with
not<00:01:46.100> pursuing<00:01:47.100> traditional<00:01:47.579> therapy<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
not pursuing traditional therapy and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.260 
not pursuing traditional therapy and
within<00:01:48.780> four<00:01:49.110> months<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.590> see<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.270> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
within four months you can see that the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.149 
within four months you can see that the
tumor<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.630> essentially<00:01:51.990> gone<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.619> then<00:01:53.009> by

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
tumor is essentially gone and then by

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.069 
tumor is essentially gone and then by
eight<00:01:53.340> months<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> normal<00:01:54.270> architecture<00:01:54.450> had

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
eight months the normal architecture had

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.139 
eight months the normal architecture had
resumed<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.619> at<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.799> point<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.640> risk<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
resumed in at this point the risk of the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.080 
resumed in at this point the risk of the
MRI<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.990> high<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.560> they<00:01:59.130> don't<00:01:59.369> they

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
MRI is so high that they don't they

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.520 
MRI is so high that they don't they
really<00:02:00.450> don't<00:02:00.509> want<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:00.869> any<00:02:01.020> more<00:02:01.079> MRIs

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
really don't want to do any more MRIs

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.300
