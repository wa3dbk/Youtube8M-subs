00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
really I mean I get the idea

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.520 
really I mean I get the idea
so<00:02:13.610> far<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:13.940> just<00:02:14.090> seems<00:02:14.420> like<00:02:14.570> way<00:02:15.020> more<00:02:15.350> effort

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
so far I just seems like way more effort

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.250 
so far I just seems like way more effort
then<00:02:16.340> juggling<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.210> up<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.540> like<00:02:17.660> drawing<00:02:18.110> it

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
then juggling it up and like drawing it

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.720 
then juggling it up and like drawing it
freehand<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.950> agree

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
freehand I agree

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.870 
freehand I agree
step<00:02:20.120> 3<00:02:20.840> we're<00:02:21.590> gonna<00:02:21.680> kind<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:21.980> like<00:02:22.160> get<00:02:22.760> it

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
step 3 we're gonna kind of like get it

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.240 
step 3 we're gonna kind of like get it
all<00:02:23.000> together<00:02:23.210> in<00:02:23.570> a<00:02:23.660> nice<00:02:23.810> yes<00:02:24.770> fill<00:02:25.070> it<00:02:25.160> all

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
all together in a nice yes fill it all

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.820 
all together in a nice yes fill it all
in<00:02:25.280> in<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.700> nice<00:02:25.850> line<00:02:26.150> I'm<00:02:26.870> just<00:02:27.470> gonna<00:02:27.560> be<00:02:27.710> good

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
in in a nice line I'm just gonna be good

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.380 
in in a nice line I'm just gonna be good
hard<00:02:28.040> since<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.550> literally<00:02:28.790> goes<00:02:28.970> down<00:02:29.240> to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
hard since it literally goes down to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.850 
hard since it literally goes down to
here

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.780 

you're<00:02:34.860> doing<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.100> much<00:02:35.160> better<00:02:35.460> now<00:02:35.640> I

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
you're doing so much better now I

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.880 
you're doing so much better now I
thought<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.570> like<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.260> much<00:02:37.380> easier<00:02:37.800> without

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
thought it's like so much easier without

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.149 
thought it's like so much easier without
this

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.339 

I<00:02:43.189> mean<00:02:43.879> I<00:02:43.969> guess<00:02:44.180> all<00:02:44.450> together<00:02:44.810> doesn't<00:02:45.230> look

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
I mean I guess all together doesn't look

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.839 
I mean I guess all together doesn't look
that<00:02:45.379> bad<00:02:45.920> just<00:02:46.219> looks<00:02:46.370> like<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.609> need<00:02:46.760> to

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
that bad just looks like you need to

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.449 
that bad just looks like you need to
like<00:02:47.030> fix<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.719> fix<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:48.230> yeah<00:02:48.709> I<00:02:48.739> guess<00:02:49.280> look

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
like fix that fix that yeah I guess look

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.520 
like fix that fix that yeah I guess look
really<00:02:49.760> run<00:02:50.090> rush<00:02:50.299> eyeliner<00:02:50.989> which<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.319> funny

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
really run rush eyeliner which is funny

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.080 
really run rush eyeliner which is funny
because<00:02:51.769> we<00:02:52.010> took<00:02:52.189> our<00:02:52.340> time<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.790> use<00:02:52.909> it

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
because we took our time and use it

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.869 
because we took our time and use it
early<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.569> spoon<00:02:53.989> spoon<00:02:54.680> comment<00:02:55.400> now<00:02:55.549> I<00:02:55.579> think

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
early a spoon spoon comment now I think

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.879 
early a spoon spoon comment now I think
maybe<00:02:56.180> we<00:02:56.329> should<00:02:56.510> try<00:02:56.719> it<00:02:56.780> with<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.379> free<00:02:57.709> hand

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
maybe we should try it with a free hand

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.259 
maybe we should try it with a free hand
on<00:02:58.099> our<00:02:58.129> right<00:02:58.430> eye<00:02:58.639> and<00:02:58.939> like<00:02:59.030> kind<00:02:59.209> of

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
on our right eye and like kind of

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.750 
on our right eye and like kind of
compare<00:02:59.569> them<00:02:59.780> here<00:03:00.200> we<00:03:00.409> go<00:03:03.069> this<00:03:04.069> is<00:03:04.129> a<00:03:04.280> not<00:03:04.549> my

forte<00:03:05.030> it's<00:03:05.510> kind<00:03:06.409> of<00:03:06.439> like<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.650> straight<00:03:06.920> line

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
forte it's kind of like a straight line

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.789 
forte it's kind of like a straight line
it<00:03:07.549> kind<00:03:07.849> of<00:03:07.879> looks<00:03:08.060> good<00:03:08.389> yeah<00:03:08.689> this<00:03:09.319> is<00:03:09.560> hard

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
it kind of looks good yeah this is hard

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.229 
it kind of looks good yeah this is hard
look<00:03:10.010> like<00:03:10.159> a<00:03:10.250> motor<00:03:10.430> -<00:03:10.760> yeah

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
look like a motor - yeah

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.940

high fashion my face - okay so now it's

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.649 
high fashion my face - okay so now it's
your<00:03:16.069> turn<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.400> try<00:03:16.579> it<00:03:16.639> free<00:03:16.939> hand<00:03:17.120> which<00:03:17.629> is

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
your turn to try it free hand which is

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.929 
your turn to try it free hand which is
your<00:03:17.900> thing<00:03:18.079> i'm<00:03:18.379> supersized<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.340> I'm<00:03:19.669> just

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
your thing i'm supersized so I'm just

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.629 
your thing i'm supersized so I'm just
gonna<00:03:20.090> start<00:03:20.419> doing<00:03:20.919> okay<00:03:21.919> oh<00:03:22.159> my<00:03:23.000> god<00:03:24.609> what<00:03:25.609> I

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
gonna start doing okay oh my god what I

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.110 
gonna start doing okay oh my god what I
think<00:03:26.389> this<00:03:26.659> looks<00:03:27.019> way<00:03:27.230> better<00:03:27.409> than<00:03:27.709> this

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
think this looks way better than this

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.360 
think this looks way better than this
this<00:03:29.120> is<00:03:29.359> not<00:03:29.719> she's<00:03:30.139> literally<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.769> Queen

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
this is not she's literally the Queen

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.390 
this is not she's literally the Queen
she<00:03:32.090> did<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:32.389> in<00:03:32.510> like<00:03:32.659> 12<00:03:32.959> seconds<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.889> can't

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
she did that in like 12 seconds I can't

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.689 
she did that in like 12 seconds I can't
I<00:03:34.790> can't<00:03:35.510> right<00:03:35.689> now

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699 
I can't right now

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.909 
I can't right now
okay<00:03:37.699> so<00:03:37.760> I<00:03:37.909> probably<00:03:38.209> would<00:03:38.900> not<00:03:39.199> ever<00:03:39.500> use

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
okay so I probably would not ever use

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.830 
okay so I probably would not ever use
this<00:03:40.159> trick<00:03:40.549> I<00:03:40.730> would<00:03:41.030> prefer<00:03:41.269> doing<00:03:41.689> it

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
this trick I would prefer doing it

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.879 
this trick I would prefer doing it
freehand<00:03:42.049> even<00:03:42.379> know<00:03:42.439> what<00:03:42.530> came<00:03:42.650> out<00:03:42.769> really

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
freehand even know what came out really

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.129 
freehand even know what came out really
badly<00:03:43.129> it's<00:03:43.430> still<00:03:43.699> better<00:03:43.849> than<00:03:43.969> this<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.449> I

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
badly it's still better than this I I
