experiment is a spoon a cookie cutter
one<00:00:19.410> cup<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.859> milk<00:00:20.100> four<00:00:20.670> teaspoons<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.330> white

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
one cup of milk four teaspoons of white

one cup of milk four teaspoons of white
vinegar<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.529> strainer<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.490> some<00:00:23.850> paper<00:00:24.060> towel

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.640 

firstly<00:00:30.119> take<00:00:30.330> your<00:00:30.480> vinegar<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.960> pour<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
firstly take your vinegar and pour it

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.040 
firstly take your vinegar and pour it
into<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.070> milk<00:00:35.329> stir<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> two<00:00:36.630> liquids

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
into the milk stir the two liquids

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.290 
into the milk stir the two liquids
gently<00:00:37.440> together<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.010> very<00:00:38.520> quickly<00:00:38.820> you'll

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
gently together and very quickly you'll

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.869 
gently together and very quickly you'll
see<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.629> lumps<00:00:39.989> appear<00:00:40.430> this<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.579> because

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
see that lumps appear this is because

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.030 
see that lumps appear this is because
the<00:00:42.059> protein<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> milk<00:00:42.989> meets<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> acid

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the protein in the milk meets the acid

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.299 
the protein in the milk meets the acid
in<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.250> vinegar<00:00:45.410> and<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> milk<00:00:46.680> does<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.100> mix

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
in the vinegar and the milk does not mix

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.250 
in the vinegar and the milk does not mix
properly<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.969> acid<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.020> forms

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
properly with the acid and so it forms

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.400 
properly with the acid and so it forms
blobs<00:00:49.879> these<00:00:50.879> blobs<00:00:51.180> are<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> substance<00:00:52.230> called

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
blobs these blobs are a substance called

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.920 
blobs these blobs are a substance called
casein<00:00:53.180> this<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.449> we're<00:00:54.539> going<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.780> make

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
casein this is what we're going to make

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.490 
casein this is what we're going to make
our<00:00:55.110> plastic<00:00:55.530> from<00:00:56.750> then<00:00:57.750> when<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.350> think
