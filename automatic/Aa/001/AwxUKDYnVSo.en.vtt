and so let's take a look at what's

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.880 
and so let's take a look at what's
inside<00:00:20.850> no<00:00:21.750> star<00:00:22.020> wars<00:00:22.230> Armada<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.680> their

answer<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.539> the<00:00:24.539> bigger<00:00:24.810> ships<00:00:25.140> how<00:00:25.590> can<00:00:25.800> we

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
answer to the bigger ships how can we

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.759 
answer to the bigger ships how can we
incorporate<00:00:26.189> those<00:00:26.779> well<00:00:27.779> you've<00:00:28.019> seen<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
incorporate those well you've seen the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.980 
incorporate those well you've seen the
biggest<00:00:29.099> ship<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.820> x-wing<00:00:30.269> game<00:00:30.480> yet<00:00:30.750> it's

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
biggest ship in the x-wing game yet it's

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.979 
biggest ship in the x-wing game yet it's
this<00:00:31.230> Star<00:00:31.740> Wars<00:00:32.009> Corvette<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> think<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.149> it's

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
this Star Wars Corvette I think and it's

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.590 
this Star Wars Corvette I think and it's
huge<00:00:34.410> literally<00:00:35.100> huge<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.790> only<00:00:36.210> play<00:00:36.420> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
huge literally huge you can only play it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.299 
huge literally huge you can only play it
on<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.719> bigger<00:00:36.960> maps<00:00:37.230> because<00:00:37.469> otherwise<00:00:37.980> you

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
on the bigger maps because otherwise you

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.920 
on the bigger maps because otherwise you
don't<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> maneuverability<00:00:39.540> for<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
don't have the maneuverability for it

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.380 
don't have the maneuverability for it
and<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:40.920> we<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> same<00:00:41.670> ship<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.210> here

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
and here we have the same ship but here

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.440 
and here we have the same ship but here
is<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> tiny<00:00:42.840> bit<00:00:43.579> here's<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.610> tiny<00:00:44.940> one<00:00:45.210> while

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
is a tiny bit here's the tiny one while

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.090 
is a tiny bit here's the tiny one while
we<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> Star<00:00:46.110> Destroyer<00:00:46.140> which<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.860> much

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
we have a Star Destroyer which is much

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.819 
we have a Star Destroyer which is much
bigger<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:48.000> watching<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.450> kit<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.500> can

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
bigger so watching this kit as you can

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
bigger so watching this kit as you can
see<00:00:50.129> from<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.610> image<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.329> one<00:00:51.690> star

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
see from the image we have one star

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.470 
see from the image we have one star
destroyer<00:00:52.410> for<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.920> Imperials<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.820> three

destroyer for the Imperials with three

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.139 
destroyer for the Imperials with three
what<00:00:55.350> looks<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:55.800> squadrons<00:00:56.489> are<00:00:56.640> no<00:00:56.879> two

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
what looks to be squadrons are no two

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.470 
what looks to be squadrons are no two
squadrons<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.960> TIE<00:00:58.260> fighters<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.100> on<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
squadrons of TIE fighters and on the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900 
squadrons of TIE fighters and on the
rebel<00:01:01.140> side<00:01:01.170> we<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.680> two<00:01:02.250> squadrons<00:01:02.640> of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
rebel side we have two squadrons of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.899 
rebel side we have two squadrons of
x-wing<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> Corvette<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:05.700> have

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
x-wing we have a Corvette and we have

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.060 
x-wing we have a Corvette and we have
this<00:01:06.150> other<00:01:06.950> it's<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.189> friggin<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.150> think

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
this other it's a friggin I think

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.800 
this other it's a friggin I think
so<00:01:11.070> what's<00:01:11.490> more<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> box<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.479> set

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
so what's more in the box you have set

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.469 
so what's more in the box you have set
of<00:01:12.930> dice<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.860> cards<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:14.700> upgrades<00:01:15.270> for

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
of dice the cards that are upgrades for

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.300 
of dice the cards that are upgrades for
your<00:01:15.720> guys<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.920> course<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.810> ship<00:01:19.590> cards<00:01:20.070> which

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
your guys of course the ship cards which

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.130 
your guys of course the ship cards which
look<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.729> lot<00:01:20.939> different<00:01:21.000> than<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.810> x-wing

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
look a lot different than the x-wing

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.170 
look a lot different than the x-wing
cards<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.619> will<00:01:22.830> go<00:01:22.979> back<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.549> once<00:01:24.060> we

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
cards and I will go back to it once we

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.910 
cards and I will go back to it once we
get<00:01:24.330> there<00:01:25.070> sort<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:27.229> maneuverability<00:01:28.229> chips

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
get there sort of maneuverability chips

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.100 
get there sort of maneuverability chips
but<00:01:29.189> they<00:01:29.340> look<00:01:29.520> different<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:30.060> well<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.900> need

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
but they look different as well you need

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.700 
but they look different as well you need
to<00:01:31.229> stack<00:01:31.470> them<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.740> or<00:01:31.950> something<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:33.710> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
to stack them up or something and the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.120 
to stack them up or something and the
most<00:01:35.450> well-known<00:01:36.560> measuring<00:01:37.560> track<00:01:37.860> for

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
most well-known measuring track for

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.969 
most well-known measuring track for
shooting<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> new<00:01:39.680> maneuverability<00:01:40.680> track

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
shooting and a new maneuverability track

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.389 
shooting and a new maneuverability track
which<00:01:41.430> looks<00:01:41.820> kind<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.920> plastic<00:01:43.920> snake<00:01:44.220> we

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399

shields<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.090> shields<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:03.540> all

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
shields but the shields are all

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.639 
shields but the shields are all
connected<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.619> there's<00:02:04.829> two<00:02:05.340> there<00:02:05.579> are<00:02:05.759> arch

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
connected to there's two there are arch

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.100 
connected to there's two there are arch
so<00:02:07.649> shooting<00:02:08.129> at<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> ship's<00:02:08.640> side<00:02:09.539> arches

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
so shooting at the ship's side arches

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.290 
so shooting at the ship's side arches
will<00:02:10.649> reduce<00:02:11.009> their<00:02:11.250> shields<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.030> side

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
will reduce their shields on that side

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.460 
will reduce their shields on that side
but<00:02:12.660> not<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.110> other

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
but not in the other

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.550 
but not in the other
however<00:02:14.430> once<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.850> pierce<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.450> shields<00:02:16.350> you

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
however once you pierce the shields you

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.980 
however once you pierce the shields you
will<00:02:16.770> be<00:02:17.150> penetrating<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.240> hull<00:02:18.420> which

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
will be penetrating the hull which

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.770 
will be penetrating the hull which
doesn't<00:02:19.410> matter<00:02:19.650> which<00:02:19.980> side<00:02:20.220> you're<00:02:20.490> on<00:02:20.780> then

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
doesn't matter which side you're on then

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.520 
doesn't matter which side you're on then
last<00:02:22.590> Lee<00:02:23.280> yes<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.570> apart<00:02:24.990> from<00:02:25.050> these<00:02:25.290> two

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
last Lee yes so apart from these two

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.000 
last Lee yes so apart from these two
defenses<00:02:26.070> you<00:02:26.250> also<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:28.010> deflector

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
defenses you also have the deflector

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.070 
defenses you also have the deflector
shields<00:02:29.340> which<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.670> an<00:02:29.790> active<00:02:30.180> shield<00:02:30.480> and

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
shields which is an active shield and

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.830 
shields which is an active shield and
which<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.530> be<00:02:31.710> steered<00:02:32.700> towards<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
which can be steered towards one of the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.220 
which can be steered towards one of the
sides<00:02:34.110> by<00:02:34.950> using<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.370> maneuver<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.690> each<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.110> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
sides by using a maneuver so each of the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.330 
sides by using a maneuver so each of the
ships<00:02:37.380> hasn't<00:02:37.950> has<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.630> command<00:02:39.630> value<00:02:39.870> and

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
ships hasn't has a command value and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.920 
ships hasn't has a command value and
unlike<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.400> command<00:02:41.880> value<00:02:42.090> an<00:02:42.360> x-wing<00:02:42.750> it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
unlike the command value an x-wing it

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.320 
unlike the command value an x-wing it
determines<00:02:43.590> how<00:02:44.220> many<00:02:44.280> actions<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.150> can

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
determines how many actions you can

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.610 
determines how many actions you can
perform<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:46.020> not<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.500> order<00:02:47.480> then<00:02:48.480> for<00:02:48.930> for

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
perform and not the order then for for

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.860 
perform and not the order then for for
each<00:02:49.770> command<00:02:50.340> point<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.820> have<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.209> have<00:02:51.240> one

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
each command point you have you have one

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.320 
each command point you have you have one
disk<00:02:52.170> which<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.250> stack<00:02:53.550> onto<00:02:53.790> each<00:02:54.120> other

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
disk which is stack onto each other

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.350 
disk which is stack onto each other
which<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:54.990> similar<00:02:55.320> like<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.360> hidden

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
which is similar like the hidden

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.570 
which is similar like the hidden
movement<00:02:58.790> disks<00:02:59.790> from<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.570> star<00:03:01.020> wars<00:03:01.110> x-wing

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
movement disks from the star wars x-wing

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.130 
movement disks from the star wars x-wing
where<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:02.730> choose<00:03:02.970> which<00:03:03.300> maneuver<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.900> will

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
where you choose which maneuver you will

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.750 
where you choose which maneuver you will
be<00:03:04.260> doing<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:04.980> will<00:03:05.130> be<00:03:05.340> having<00:03:05.490> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
be doing and you will be having the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.270 
be doing and you will be having the
choice<00:03:06.000> out<00:03:06.270> of<00:03:06.390> four<00:03:06.660> commands<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.709> first<00:03:07.980> is

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
choice out of four commands the first is

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.160 
choice out of four commands the first is
the<00:03:08.490> navigate<00:03:08.880> command<00:03:09.270> which<00:03:09.540> allows<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:09.959> to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
the navigate command which allows you to

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.940 
the navigate command which allows you to
use<00:03:10.410> change<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.160> ship<00:03:11.370> speed<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.200> thus<00:03:13.200> make

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
use change the ship speed and thus make

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.220 
use change the ship speed and thus make
it<00:03:14.100> easier<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.610> steer<00:03:14.910> with<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.810> second

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
it easier to steer with it the second

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.710 
it easier to steer with it the second
will<00:03:16.440> is<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.250> squadron<00:03:17.790> command<00:03:18.209> which<00:03:18.540> will

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
will is the squadron command which will

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.850 
will is the squadron command which will
allow<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.260> order<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.519> squat<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:21.630> of

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
allow you to order the squat so of

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.370 
allow you to order the squat so of
x-wing<00:03:22.860> or<00:03:23.160> TIE<00:03:23.519> fighters<00:03:24.030> near<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.750> let<00:03:25.110> them

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
x-wing or TIE fighters near and let them

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.650 
x-wing or TIE fighters near and let them
attack<00:03:25.530> earlier<00:03:26.070> then<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:26.970> have<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.209> repair

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
attack earlier then you have the repair

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.330 
attack earlier then you have the repair
command<00:03:28.019> which<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.350> can<00:03:28.500> use<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.709> recover

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
command which you can use to recover

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.570 
command which you can use to recover
shields<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:29.970> hull<00:03:30.450> damage<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:31.280> lastly<00:03:32.280> you

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
shields and hull damage and lastly you

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.490 
shields and hull damage and lastly you
have<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:33.000> concentrate<00:03:33.540> fire<00:03:33.810> which<00:03:34.290> will

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
have the concentrate fire which will

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.440 
have the concentrate fire which will
allow<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:34.950> increase<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.610> power<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:36.180> your

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
allow you to increase the power of your

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:44.539 
allow you to increase the power of your
attack<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:42.810> course<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.769> can<00:03:43.950> understand<00:03:44.430> that

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
attack of course you can understand that

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.370 
attack of course you can understand that
bigger<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.180> shipment<00:03:45.630> more<00:03:45.840> expensive<00:03:46.350> to

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
bigger the shipment more expensive to

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.470 
bigger the shipment more expensive to
ship<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.830> more<00:03:47.040> command<00:03:47.400> flowers<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.269> has

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
ship the more command flowers it has

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.560 
ship the more command flowers it has
some<00:03:48.900> more<00:03:49.140> stuff<00:03:49.440> can<00:03:49.680> be<00:03:49.709> done<00:03:50.040> then<00:03:51.000> that's

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
some more stuff can be done then that's

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.000 
some more stuff can be done then that's
in<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.870> first<00:03:52.110> phase<00:03:52.380> after<00:03:52.709> you've

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
in the first phase after you've

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.860 
in the first phase after you've
determined<00:03:53.670> which<00:03:54.060> commands<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.600> will<00:03:54.750> be

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
determined which commands you will be

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.570 
determined which commands you will be
doing<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.290> will<00:03:55.500> be<00:03:55.709> moving<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.370> ship

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
doing you will be moving to the ship

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.360 
doing you will be moving to the ship
face<00:03:56.820> if<00:03:57.480> we<00:03:57.989> look<00:03:58.110> at<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.380> card<00:03:58.620> here<00:03:58.920> we<00:03:59.190> can

face if we look at the card here we can

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.320 
face if we look at the card here we can
see<00:03:59.580> that<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.850> card<00:04:00.150> has<00:04:00.360> sort<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.019> different

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
see that the card has sort of different

command to change this it will stay at
the<00:05:13.660> current<00:05:14.050> speed<00:05:14.170> and<00:05:14.590> it<00:05:14.680> will<00:05:14.890> just<00:05:15.250> go<00:05:15.430> on

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
the current speed and it will just go on

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.240 
the current speed and it will just go on
forever<00:05:15.910> in<00:05:16.390> that<00:05:16.600> sense<00:05:16.990> then<00:05:17.800> if<00:05:17.980> you<00:05:18.100> look

joints in the sort of snake-like device

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.210 
joints in the sort of snake-like device
we<00:05:27.280> have<00:05:27.660> then<00:05:28.660> you<00:05:28.690> see<00:05:29.050> a<00:05:29.080> number<00:05:29.620> it's<00:05:30.070> a

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
we have then you see a number it's a

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.840 
we have then you see a number it's a
tattoo<00:05:30.640> one<00:05:31.300> or<00:05:31.570> a<00:05:31.630> dash<00:05:32.290> the<00:05:33.280> tool<00:05:33.550> and<00:05:33.760> the

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
tattoo one or a dash the tool and the

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.730 
tattoo one or a dash the tool and the
one<00:05:34.360> is<00:05:34.600> the<00:05:34.900> amount<00:05:35.200> of<00:05:36.000> ticks<00:05:37.000> you<00:05:37.450> can<00:05:37.740> bend

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
one is the amount of ticks you can bend

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.300 
one is the amount of ticks you can bend
the<00:05:39.250> snake<00:05:39.600> to<00:05:40.600> make<00:05:40.810> a<00:05:40.840> maneuver<00:05:41.410> and<00:05:41.650> the

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
the snake to make a maneuver and the

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.760 
the snake to make a maneuver and the
dash<00:05:42.580> as<00:05:42.910> far<00:05:43.210> as<00:05:43.240> i<00:05:43.450> understand<00:05:43.960> it<00:05:44.290> means

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
dash as far as i understand it means

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.760 
dash as far as i understand it means
that<00:05:45.010> you<00:05:45.160> cannot<00:05:45.490> turn<00:05:46.330> at<00:05:46.690> that<00:05:47.110> speed<00:05:47.470> in

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
that you cannot turn at that speed in

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.590 
that you cannot turn at that speed in
the<00:05:48.580> first<00:05:48.850> neck<00:05:50.310> so<00:05:51.310> if<00:05:51.700> this<00:05:52.120> had<00:05:52.360> happened

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
the first neck so if this had happened

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.220 
the first neck so if this had happened
then<00:05:53.260> we<00:05:53.530> go<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:54.040> squadron<00:05:54.430> face<00:05:55.230> and

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
then we go to the squadron face and

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.340 
then we go to the squadron face and
where<00:05:57.040> we<00:05:57.160> move<00:05:57.400> our<00:05:57.700> squadrons<00:05:58.240> to<00:05:58.360> do<00:05:59.050> some

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
where we move our squadrons to do some

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.780 
where we move our squadrons to do some
dog<00:05:59.860> fighting<00:06:00.220> shooting<00:06:01.030> and<00:06:01.330> whatnot<00:06:01.870> and

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
dog fighting shooting and whatnot and

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.540 
dog fighting shooting and whatnot and
afterwards<00:06:03.790> we<00:06:03.910> do<00:06:04.120> our<00:06:04.240> sadies<00:06:04.600> face<00:06:05.550> where

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
afterwards we do our sadies face where

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.190 
afterwards we do our sadies face where
we<00:06:08.100> flip<00:06:09.100> up<00:06:09.340> stuff<00:06:09.850> and<00:06:10.210> recover<00:06:10.810> everything

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
we flip up stuff and recover everything

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.810 
we flip up stuff and recover everything
just<00:06:11.710> to<00:06:11.950> start<00:06:12.250> new<00:06:12.520> turn<00:06:12.790> and<00:06:14.430> this<00:06:15.430> is<00:06:15.610> then

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
just to start new turn and this is then

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.920 
just to start new turn and this is then
the<00:06:16.180> new<00:06:16.420> way<00:06:16.870> of<00:06:16.900> gaming<00:06:18.240> so<00:06:19.240> as<00:06:19.480> you<00:06:19.810> can

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
the new way of gaming so as you can

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.670 
the new way of gaming so as you can
already<00:06:20.140> see<00:06:20.560> it<00:06:20.860> has<00:06:21.100> a<00:06:21.130> much<00:06:21.700> more

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
already see it has a much more

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.580 
already see it has a much more
predictable<00:06:23.680> way<00:06:24.280> of<00:06:24.630> flying<00:06:25.630> so<00:06:26.200> it's<00:06:26.380> no

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
predictable way of flying so it's no

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.580 
predictable way of flying so it's no
more<00:06:26.860> about<00:06:27.640> avoiding<00:06:28.210> avoiding<00:06:29.200> each<00:06:29.350> other

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
more about avoiding avoiding each other

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.460 
more about avoiding avoiding each other
or<00:06:30.190> or<00:06:30.940> doing<00:06:31.450> some<00:06:31.750> sort<00:06:31.990> of<00:06:32.110> sneaky
