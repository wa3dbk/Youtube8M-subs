00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.480
 we present you a new madness of 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.250
 telepizza because you have to be crazy to 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.299
 offer you a medium pizza for only 4 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.070
 95 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.230
 take advantage of the crazy Tuesdays of 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.730
 pizza the secret is in the dough the 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.290
 Mr Springs Congratulations for the 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.150
 victory worked has perhaps influenced 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.100
 the result the attitude of the referee that 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.400
 has left the opponent in inferiority very 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.400
 soon 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:50.360
 I think referees always influence 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.920
 in matches all matches in 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.320
 those who was in the league when they have 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.650
 been influenced by decisions 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.650
 of the referees 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:08.110
 and I think the expulsion is correct 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.320
 if we are a districts with the regulations 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.080
 I would have preferred a yellow card 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.200
 but the rule says that if the last 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.979
 man makes a mistake is that he has to 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.979
 be listened 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.120
 Y 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.690
 in this case they have given him a chance 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.040
 it was a clear goal opportunity and so 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.330
 so much although I do not like this rule 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.330
 I should be expelled 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.840
 but no 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.570
 Y 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.410
 now I wanted to ask him about the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.540
 2-1 play 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.970
 minutes before rule saved the team 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.060
 also in a heads up a play that 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.560
 could be decisive I wanted me 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.330
 value that play and also the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.430
 importance or the weight that was 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.820
 taking ruly on the computer for his 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.820
 youth 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.140
 and maybe this has been the party 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.380
 most important oak and has played very 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.380
 all right 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.400
 for most of the game not 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.290
 I had nothing to do 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.680
 and that's why his concentration had to be 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.680
 very good 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.970
 and has had some good stops one of 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.180
 a choir in the first time and another in the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.220
 second time he has played very well 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.220
 matches like this are difficult 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.780
 is a player of them in the next 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.709
 minute they have scored a goal that 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.709
 in return the party completely 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.940
 go 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.550
 the referee is or has hit on that 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.959
 move 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.080
 in the corner that has caused the cav 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.640
 The goal 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.380
 that's why I think the referee also 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.560
 has had an influence on his first 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.819
 goal but the team tries it 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.440
 very well to pass the ball to Alvaro 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.870
 specific concentrates and in the end has 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.530
 been a victory deserved by the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.530
 way we played 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.140
 because you liked the team 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.630
 maybe more in the second part than in the 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.110
 first part has entered cost him 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.880
 entry of the match and more than three the goal 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.990
 I do not know what the value of the 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.420
 city ​​is from the team 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.959
 product 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.959
 I doubt 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.569
 in the second time 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.689
 in the first time we had some 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.909
 bad passes and eight passes from Wayne we have 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.090
 of street and we had some passes that 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.349
 they have not reached anyone 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.129
 but I think we've tried to do the 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:14.049
 things well words and play forward 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.090
 good time but we wanted to be 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.880
 near your area all the time everything 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.109
 that could a room for win it is win 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.479
 it is war 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.160
 belonging we needed more had to 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.919
 do it even better and I think that in the 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.889
 Second time we got it 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.720
 episodes with ipic shine with fire spikes 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.060
 he operated friends with the moon doctor 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.479
 they were tired by the pressure to which 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.479
 we have submitted them 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.340
 that always happens more more in a more 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.810
 advanced the match 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.510
 at a certain point first press conference 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.070
 when you came here you said that the 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.350
 team was not going to go down that was not going to 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.300
 fight to get down and the team would be 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.160
 practically saved 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.040
 I wanted to ask you how you are 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.930
 you with the result of your work and 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.220
 if still without neglecting the present you are 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.610
 thinking a little bit about next year 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.610
 you too 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.070
 knots 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.950
 but 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.800
 the job was to avoid the descent not 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.310
 we are saved we do not have the 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.300
 enough ethical points 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.509
 then we need a little bit to 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.000
 get it renwick 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.909
 but I hope we can go more towards 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.469
 up in the league 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:36.539
 game and I think we would have won 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.530
 some games that we do not win I think that 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.129
 we should now be in a position 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:45.060
 better than what we are and my plan is 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:46.469
 make the equipment better for you the 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.300
 plan has always been considered that the 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:51.000
 Real again compete for seats 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.509
 European this year I do not think we're going to 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.629
 do what 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:56.069
 success but I hope to do the 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:58.430
 next season is that is my 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.430
 hope
