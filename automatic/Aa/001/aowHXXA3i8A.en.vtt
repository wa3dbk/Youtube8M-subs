00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
to believe because I follow up like 30

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.540

minutes<00:04:39.410> and<00:04:39.560> they<00:04:39.620> just<00:04:39.800> kind<00:04:40.010> of<00:04:40.100> wander

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
minutes and they just kind of wander

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.060 
minutes and they just kind of wander
around<00:04:40.640> trying<00:04:41.420> to<00:04:41.510> get<00:04:41.630> away<00:04:41.720> from<00:04:41.960> you<00:04:42.080> but
