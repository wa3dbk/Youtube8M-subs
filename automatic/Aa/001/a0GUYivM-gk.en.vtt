me train had died and um yeah and I
wasn't<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.780> knew<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.410> gonna<00:00:46.620> catch<00:00:46.890> itself

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
wasn't I knew it was gonna catch itself

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.560 
wasn't I knew it was gonna catch itself
and<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.289> what<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.559> did<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.950> first<00:00:49.980> time

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
and this is what I did the first time

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.049 
and this is what I did the first time
I'm<00:00:51.570> try<00:00:51.899> pulling<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.320> also<00:00:52.860> hopefully<00:00:53.820> this

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
I'm try pulling it also hopefully this

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.630 
I'm try pulling it also hopefully this
time<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:55.320> thing<00:00:55.620> will<00:00:55.800> actually<00:00:55.829> stay<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
time the thing will actually stay in the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:08.980 
time the thing will actually stay in the
pokeballs<00:01:02.300> mmm<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.960> supposed<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.589> scare<00:01:04.949> me

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.700 

um<00:01:09.470> I<00:01:10.149> thought<00:01:11.149> you<00:01:11.600> guys<00:01:11.840> I<00:01:12.140> would<00:01:12.350> not<00:01:12.530> use

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
um I thought you guys I would not use

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.340 
um I thought you guys I would not use
earth<00:01:13.040> moves<00:01:13.610> like<00:01:14.479> earthquake<00:01:15.049> or<00:01:15.200> something

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
earth moves like earthquake or something

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.300 
earth moves like earthquake or something
because<00:01:15.680> it<00:01:16.100> could<00:01:16.220> easily<00:01:16.340> kill<00:01:16.790> hate<00:01:17.090> ran

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
because it could easily kill hate ran

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.020 
because it could easily kill hate ran
but<00:01:19.310> I'm<00:01:19.399> gonna<00:01:19.549> use<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.790> same<00:01:20.000> gotcha<00:01:20.439> okay
