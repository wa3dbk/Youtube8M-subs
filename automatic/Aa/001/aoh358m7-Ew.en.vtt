get protection from blue and black and

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.250 
get protection from blue and black and
can't<00:03:39.590> be<00:03:39.739> countered<00:03:40.130> better<00:03:40.820> yet<00:03:41.090> it's<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.540> 334

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
can't be countered better yet it's a 334

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.320 
can't be countered better yet it's a 334
to<00:03:42.440> green<00:03:42.739> in<00:03:42.860> one<00:03:43.040> colors<00:03:43.370> it's<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:44.090> hard

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
to green in one colors it's a hard

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.900 
to green in one colors it's a hard
decision<00:03:44.480> but<00:03:45.470> it's<00:03:45.980> based<00:03:46.280> off<00:03:46.459> with<00:03:46.700> two

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
decision but it's based off with two

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.240 
decision but it's based off with two
things<00:03:47.209> one<00:03:47.780> is<00:03:47.930> your<00:03:48.200> deck<00:03:48.380> dual<00:03:48.680> colors<00:03:49.040> like

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
things one is your deck dual colors like

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.900 
things one is your deck dual colors like
cleaning<00:03:49.640> and<00:03:49.820> blue<00:03:50.080> remember<00:03:51.080> if<00:03:51.290> it<00:03:52.010> costs

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
cleaning and blue remember if it costs

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.630 
cleaning and blue remember if it costs
to<00:03:53.150> green<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.780> then<00:03:54.260> one<00:03:54.530> coalesced<00:03:55.040> so

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
to green and then one coalesced so

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.330 
to green and then one coalesced so
you'll<00:03:55.820> need<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.060> forests<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.080> not<00:03:57.800> just<00:03:58.070> one

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
you'll need to forests and not just one

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.880 
you'll need to forests and not just one
so<00:03:59.090> if<00:03:59.390> you<00:03:59.600> can't<00:03:59.870> find<00:04:00.020> that<00:04:00.230> extra<00:04:00.620> force

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
so if you can't find that extra force

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.350 
so if you can't find that extra force
it's<00:04:01.160> going<00:04:01.310> to<00:04:01.370> be<00:04:01.459> sitting<00:04:01.640> your<00:04:01.880> hand<00:04:02.090> for<00:04:02.330> a

debt now most people say put in 22 and
you'll<00:04:28.940> be<00:04:29.090> fine<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.600> like<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.170> be<00:04:30.290> a<00:04:30.320> bit<00:04:30.560> more

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
you'll be fine I like to be a bit more

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.740 
you'll be fine I like to be a bit more
accurate<00:04:31.340> so<00:04:31.880> first<00:04:32.120> thing<00:04:32.330> you're<00:04:32.540> going<00:04:32.690> to

accurate so first thing you're going to
do<00:04:32.870> is<00:04:32.990> put<00:04:33.260> your<00:04:33.470> cards<00:04:33.860> in<00:04:34.010> an<00:04:34.130> order<00:04:34.430> from

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
do is put your cards in an order from

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
left to right based off the mana from

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.710 
left to right based off the mana from
lowest<00:04:37.100> to<00:04:37.190> highest<00:04:37.250> if<00:04:38.090> you<00:04:38.240> notice<00:04:38.510> much

most agree and then a small amount or
blue<00:04:55.880> then<00:04:56.450> obviously<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:57.050> should<00:04:57.080> put<00:04:57.380> in

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
best area for most types hopefully this

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.500
