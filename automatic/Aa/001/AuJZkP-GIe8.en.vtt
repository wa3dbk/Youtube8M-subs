00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
hoagie quick rig will add just a little

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.429 
hoagie quick rig will add just a little
bit<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.090> natural<00:01:03.480> weight<00:01:03.660> right<00:01:04.049> down<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
center line of the bait so that'll help

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.300 
center line of the bait so that'll help
you<00:01:06.420> get<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.020> slow<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:07.950> call<00:01:08.159> an

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
you get just a slow what we call an

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.550 
you get just a slow what we call an
intermediate<00:01:08.909> sink<00:01:09.210> rate<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:10.470> know

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
intermediate sink rate and you know

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560 
intermediate sink rate and you know
that'll<00:01:10.830> be<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> good<00:01:11.760> technique<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.270> again

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that'll be a good technique for again

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.149 
that'll be a good technique for again
keeping<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.049> bait<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.710> subsurface

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
keeping that bait in a subsurface

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.170 
keeping that bait in a subsurface
situation<00:01:16.400> now<00:01:17.400> if<00:01:17.580> there<00:01:17.759> were<00:01:17.939> any

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
situation now if there were any

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.450 
situation now if there were any
limitations<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.350> tandem<00:01:19.830> rigging<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.189> soft

limitations to tandem rigging a soft

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.260 
limitations to tandem rigging a soft
bait

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
bait

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.539 
bait
number<00:01:21.840> one<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.409> would<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.770> d<00:01:22.920> hooking<00:01:23.280> fish

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
number one it would be d hooking fish

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.170 
number one it would be d hooking fish
these<00:01:24.060> hooks<00:01:24.390> keep<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.840> mind<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.320> razor-sharp

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
these hooks keep in mind a razor-sharp

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.020 
these hooks keep in mind a razor-sharp
so<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.479> do<00:01:28.009> land<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.159> fish<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> tandem

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so if you do land a fish on the tandem

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.999 
so if you do land a fish on the tandem
rig<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.570> want<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.900> careful<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.439> extra

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
rig you want to be careful of that extra

again<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.460> appropriate<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.150> larger<00:01:42.689> baits<00:01:42.930> but

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
again is appropriate on larger baits but

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.980 
again is appropriate on larger baits but

as you can see you know there's just not

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.630 
as you can see you know there's just not
a<00:01:48.780> lot<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.049> meat<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> baits<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.130> the

if the hooks are out of alignment it may

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.929 
if the hooks are out of alignment it may
cause<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.500> bait<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.859> spin<00:03:58.159> so<00:03:58.609> this<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:58.909> a

00:03:58.929 --> 00:03:58.939 
cause the bait to spin so this is a

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.000 
cause the bait to spin so this is a
great<00:03:59.180> technique<00:03:59.599> for<00:03:59.659> keeping<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.829> bait

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
great technique for keeping the bait

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.619 
great technique for keeping the bait
nice<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:01.489> straight<00:04:01.730> paying<00:04:02.030> attention<00:04:02.510> to

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
nice and straight paying attention to

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.080 
nice and straight paying attention to
that<00:04:02.750> exit<00:04:03.139> hole<00:04:03.319> and<00:04:03.980> this<00:04:04.430> is<00:04:04.489> like<00:04:04.879> I<00:04:05.030> said

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
that exit hole and this is like I said

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.770 
that exit hole and this is like I said
the<00:04:05.269> easiest<00:04:05.750> step<00:04:05.930> here<00:04:06.909> on<00:04:07.909> the<00:04:08.150> far<00:04:08.450> end<00:04:08.659> of

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
the easiest step here on the far end of

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.789 
the easiest step here on the far end of
the<00:04:08.870> rigging<00:04:09.139> slot<00:04:10.510> we're<00:04:11.510> going<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.079> enter

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
the rigging slot we're going to enter

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.289 
the rigging slot we're going to enter
the<00:04:13.370> bait<00:04:14.739> then<00:04:15.739> come<00:04:16.009> out<00:04:16.190> where<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:16.970> little

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
the bait then come out where the little

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.029 
the bait then come out where the little
indicator<00:04:17.810> is<00:04:20.380> push<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.560> through<00:04:21.739> with<00:04:21.799> your

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
indicator is push it through with your

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.650 
indicator is push it through with your
fingers<00:04:23.500> then<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.650> hook<00:04:24.800> back<00:04:25.419> when<00:04:26.419> you<00:04:26.509> have

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
fingers then the hook back when you have

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.490 
fingers then the hook back when you have
a<00:04:26.690> perfectly<00:04:27.139> tandem<00:04:27.620> rig<00:04:27.800> soft<00:04:28.099> bait<00:04:29.500> now

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
a perfectly tandem rig soft bait now

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.219 
a perfectly tandem rig soft bait now
final<00:04:31.130> step<00:04:31.430> worth<00:04:31.849> mentioning<00:04:32.449> and<00:04:32.720> it's

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
final step worth mentioning and it's

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.379 
final step worth mentioning and it's
optional<00:04:33.440> but<00:04:34.370> it's<00:04:34.699> a<00:04:34.789> technique<00:04:35.150> that<00:04:35.360> I

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
optional but it's a technique that I

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.600 
optional but it's a technique that I
recommend<00:04:36.020> would<00:04:36.530> be<00:04:36.590> just<00:04:36.949> securing<00:04:37.430> those

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
recommend would be just securing those

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.339 
recommend would be just securing those
hooks<00:04:38.090> in<00:04:38.300> place<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:38.810> like<00:04:38.990> to<00:04:39.020> call<00:04:39.289> it

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
hooks in place I like to call it

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.610 
hooks in place I like to call it
preventive<00:04:40.009> maintenance<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:41.620> basically

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
preventive maintenance and basically

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.200 
preventive maintenance and basically
what<00:04:42.860> we're<00:04:42.979> accomplishing<00:04:43.639> is<00:04:43.910> really

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
what we're accomplishing is really

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.270 
what we're accomplishing is really
securing<00:04:44.750> those<00:04:44.870> hooks<00:04:45.199> in<00:04:45.409> place<00:04:45.440> now

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
securing those hooks in place now

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.279 
securing those hooks in place now
remember<00:04:46.789> these<00:04:46.909> are<00:04:46.970> soft<00:04:47.330> baits<00:04:47.659> and<00:04:47.930> they

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
remember these are soft baits and they

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.330 
remember these are soft baits and they
will<00:04:48.440> get<00:04:48.590> torn<00:04:48.860> up<00:04:49.070> over<00:04:49.280> time<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:50.750> if<00:04:51.680> just

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
will get torn up over time and if just
