00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
it's basically a monitoring type of a

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.579 
it's basically a monitoring type of a
module<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:06.930> enables<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.410> monitor

but the main benefit of it is that it

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.919 
but the main benefit of it is that it
actually<00:00:11.610> has<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.030> ability<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.450> floating<00:00:12.840> all

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.140 
able to use to move it and it is
persistent<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.820> move<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.060> anywhere

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it in it wherever it sits it'll be the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.359 
it in it wherever it sits it'll be the
position<00:01:16.170> where<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.500> stays<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.220> rest

of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> process<00:01:18.299> or<00:01:18.509> from<00:01:18.930> now<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.259> at<00:01:19.380> least

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
of the process or from now on at least

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
of the process or from now on at least
you<00:01:19.650> turn<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> off<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:21.000> main<00:01:21.150> thing<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.390> want

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
to keep in mind is it is persistent so

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.370

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
even if I come home you'll notice that's

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.230 
even if I come home you'll notice that's
sitting<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.740> my<00:01:25.830> manifestation<00:01:26.250> panel<00:01:26.820> but

are<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.170> other<00:01:49.290> options<00:01:49.350> were<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.890> able<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
are the other options were you able to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.889 
are the other options were you able to
turn<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.670> Wi-Fi<00:01:51.000> signal<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.600> battery

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
turn on the Wi-Fi signal the battery

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.870 
turn on the Wi-Fi signal the battery
signal<00:01:52.110> all<00:01:52.439> those<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.920> their<00:01:53.070> live<00:01:53.310> toggles

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
signal all those and their live toggles

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.600 
signal all those and their live toggles
so<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.689> go<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> battery<00:01:55.740> percentage<00:01:55.950> gives

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
so if I go to battery percentage gives

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.280 
so if I go to battery percentage gives
me<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.820> ability<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.119> look<00:01:57.180> at<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.600> Wi-Fi

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
me the ability to look at it there Wi-Fi

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.380 
me the ability to look at it there Wi-Fi
gauge<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.070> don't<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.399> Wi-Fi<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.909> doesn't<00:02:00.240> help

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.109 
gauge I don't have Wi-Fi on doesn't help
me<00:02:00.799> network<00:02:01.799> traffic<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:02.640> it'll<00:02:02.880> give

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
me network traffic and then it'll give

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.240 
me network traffic and then it'll give
you<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.240> update<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.780> again<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.200> still<00:02:04.590> keeps

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
it but I'm able to actually even inject

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.320 
it but I'm able to actually even inject
it<00:03:01.260> into<00:03:01.680> my<00:03:01.860> status<00:03:02.250> bar<00:03:02.280> now<00:03:02.700> by<00:03:02.819> doing<00:03:02.879> so

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
it into my status bar now by doing so

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.000 
it into my status bar now by doing so
this<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.629> where<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.870> xposed<00:03:04.230> module<00:03:04.349> turns<00:03:04.800> on

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
this is where the xposed module turns on

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.070 
this is where the xposed module turns on
it<00:03:05.879> actually<00:03:06.209> sits<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.569> there<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:06.959> goes

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
it actually sits in there and it goes

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.720 
it actually sits in there and it goes
away<00:03:07.319> now<00:03:07.470> when<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.650> open<00:03:07.739> up<00:03:08.010> my<00:03:08.069> notification

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
away now when I open up my notification

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.670 
away now when I open up my notification
panel<00:03:08.879> I<00:03:09.150> can<00:03:09.569> still<00:03:09.810> access<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.170> through<00:03:10.440> here

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
panel I can still access it through here

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.110 
panel I can still access it through here
but<00:03:10.890> when<00:03:11.069> I<00:03:11.099> close<00:03:11.310> my<00:03:11.340> notification<00:03:12.000> panel

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
but when I close my notification panel

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.790 
but when I close my notification panel
that's<00:03:12.420> sitting<00:03:12.690> there<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.379> of<00:03:13.560> course

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
that's sitting there and it is of course

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.140 
that's sitting there and it is of course
more<00:03:14.040> notifications<00:03:14.640> come<00:03:14.819> in<00:03:14.940> they'll<00:03:15.120> see

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
more notifications come in they'll see

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.210 
more notifications come in they'll see
on<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.510> left<00:03:15.690> side<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.080> screen<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:17.040> main

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
on the left side of the screen the main

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.979 
on the left side of the screen the main
option<00:03:17.550> here<00:03:17.760> is<00:03:17.879> very<00:03:18.450> nice<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.840> only

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
option here is very nice the only

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.390 
option here is very nice the only
concern<00:03:19.290> though<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.739> since<00:03:20.159> it's<00:03:20.340> a

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
concern though is that since it's a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.040 
concern though is that since it's a
persistent<00:03:20.670> notification<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.629> will<00:03:21.810> draw<00:03:22.019> a

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
persistent notification it will draw a

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.320 
persistent notification it will draw a
more<00:03:22.260> battery<00:03:22.560> just<00:03:23.220> keep<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.580> in<00:03:23.670> mind<00:03:23.879> it's

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
more battery just keep that in mind it's

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.420 
more battery just keep that in mind it's
a<00:03:24.450> nice<00:03:24.599> option<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:25.080> have<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.379> there<00:03:25.560> next<00:03:26.280> one

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
a nice option to have in there next one

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.160 
a nice option to have in there next one
last<00:03:26.909> but<00:03:27.030> not<00:03:27.090> least<00:03:27.299> here<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.510> can<00:03:27.659> start<00:03:27.989> on

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
last but not least here you can start on

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.479 
last but not least here you can start on
logs<00:03:28.409> to<00:03:28.680> be<00:03:28.769> able<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.980> see<00:03:29.099> some<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.340> your

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
stats as far as usage and so on I think

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.680 
stats as far as usage and so on I think
it's<00:03:32.099> very<00:03:32.250> nice<00:03:32.489> be<00:03:33.060> able<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.299> turn<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.569> on<00:03:33.629> and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
it's very nice be able to turn it on and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.089 
it's very nice be able to turn it on and

that's on to go into it from the
notification<00:04:18.299> panel<00:04:18.419> once<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.780> open<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.109> up

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
but the interface and the functions that

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.600 
but the interface and the functions that
it<00:04:21.329> does<00:04:21.449> are<00:04:21.660> pretty<00:04:21.840> unique

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
it does are pretty unique

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.980 
it does are pretty unique

think<00:04:56.690> check<00:04:57.199> it<00:04:57.320> out<00:04:57.410> I<00:04:57.919> did<00:04:58.340> notice<00:04:58.610> a<00:04:58.639> little

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
think check it out I did notice a little

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.909
