00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.660
 the voices are fundamental in a 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.240
 animated film they give life to the 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.129
 characters for the English version the 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.830
 dubbing was in charge of recognized 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.200
 artists like the actor william dafoe or 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.240
 the comedian ellen degeneres for the 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.369
 Spanish version the dubbing was done 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.289
 here in Mexico and we were there 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.289
 to see what the thing was about 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.590
 many of the characters in a movie 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.150
 animated are perfected at the moment of 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.580
 record the voices in the different 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.290
 languages and that's why it's very important 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.330
 find artists of different ages 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.330
 that contribute their own styles 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.570
 and at this moment we are recording the 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.570
 voice of marlin who is the father of nemo 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.980
 In the area 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.380
 [Music] 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.129
 like all good dad because he is very affectionate 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.220
 he protects he does not want anything to happen to him 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:10.349
 I want 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.349
 [Music] 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.850
 the recording is very careful because 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:22.820
 we know that it is aimed at a lot 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:26.310
 people I do not know if the edition is cut 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.920
 although we know that they are very productions 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.159
 taken care of from its origin first I begin 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.970
 to see the project and hear the voices 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.700
 what kind of voices are they and what actors 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.250
 I could call to do a casting before 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.950
 we select the study where 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.840
 I was going to record and the director that I was going 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.390
 to do that I was going to direct the project 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.619
 let's play it more how it is in a 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.619
 swirl called greetings 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.770
 Guillermo Aponte had to talk to 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.560
 nemo task that led him to study very 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.900
 well this very special character then 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.750
 It's a very small best and it's a fish 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.340
 very brave clown very much the reason 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.530
 do things but his dad almost never 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.740
 he leaves it well what I'm going to do here is 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.380
 read script to be able to fold the movie 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.120
 I need him to be super-attached to it 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.900
 he is told he does not want to go to school that 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.380
 Mind a hole for dad 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.420
 I was wrong I was wrong 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.020
 I'm looking for the needle they told me 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.840

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.790
 [Music] 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.770

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.770

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.970
 characters are divine divine me 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.110
 I am sure that they will have a great time 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.420
 and we in the movie are 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.640
 very interested in history and 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.120

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.890
