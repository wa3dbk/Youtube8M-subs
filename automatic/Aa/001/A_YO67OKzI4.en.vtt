the<00:00:32.550> checker<00:00:33.000> board<00:00:33.149> really<00:00:33.870> works<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
the checker board really works on the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160 
the checker board really works on the
principle<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.730> very<00:00:36.059> popular<00:00:36.360> Arduino

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
principle of the very popular Arduino

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.680 
principle of the very popular Arduino
format<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:39.000> most<00:00:39.239> people<00:00:39.570> would<00:00:39.660> be

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
format that that most people would be

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.569 
format that that most people would be
aware<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.379> may<00:00:40.530> remember<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.129> did<00:00:41.399> my

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
aware of and may remember that I did my

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.910 
aware of and may remember that I did my
very<00:00:42.149> first<00:00:42.450> video<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> duty<00:00:43.559> Milano

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920

board<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.420> see<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> board

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
board so I can see here that the board

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.119 
board so I can see here that the board
in<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> standard<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> head<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.539> very

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
in the standard with the head is very

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.080 
in the standard with the head is very
familiar<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.160> some<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.579> people<00:00:50.730> who've

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
familiar to some of you people who've

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090 
familiar to some of you people who've
seen<00:00:51.270> Arduino<00:00:51.660> before<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.890> see<00:00:53.039> in

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
you see you know ati old pins in

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.249 
you see you know ati old pins in
colorful<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.090> access<00:01:30.479> from<00:01:31.140> this

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
colorful that you can access from this

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.999 
colorful that you can access from this
device<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.869> when<00:01:33.869> we<00:01:33.990> look<00:01:34.170> towards<00:01:34.619> obviously

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
device so when we look towards obviously

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.830 
device so when we look towards obviously
arduino<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> very<00:01:36.540> big

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
arduino we know that this is a very big

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.719 
arduino we know that this is a very big
community<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.590> terms<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.040> light<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.430> in

a<00:01:39.119> hobbyist<00:01:39.540> open<00:01:39.930> source<00:01:40.200> software<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.829> it's

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
a hobbyist open source software so it's

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.520 
a hobbyist open source software so it's
in<00:01:42.030> tune<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.570> what<00:01:42.750> we've<00:01:42.899> now<00:01:42.990> done<00:01:43.049> is

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
in tune with that what we've now done is

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.580 
in tune with that what we've now done is
with<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> new<00:01:44.579> MP<00:01:44.970> ide<00:01:45.360> i'll<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.320> show<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.500> a

be very familiar to arduino users so

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.590 
be very familiar to arduino users so
this<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.500> an<00:01:55.890> extraction<00:01:56.340> or<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.329> copy

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
this is really an extraction or a copy

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.240 
this is really an extraction or a copy
if<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.259> actual<00:01:58.680> sketch<00:01:58.920> tool

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
if you like of the actual sketch tool

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.370 
if you like of the actual sketch tool
then<00:01:59.880> all<00:02:00.119> are<00:02:00.270> doing<00:02:00.719> our<00:02:00.840> users<00:02:01.200> will<00:02:01.350> be

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
then all are doing our users will be

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.590 
then all are doing our users will be
aware<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.700> been<00:02:02.880> make<00:02:03.030> impossible

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
aware of but it's been make impossible

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.410 
aware of but it's been make impossible
to<00:02:03.719> run<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.590> pic32<00:02:04.939> so<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:06.119> anybody

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
to run with the pic32 so for anybody

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.990 
to run with the pic32 so for anybody
who's<00:02:06.540> don't<00:02:06.750> work<00:02:06.930> before<00:02:07.409> with<00:02:08.099> arduino<00:02:08.580> can

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
who's don't work before with arduino can

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.850 
who's don't work before with arduino can
certainly<00:02:09.330> use<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.080> tool<00:02:10.379> again<00:02:10.739> to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
certainly use it to this tool again to

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.650 
certainly use it to this tool again to
do<00:02:11.039> all<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.280> work<00:02:11.430> with<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.700> max<00:02:11.910> 32<00:02:12.239> board

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
do all the work with the max 32 board

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.460 
do all the work with the max 32 board
and<00:02:12.810> continue

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
and continue

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.500 
and continue
there<00:02:13.710> are<00:02:13.800> other<00:02:13.920> projects<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.460> well<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:15.390> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
there are other projects as well so the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.940 
there are other projects as well so the
same<00:02:15.690> principle<00:02:16.080> applies<00:02:16.380> as<00:02:16.620> well<00:02:16.800> obviously

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
same principle applies as well obviously

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.830 
same principle applies as well obviously
with<00:02:17.310> working<00:02:17.700> with<00:02:17.820> shields<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.720> know

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
with working with shields and you know

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.750 
with working with shields and you know
add-ons<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.010> board<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.280> can<00:02:20.400> be<00:02:20.640> added

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
add-ons to the board that can be added

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.720 
add-ons to the board that can be added
to<00:02:20.850> peripherals<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.590> as<00:02:23.100> we<00:02:23.220> say<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.520> know<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
to peripherals so as we say you know the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.500 
to peripherals so as we say you know the
kit<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.030> very<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:25.590> know<00:02:25.680> simple<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.510> get

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
kit is very you know simple to get

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.090 
kit is very you know simple to get
started<00:02:27.570> with<00:02:28.140> hit<00:02:28.380> me<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.620> comes<00:02:28.800> in<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.950> very

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
started with hit me it comes in a very

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.060 
started with hit me it comes in a very
neat<00:02:29.310> little<00:02:29.400> box<00:02:29.760> will<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.330> supply<00:02:30.720> your<00:02:30.840> own

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
neat little box will you supply your own

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.000 
neat little box will you supply your own
USB<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.250> 2<00:02:32.850> mini<00:02:33.330> B<00:02:33.720> lead<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:34.860> not

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
USB a 2 mini B lead is that is not

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.700 
USB a 2 mini B lead is that is not
provided<00:02:35.550> with<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.730> kit<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.990> now<00:02:37.380> we'll<00:02:37.530> just

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
provided with the kit and now we'll just

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.810 
provided with the kit and now we'll just
plug<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.430> board<00:02:38.670> into<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.030> USB<00:02:39.320> ok<00:02:40.820> so

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
plug that board into the USB ok so

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.690 
plug that board into the USB ok so
that's<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:42.180> connects<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.020> up<00:02:43.110> now

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
that's just connects it up now

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.490 
that's just connects it up now
so<00:02:44.700> very<00:02:45.060> simply<00:02:45.510> what<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.810> wanted<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.170> look<00:02:46.290> at

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
so very simply what I wanted to look at

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.680 
so very simply what I wanted to look at
here<00:02:46.740> then<00:02:47.040> was<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:50.150> I'll<00:02:51.150> show<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.480> little

downloading the IDE is very simple you
know<00:03:09.810> we'll<00:03:09.990> provide<00:03:10.290> information<00:03:10.709> for<00:03:11.040> this

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
know we'll provide information for this

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.630 
know we'll provide information for this
and<00:03:11.610> also<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:12.810> see<00:03:13.500> pictures<00:03:14.010> there<00:03:14.250> off<00:03:14.459> the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
and also you see pictures there off the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.590 
and also you see pictures there off the
board<00:03:15.140> obviously<00:03:16.580> forums<00:03:17.580> there<00:03:17.910> which<00:03:18.450> would

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
board obviously forums there which would

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.680 
board obviously forums there which would
expect<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.110> see<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:20.910> whole<00:03:21.180> host<00:03:21.450> of

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
expect to see and a whole host of

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.900 
expect to see and a whole host of
information<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.340> won't<00:03:23.550> go<00:03:23.700> through<00:03:23.850> that

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
information so I won't go through that

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.370 
information so I won't go through that
now<00:03:24.180> because<00:03:24.450> it's<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.780> little<00:03:24.870> tricky<00:03:25.110> with

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
now because it's a little tricky with

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.790 
now because it's a little tricky with
one<00:03:25.530> hand<00:03:25.830> so<00:03:26.840> very<00:03:27.840> quickly<00:03:28.110> then<00:03:28.380> what<00:03:28.650> we'll

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
one hand so very quickly then what we'll

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.729 
one hand so very quickly then what we'll
look<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.160> do<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.600> same<00:03:31.110> formats<00:03:31.590> to

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
look to do is is the same formats to

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.449 
look to do is is the same formats to
upload<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.280> simple<00:03:32.670> piece<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.850> code<00:03:34.100> so<00:03:35.100> here

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
upload a simple piece of code so here

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.810 
upload a simple piece of code so here
when<00:03:36.209> we<00:03:36.239> click<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:36.900> that's<00:03:37.019> why<00:03:37.230> de<00:03:37.820> you

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
when we click in so that's why de you

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.080 
when we click in so that's why de you
can<00:03:39.000> see<00:03:39.500> that<00:03:40.500> there<00:03:40.769> are<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.400> number<00:03:41.820> of

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
can see that there are a number of

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.710 
can see that there are a number of
options<00:03:42.350> we've<00:03:43.350> got<00:03:43.500> two<00:03:43.620> examples<00:03:44.660> what<00:03:45.660> we

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
options we've got two examples what we

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.130 
options we've got two examples what we
can<00:03:45.870> see<00:03:46.080> here<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.590> soon<00:03:46.950> out<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:48.450> basics

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
can see here is soon out the basics

there's the arduino test suite that
you've<00:03:54.959> probably<00:03:55.140> familiar<00:03:55.470> with<00:03:55.860> the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
you've probably familiar with the

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.890 
you've probably familiar with the
ethernet<00:03:56.340> liquid-crystal<00:03:56.850> displays<00:03:57.390> SD

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
ethernet liquid-crystal displays SD

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.120 
ethernet liquid-crystal displays SD
servos<00:03:58.739> etc<00:03:59.310> so<00:04:00.239> very<00:04:01.230> simply<00:04:01.680> we<00:04:01.799> can<00:04:01.980> look

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
servos etc so very simply we can look

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.870 
servos etc so very simply we can look
here<00:04:02.340> now<00:04:02.400> for<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.910> simple<00:04:03.330> example<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:05.700> then

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
here now for a simple example and then

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.750 
here now for a simple example and then
we<00:04:05.970> go<00:04:06.090> for<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.299> digital<00:04:06.480> example<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.760> we'll

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
we go for a digital example and we'll

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.890 
we go for a digital example and we'll
look<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.150> maybe<00:04:09.360> blink<00:04:10.100> one<00:04:11.100> of<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.459> LEDs<00:04:13.070> so

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
look to maybe blink one of the LEDs so

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.650 
look to maybe blink one of the LEDs so
we<00:04:15.900> open<00:04:16.169> up<00:04:16.260> file<00:04:16.880> what<00:04:17.880> we<00:04:18.000> now<00:04:18.150> get<00:04:18.390> is

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
we open up file what we now get is

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.210 
we open up file what we now get is
obviously<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:20.870> that's<00:04:21.870> what<00:04:22.020> file<00:04:22.320> opens<00:04:22.919> and

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
obviously the that's what file opens and

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.100 
obviously the that's what file opens and
what<00:04:23.400> we<00:04:23.520> always<00:04:23.700> see<00:04:23.970> here<00:04:24.180> is<00:04:24.270> nice<00:04:24.479> common

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
what we always see here is nice common

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.850 
what we always see here is nice common

tell<00:04:34.509> you<00:04:34.599> a<00:04:34.629> little<00:04:34.719> bit<00:04:34.900> about<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.169> circuit

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
tell you a little bit about the circuit

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.709 
tell you a little bit about the circuit
the<00:04:35.889> LED<00:04:36.189> is<00:04:36.310> attached<00:04:36.699> from<00:04:37.000> pin<00:04:37.210> 13<00:04:37.539> to

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:37.719 
the LED is attached from pin 13 to

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.890 
the LED is attached from pin 13 to
ground<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:39.610> know<00:04:39.729> it's<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.270> very<00:04:40.659> good

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
ground and you know it's a very good

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.450 
ground and you know it's a very good
example<00:04:41.729> just<00:04:42.729> to<00:04:42.819> get<00:04:43.000> started<00:04:43.090> with<00:04:43.629> and<00:04:44.460> if

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
example just to get started with and if

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.050 
example just to get started with and if
we<00:04:45.610> scroll<00:04:45.969> down<00:04:46.030> now<00:04:46.569> here<00:04:46.870> you'll<00:04:47.560> see<00:04:48.060> the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
we scroll down now here you'll see the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.999 
we scroll down now here you'll see the
actual<00:04:49.270> cuddled<00:04:49.840> there<00:04:50.050> is<00:04:50.289> written<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:50.860> know

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
actual cuddled there is written you know

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.059 
actual cuddled there is written you know
an<00:04:51.129> usual<00:04:51.400> script<00:04:51.879> fashion<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:53.620> we<00:04:53.710> can<00:04:53.889> see

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
an usual script fashion so we can see

00:04:54.069 --> 00:05:00.589 
an usual script fashion so we can see
here<00:04:54.460> setting<00:04:55.180> LED<00:04:55.509> is<00:04:55.629> pin<00:04:55.870> 13<00:04:57.419> LED<00:04:58.419> start<00:04:58.689> low

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
here setting LED is pin 13 LED start low

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.999 
here setting LED is pin 13 LED start low
intervals<00:05:01.599> and<00:05:01.900> then<00:05:02.020> your<00:05:02.199> main<00:05:02.409> function<00:05:03.000> so

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
intervals and then your main function so

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.269 
intervals and then your main function so
it<00:05:06.009> has<00:05:06.219> a<00:05:06.250> loop<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:07.029> think<00:05:07.930> so<00:05:08.800> quite<00:05:09.009> simply

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:09.279 
it has a loop I think so quite simply

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.179 
it has a loop I think so quite simply
all<00:05:09.490> we<00:05:09.669> need<00:05:09.909> to<00:05:10.029> do<00:05:10.469> at<00:05:11.469> this<00:05:11.650> point<00:05:11.949> then

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:12.189 
all we need to do at this point then

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:14.790 
all we need to do at this point then
this<00:05:12.969> familiar<00:05:13.539> is<00:05:13.990> we<00:05:14.289> have<00:05:14.439> a<00:05:14.469> number<00:05:14.680> of

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
this familiar is we have a number of

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.540 
this familiar is we have a number of
buttons<00:05:15.189> here<00:05:15.250> for<00:05:15.610> controlling<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:18.310> if<00:05:18.460> we

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
buttons here for controlling and if we

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.969 
buttons here for controlling and if we
just<00:05:18.729> go<00:05:18.909> over<00:05:19.120> to<00:05:19.330> them<00:05:19.539> you<00:05:20.229> can<00:05:20.379> see<00:05:20.529> play

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
just go over to them you can see play

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.790 
just go over to them you can see play
verify<00:05:21.669> and<00:05:22.599> if<00:05:22.689> we<00:05:22.810> move<00:05:22.930> across<00:05:23.080> to<00:05:23.409> this<00:05:23.590> one

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
verify and if we move across to this one

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.709 
verify and if we move across to this one
this<00:05:24.460> is<00:05:24.639> the<00:05:24.699> important<00:05:25.090> button<00:05:25.270> upload

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:25.719 
this is the important button upload

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:28.980 
this is the important button upload
well<00:05:26.560> this<00:05:26.710> will<00:05:26.860> now<00:05:26.979> I<00:05:27.009> do<00:05:27.250> is<00:05:27.550> upload<00:05:27.990> this

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
well this will now I do is upload this

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.129 
well this will now I do is upload this
piece<00:05:29.199> of<00:05:29.319> code<00:05:29.529> to<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:30.099> actual<00:05:30.389> pic32<00:05:31.389> to

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
piece of code to the actual pic32 to

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.829 
piece of code to the actual pic32 to
that<00:05:32.289> for<00:05:32.469> max<00:05:32.650> 32<00:05:33.009> board<00:05:33.370> and<00:05:33.610> then<00:05:34.599> will

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:34.839 
that for max 32 board and then will

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:37.860 
that for max 32 board and then will
automatically<00:05:35.529> execute<00:05:36.159> that<00:05:36.250> code<00:05:36.629> so<00:05:37.629> I<00:05:37.659> now

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
automatically execute that code so I now

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.700 
automatically execute that code so I now
here<00:05:39.240> we<00:05:40.240> can<00:05:40.389> see<00:05:40.569> here<00:05:40.870> a<00:05:41.020> lot<00:05:41.229> into<00:05:41.500> the<00:05:41.589> i/o

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
here we can see here a lot into the i/o

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:51.570 
here we can see here a lot into the i/o
board

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.700 

okay<00:05:52.580> there<00:05:53.479> we<00:05:53.539> go<00:05:53.569> let<00:05:54.350> me<00:05:54.410> just<00:05:54.560> get<00:05:54.650> a

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
okay there we go let me just get a

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.749 
okay there we go let me just get a
little<00:05:54.800> report<00:05:55.220> there<00:05:55.539> the<00:05:56.539> binary<00:05:56.840> file<00:05:57.080> size

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 
little report there the binary file size

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:02.350 
little report there the binary file size
done<00:05:58.759> uploading<00:06:00.340> so<00:06:01.340> really<00:06:01.819> that<00:06:01.970> simple

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
done uploading so really that simple

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.710 
done uploading so really that simple
just<00:06:02.539> by<00:06:02.630> pulling<00:06:02.840> the<00:06:03.020> example<00:06:03.410> file<00:06:03.650> out<00:06:03.979> and

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
just by pulling the example file out and

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.680 
just by pulling the example file out and
now<00:06:06.190> if<00:06:07.190> we<00:06:07.250> just<00:06:07.580> take<00:06:07.789> a<00:06:07.849> look<00:06:08.150> down<00:06:08.389> to<00:06:08.599> the

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
now if we just take a look down to the

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:16.499 
now if we just take a look down to the
board<00:06:12.250> and<00:06:13.250> there<00:06:13.550> we<00:06:13.729> can<00:06:13.910> see<00:06:14.090> quite<00:06:14.330> clearly

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:16.509 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:21.010 

the<00:06:17.509> LED<00:06:17.930> lighting<00:06:18.560> for<00:06:19.419> a<00:06:20.419> very<00:06:20.599> simple

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
the LED lighting for a very simple

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.140 
the LED lighting for a very simple
example<00:06:21.139> but<00:06:22.009> just<00:06:22.250> really<00:06:22.580> the<00:06:22.669> principle<00:06:23.120> of

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
example but just really the principle of

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.080 
example but just really the principle of
showing<00:06:23.449> you<00:06:23.599> how<00:06:23.900> easy<00:06:23.930> and<00:06:24.590> you<00:06:25.580> know<00:06:25.699> it<00:06:25.940> is

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
showing you how easy and you know it is

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.150 
showing you how easy and you know it is
to<00:06:26.330> take<00:06:26.960> a<00:06:26.990> piece<00:06:27.229> of<00:06:27.259> example<00:06:27.710> code

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
to take a piece of example code
