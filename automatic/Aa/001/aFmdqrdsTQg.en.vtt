I've<00:00:12.450> noticed<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.230> lot<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:13.950> people<00:00:14.340> want<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.670> be

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
I've noticed a lot of people want to be

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.990 
I've noticed a lot of people want to be
strong<00:00:15.630> or<00:00:16.230> they<00:00:16.350> want<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.560> be<00:00:16.650> mobile<00:00:17.100> using

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
strong or they want to be mobile using

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.300 
strong or they want to be mobile using
sled<00:00:18.300> work<00:00:18.510> kind<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.380> combines<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.920> too<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.220> you

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
sled work kind of combines it too so you

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.759 
sled work kind of combines it too so you
can<00:00:20.340> be<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.789> combines<00:00:21.480> mobility<00:00:22.170> with

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
can be it combines mobility with

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.460 
can be it combines mobility with
strength<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.910> working<00:00:24.779> with<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.260> we're

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
strength so working with that we're

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.240 
strength so working with that we're
going<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.650> do<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> few<00:00:25.949> exercises

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
going to do a few exercises

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.419 
going to do a few exercises
demonstrating<00:00:27.180> not<00:00:27.869> only<00:00:28.170> linear<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:29.160> some

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
demonstrating not only linear but some

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.790 
demonstrating not only linear but some
lateral<00:00:29.760> movement<00:00:30.240> working<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> core<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
lateral movement working the core the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.620

anterior<00:00:32.309> chain<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:33.180> posterior<00:00:33.600> chain<00:00:35.630> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
anterior chain and a posterior chain the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.670 
anterior chain and a posterior chain the
first<00:00:36.840> exercise<00:00:37.140> we're<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
first exercise we're going to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.190 
first exercise we're going to
demonstrate<00:00:37.829> as<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> walking<00:00:38.790> sled<00:00:39.120> drag<00:00:39.420> as

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
demonstrate as a walking sled drag as

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.479 
demonstrate as a walking sled drag as
opposed<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.680> running<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:41.190> were<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
opposed to running what they were the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.280 
opposed to running what they were the
emphasis<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.090> quads<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.780> explosion

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
emphasis on the quads and the explosion

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.350 
emphasis on the quads and the explosion
walking<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.309> let's<00:00:44.940> go<00:00:45.000> ahead<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.149> start

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
walking with it let's go ahead and start

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.729 
walking with it let's go ahead and start
walking<00:00:45.719> we're<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> go<00:00:46.230> hill<00:00:46.469> first

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
walking we're going to go hill first

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.529 
walking we're going to go hill first
we're<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> pull<00:00:47.910> through<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
we're going to pull through with the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.830 
we're going to pull through with the
hamstrings<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> glutes<00:00:50.600> this<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.719> going

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
hamstrings and the glutes this is going

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.389 
hamstrings and the glutes this is going
to<00:00:51.930> change<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.260> emphasis<00:00:52.800> while<00:00:53.219> we're

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
to change the emphasis while we're

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.090 
to change the emphasis while we're
walking<00:00:54.379> onto<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.739> posterior<00:00:56.190> chain<00:00:58.100> so

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
walking onto that posterior chain so

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.889 
walking onto that posterior chain so
instead<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.399> pushing<00:00:59.760> off<00:01:00.120> with<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> quads

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
instead of pushing off with the quads

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.840 
instead of pushing off with the quads
we're<00:01:01.859> pulling<00:01:02.129> through<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
we're pulling through with the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.939 
we're pulling through with the
hamstrings<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.600> glutes<00:01:03.960> keeping<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
hamstrings and the glutes keeping the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.340 
hamstrings and the glutes keeping the
abs<00:01:05.100> tight<00:01:06.530> shoulders<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:09.229> walking<00:01:10.229> all

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
abs tight shoulders up and walking all

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:19.350 
abs tight shoulders up and walking all
the<00:01:10.380> way<00:01:10.500> through

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.650 

good<00:01:21.910> next<00:01:22.910> exercise<00:01:23.300> we're<00:01:23.480> going<00:01:23.510> to

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
good next exercise we're going to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.080 
good next exercise we're going to
demonstrate<00:01:23.870> is<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:25.010> backwards<00:01:25.520> walk<00:01:25.850> with

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
demonstrate is the backwards walk with

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.000 
demonstrate is the backwards walk with
the<00:01:26.210> sled<00:01:26.540> this<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.410> going<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.590> change<00:01:27.680> the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
the sled this is going to change the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.980 
the sled this is going to change the
emphasis<00:01:28.430> from<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.030> hamstrings<00:01:29.540> on<00:01:29.690> to<00:01:29.900> the

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
emphasis from the hamstrings on to the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.890 
emphasis from the hamstrings on to the
quad<00:01:30.260> and<00:01:30.530> hip<00:01:30.830> flexors<00:01:31.310> again<00:01:32.210> working<00:01:32.540> on

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
quad and hip flexors again working on

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.100 
quad and hip flexors again working on
that<00:01:33.500> linear<00:01:34.070> motion<00:01:34.660> we're<00:01:35.660> going<00:01:35.870> backwards

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
that linear motion we're going backwards

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.860 
that linear motion we're going backwards
all<00:01:37.100> right<00:01:37.220> reach<00:01:37.760> back<00:01:38.030> we're<00:01:38.480> going<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:38.660> pull

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
all right reach back we're going to pull

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.260 
all right reach back we're going to pull

direction nice job next exercise is that
it's<00:04:44.520> anti<00:04:45.030> rotational<00:04:46.669> exercise<00:04:47.669> again

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
it's anti rotational exercise again

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.970 
it's anti rotational exercise again

rotational<00:04:57.390> movement<00:04:57.870> again<00:04:58.440> we're<00:04:58.590> going<00:04:58.710> to

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
rotational movement again we're going to

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.620 
rotational movement again we're going to
show<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:58.919> how<00:04:58.979> to<00:04:59.100> use<00:04:59.400> that<00:05:00.150> rotational

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
show you how to use that rotational

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.760 
show you how to use that rotational
movement<00:05:00.930> you're<00:05:01.110> still<00:05:01.290> incorporating
