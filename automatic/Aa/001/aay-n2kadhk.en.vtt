00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.700
 we have said obama matter organization 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.240
 but the answer in the medium and long 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.279
 term is to go to a monetary union the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.760
 new electronic money is the answer 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.130
 to bring down the dollar in ecuador what 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.650
 we analyze let's put this in 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.050
 context the central bank of ecuador 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.970
 created the electronic money that is payments 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.309
 dollar by phone 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.350
 cell phones without the need to have 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.269
 Internet or bank account and you can 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.710
 be exchanged at any time for money 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.979
 physical or that would be the dollars 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.339
 critics two one that the government would be 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:47.489
 looking for another source of financing 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:49.110
 as it does not issue US dollars I would use the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.790
 electronic money to finance the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.320
 expansion of public spending what would be 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.750
 dangerous for public finances and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.180
 two opens the door to another currency 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.030
 different to the dollar and this would not be very 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.589
 popular with people because in 2000 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.059
 Ecuador was assumed to be the largest 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.830
 financial crisis of its history and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.210
 history the sucre lost value and the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.920
 inflation was out of control that 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.470
 The Ecuadorians decided to accept the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.330
 dollar as official currency 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.790
 and the Ecuadorians want to be 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.590
 keep the dollar very popular the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.870
 president rafael strap that defends the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.210
 electronic money project has been 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.610
 very critical that the dollar has been dollarized 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.740
 economy says it's an absurd though 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.680
 he has also said to remove the dollar 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.540
 would create more problems and more chaos going 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.950
 with Carlos de la Torre, economist of the 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.600
 catholic university of quito that 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.820
 defends electronic money is a 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.170
 carlos bust you in the program does not 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.790
 we are going to focus on the issue of 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.340
 operational transactions how it works 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.869
 if it works that if the benefits and the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.580
 negative effects that we are not going to 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.310
 focus on the macro effect that could 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.619
 have the first criticism that is said to 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.600
 it would be creating a quasi- 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.810
 quasi-currency different from the dollar that says 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.880
 you in no way in its structure and 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.729
 objectives the electronic money what 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.460
 point is to cover the spaces that the 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.970
 financial system is not covering in 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.390
 terms of facilitating transactions 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.229
 minors 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.590
 even in terms of magnitudes the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.410
 electronic money is planned 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:19.400
 somehow reach 150 million 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.349
 of dollars in about 5 years when 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.690
 the money circulating in currencies 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.580
 deficient in the equator is by 7 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.680
 billion ie 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.750
 orders of magnitude is money 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.330
 electronic would in no way come to 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.550
 cover or replace the coins and 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.989
 banknotes in circulation although now you 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.760
 I'm going to read what Miguel wrote 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.740
 Davila former manager of the central bank of 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.820
 Ecuador 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.110
 how the regulations are written 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.960
 related to the issuance of money 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.820
 electronic there is a possibility 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.320
 that the central bank of which Ecuador 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.820
 applies a reservation system 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.830
 proportional between the physical dollars 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.440
 that receives electronic records that 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.990
 issue in other words there is a 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.910
 accounting measure and how it is established 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.410
 the regulation would allow the bank 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.780
 central use the reservation 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.120
 international I can issue debt in 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.280
 outside I can use the currency 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.710
 that I receive from the export of my 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.930
 products from Ecuadorian oil 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.420
 for example I can use that because 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.240
 the same regulation is not clear in 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.520
 limit what you say of no 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.890
 way by how much the structures are 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.770
 which dollarization works in the 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.350
 Ecuador would not allow in a way that 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.080
 an edition can be generated without a 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.140
 endorsement and indeed the electronic zero 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.030
 will necessarily have a backup 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.650
 to repair that there is a moment and touch them 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.230
 because this is the key law of creation 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.980
 of the financial safety net that is 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.349
 recently created 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.930
 says the central bank of equator 10 and 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.640
 must deliver the so-called bonds 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.459
 the minister of finance ministry 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.680
 value 0 that to energize the economy 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.930
 national the central bank should 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.299
 use the resources of the reserves 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.330
 available international and perform 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.920
 investments in the country that is already here 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:10.170
 a door that the central bank can 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.110
 fund investment projects within 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.879
 of the equator then with this money 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.590
 address the concern is already 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.789
 On the one hand, you are being allowed to 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.560
 the central bank finances projects 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.740
 internal and with electronic money 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.360
 would be creating a cash balance that 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.550
 while silver enters the country there is no 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.340
 no problem while entering currency 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.110
 and Ecuador has access to external debt 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.539
 there is no problem what happens when 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.580
 there is no such thing then when it falls 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.639
 then it would not come the 1 to 1 that says your 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.560
 answer you can not keep anything 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.970
 different to 11 because you have to understand 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.600
 that the international reserve of free 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.860
 availability are the bank's assets 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.289
 central 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.659
 generates from the liabilities that are 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.280
 the deposits of the financial system and 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.949
 the deposits of the public sector 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.289
 fundamentally electronic money 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.810
 what would come to constitute is also 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.389
 some deposits or would be based on the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.370
 deposits made by the public and that 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.439
 just now you can access those 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.330
 deposits through media 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:12.030
 electronic using the phone 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.699
 cellular is exactly the same as maintaining 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.680
 a deposit in a commercial bank and 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.479
 use the internet to perform 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.819
 transfers from one account to another 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.039
 then it is always going to keep the one 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:25.259
 to one now but for example in the case 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.550
 how do you answer me Carlos on the subject 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.639
 of the creation of the safety net 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.770
 financial or as if we're seeing 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.449
 that to energize the national economy 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.360
 As it is saying, the bank dÃ¡vila 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:39.860
 Central of Ecuador should use the 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.310
 resources of international reserves 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.990
 asked was the central bank use 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.330
 international reserves for 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.009
 finance a bank an investment 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.449
 internal within the country that does not 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.180
 necessarily be the private banking 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.919
 create a public bank to support banking 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.419
 public that is, there is that window 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:01.310
 currently of course the resources of 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.169
 the national reserves of promotion and 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.330
 national financial corporation ok 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.770
 Hold on to me then hold on there 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.750
 we are then the concern is that 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.270
 there is this window and now the government 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.759
 You can create through this ticket 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.189
 electronic I can then allow 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.659
 the people that I'm going to give you a ticket 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:19.759
 electronic you say it's one to one 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:21.289
 comes a person deposits it in the 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.659
 bank and the central bank gives you the one to 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.520
 a perfect one but what happens when the 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.319
 government because remember that the bank 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.669
 central has that power the government will 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:31.310
 says to the central bank now I want 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:33.050
 that you finance me is more where do you go 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.270
 come that ticket that is the concern 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.550
 that there is where it will come from then 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.370
 according to the law, it would be 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.419
 established the letter that would allow 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.920
 off through reserves 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:46.700
 international 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.890
 first by law since 1992 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.160
 the central bank can not grant 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:54.560
 credits to the government then indicated 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.630
 again the investments he makes 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.700
 the central bank are like the 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.100
 investments of any commercial bank 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.930
 and a part of those investments those that 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.580
 are in more liquid assets is called 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.520
 free international reserve 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.730
 availability and could direct some 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.290
 resources to investments that are 

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.200
 characteristics maybe a little less 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.090
 liquid but backed by liabilities 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.010
 which are deposits of the financial sector 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.140
 and deposits of the local sector itself 

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.630
 Carlos, I have to go, I'll make you two 

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.940
 closed questions me not first 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.010
 ask time this creation of the 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.340
 electronic money is not a quasi-currency 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.890
 different to the dollar yes or no in a way 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.180
 ok and the second the state would find 

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.950
 that the placement of electronic money 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.860
 constitutes a source of financing 

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.360
 ask this this ticket this money 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.090
 electronic would be another source of 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.010
 financing for the government yes or no 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.250
 Carlos from the tower a pleasure to have had 

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.250
 the program
