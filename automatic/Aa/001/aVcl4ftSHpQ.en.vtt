of know what suits you you can do a
thinner<00:02:18.260> I<00:02:18.320> let<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.620> can<00:02:18.740> do<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.830> thinner

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
thinner I let you can do a thinner

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.160 
thinner I let you can do a thinner
version<00:02:19.130> of<00:02:19.460> this<00:02:19.610> as<00:02:19.760> well

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.930 

and<00:02:24.170> I'm<00:02:24.830> basically<00:02:25.160> just<00:02:25.250> smoothing<00:02:25.700> out<00:02:25.790> the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
and I'm basically just smoothing out the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.260 
and I'm basically just smoothing out the
edges<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:27.130> there<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.280> go<00:02:28.400> there<00:02:28.640> there's<00:02:29.060> my

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
edges and there you go there there's my

edges and there you go there there's my
my<00:02:30.080> eyeliner<00:02:30.440> but<00:02:30.920> I'm<00:02:31.070> just<00:02:31.250> gonna<00:02:31.340> fill<00:02:31.640> in<00:02:31.760> a

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
my eyeliner but I'm just gonna fill in a

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.850 
my eyeliner but I'm just gonna fill in a
little<00:02:31.970> bit<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.360> gaps<00:02:32.540> here<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.650> just

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
little bit of the gaps here and just

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.370 
little bit of the gaps here and just
make<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.100> look<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.460> little<00:02:34.550> bit<00:02:34.730> more<00:02:34.880> smoother

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.110 

okay<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.680> then<00:02:43.160> I'm<00:02:43.340> going<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.640> do<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.000> other

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
okay and then I'm going to do the other

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.280 
okay and then I'm going to do the other
thing<00:02:44.420> with<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.780> same<00:02:44.960> thing<00:02:45.110> on<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.260> other

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
thing with the same thing on the other

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:53.470 
thing with the same thing on the other
side<00:02:45.560> as<00:02:45.680> well<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:52.400> I've<00:02:52.490> got<00:02:52.640> my<00:02:52.790> line<00:02:53.300> in

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
side as well so so I've got my line in

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.260 
side as well so so I've got my line in
the<00:02:53.510> corners<00:02:53.959> in<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.770> inner<00:02:54.920> corner<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.610> I'm

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
the corners in the inner corner and I'm

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.390 
the corners in the inner corner and I'm
gonna<00:02:56.420> do<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.750> line<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.800> outer<00:02:57.950> corner<00:02:58.310> as

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
gonna do the line on the outer corner as

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.380 
gonna do the line on the outer corner as
well

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.800 

notice<00:03:02.390> how<00:03:02.510> I'm<00:03:02.660> kind<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.990> just<00:03:04.660> tapering<00:03:05.660> it

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
notice how I'm kind of just tapering it

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.020 
notice how I'm kind of just tapering it
off<00:03:05.930> like<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.970> like<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.000> feather<00:03:08.330> stroke<00:03:08.750> and

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
off like that like a feather stroke and

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.340 
off like that like a feather stroke and
then<00:03:11.030> I'm<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.300> going<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.660> connect<00:03:12.050> both<00:03:12.200> of

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
then I'm just going to connect both of

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.280 
then I'm just going to connect both of
these<00:03:12.440> lines<00:03:12.620> together<00:03:13.040> okay<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.990> hold<00:03:14.990> on<00:03:15.140> my

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
these lines together okay I hold on my

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:27.610 
these lines together okay I hold on my
lid<00:03:15.530> by<00:03:15.770> keeping<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.250> other<00:03:16.370> eye<00:03:16.459> open

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.729 

and<00:03:28.220> you're<00:03:28.340> just<00:03:28.550> connecting<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:29.090> dots<00:03:29.239> I

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
and you're just connecting the dots I

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.410 
and you're just connecting the dots I
know<00:03:30.739> it<00:03:30.980> looks<00:03:31.190> easy<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.790> it's<00:03:32.120> probably<00:03:32.269> not

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
know it looks easy and it's probably not

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.150 
know it looks easy and it's probably not
easy<00:03:32.629> when<00:03:32.840> you're<00:03:32.900> doing<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.349> but<00:03:33.560> trust<00:03:33.800> me

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
easy when you're doing it but trust me

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.130 
easy when you're doing it but trust me
practice<00:03:34.910> makes<00:03:35.180> perfect<00:03:35.750> I've<00:03:35.810> been<00:03:35.959> doing

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
practice makes perfect I've been doing

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.250 
practice makes perfect I've been doing
this<00:03:36.200> for<00:03:36.349> over<00:03:36.379> 10<00:03:36.650> years<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.870> now<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:38.900> do<00:03:39.110> it

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
this for over 10 years and now I do it

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.900 
this for over 10 years and now I do it
really<00:03:39.560> quickly<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:41.050> one<00:03:42.050> trick<00:03:42.560> one<00:03:42.910> tip

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
really quickly and one trick one tip

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.490

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.440 
that I'm gonna give you is that the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
faster you do it the cleaner the the

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.119 
faster you do it the cleaner the the
lines<00:03:47.690> gonna<00:03:47.930> look<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.319> slower<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.799> do<00:03:48.980> it

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
lines gonna look the slower you do it

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.070 
lines gonna look the slower you do it
the<00:03:49.610> more<00:03:49.640> jagged<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.390> lines<00:03:50.569> are<00:03:50.750> gonna<00:03:50.840> look

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
the more jagged the lines are gonna look

00:03:51.080 --> 00:04:00.990 
the more jagged the lines are gonna look
okay<00:03:51.620> so

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.760 

and<00:04:01.390> just<00:04:01.810> make<00:04:01.960> sure<00:04:01.990> that<00:04:02.140> they<00:04:02.380> both<00:04:02.500> look

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
and just make sure that they both look

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:12.270 
and just make sure that they both look
even<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:11.110> I<00:04:11.230> usually<00:04:11.350> just<00:04:11.680> put<00:04:11.770> my<00:04:11.950> hands

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
even and I usually just put my hands

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.920 
even and I usually just put my hands
like<00:04:12.700> that<00:04:12.910> when<00:04:13.270> there's<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.480> lot<00:04:13.600> of<00:04:13.720> light

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
like that when there's a lot of light

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.360 
like that when there's a lot of light
coming<00:04:14.260> from<00:04:14.290> one<00:04:14.560> side<00:04:14.590> of<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:14.950> room<00:04:15.160> I

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
coming from one side of the room I

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.460 
coming from one side of the room I
always<00:04:15.640> just<00:04:15.850> kind<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.840> create<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.350> little

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
always just kind of create a little

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.220 
always just kind of create a little
shadow<00:04:17.769> on<00:04:18.040> top<00:04:18.070> like<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.730> and<00:04:19.150> this<00:04:19.989> way<00:04:20.200> I

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
shadow on top like that and this way I

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.150 
shadow on top like that and this way I
can<00:04:20.579> see<00:04:21.579> if<00:04:21.730> they<00:04:21.880> both<00:04:22.000> look<00:04:22.240> even<00:04:22.980> and<00:04:23.980> they

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
can see if they both look even and they

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.670 
can see if they both look even and they
look<00:04:24.340> pretty<00:04:24.550> good<00:04:24.670> to<00:04:24.850> me<00:04:27.480> okay<00:04:28.480> and<00:04:28.690> now<00:04:29.590> I'm

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
look pretty good to me okay and now I'm

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.990 
look pretty good to me okay and now I'm
going<00:04:29.830> to<00:04:29.890> do<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.220> bottom<00:04:30.520> part<00:04:30.850> of<00:04:30.880> the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
going to do the bottom part of the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:43.830 
going to do the bottom part of the
eyeliner<00:04:31.300> I<00:04:37.830> do<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.070> inner<00:04:42.630> part<00:04:43.630> of<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.810> eye

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
eyeliner I do the inner part of the eye

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:51.490 
eyeliner I do the inner part of the eye
first

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.500 

and<00:04:52.040> then<00:04:52.310> what<00:04:52.490> I'm<00:04:52.580> gonna<00:04:52.700> do<00:04:53.000> is<00:04:53.150> I<00:04:53.270> like<00:04:53.420> to

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
and then what I'm gonna do is I like to

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.260 
and then what I'm gonna do is I like to
have<00:04:53.630> that<00:04:53.810> clean<00:04:54.170> edge<00:04:54.380> look<00:04:54.710> at<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:54.920> bottom

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
have that clean edge look at the bottom

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.370 
have that clean edge look at the bottom
so<00:04:56.270> I'm<00:04:57.050> going<00:04:57.350> to<00:04:57.410> just<00:04:57.800> draw<00:04:58.610> a<00:04:58.910> line<00:04:59.380> very

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
so I'm going to just draw a line very

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.380 
so I'm going to just draw a line very
softly<00:05:02.770> underneath<00:05:03.770> I<00:05:04.210> don't<00:05:05.210> know<00:05:05.270> if<00:05:05.330> you

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
softly underneath I don't know if you

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:12.230 
softly underneath I don't know if you
can<00:05:05.540> see<00:05:05.690> but

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.629 

and<00:05:12.539> if<00:05:13.289> you<00:05:13.470> don't<00:05:13.590> like<00:05:13.800> that<00:05:13.919> clean<00:05:14.250> sharp

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
and if you don't like that clean sharp

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.189 
and if you don't like that clean sharp
look<00:05:14.880> at<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.240> bottom<00:05:15.569> that's<00:05:15.720> fine<00:05:15.990> you<00:05:16.169> can

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
look at the bottom that's fine you can

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.610 
look at the bottom that's fine you can
just<00:05:16.350> use<00:05:16.800> like<00:05:17.729> a<00:05:17.789> soft<00:05:18.120> smudge<00:05:18.449> brush<00:05:19.139> to

just use like a soft smudge brush to

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.589 
just use like a soft smudge brush to
kind<00:05:19.770> of<00:05:19.919> smudge<00:05:20.160> it<00:05:20.340> at<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.520> bottom<00:05:21.030> you<00:05:21.539> can

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.469 
and I'll do the same thing on the other
side<00:06:02.540> so<00:06:03.540> I'm<00:06:03.990> gonna<00:06:04.850> extend<00:06:05.850> the<00:06:06.030> top<00:06:06.240> line

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
side so I'm gonna extend the top line

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.790 
side so I'm gonna extend the top line
first<00:06:08.630> like<00:06:09.630> that<00:06:09.810> and<00:06:10.289> then<00:06:10.530> I'm<00:06:10.620> gonna

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
first like that and then I'm gonna

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.520 
first like that and then I'm gonna
extend<00:06:11.010> the<00:06:11.370> bottom<00:06:11.550> line<00:06:12.110> and<00:06:13.110> then<00:06:13.500> just

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
extend the bottom line and then just

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:21.279 
extend the bottom line and then just
again<00:06:14.010> just<00:06:14.400> connecting<00:06:14.940> them<00:06:15.210> together
