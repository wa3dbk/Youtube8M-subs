00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.800
 liking a lot in terms of information 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.100
 apart from gameplays and humor too 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.739
 information about everything wrong the most 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.260
 possible fast whenever I see any 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.059

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.399

 show you as fast as possible to me 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.110
 I always liked to inform me then to 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.760
 I like to do the same to others 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.100
 people then 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.610
 I want to have a wide coverage about 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.430
 of season 4 season so 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.430
 you can subscribe to people who do not 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.040
 is subscribed you can share the channel 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.289
 because it's going to be a pass and 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.350
 you will see it I have thought about many things 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.210
 for season 4 apart from announcing 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.549
 all changes the new champions 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.890
 that new skins are coming as 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.320
 I'm usually doing but the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.800
 season 4 the preseason will take 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.470
 many changes therefore many 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.690
 videos also with information 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.610
 anyway in this video I love you 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.810
 teach something that was talked about in the all-star 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.900
 of the sun in which a map of 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.050
 1 versus 1 and 2 versus 1 was called in 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.710
 magma chamber let's move on to see what 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.420
 that what good what would be first the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.020
 Initial sketch of the magma chamber 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.840
 ad riot is this here I announce it 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.590
 riot a long time ago a few years ago 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.410
 in which was to be a new map 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.459
 as you see it is not out yet nothing was 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.590
 a news that came out in the go in the 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.379
 game directly that you could 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.750
 visualize on the riot website in 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.210
 which good then we see a field like 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.500
 of 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.320
 of ice magma good to be able to route 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.870
 also ice on the part of the new 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.870
 will make the new map of will but good 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.270
 it became this we see to 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.970
 then that map was used in the 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.510
 all-star for the 1 versus 1 and 2 versus 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.190
 2 in which good as edition of the sun 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.380
 be there by individuality or 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.530
 individual let's go 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.270
 and what they said what they said is not 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.860
 one hundred percent , but is supposed to go 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.770
 to take out for the patch 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.930
 the first good patch I guess of the 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.810
 season 4 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.480
 because I like it good because if you 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.209
 you remember a month ago not a month ago 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.489
 and half or two months I did a tournament 1 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.079
 versus 1 we had to do everything from 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.510
 manual form 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.459
 here you select the 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.340
 champion and you can see the champion who 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.650
 choose your opponent you can change in 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.170
 the last moment you can do a thousand 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.670
 adventures here if you throw the only tower 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.639
 that's where the game ends directly 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.319
 if maximum rate to the opponent you kill 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.670
 the game is over and if you reach 100 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.919
 minions the game is over just the 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.590
 rules that I put in the tournament and that are 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.849
 they're like that in 11 so we're going to 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.720
 put it more closely so that what 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:44.599
 see here we have it therefore good 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.169
 Well, I think it's going to give a lot of play to 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:51.709
 this can lead to new tournaments and 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:54.740
 hopefully, in season 4, so be it and 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.810
 see the light this map 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.100
 a little more a little more a video 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.930
 short but I was interested in 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.450
 I knew there is going to be a lot 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.340
 coverage with the pre-season theme 4 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.620
 all the news you are going to have in 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.910
 the channel you can subscribe you can give 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.650
 I like it if you liked the video 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.330
 you can share it are little things that 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.250
 they cost very little and they help a lot like 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.270
 I always say and see you in the next 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.270
 goodbye video 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.120
