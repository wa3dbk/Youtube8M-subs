00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.810
 hello girls so I find myself 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.260
 for the presentation of my beast w 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:14.750
 I'm really happy so here is so 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.180
 to be present like this 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.490
 and here's behind so it's a 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.430
 metal case all slightly more 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.660
 simple and that's the inside here and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.760
 for now I told you about the park 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.099
 Jean Jaures and an after in what is there 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.960
 in then at the package level me it 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.469
 I like it very well I find it pretty 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.780
 sober and pretty if I would really like 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.960
 a rebuke to do that would be like you 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.260
 so see the hues are written to 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.500
 the back and not inside as 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.579
 in luxury mechanics and his copy 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.660
 here I would have preferred it to be written 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.149
 in the tents it's true that it would have 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 been really more convenient but this 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.190
 is not the case so it's only 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.020
 reproach that I have to do it's really 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.649
 I find it very very well here I am 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.799
 am happy 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.250
 then with regard to the interior 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.450
 the most important so I'm not going to you 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.540
 come back so I do not know if you see 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.670
 well yes I think so I will not 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.570
 go back on the state name since I 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.770
 you quoted them on facebook 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.990
 but we talk a lot 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.939
 pigmentation then personally I 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.110
 find that pigmentation ibl months 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.759
 here you look at me I am 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.030
 makeup with I will get closer 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.759
 for you to see 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.840
 I do not know if you have seen 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.850
 here I find that food on 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.829
 flights at the level of the outfit he has 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.290
 listened I'm makeup with twice 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.130
 and it held all day at the end of 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.369
 day I did not have 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.799
 and make big pies in the middle that I 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.969
 hated 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.979
 so no I'm happy 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.360
 after the only complaint is that when 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.780
 you wear makeup there are some 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.549
 falls 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.470
 there are some falls at the level of 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.350
 cheeks but frankly it's very very 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.060
 light compared to others to others 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.319
 palettes or others this eyeshadow 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.539
 that I have already been able to test it 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.920
 so that's only 300 blame for me 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.580
 because we must not forget that she 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.110
 costs 8 euros so compared to the year 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.830
 key2key in football 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:20.459
 I have more or less 45 or 47 on the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.840
 forgiveness of time so here first of all at 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.700
 price quality level 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.450
 frankly I find it great so there 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.470
 on the eyes I have the hue so I 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.190
 look behind what I did the 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.269
 spokesperson 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.049
 so I'm probably waiting for it so it's 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:41.910
 this one that I have in base 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:49.620
 Then I have the tent right next to it 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:53.130
 kg and 2 then I have this one which is 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.260
 wade and I got a little bit of 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.530
 zeal who next to make the sound kiki 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.819
 and tender here is good to eat pasta rice 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.769
 wheat 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.120
 so here it is and it was asked by 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.310
 we from you if I could do a 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.380

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.299
 smoky eyes brown world will listen 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.799
 there's no problem but I'll do it 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.959
 when the world will begin as I 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.780

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.220

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.430
 so if you are I would like you 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.540
 hold your opinion me personally I 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.000
 am very happy I find that 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.380
 really value for money there is nothing 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.859
 to say what to 8 euros postage 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.310

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:48.280
