00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:09.429
 find cyril hanouna and his team 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:13.010
 between 6 am and 9 am wonderfully 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:15.650

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.599
 the choices made on virgin radio I 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.460
 see the Michelin name on efficiency 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.509
 finally passed just a clasico a game of 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.130
 classic words I called a gentleman 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.849
 michel way to change but the 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.900
 windows my x 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.550
 this is simply this classic hello 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.820
 hello my name is well done iech 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.809
 I am well at michelin yes in fact 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.640
 I call you because I had a 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.839
 galley let's love the x I punctured on 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.460
 guingamp is actually next to the stadium 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:44.600
 roudourou and I feel if you can 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:45.559
 help me out I 'm pessimistic because 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.530
 that I actually told you is that I 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.180
 actually need a tire michelin energy 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.609
 185 points 55 on a leg of 14 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.140
 so you actually phone yourself you 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:03.260
 to be sold to the manufacturers listened 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:06.259
 until the seller ok I understand me yes 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.130
 cuckoo it's always worth paying if 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.520
 I'm okay what am I not a 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.520
 mechanic 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.909
 yes no but because actually 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.930
 as much for me there is a misunderstanding 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.360
 because in fact I told you that 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.650
 I needed a tire michelin energy 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.630
 legs of 14 when in fact these rims 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.950
 of 15 who to listen to understand that 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.729
 suffice that it corresponded only to his 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.930
 modules to go after 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.890

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.009
