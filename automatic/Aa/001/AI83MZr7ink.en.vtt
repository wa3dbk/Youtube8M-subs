00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.540
 good day here is not even still 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.830
 on the ces 2014 today is if me 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.580
 not everything is the ninth first 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.199
 all a bit tiring last one 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.189
 But that is part of such a fair 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.529
 we are at the Qualcomm stand and 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.019
 As you can see, I have a device from LG 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.039
 in the hand it is about that 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:33.270
 So lg flex the first smartphone 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.649
 The home LG with flexible display as 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.700
 that was presented so before there was 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.000
 so many actually rumored 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.940
 happened with such flexible displays 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.160
 The first implementation is like this 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.200
 simply bent into a device 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.399
 I'll have to say I can do that now 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.230
 Of course not quite right in the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.800
 hand take over because of the magnet here 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.870
 in the back 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.980
 but I find it quite interesting 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.600
 especially because it is really quite real 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.770
 nice different if you do that in the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.530
 So hand has the display 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.730
 you can already see how bent it is 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.890
 but what I have to say is that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.420
 The device is quite big, I know 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.590
 unfortunately not exactly the right one 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.790
 Great displays I have this whole 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.060
 do not pay anymore at all 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.470
 in the head 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.080
 but I think so 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.560
 about 50 or 60 would have to be 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.210
 and you also notice the big difference 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.280
 is because if you have the 0 3 to 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.070
 comparison takes you see that this 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.140
 then again whole tick bigger 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.930
 So the complete emergency is almost like that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.130
 Big as the screen of the LG Flex as 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.430
 definitely a huge device 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.869
 anyway the trend here at the fair 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.939
 everything actually bigger and bigger so you 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.750
 Hardly anybody finds smartphones anymore 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.729
 Below 5 inches there are a few exceptions 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.189
 So for people who a big device 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.159
 a big smartphone like a big one 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.280
 Tablet is the LG Flex with security 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.869
 quite interesting, yes, we'll take a look 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.909
 maybe someday in the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.500
 editing properly when you test device 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.729
 got around here so a bit 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.380
 playing is not so useful now 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.939
 First impression in any case is one 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.680
 chic device that makes lg also real 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.619
 always better devices like me 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.229
 personally think that was already 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.130
 really a great part 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.110
 Yes and 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.130
 big device is synonymous mine 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.440
 straight hand movements straight 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.400
 In any case , we have noticed 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.290
 us now a bit further around 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.160
 and I wish you one more first 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.160
 Good bye
