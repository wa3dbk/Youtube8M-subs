 we can make ourselves discover again 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.220
 the building would be proved anyway 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.930
 I only demolished a building but it was 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.430

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.839

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.129
 tuned again on the radio of 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.720
 police and I also provided a service 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.699
 audience you will hear seems like a thing 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.620
 negative is a bad thing bob 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.030
 uproot the family again because you 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.860
 can revive the glory days is 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.750
 negative then and always better than that 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.210
 pretend they never were 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.500
 yes there have been is true but this the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.440
 our family is what's there now 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.330
 bob you 're losing it I can't 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.010
 believe you don't want to go see yours 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.380
 child who graduate from high school 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.810
 it goes from elementary to middle school is one 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.610
 crazy ceremony always create new 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.380
 ways to celebrate mediocrity but if 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.270
 someone is really great then 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.890
 does not talk about you bob we talk about flash 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.810
 can do something for flash 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.280
 then allow him to compete leave 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.020
 what makes sports do me 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.969
 bad mom you know because she can't 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.670
 do it because it would be the best 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:36.979
 we are not talking about you is too much 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.409
 I would really say that you are elegant 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.149
 very well 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.500
 I thought that our region or me 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.380
 sorry there was none with us tonight 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.179
 trust in your understanding but of course 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.130
 however, I usually prefer to know for 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.170
 those who work instead prefer a 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.640
 anonymous profile 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.799
 I believe you can understand it better than 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.299
 anyone else I was wondering among 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.179
 all the places that exist in the world 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.749
 why live in a volcano 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.789
 he is attracted to power like me is one 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:07.840
 weakness that we share seems to me a 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:11.060
 somewhat unstable I prefer to define it 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.890
 misunderstood Beijing is the land 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.140
 volcanic and fertile beams that there are 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.240
 everything on this table has been cultivated 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.120
 here 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.590
 what do you think I find all delicious 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.900
 we have confirmation of the impact 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.920
 the goal has been destroyed or will you 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.260
 will pass you will see 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:42.390
 I seem to remember that you prefer 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:46.240
 work alone free me now 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.530

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.680
 cruel on your part 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.690
 go ahead it will be easy as they broke 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.690

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.390
 I knew you're not even capable 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:15.080
 when you have nothing to lose 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.080

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.550

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.540
 close as you call if you do not mind 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:44.160

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.750

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.820
 your success with women 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.010
 I don't think it was exactly for 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.190

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.960
