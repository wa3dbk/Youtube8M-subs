00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.359 

cable<00:01:56.270> turn<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.540> phone<00:01:57.810> here

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:09.350 

we<00:02:02.369> can't<00:02:02.670> see<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.210> secret<00:02:06.689> okay<00:02:08.360> so

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
we can't see that it's a secret okay so

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:20.479 
we can't see that it's a secret okay so
basically<00:02:13.849> plug<00:02:14.849> this<00:02:15.090> into<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> phone<00:02:19.489> comes

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
basically plug this into the phone comes

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.030 
basically plug this into the phone comes
up<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:21.000> display<00:02:21.269> says<00:02:21.930> HDMI<00:02:22.620> cable

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
up on the display says HDMI cable

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.640 
up on the display says HDMI cable
connected<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.940> as<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.420> see<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.959> have<00:02:24.989> a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
connected and as you see we have a

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.449 
connected and as you see we have a
mirror<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.349> really<00:02:28.920> smooth<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:31.459> thought

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
mirror this is really smooth I thought

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.570 
mirror this is really smooth I thought
there<00:02:32.640> might<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.819> some<00:02:33.120> lag<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:33.750> there's<00:02:33.930> not

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
there might be some lag but there's not

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:48.949 
there might be some lag but there's not
very<00:02:35.580> smooth<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:38.209> so<00:02:39.209> if<00:02:39.329> we<00:02:39.480> go<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:47.959> the

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
very smooth and so if we go to so the

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.729 
very smooth and so if we go to so the
scrolling<00:02:49.560> as<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:49.920> can<00:02:50.069> see<00:02:50.340> very<00:02:51.060> smooth<00:02:51.739> for

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
scrolling as you can see very smooth for

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.699 
scrolling as you can see very smooth for
the<00:02:52.799> landscape<00:02:53.390> that's<00:02:54.390> cool<00:02:56.989> very<00:02:57.989> clear<00:02:58.500> I

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709

can't<00:02:59.150> can't<00:03:00.150> believe<00:03:00.390> how<00:03:00.599> clear<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.049> screen

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680
