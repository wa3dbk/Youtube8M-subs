first<00:04:00.010> we<00:04:00.220> apply<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:00.579> realistic<00:04:01.540> water<00:04:01.780> at

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
first we apply the realistic water at

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.080 
first we apply the realistic water at
1/16<00:04:02.890> of<00:04:03.040> an<00:04:03.189> inch<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.579> bottom<00:04:03.939> after

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
1/16 of an inch to the bottom after

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.190 
1/16 of an inch to the bottom after
painting<00:04:04.659> it<00:04:04.810> then<00:04:05.799> we<00:04:06.280> added<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:07.180> lily<00:04:07.900> pads

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
painting it then we added the lily pads

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.649 
painting it then we added the lily pads
that<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:08.560> see<00:04:08.739> here<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:10.060> little<00:04:10.299> pad<00:04:10.510> in

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
that you see here and the little pad in

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.929 
that you see here and the little pad in
the<00:04:10.750> back<00:04:10.959> with<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.319> fish<00:04:11.680> where<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.700> boat<00:04:12.909> is

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
the back with the fish where the boat is

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.660 
the back with the fish where the boat is
over<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.599> we<00:04:13.840> added<00:04:14.079> those<00:04:14.409> to<00:04:14.799> the<00:04:14.950> top<00:04:15.189> of<00:04:15.459> the

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
over it we added those to the top of the

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.219 
over it we added those to the top of the
realistic<00:04:16.150> water<00:04:16.419> after<00:04:16.840> it<00:04:16.900> had<00:04:17.049> dried<00:04:17.699> then

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
realistic water after it had dried then

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.650 
realistic water after it had dried then
every<00:04:20.229> three<00:04:20.440> days<00:04:20.650> we<00:04:21.039> would<00:04:21.190> add<00:04:21.340> another

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
every three days we would add another

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.279 
every three days we would add another
1/16<00:04:22.660> of<00:04:22.870> an<00:04:23.020> inch

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
1/16 of an inch

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.890 
1/16 of an inch
of<00:04:23.490> realistic<00:04:24.490> water<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.330> it<00:04:25.479> gives<00:04:25.720> the

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
of realistic water and it gives the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.370 
of realistic water and it gives the
effect<00:04:26.020> that<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:27.400> boat<00:04:27.639> itself<00:04:28.199> the<00:04:29.199> two

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
effect that the boat itself the two

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.500 
effect that the boat itself the two
bolts<00:04:29.800> in<00:04:29.949> the<00:04:30.220> back<00:04:30.250> are<00:04:30.669> sitting<00:04:31.389> on

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
bolts in the back are sitting on

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.800 
bolts in the back are sitting on

where<00:04:38.289> the<00:04:38.440> water<00:04:38.710> actually<00:04:38.800> falls<00:04:39.400> from<00:04:39.550> the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
back the water is actually deeper now we

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.830 
back the water is actually deeper now we
also<00:05:02.830> found<00:05:03.250> that<00:05:03.460> by<00:05:03.729> using<00:05:03.760> the<00:05:04.330> realistic

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
also found that by using the realistic

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.070 
also found that by using the realistic
the<00:05:04.990> water<00:05:05.260> effects<00:05:05.849> the<00:05:06.849> same<00:05:07.150> pattern<00:05:07.900> that

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
the water effects the same pattern that

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.379 
the water effects the same pattern that
we<00:05:08.199> use<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.560> coat<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.949> side<00:05:09.190> here<00:05:09.699> when<00:05:10.270> you

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
we use to coat the side here when you

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.629 
we use to coat the side here when you
lay<00:05:10.630> it<00:05:10.750> across<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:11.260> middle<00:05:11.289> or<00:05:11.800> around<00:05:12.460> the

lay it across the middle or around the

the realistic water just behind it it'll

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.779 
the realistic water just behind it it'll
block<00:05:18.400> it<00:05:18.699> and<00:05:18.849> build<00:05:19.270> up<00:05:19.599> a<00:05:20.310> larger<00:05:21.310> amount<00:05:21.610> of

block it and build up a larger amount of

and<00:05:24.310> that's<00:05:25.150> how<00:05:25.360> we<00:05:25.419> created<00:05:26.380> this<00:05:26.729> realistic

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
and that's how we created this realistic

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.219 
and that's how we created this realistic
