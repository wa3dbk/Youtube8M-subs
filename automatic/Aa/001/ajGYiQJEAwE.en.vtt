dolphin featured paper and we flip it so

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.620 
dolphin featured paper and we flip it so
that<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.349> bottom<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:14.009> at<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.670> bottom<00:00:15.030> facing

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
that the bottom is at the bottom facing

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.670 
that the bottom is at the bottom facing
upwards<00:00:16.880> next<00:00:17.880> we're<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.869> fold<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
upwards next we're going to fold the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.480 
upwards next we're going to fold the
paper<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.189> half<00:00:20.220> from<00:00:20.789> left<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.270> right<00:00:22.310> in<00:00:23.310> a

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
diagonal I'm going to crease it so

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.620 
diagonal I'm going to crease it so
crease<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.800> really<00:00:31.830> well<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.550> then<00:00:33.480> we're

crease it really well and then we're

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.690 
crease it really well and then we're
going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.960> open<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.530> back<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:37.040> next<00:00:38.040> we're

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
going to open it back up next we're

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.180 
going to open it back up next we're
going<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.270> take<00:00:39.840> these<00:00:40.290> two<00:00:40.559> corners<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
going to take these two corners and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.000 
going to take these two corners and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
we're going to fold these edges to the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.549 
we're going to fold these edges to the
middle<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:45.210> we're<00:00:45.390> going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.600> take<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.320> top

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
middle so we're going to take the top

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.940 
middle so we're going to take the top
edge<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.690> we're<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> fold<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.559> into<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
edge and we're going to fold it into the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.510 
edge and we're going to fold it into the
middle<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:54.480> we're<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.320> take<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.070> right

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
middle and we're going to take the right

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.189 
middle and we're going to take the right
edge<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:58.489> fold<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.789> into<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> middle<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.960> that

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
edge and fold it into the middle so that

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.760 
edge and fold it into the middle so that
is<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> nice<00:01:02.180> ice-cream<00:01:03.180> cone<00:01:03.629> kind<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.170> shape

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.700 

next<00:01:07.610> we're<00:01:07.790> going<00:01:07.970> to<00:01:08.119> take<00:01:08.450> corners<00:01:08.930> a<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.500> B

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
next we're going to take corners a and B

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.060 
next we're going to take corners a and B
and<00:01:10.040> we're<00:01:10.189> going<00:01:10.399> to<00:01:10.610> fold<00:01:11.270> these<00:01:11.630> edges<00:01:12.070> into

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
and we're going to fold these edges into

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.440 
and we're going to fold these edges into
the<00:01:13.189> middle<00:01:13.460> as<00:01:13.640> well<00:01:13.670> so<00:01:14.119> we're<00:01:14.270> going<00:01:14.390> to

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
the middle as well so we're going to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.410 
the middle as well so we're going to
take<00:01:14.630> corner<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:16.030> we're<00:01:17.030> going<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:17.240> follow

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
take corner a and we're going to follow

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.429 
take corner a and we're going to follow
the<00:01:17.689> lines<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.350> fold<00:01:18.799> it<00:01:19.070> into<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:21.020> middle

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
the lines and fold it into the middle

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.789 
the lines and fold it into the middle
like<00:01:21.799> that<00:01:25.509> I'm<00:01:26.509> going<00:01:26.659> to<00:01:26.720> take<00:01:26.929> corner<00:01:27.259> B<00:01:27.500> and

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
like that I'm going to take corner B and

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.570 
like that I'm going to take corner B and
this<00:01:28.369> edge<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:29.030> fold<00:01:29.539> it<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.140> middle<00:01:30.580> so

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
this edge and fold it to the middle so

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.330 
this edge and fold it to the middle so
it<00:01:31.729> looks<00:01:31.909> like<00:01:32.000> we<00:01:32.299> have<00:01:32.509> two<00:01:32.929> dolphins

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
it looks like we have two dolphins

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.529 
it looks like we have two dolphins
sitting<00:01:34.340> next<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.880> each<00:01:35.030> other<00:01:37.210> next<00:01:38.210> we're

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
sitting next to each other next we're

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.719 
sitting next to each other next we're
going<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.869> take<00:01:39.259> this<00:01:39.590> paper<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.340> we're<00:01:40.490> going

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
going to take this paper and we're going

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.690 
going to take this paper and we're going
to<00:01:40.940> fold<00:01:41.209> it<00:01:41.420> in<00:01:41.569> half<00:01:41.860> backwards<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.549> we're

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
to fold it in half backwards so we're

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.609 
to fold it in half backwards so we're
going<00:01:43.819> to<00:01:43.880> take<00:01:44.149> this<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:44.780> we're<00:01:45.289> going<00:01:45.319> to

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
going to take this and we're going to

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.029 
going to take this and we're going to
fold<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.130> in<00:01:46.280> half<00:01:46.810> backwards<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:48.890> the

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
fold it in half backwards and so the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.899 
fold it in half backwards and so the
tops<00:01:49.369> meet<00:01:50.200> at<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.380> top<00:01:51.590> point<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.310> we're

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
tops meet at the top point and we're

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.969 
tops meet at the top point and we're
going<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:53.270> fold<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:53.780> in<00:01:54.590> half<00:01:56.799> next<00:01:57.799> we're

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
going to fold it in half next we're

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.399 
going to fold it in half next we're
going<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.459> take<00:01:58.729> our<00:01:59.119> finger<00:01:59.899> and<00:02:00.140> we're<00:02:00.259> going

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
going to take our finger and we're going

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.359 
going to take our finger and we're going
to<00:02:00.470> slide<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.189> into<00:02:01.509> this<00:02:02.509> pocket<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:04.130> top

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
to slide it into this pocket the top

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.839 
to slide it into this pocket the top
pocket<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.119> we're<00:02:05.869> going<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:06.289> pull<00:02:06.649> out<00:02:06.890> the

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
pocket and we're going to pull out the

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.560 
pocket and we're going to pull out the
flap<00:02:08.149> that's<00:02:09.049> inside<00:02:10.120> next<00:02:11.120> we're<00:02:11.239> going<00:02:11.450> to

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
flap that's inside next we're going to

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.310 
flap that's inside next we're going to
fold<00:02:11.930> along<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:13.010> tip<00:02:13.600> along<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:14.810> dotted

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
fold along the tip along this dotted

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.539 
fold along the tip along this dotted
line<00:02:15.739> so<00:02:17.019> that<00:02:18.019> we<00:02:18.350> can<00:02:18.560> create<00:02:18.829> the<00:02:19.100> Dolphins

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
line so that we can create the Dolphins

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.360 
line so that we can create the Dolphins
fins<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:21.670> then<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:22.820> can<00:02:23.500> push<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.980> the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
fins and then we can push it to the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.610 
fins and then we can push it to the
right<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:28.459> we<00:02:28.489> have<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.180> Dolphins<00:02:29.570> fin<00:02:29.840> and

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
right so we have the Dolphins fin and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.410 
right so we have the Dolphins fin and
we're<00:02:30.769> going<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.100> do<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.640> same<00:02:31.880> thing<00:02:32.120> on<00:02:32.269> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
we're going to do the same thing on the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.660 
we're going to do the same thing on the
other<00:02:32.450> side<00:02:33.070> so<00:02:34.070> we<00:02:34.549> slip<00:02:34.850> our<00:02:35.000> finger<00:02:35.329> in<00:02:36.670> pull

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
other side so we slip our finger in pull

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.240 
other side so we slip our finger in pull
out<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.060> flap<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:39.650> then<00:02:39.890> fold<00:02:40.720> along

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
out the flap and then fold along

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.470 
out the flap and then fold along
dotted<00:02:44.120> line<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.260> we<00:02:45.380> get<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.590> pointy<00:02:46.480> tip

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
dotted line so that we get a pointy tip

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.600 
dotted line so that we get a pointy tip
coming<00:02:47.960> out<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.410> we<00:02:48.500> can<00:02:48.620> put<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.070> back<00:02:49.250> this

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
coming out and we can put it back this

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.710 
coming out and we can put it back this
time<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.180> left<00:02:50.390> side<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.210> you<00:02:53.270> can<00:02:53.510> see

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
time to the left side and so you can see

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.030 
time to the left side and so you can see
the<00:02:53.990> Dolphins<00:02:54.710> fins<00:02:55.100> are<00:02:55.630> done<00:02:56.680> next<00:02:57.680> we're

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
the Dolphins fins are done next we're

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.240 
the Dolphins fins are done next we're
going<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.400> do<00:02:58.640> an<00:02:59.240> inside<00:02:59.930> reverse<00:03:00.170> fold<00:03:00.860> to

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
going to do an inside reverse fold to

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.540 
going to do an inside reverse fold to
finish<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.060> head<00:03:02.300> so<00:03:03.050> basically<00:03:03.590> we're<00:03:04.340> going

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
finish the head so basically we're going

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.730 
finish the head so basically we're going
to<00:03:04.670> open<00:03:04.850> up<00:03:05.210> the<00:03:05.420> paper<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:06.140> we're<00:03:06.410> going<00:03:06.680> to

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
to open up the paper and we're going to

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.230 
to open up the paper and we're going to
tuck<00:03:07.130> this<00:03:07.640> paper<00:03:08.000> in<00:03:08.360> along<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.620> dotted<00:03:09.800> line

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
tuck this paper in along the dotted line

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.809 
tuck this paper in along the dotted line
and<00:03:11.260> we're<00:03:12.260> going<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.530> fold<00:03:13.040> it

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.080 

so<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.599> the<00:03:17.719> paper<00:03:17.959> is<00:03:18.079> inside<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:19.730> tip<00:03:19.939> is

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
so that the paper is inside the tip is

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.099 
so that the paper is inside the tip is
inside<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:21.519> then<00:03:22.519> we're<00:03:22.700> going<00:03:22.879> to<00:03:23.000> do<00:03:23.329> the

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
inside and then we're going to do the

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.530 
inside and then we're going to do the
tail<00:03:24.379> in<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.099> tail<00:03:25.370> we're<00:03:25.790> going<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.120> also<00:03:26.299> do

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
tail in the tail we're going to also do

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.330 
tail in the tail we're going to also do
it<00:03:26.629> inside<00:03:26.989> reverse<00:03:27.319> fold<00:03:27.590> but<00:03:27.769> first<00:03:28.040> we're

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
it inside reverse fold but first we're

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.240 
it inside reverse fold but first we're
going<00:03:28.489> to<00:03:28.579> crease<00:03:29.000> this<00:03:29.329> to<00:03:29.900> help<00:03:30.109> us<00:03:30.319> so<00:03:31.099> we're

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
going to crease this to help us so we're

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.839 
going to crease this to help us so we're
going<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.430> crease<00:03:31.670> along<00:03:32.030> this<00:03:32.180> line<00:03:33.849> that's

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
going to crease along this line that's

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.759 
going to crease along this line that's
printed<00:03:35.359> and<00:03:35.599> we're<00:03:35.870> going<00:03:36.109> to<00:03:36.170> crease<00:03:36.439> it<00:03:36.650> and

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
printed and we're going to crease it and

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.440 
printed and we're going to crease it and
we're<00:03:37.010> going<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:37.370> UNCHR<00:03:37.790> esit<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:38.299> can

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
we're going to UNCHR esit and you can

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.380 
we're going to UNCHR esit and you can
also<00:03:39.159> kind<00:03:40.159> of<00:03:40.310> fold<00:03:40.519> it<00:03:40.640> backwards<00:03:41.150> this<00:03:41.329> way

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
also kind of fold it backwards this way

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.589 
also kind of fold it backwards this way
so<00:03:41.599> it's<00:03:41.959> creased<00:03:42.290> really<00:03:42.650> really<00:03:42.920> well<00:03:43.599> then

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
so it's creased really really well then

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.569 
so it's creased really really well then
we're<00:03:44.870> going<00:03:45.079> to<00:03:45.200> open<00:03:45.349> up<00:03:45.680> our<00:03:45.859> dolphin<00:03:46.069> and

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
we're going to open up our dolphin and

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.030 
we're going to open up our dolphin and
we're<00:03:47.209> going<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.540> push<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.950> paper<00:03:49.189> in<00:03:49.519> words

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
we're going to push the paper in words

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.440 
we're going to push the paper in words
so<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:54.129> turns<00:03:55.129> up<00:03:55.400> like<00:03:55.609> that<00:03:55.819> and<00:03:56.090> we're

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
so that it turns up like that and we're

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.030 
so that it turns up like that and we're
going<00:03:56.569> to<00:03:56.629> squish<00:03:56.989> it<00:03:57.139> together<00:03:57.319> and<00:03:57.769> we<00:03:57.919> can

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
going to squish it together and we can

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.679 
going to squish it together and we can
follow<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.700> creases<00:03:59.000> that<00:03:59.209> we<00:03:59.510> made

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
follow the creases that we made

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.599 
follow the creases that we made
previously<00:04:01.689> next<00:04:02.689> we're<00:04:02.900> going<00:04:03.109> to<00:04:03.230> make<00:04:04.129> the

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
previously next we're going to make the

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.509 
previously next we're going to make the
tail<00:04:04.909> a<00:04:05.180> little<00:04:05.329> bit<00:04:05.599> more<00:04:05.810> special<00:04:06.519> first

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
tail a little bit more special first

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.539 
tail a little bit more special first
we're<00:04:07.790> going<00:04:07.879> to<00:04:07.939> take<00:04:08.090> our<00:04:08.269> scissors<00:04:08.510> and

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
we're going to take our scissors and

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.520 
we're going to take our scissors and
then<00:04:10.549> along<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.239> tail<00:04:11.569> there's<00:04:11.840> a<00:04:11.900> solid

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
then along the tail there's a solid

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.589 
then along the tail there's a solid
white<00:04:13.189> line<00:04:13.519> like<00:04:13.849> this<00:04:14.060> so<00:04:14.269> we're<00:04:14.389> going<00:04:14.540> to

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
white line like this so we're going to

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.960 
white line like this so we're going to
cut<00:04:14.840> along<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.379> solid<00:04:15.829> white<00:04:16.039> line<00:04:17.229> and<00:04:18.970> stop

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
cut along the solid white line and stop

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.460 
cut along the solid white line and stop
where<00:04:20.269> it<00:04:20.449> stops<00:04:22.599> so<00:04:23.599> we<00:04:23.659> took<00:04:23.810> a<00:04:23.960> little<00:04:24.199> snip

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
where it stops so we took a little snip

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.950 
where it stops so we took a little snip
then<00:04:25.400> we're<00:04:25.580> going<00:04:25.729> to<00:04:25.789> take<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.090> top<00:04:26.360> flap<00:04:26.720> of

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
then we're going to take the top flap of

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.659 
then we're going to take the top flap of
that<00:04:27.139> and<00:04:27.409> we're<00:04:27.590> going<00:04:27.830> just<00:04:28.099> to<00:04:28.310> make<00:04:28.639> a

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
that and we're going just to make a

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.310 
that and we're going just to make a
little<00:04:29.530> v-shape<00:04:30.560> with<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.190> tail<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:32.320> then

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
little v-shape with the tail and then

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.860 
little v-shape with the tail and then
our<00:04:33.470> dolphin<00:04:33.710> is<00:04:34.010> finished<00:04:34.340> you<00:04:35.300> can<00:04:35.510> put<00:04:35.780> it
