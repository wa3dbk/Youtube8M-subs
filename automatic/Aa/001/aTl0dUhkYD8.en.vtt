00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.680 
want to use a quarter inch twisted drill
bit<00:03:07.140> which<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:10.370> which<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.550> this<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:12.570> just

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
bit which is which is this you just

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.120 
bit which is which is this you just
don't<00:03:12.810> want<00:03:12.990> to<00:03:13.020> use<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.170> masonry<00:03:13.590> bit<00:03:13.740> and

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
don't want to use a masonry bit and

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.550 
don't want to use a masonry bit and
again<00:03:14.850> this<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.150> quarter<00:03:15.480> inch<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:16.320> want<00:03:16.500> to

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
again this is a quarter inch you want to

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.199 
again this is a quarter inch you want to
drill<00:03:16.860> through<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.220> plastic<00:03:19.820> when<00:03:20.820> I<00:03:20.850> drilled

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
drill through the plastic when I drilled

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:28.430 
drill through the plastic when I drilled
mine<00:03:23.420> it<00:03:24.420> really<00:03:24.660> wasn't<00:03:24.840> very<00:03:24.959> hard<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:27.440> I'm

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
mine it really wasn't very hard so I'm

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:55.020 
mine it really wasn't very hard so I'm
going<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.769> show<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.070> that<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.370> minute

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.580 

as<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:57.290> can<00:03:57.410> see<00:03:57.620> it's<00:03:57.769> pretty<00:03:58.040> easy<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:59.590> to

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
as you can see it's pretty easy to to

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.820 
as you can see it's pretty easy to to
drill<00:04:00.860> through<00:04:01.099> that<00:04:05.080> next<00:04:06.080> step<00:04:06.260> is<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.620> put

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
drill through that next step is to put

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:14.020 
drill through that next step is to put
your<00:04:08.110> parts<00:04:09.110> in<00:04:09.260> there<00:04:09.470> and<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:11.810> put<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:13.030> the

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
your parts in there and I put the the

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.870 
your parts in there and I put the the
non<00:04:16.000> slotted<00:04:17.000> part<00:04:17.299> on<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:18.350> outside<00:04:19.040> so<00:04:19.729> that

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
non slotted part on the outside so that

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.340 
non slotted part on the outside so that
you<00:04:20.030> can't<00:04:20.269> see<00:04:20.540> the<00:04:20.570> slot<00:04:21.019> when<00:04:21.260> they<00:04:26.350> the

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
you can't see the slot when they the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.050 
you can't see the slot when they the
visor<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:27.800> closed<00:04:28.130> and<00:04:28.940> again<00:04:30.610> post<00:04:31.610> goes<00:04:31.880> in

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
visor is closed and again post goes in

00:04:32.060 --> 00:05:03.620 
visor is closed and again post goes in
there<00:04:38.169> screw<00:04:39.169> goes<00:04:39.410> on<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.650> top

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.090 

basically<00:05:04.630> this<00:05:04.840> was<00:05:05.020> a<00:05:05.050> design<00:05:05.470> flaw<00:05:05.860> by

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
basically this was a design flaw by

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.480 
basically this was a design flaw by
Honda<00:05:06.640> that<00:05:07.410> and<00:05:08.410> these<00:05:08.890> parts<00:05:09.310> are<00:05:09.460> just

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
Honda that and these parts are just

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.090 
Honda that and these parts are just
going<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:11.070> give<00:05:12.070> you<00:05:12.190> some<00:05:12.460> stability<00:05:14.100> keep

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
going to give you some stability keep

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.620 
going to give you some stability keep
the<00:05:15.220> visor<00:05:15.460> some<00:05:15.790> stability<00:05:15.970> to<00:05:16.270> be<00:05:16.420> able<00:05:16.570> to

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
the visor some stability to be able to

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.860 
the visor some stability to be able to
hold<00:05:16.780> on<00:05:21.210> you<00:05:22.210> should<00:05:22.330> want<00:05:22.480> to<00:05:22.510> make<00:05:22.630> them<00:05:22.780> as

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
hold on you should want to make them as

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.810 
hold on you should want to make them as
tight<00:05:23.140> as<00:05:23.290> you<00:05:23.380> can<00:05:23.410> make<00:05:23.560> them<00:05:23.860> without

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
tight as you can make them without

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.210 
tight as you can make them without
obviously<00:05:25.360> breaking<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.780> plastic<00:05:26.290> and

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
obviously breaking the plastic and

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.220 
obviously breaking the plastic and
that's<00:05:27.640> basically<00:05:28.060> it<00:05:28.180> now<00:05:28.780> it's<00:05:28.900> just<00:05:28.960> time

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
that's basically it now it's just time

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.610 
that's basically it now it's just time
to<00:05:29.290> put<00:05:29.530> it<00:05:29.590> back<00:05:29.710> on<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:30.190> on<00:05:30.970> the<00:05:31.090> car<00:05:31.620> okay

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
to put it back on the on the car okay

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.100 
to put it back on the on the car okay
then<00:05:32.830> it's<00:05:32.980> just<00:05:33.100> time<00:05:33.400> to<00:05:33.840> put<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:34.960> visor

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
then it's just time to put the visor

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.500 
then it's just time to put the visor
back<00:05:35.440> up<00:05:35.650> and<00:05:35.920> you'll<00:05:36.010> notice<00:05:36.360> obviously<00:05:37.360> when

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
back up and you'll notice obviously when

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.900 
back up and you'll notice obviously when
you<00:05:37.600> took<00:05:37.720> it<00:05:37.780> off<00:05:38.550> that<00:05:39.550> there<00:05:39.700> was<00:05:39.790> this

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
you took it off that there was this

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.650 
you took it off that there was this
little<00:05:40.030> tab<00:05:40.420> on<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:41.110> end<00:05:41.230> of<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:42.660> connector

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
little tab on the end of the connector

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.260 
little tab on the end of the connector
you<00:05:43.950> have<00:05:44.950> to<00:05:45.190> make<00:05:45.340> sure<00:05:45.400> you<00:05:45.550> slide<00:05:45.910> that<00:05:46.150> in

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
you have to make sure you slide that in

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.790 
you have to make sure you slide that in

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
decorative clip to cover the screws and

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.260 
decorative clip to cover the screws and
you're<00:06:05.710> done<00:06:06.210> so<00:06:07.890> on<00:06:08.890> the<00:06:08.920> outside<00:06:09.060> you<00:06:10.060> just

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
you're done so on the outside you just

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.310 
you're done so on the outside you just
see<00:06:10.450> these<00:06:10.630> two<00:06:10.810> points<00:06:11.170> on<00:06:11.410> your<00:06:12.040> visor<00:06:13.320> you

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
see these two points on your visor you

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.400 
see these two points on your visor you
can<00:06:15.240> if<00:06:16.240> it<00:06:16.390> really<00:06:16.570> bothers<00:06:16.750> you<00:06:17.080> the<00:06:17.200> color

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
can if it really bothers you the color

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.170 
can if it really bothers you the color
room<00:06:17.620> you<00:06:17.830> could<00:06:17.950> probably<00:06:18.190> get<00:06:18.550> some<00:06:18.760> some

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
room you could probably get some some

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.450 
room you could probably get some some
tan<00:06:19.390> paint<00:06:19.660> and<00:06:19.900> just<00:06:20.080> you<00:06:20.380> know<00:06:20.470> cut<00:06:20.740> cover<00:06:21.370> up

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
tan paint and just you know cut cover up

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.280 
tan paint and just you know cut cover up
the<00:06:21.580> sides<00:06:21.820> again<00:06:22.390> I<00:06:22.420> just<00:06:22.540> didn't<00:06:22.900> don't<00:06:23.110> want

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
the sides again I just didn't don't want

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.650 
the sides again I just didn't don't want
to<00:06:23.380> see<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.680> screw<00:06:23.980> slots<00:06:24.610> on<00:06:25.090> this<00:06:25.420> side<00:06:25.630> of

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
to see the screw slots on this side of

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:31.290 
to see the screw slots on this side of
the<00:06:25.980> divisor<00:06:26.980> so<00:06:29.010> again<00:06:30.010> these<00:06:30.520> things<00:06:31.180> are

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
the divisor so again these things are

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.520 
the divisor so again these things are
not<00:06:31.450> cheap<00:06:32.070> they<00:06:33.070> cost<00:06:33.310> about<00:06:34.200> $60<00:06:35.200> a<00:06:35.230> piece

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
not cheap they cost about $60 a piece

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.270 
not cheap they cost about $60 a piece
maybe<00:06:36.070> more<00:06:36.480> to<00:06:37.480> replace<00:06:37.800> is<00:06:38.800> obviously<00:06:39.190> a

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
maybe more to replace is obviously a

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.240
