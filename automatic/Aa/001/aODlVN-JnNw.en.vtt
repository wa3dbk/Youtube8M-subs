is involving lot tricks
it's<00:00:23.619> you've<00:00:24.310> got<00:00:24.430> backflips<00:00:25.410> somersaults

parkour<00:00:31.030> to<00:00:31.150> an<00:00:31.240> extent<00:00:31.570> but<00:00:31.750> you<00:00:31.810> also

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
parkour to an extent but you also

parkour to an extent but you also
involve<00:00:32.260> tricks<00:00:33.190> from<00:00:33.580> zoar<00:00:34.030> front<00:00:34.239> flips<00:00:34.480> and

involve tricks from zoar front flips and
back<00:00:34.750> flips<00:00:35.050> so<00:00:35.379> you<00:00:35.440> do<00:00:36.100> a<00:00:36.129> Kong<00:00:36.430> and<00:00:36.610> instead

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
back flips so you do a Kong and instead

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.220 
back flips so you do a Kong and instead
of<00:00:36.910> just<00:00:37.059> landed<00:00:37.390> and<00:00:37.510> doing<00:00:37.660> roll<00:00:37.870> you<00:00:38.050> might

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
of just landed and doing roll you might

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.110 
of just landed and doing roll you might
land<00:00:38.770> and<00:00:39.010> do<00:00:39.070> some<00:00:39.250> tumbling<00:00:39.460> afterwards

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
land and do some tumbling afterwards

land and do some tumbling afterwards
looks<00:00:41.080> fantastic<00:00:41.770> it's<00:00:42.040> not<00:00:42.489> what<00:00:42.640> I<00:00:42.670> do<00:00:42.790> but

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
looks fantastic it's not what I do but

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.540 
looks fantastic it's not what I do but
it's<00:00:43.540> as<00:00:43.659> valid<00:00:43.989> as<00:00:44.080> parkour

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.990

philosophical side of it and I really

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.580 
philosophical side of it and I really
enjoy<00:01:09.130> moving<00:01:09.759> different<00:01:10.630> ways<00:01:10.780> or<00:01:11.380> use

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
enjoy moving different ways or use

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.899 
enjoy moving different ways or use
parkour<00:01:11.979> for<00:01:12.159> getting<00:01:12.310> through<00:01:12.430> hanging<00:01:12.790> out

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
parkour for getting through hanging out

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.790 
parkour for getting through hanging out
because<00:01:13.509> I<00:01:13.690> know<00:01:13.750> short<00:01:14.110> of<00:01:14.229> its<00:01:14.380> fruit<00:01:14.619> and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
because I know short of its fruit and

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.950 
because I know short of its fruit and
food<00:01:15.190> in<00:01:15.790> training<00:01:16.149> here<00:01:16.300> and<00:01:16.390> I<00:01:16.420> find<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:16.780> it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
food in training here and I find it it

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.660 
food in training here and I find it it
just<00:01:17.140> becomes<00:01:17.470> part<00:01:17.649> of<00:01:17.890> my<00:01:17.979> day<00:01:18.040> I<00:01:18.190> mean<00:01:18.460> I'm

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
just becomes part of my day I mean I'm

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.280 
just becomes part of my day I mean I'm
always<00:01:18.850> looking<00:01:19.210> at<00:01:19.300> stuff<00:01:19.509> in<00:01:19.899> a<00:01:19.990> different

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
always looking at stuff in a different

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.620 
always looking at stuff in a different
way<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.560> looking<00:01:20.800> at<00:01:20.979> what<00:01:21.729> not<00:01:22.090> just<00:01:22.119> looking

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
way and looking at what not just looking

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.810 
way and looking at what not just looking
at<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.810> environment<00:01:23.050> is<00:01:23.410> somewhere<00:01:24.369> you<00:01:24.490> can

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
at the environment is somewhere you can

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.889 
at the environment is somewhere you can
through<00:01:25.030> somewhere<00:01:25.390> you<00:01:25.479> go<00:01:25.630> that's

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
through somewhere you go that's

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.870 
through somewhere you go that's
something<00:01:26.259> you<00:01:26.350> can<00:01:26.500> train<00:01:26.740> on<00:01:26.920> is<00:01:27.759> to

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
something you can train on is to

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.880 
something you can train on is to
progress<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.600> don't<00:01:28.810> see<00:01:28.960> things<00:01:29.170> as<00:01:29.500> an

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
progress you don't see things as an

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.460 
progress you don't see things as an
obstruction<00:01:30.280> any<00:01:30.610> more<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:30.970> see<00:01:31.149> the<00:01:31.179> more

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
obstruction any more you see the more

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.350 
obstruction any more you see the more
obstacle<00:01:32.470> that<00:01:32.679> you<00:01:32.800> can<00:01:32.979> get<00:01:33.100> over<00:01:33.280> or<00:01:33.970> look

obstacle that you can get over or look
at<00:01:34.929> things<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.320> think<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.710> could<00:01:35.860> get<00:01:35.950> rid<00:01:36.100> of

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
at things and think I could get rid of

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.609 
at things and think I could get rid of
that<00:01:36.310> more<00:01:36.759> efficiently<00:01:37.179> than<00:01:37.300> like<00:01:38.050> working

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
that more efficiently than like working

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.649 
that more efficiently than like working
around<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:38.979> you<00:01:39.610> get<00:01:39.789> funny<00:01:40.000> looks<00:01:40.060> of<00:01:40.360> people

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
around it you get funny looks of people

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.450 
around it you get funny looks of people
in<00:01:40.720> you<00:01:40.780> drop<00:01:40.960> off<00:01:41.110> bogeys<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.770> stuff<00:01:42.039> next<00:01:42.250> to

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
in you drop off bogeys and stuff next to

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.490 
in you drop off bogeys and stuff next to
me<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.640> bus<00:01:42.820> stops<00:01:43.119> but<00:01:43.570> like<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.259> do<00:01:44.409> it

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
me the bus stops but like and you do it

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.050 
me the bus stops but like and you do it
as<00:01:44.560> partly<00:01:44.800> life<00:01:45.009> so<00:01:45.190> you're<00:01:45.640> not<00:01:45.729> doing<00:01:45.880> it<00:01:46.000> as

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
as partly life so you're not doing it as

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
as partly life so you're not doing it as
a<00:01:46.090> bit<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.330> training<00:01:46.539> during<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.869> day<00:01:46.960> and
