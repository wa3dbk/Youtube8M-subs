00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.230
 weapon system officer tornado on this 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.860
 planes train the students in 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.530
 pensacola naval air station in pensacola 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.670
 Florida around for the tornado fighter plane 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.320
 to be fit 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.200
 the air force is training theirs here 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.360
 budding weapons system officer only on 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.980
 a propeller machine later on one 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.560
 trainingscamp students learn here 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.079
 navigation deep and instrument flight 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.829
 later the monika came and came 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.390
 bomb throw in addition to major tino ranch 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.249
 is part of the second german education 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.379
 season in pensacola which the 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:42.489
 budding weapons system officer here at 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.350
 supported 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.030
 He will give us the two training 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.030
 aircraft bring something more 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.450
 to be here now before the t6 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.620
 alpha in the background of me that's it 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.660
 Training plane on the our 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.890
 weapon systems officers the first part 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.230
 complete the training 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.060
 this is a training plane of the us 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.210
 navy on the German Luftwaffe 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.220
 trained because the German air force to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.200
 few weapons system officer trains 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.640
 as what would that be worthwhile itself 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.100
 to buy planes yourself 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.890
 the c6 alpha is good for one 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.880
 speed range of 115 150 to 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.500
 250 knots 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.930
 is a propeller plane is using 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.479
 profile driven and is pretty good around 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.039
 the student first slowly to the 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.810
 introduce general flies 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.500
 then we move ahead 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.390
 plane fuselage and look back in 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.460
 the inner cockpit purely though the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.640
 students the first six months of their 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.490
 spend training 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.360
 which in sum so between 50 and 60 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.360
 are flying hours 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.310
 then here is the training place in 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.580
 plane itself our weapon systems 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.570
 officers of our students 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.850
 equipped with digital displays 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.360
 satellite navigation and so on 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.940
 our students slowly to the tasks 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.770
 in the cockpit before you 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.149
 then later on to the next 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.280
 change aircraft pattern 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.180
 then a speed band of 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.739
 cover about 250 miles to 350 450 x 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.640
 and that is hangar in the other one 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.640
 t5 to give up 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.450
 after just looking at t6 alpha 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.460
 we are now with the propeller 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.200
 here on the slightly faster 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.080
 plane maker airplane that is the 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.990
 deep 40 c like charlie a big chance 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.580
 so to speak the navy then used around 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.310
 The speed range in the stables 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.590
 to be covered within the framework of the training 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.480
 the airplane itself is also one 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.860
 Tandem cockpit has a modified 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.510
 chassis so that for the 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.910
 Aircraft carrier can be used on 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.690
 she is used to training and is 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.350
 equipped with a jet engine 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.720
 The engine itself is simply explained 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.210
 Rhine's airspace is filled with gasoline 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.400
 mixed a spark supplied explosion 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.300
 creates pressure in the back of the plane 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.800
 moves forward 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.120
 then we go up and look 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.010
 us the workplace is 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.470
 why schÃ¼lers in the context of his 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.870
 last training about three quarters of a year 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.010
 about 80 hours of flight 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.780
 almir something behind 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.049
 modified equipped comparison 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.640
 to the c6 alpha has color displays on those 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.000
 I let myself be a cyclist 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.860
 can 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.049
 I also like that one 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.959
 navigation can only operate 150 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.430
 up to 250 knots faster than six 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.200
 easy 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.269
 after the students are done with it 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.890
 they are certified as 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.020
 weapon systems officer 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.300
 and then from here to mexico 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.020
 sent there the education on the 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.780
 tornado at the beginning in another 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.340
 to see pensacola video 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.500
 cultural differences as German 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.600
 soldier on an american 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.810
 it's different in America than it is 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.810
 in Germany
