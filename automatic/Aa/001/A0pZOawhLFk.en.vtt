00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.930
 Y 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.300
 hello everyone this is another video about 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.009
 Terrarium update of force 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.299
 coral in the last video I think that since 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.490
 you saw who is left to take the 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.440
 polyurethane we have already put it good 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.440
 we have fallen short we have to buy 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:19.340
 another polyurethane foam boat 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.920
 and we have thrown the foam here 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.430
 also this we still remain in doubt not 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.670
 we know if we are going to take more we are missing 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.340
 cut what is clear over here and 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.920
 we have cut a bit through the opening 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.280
 of the national and is supposed to come in 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.040
 also for backwards you see joins by 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.040
 here and they enter like this 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.640
 we have also thrown the foam 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.170
 without the roof of the cave we want to make 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.330
 everything with the coconut 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.220
 it's a route and these are groups here 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.970
 we see that also a braked branch 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.970
 there is another stone and this to see if I do 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.000
 and that's where we want to put a 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.149
 little plant 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.050
 click on this I'm going to put a little 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.050
 neat beast 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.340
 good if it would be better suited for that 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.210
 not this the bible 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.890
 I do not want to force it 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:28.800
 here the glass is supposed to go 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:34.460
 and so decide 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.750
 and good helping pretty well but 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.490
 after throwing the foam as 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.060
 It swells a lot because you have to cut back 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.810
 the remaining uni here as you see also 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.090
 the world short truly 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:53.550
 If it did not fit and well , all the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.720
 way not to execute where you are already 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.170
 also that's what I told you 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.220
 throw more polyurethane foam for 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.530
 complete where we have fallen short 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.440
 as there 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.200
 but the following is already taking shape 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.990
 it's also going to be to put again the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.850
 ceiling that goes here 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.920
 the other heel enter the silicone 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.880
 in the boards how they are taught in the 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.900
 sparkly 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.330
 here it looks a bit that it does not work for us but 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.330
 I say it here also has silicone 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.400
 and that is gradually becoming a 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.120
 way your achievement is instead of painting 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.110
 let's throw him like 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.110
 you will see 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.579
 also this is short we leave it here and 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.579
 which also moves one 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.270
 foam chicken there
