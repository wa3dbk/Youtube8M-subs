00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.900
 hello hi de lyon I hope you are 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.730
 pretty good and good we are in a 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.440
 new video is a tutorial because many 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.030
 I have been asking and although 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.660
 I tell them that there is already a video of 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.400
 I still do not know how I do not know 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.929
 what happens but it's a tutorial 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.210
 comment on the hunger games' post 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.619
 that lately he was playing a 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.289
 little bit more together here I have many 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.750
 servers and good how is it done 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.410
 we give you here in play is very simple 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.140
 add them to the ip's of the servers and 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.070
 we would give in the edit part to 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.719
 edit it 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.870
 you will see that right next to edith 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.899
 came out one that says external we would give 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:45.549
 there and here and server name can not be 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:47.739
 put him to not be hunger of hunger games and in 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:49.059
 ip longer it is that I got them 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.920
 say for example by twitter or by 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:57.400
 facebook I do not know an example is 1 point axis 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.100
 lbs g point net 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.450
 we give you where he commonly ports 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.700
 it is always this so there is no 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.740
 problem we are going to add server and 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.630
 as you can see here is just and 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.510
 if I want to enter I do not know if right now and 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.400
 space to enter this server is 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.710
 add generating world locating the 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.290
 server if there is space then what 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.850
 would start to generate although I do not think 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.370
 There is space 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.190
 If there is no, there is no, there is no fast now, no 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.680
 appear not then will not concentrate 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.270
 this aversion this if you want to load and 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.520
 as you can see it is also loading 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.310
 just and as you can see I have a 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.780
 texture that is about dragon lights and 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.630
 also if you want to download it 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.880
 abajito in the description of this video 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.570
 them there is where they can 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.920
 download it too soon I think that 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.229
 also upload a video where they can 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.060
 download blog launcher and if not all 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.440
 forms will be a link to the same in the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.110
 description where you can download it 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.020
 to put what they are 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.180
 the textures and also in the description 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.840
 there is a tutorial on how to put the same 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.340
 textures has been this is how one can 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.920
 enter the game servers 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.600

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.210

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.430
 everyone seems to know me 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.920
 lighting gives me you can not yes 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.110
