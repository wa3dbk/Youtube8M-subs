00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
bras are no different what I like about

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.410 
bras are no different what I like about
these<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.399> they<00:01:44.399> they<00:01:44.820> cover<00:01:45.180> you

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
these is that they they cover you

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.639 
these is that they they cover you
completely<00:01:46.140> they<00:01:46.979> cover<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.649> they're

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
completely they cover you and they're

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.460 
completely they cover you and they're
made<00:01:49.920> very<00:01:50.340> sturdily<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.659> there's<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.079> tiny

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
made very sturdily and there's a tiny

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.100 
made very sturdily and there's a tiny
bit<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.860> padding<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.340> these<00:01:53.549> not<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> lot<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
bit of padding in these not a lot just a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.560 
bit of padding in these not a lot just a
little<00:01:55.350> bit<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:56.100> reason<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
little bit the reason that I like the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.740 
little bit the reason that I like the
padding<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.170> because<00:01:58.880> sports<00:01:59.880> bras<00:02:00.180> tend<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
padding is because sports bras tend to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.770 
padding is because sports bras tend to

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.090 
now which is fine I'm totally okay with
that<00:02:06.690> but<00:02:07.020> when<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.230> wear<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.500> sports<00:02:07.800> bra<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
little bit of confidence at least in my

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.430 
little bit of confidence at least in my
case<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.520> does<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.780> other<00:02:24.990> thing<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.320> like

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
case it does the other thing I like

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.600 
case it does the other thing I like
about<00:02:25.470> these<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.160> they<00:02:26.340> have<00:02:26.490> an

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
about these is that they have an

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.210 
about these is that they have an
underwire<00:02:27.650> for<00:02:28.650> support

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
underwire for support

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.470 
underwire for support
I<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.970> underwires<00:02:30.480> they<00:02:31.470> also<00:02:31.709> have<00:02:32.040> a

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
I like underwires they also have a

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.580 
I like underwires they also have a
version<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.050> does<00:02:34.230> not<00:02:34.350> have<00:02:34.500> an

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
version of this that does not have an

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.320 
version of this that does not have an
underwire<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.550> if<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.730> don't<00:02:35.880> like<00:02:35.940> underwire

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
underwire so if you don't like underwire

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.449 
underwire so if you don't like underwire
is<00:02:36.540> they<00:02:36.959> have<00:02:37.140> versions<00:02:37.800> for<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.160> as<00:02:38.280> well

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
is they have versions for you as well

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.330 
is they have versions for you as well
but<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.300> like<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.600> underwire<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.920> support

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
but I like the underwire and the support

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.000 
but I like the underwire and the support
I<00:02:41.610> can<00:02:42.090> do<00:02:42.500> really<00:02:43.500> high<00:02:43.830> intense<00:02:45.739> training<00:02:46.739> I

I can do really high intense training I

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.860 
I can do really high intense training I
guess<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.310> would<00:02:47.430> say<00:02:47.640> high<00:02:48.150> intense<00:02:48.480> running

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
guess you would say high intense running

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.900 
guess you would say high intense running
running<00:02:49.470> really<00:02:49.680> fast<00:02:49.800> jumping<00:02:50.580> up<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.820> down

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
large-chested but just by feeling this

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.620 
large-chested but just by feeling this
bra<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.050> how<00:03:04.650> it's<00:03:04.800> made<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.239> my<00:03:06.239> experience

with<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:07.080> would<00:03:07.320> say<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.620> women<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.750> variety

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
with it I would say that women a variety

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.590 
with it I would say that women a variety
of<00:03:09.780> sizes<00:03:10.220> would<00:03:11.220> actually<00:03:12.090> benefit<00:03:12.420> from

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
of sizes would actually benefit from

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.830 
of sizes would actually benefit from
this<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.769> for<00:03:14.070> high<00:03:14.760> intense<00:03:15.090> activities

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
this it is for high intense activities

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.530 
this it is for high intense activities
and<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.590> works<00:03:16.739> very<00:03:16.830> well<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.580> other<00:03:18.209> thing<00:03:18.480> I

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
and it works very well the other thing I

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.300 
and it works very well the other thing I
like<00:03:18.690> about<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.380> print<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.010> comes<00:03:20.160> in<00:03:20.250> a

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
like about it is the print it comes in a

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.039 
like about it is the print it comes in a
variety<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.640> prints<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.330> is<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.510> really<00:03:21.870> cute

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
variety of prints this is a really cute

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.350 
variety of prints this is a really cute
floral<00:03:22.290> print<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:23.340> course<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.670> have<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.850> the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
floral print of course I have the the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.080 
floral print of course I have the the
hot<00:03:24.540> pink<00:03:24.720> as<00:03:24.900> well<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.590> only<00:03:25.830> con<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.610> would

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
hot pink as well the only con I would

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.170 
hot pink as well the only con I would
list<00:03:27.959> for<00:03:28.769> these<00:03:28.920> is<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.310> price<00:03:29.549> they<00:03:29.760> are<00:03:29.790> on

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
list for these is the price they are on

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.920 
list for these is the price they are on
the<00:03:30.420> pricey<00:03:30.750> side<00:03:31.340> not<00:03:32.360> crazy<00:03:33.360> sins<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.870> I

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
the pricey side not crazy sins and I

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.979 
the pricey side not crazy sins and I
think<00:03:34.200> they<00:03:34.320> probably<00:03:34.470> raise<00:03:34.920> between<00:03:35.310> 45<00:03:35.790> and

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
think they probably raise between 45 and

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.259 
think they probably raise between 45 and
55<00:03:36.989> dollars<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.350> piece<00:03:37.709> but<00:03:38.670> when<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.090> consider

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
55 dollars a piece but when you consider

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.020 
55 dollars a piece but when you consider
how<00:03:39.870> long<00:03:40.200> Victoria's<00:03:41.190> Secret<00:03:41.459> products<00:03:41.790> last

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
how long Victoria's Secret products last

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.610 
how long Victoria's Secret products last
and<00:03:42.390> how<00:03:42.480> well<00:03:42.690> these<00:03:42.810> are<00:03:42.989> made<00:03:43.200> it's

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
and how well these are made it's

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.160 
and how well these are made it's
probably<00:03:44.160> worth<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.730> as<00:03:45.060> in<00:03:45.450> my<00:03:45.570> case<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.989> was

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
probably worth it as in my case it was

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.600 
probably worth it as in my case it was
since<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.650> went<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:46.980> bought<00:03:47.160> one<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.430> these

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
since I went and bought one of these
