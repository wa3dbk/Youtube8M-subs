coming<00:02:37.160> up<00:02:37.250> for<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.459> came<00:02:37.940> out<00:02:38.150> for<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:38.629> that

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
coming up for it came out for it so that

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.930 
coming up for it came out for it so that
was<00:02:39.200> in<00:02:39.500> fact<00:02:39.680> real<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.489> could<00:02:40.670> believe

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
was in fact real you could believe

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.850 
was in fact real you could believe
something<00:02:41.239> like<00:02:41.269> that<00:02:41.569> but<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:41.989> is<00:02:42.290> fake<00:02:42.500> so
