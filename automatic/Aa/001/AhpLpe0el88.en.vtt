again<00:04:45.570> i<00:04:45.780> think<00:04:46.140> it<00:04:46.440> just<00:04:46.620> said<00:04:46.920> when<00:04:47.130> they

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
again i think it just said when they

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.860 
again i think it just said when they
actually<00:04:47.370> dies<00:04:47.670> they<00:04:47.940> animation<00:04:48.450> it<00:04:48.570> kind<00:04:48.810> of

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
actually dies they animation it kind of

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.410 
actually dies they animation it kind of
stays<00:04:49.320> hour<00:04:49.710> delays<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.340> bit<00:04:50.670> so<00:04:50.940> that's<00:04:51.210> why

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
stays hour delays a bit so that's why

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.050 
stays hour delays a bit so that's why
you<00:04:51.480> can<00:04:52.080> see<00:04:52.380> they<00:04:53.280> saw<00:04:53.490> it<00:04:53.550> on<00:04:53.730> the<00:04:53.760> floor

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060
