00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.080
 until 1994 the government refused to recognize the existence of a base 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.080
 super secret known as Area 51 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.079
 6 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.890
 but in August of that year former lapa employees secret air 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.589
 file a complaint that obliges the Ministry of Defense to change its 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.900
 politics 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.140
 in the lawsuit it is stated that the workers had received the order 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.779
 of incinerating toxic material from the extensive hayter program 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.860
 in open wells at the base something that had caused them serious diseases 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.110
 and in some cases death good memories when they went to the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.920
 courts, the government used all the instruments at its disposal to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.920
 cover the case couso 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.840
 government lawyers argue that public disclosure of any 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.410
 information about the case would pose a threat to national security 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.710
 but critics believe that security measures have gone too far 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.410
 if that occurs a situation that has nothing to do with what could 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.380
 be the silence around a secret spacecraft project the government does not 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.510
 only refuses to assume its responsibility but seeks to annul 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.680
 the whole case and does not give any information about what is 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 happening there 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.970
 After one year 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.480
 the government manages to stop the demand 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.620
 but the case forces the pentagon to admit that there are some facilities 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.140
 operational near crumb law finally recognizing the existence 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.140
 of area 51 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.460
 he forced them to put the cards face up they had to admit that 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.100
 there were some facilities as they said that but there was a change already 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
 they could not deny the evidence 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.400
 those who pressed to find out the truth around area 51 began to 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.760
 ask more questions 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.920
 among them how the government had managed to finance a non-existent base 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.930
 for almost four decades 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.980
 the answer was in the so-called reserved funds 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.500
 the reserved funds or those used to finance things like 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.760
 area 51 another instance so as not to have to reveal specific details of what 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.760
 it is done there differently 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.479
 that is to say from the 2 billion euros in a program and this one fails 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.599
 there is a transparent financing program, the public is thrown out 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.059
 over but if it's with reserved funds the inmates go 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:31.489
 clear and concise for people from 51 countries 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.620
 the symbol of the abuses committed by a group of high military Jorge 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.239
 gonzÃ¡lez st 10 'the secrecy would have been assassinated enzo since not only 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.200
 If he did not know and knew that his representatives did not know either 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.540
 that's the party that commits all kinds of irregularities 26 9 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:55.869
 saved 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:59.859
 activists how to get there they never consider themselves guardians 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.499
 determined to limit the power of such irregularities 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.779
 hodgson what we are trying to achieve is that the powers be honest as 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.779
 technique that abuse their physical secrecy and 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.519
 tarno said that his attempts to make the government honest have been valid 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.649
 a few clashes 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:25.819
 in February 2003 he armed reported on his website that the government will use 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.979
 illegal location sensors etc in public territory around the 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:31.889
 military base 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.599
 four months later armed he claims to have received a threatening call 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.109
 of the fb and 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.869
 in denver and they made it very clear that he was serious if ortiz and they did not stop 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:44.869
 very bad things would happen 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:50.699
 but he says he refused to give up controlling activities in area 51 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.699
 bob las ars is reaffirmed in his disturbing statements that the 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.699
 government hides a spaceship in area 51 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.290
 We can not prove these things 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.500
 he can not prove what he says he saw it would show that he did not 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.729
 Yesterday 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:14.919
 the room states that the government has done everything possible to annul its history and 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.419
 discredit the mayor 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.650
 among other things delete his name from all his previous works and his 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.580
 academic records 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.589
 There was also a concerted effort to eliminate him on my wall creatively 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:32.009
 eliminated and gone and everything I've done we're going to get this starts at 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.210
 sound like a movie about conspiracy 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.720
 things may be like this but I do not know who pulls the strings for 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.720
 I even know who is in aluminum girls may date 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.660
 the room insists that it still works to get evidence to corroborate what 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.249
 what do they say 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:57.900
 it's something I'm going to keep trying yesterday tepco does not choose between that could 

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:59.419
 corroborate what all 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.010
 nawaz without buts or conditions she played and I'm willing to prove it 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.330
 to date lazar has not provided definitive evidence 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.639
 the history channel sent the army of the air a request for an interview in 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.320
 around area 51 but that request was denied 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.979
 the air army maintains that all operations there are classified 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:33.209
 since the 1994 lawsuit the president of the united states has renewed the 

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:37.939
 Top secret status of area 51 with what criticisms and conjectures 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.590
 continue 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:47.009
 shoemaker of course there are things that should be kept secret and there but 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.719
 that a whole area is an unknown is something that scares many citizens 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.689
 spokesmen 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:56.509
 for many the questions continue 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.619
 represents the area 51 the cutting edge of air technology 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:05.240
 or perhaps investigates the most innovative technology 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.419
 else 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.620
 as the years go by and he does not know when some of these things is time 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.610
 that this place is an increasingly important focus of interest you do not know what 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.919
 that tennis can come out is the question that always sergio rosemary 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:24.980
 we all want to know where we came from and what we do here 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.210
 however for certain people this is almost like a religion 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.050
 this 16 of the way of life abroad will surely have been there 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.639
 long before us almunia maybe area 51 stop the answer some 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:41.599
 of these questions these lawyers things uu 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.680
 the program that we have presented to you offers a series of theories about a 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.710
 historical fact wrapped in mystery 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.450
 contains recordings of archive reconstructions and dramatizations that 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.729
 invite the viewer to draw their own conclusions
