00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.710
 hello shale and is present 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.960
 in languages â€‹â€‹to kill the system 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.449
 the cellar with nicolas of channel he will us 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.679
 introduce the new mayor 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.869
 hello in the horizon with the new 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.999
 Channel mark muller the first vehicle 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.239
 totally sport the dedicate this market the 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:35.130
 dollar so a nice feature 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.750
 we have the engine but here it is the most 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.520
 powerful side-by-side industry 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.280
 for the moment with his five horses 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.149
 so a good 15 % more than the competitor 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.809
 the closest 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.000
 we left to arrive at 100 hp east 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.430
 roughly speaking with the same material as 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.890
 found in our mountain bike increase 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.050
 power with an increase the flow 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.789
 of air that will be the engine one also 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.870
 increase the compression ratio change 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.870
 intake and outlet valves 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.730
 in terms of suspension 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.830
 we have here 14 pose of deflection to 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.979
 the front and back at the front one 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.180
 uses a double arm system with 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.040
 a geometry that is modified by 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.799
 compared to that of the commander for price 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.259
 for pride feeling on the handlebar that is 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:24.299
 lighter at the back we use our 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.130
 grant called line which is 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.020
 actually one against a situation at five 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.610
 jackpot but a more compact version 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.070
 comparatively what except presently 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.159
 on the market with the benefits of having 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.530
 no change of parallelism very 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.950
 very little shifting the weakest in 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.049
 done and no change of kemble by 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.939
 give an explanation to ice and 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.850
 unsuspended weight level the pole 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.289
 suspended the weakest given the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.509
 compact version compared to 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.090
 two other competition system on the 3rd 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.950
 April to 5 arms of competitors at 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.180
 level of ergonomics inside this 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.780
 wine found in the commander 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.090
 so with the the passenger position which 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.340
 is adjustable back forward as well as the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.109
 height guide that is adjustable and 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.180
 then at the back we find the same 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.979
 arm found on our vtt with the 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.710
 task system the quick accessory 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.030
 the link so the majority whose 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.610
 creation is incompatible for this 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.450
 vehicle 6 also and then from a point 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.400
 of view 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.680
 models available here we have the version 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.050
 is also a basic model which 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.379
 distinguishes the x ars version of the version 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.480
 basic 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.459
 we are talking about the list of dampers or 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.620
 four points which are the new 2.5 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.569
 inches in diameter of fox so 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.260
 completely adjustable in compression 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:41.489
 speed bounce at report level 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.040
 at the level where we have wheels here at 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.599
 income rings or bides the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.459
 functional so not just for the 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.730
 look here the other technical elements 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.400
 give the coloring the frame and the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.170
 handlebars and the seats that are other 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.010
 play against 9 on the whole ex 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.519
 compared to the model 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.450
 so big thank you nicolas baumard and 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.450
 so 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.490
 no 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.830
