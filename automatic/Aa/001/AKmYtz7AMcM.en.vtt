tinted moisturizer into my skin instead

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.140 
tinted moisturizer into my skin instead
of<00:02:52.680> circle<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.770> motion<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.930> rubbing<00:02:55.930> off<00:02:56.080> the

of circle of motion and rubbing off the
moisturizer<00:02:58.150> so<00:02:59.520> so<00:03:00.520> far<00:03:00.850> it<00:03:01.030> feels<00:03:01.150> really

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630

good on the skin I tend not to go for
tinted<00:03:05.350> moisturizers<00:03:05.920> because<00:03:06.100> they're

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
tinted moisturizers because they're

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.150 
moisturizer and to be quite honest this
actually<00:04:46.229> gave<00:04:46.470> me<00:04:46.710> more<00:04:46.889> than<00:04:47.010> what<00:04:47.130> I

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
actually gave me more than what I

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.960 
actually gave me more than what I
expected

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
expected

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.779 
expected
initially<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:48.960> didn't<00:04:49.349> expect<00:04:49.710> much<00:04:49.949> because<00:04:50.460> I

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
initially I didn't expect much because I

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.339 
initially I didn't expect much because I
don't<00:04:50.820> have<00:04:51.270> much<00:04:51.570> hope<00:04:51.840> with<00:04:52.139> tinted

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
don't have much hope with tinted

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.409 
don't have much hope with tinted
moisturizers<00:04:53.070> now<00:04:53.610> I<00:04:53.639> need<00:04:53.940> to<00:04:54.030> look<00:04:54.150> for<00:04:54.210> a

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
moisturizers now I need to look for a

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.050 
moisturizers now I need to look for a
medium<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.870> full<00:04:55.080> coverage<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.680> this<00:04:56.400> gave<00:04:56.789> me

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
medium to full coverage and this gave me

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.140 
medium to full coverage and this gave me
a<00:04:57.090> very<00:04:57.539> light<00:04:58.130> coverage<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.729> I<00:04:59.849> wasn't

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
a very light coverage and I wasn't

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.570 
a very light coverage and I wasn't
expecting<00:05:00.690> that<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:01.050> just<00:05:01.710> expected<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:02.400> was

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
expecting that I just expected I was

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.710 
expecting that I just expected I was
just<00:05:02.820> kind<00:05:03.000> of<00:05:03.060> looking<00:05:03.300> forward<00:05:03.720> to<00:05:03.930> a<00:05:03.960> more

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
before and after my skin was completely

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.500 
before and after my skin was completely
even<00:05:13.199> um<00:05:13.729> coverage<00:05:14.729> is<00:05:14.880> not<00:05:15.000> that<00:05:15.240> great

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
even um coverage is not that great

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.420 
even um coverage is not that great
obviously<00:05:16.169> it's<00:05:16.349> a<00:05:16.409> tinted<00:05:16.710> moisturizer<00:05:16.949> so

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
obviously it's a tinted moisturizer so

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.850 
obviously it's a tinted moisturizer so
I'm<00:05:17.550> not<00:05:17.669> gonna<00:05:17.849> say

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
I'm not gonna say

it<00:05:19.490> gives<00:05:19.940> great<00:05:20.060> coverage<00:05:20.300> but<00:05:20.930> very<00:05:21.259> light

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
it gives great coverage but very light

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.860 
it gives great coverage but very light
on<00:05:22.039> the<00:05:22.099> skin<00:05:22.220> which<00:05:22.909> is<00:05:22.940> amazing<00:05:23.569> I<00:05:23.750> don't

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
on the skin which is amazing I don't

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.080

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
have acne marks seeping through but

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.980 
have acne marks seeping through but
that's<00:05:36.889> okay<00:05:37.430> because<00:05:37.460> my<00:05:38.030> skin<00:05:38.389> is<00:05:38.449> breathing

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
and I kind of want that nowadays because

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.659 
and I kind of want that nowadays because
I<00:05:41.930> feel<00:05:42.289> like<00:05:42.409> my<00:05:42.530> foundations<00:05:43.039> are<00:05:43.250> just<00:05:43.460> too
