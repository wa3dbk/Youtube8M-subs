00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
to use heel-toe because it means there's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.899 
to use heel-toe because it means there's
less<00:02:02.119> of<00:02:03.049> your<00:02:03.259> foot<00:02:03.530> touching<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.009> ground<00:02:04.220> at

where to step but if I'm just gonna look
regularly<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.770> air<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.400> dirt<00:02:50.550> it'll

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
regularly in the air in this dirt it'll

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.150 
regularly in the air in this dirt it'll
be<00:02:50.940> kind<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.420> quiet<00:02:51.600> but<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.140> will<00:02:52.290> be<00:02:52.620> anywhere

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
be kind of quiet but it will be anywhere

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.699 
be kind of quiet but it will be anywhere
near<00:02:53.310> as<00:02:53.400> quiet<00:02:53.670> as<00:02:54.080> when<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.110> did<00:02:55.350> heel<00:02:55.470> -<00:02:55.590> I'll

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
near as quiet as when I did heel - I'll

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.370 
near as quiet as when I did heel - I'll
walk<00:02:55.830> just<00:02:56.100> as<00:02:56.250> slowly<00:02:56.550> as<00:02:57.360> before<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:57.989> I'll

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
walk just as slowly as before so I'll

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.840

one right there

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.110 
one right there
I'll<00:04:10.670> go<00:04:10.760> ahead<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.000> step<00:04:11.150> on<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.540> heel-toe

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.640 

then<00:04:17.120> I'm<00:04:17.239> putting<00:04:17.450> all<00:04:17.660> my<00:04:17.690> weight<00:04:17.810> on<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:18.200> and

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
then I'm putting all my weight on it and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.830 
then I'm putting all my weight on it and
it's<00:04:19.430> not<00:04:19.549> snapping<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:20.180> snapped<00:04:20.419> just<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.630> tiny

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
it's not snapping it snapped just a tiny

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.990 
it's not snapping it snapped just a tiny
bit<00:04:21.080> but<00:04:21.320> there's<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.530> lot<00:04:21.709> less<00:04:22.070> it<00:04:22.640> was<00:04:22.790> a<00:04:22.850> lot

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
bit but there's a lot less it was a lot

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.360 
bit but there's a lot less it was a lot
less<00:04:23.300> rapid<00:04:23.840> so<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.080> made<00:04:24.229> a<00:04:24.260> lot<00:04:24.350> less<00:04:25.130> noise

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
less rapid so it made a lot less noise

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.200 
less rapid so it made a lot less noise
it<00:04:25.910> was<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.090> slow<00:04:26.479> kind<00:04:26.870> of<00:04:26.960> snap<00:04:27.680> so<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.400> made<00:04:29.180> a

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
it was a slow kind of snap so it made a

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.800 
it was a slow kind of snap so it made a
lot<00:04:29.270> less<00:04:29.510> noise<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:30.800> walking<00:04:31.610> Kyoto<00:04:32.300> matters

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
lot less noise so walking Kyoto matters

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.409 
lot less noise so walking Kyoto matters
but<00:04:33.169> were<00:04:33.290> you<00:04:33.350> but<00:04:34.280> ultimately<00:04:34.400> where<00:04:35.240> you

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
but were you but ultimately where you

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.240 
but were you but ultimately where you
step<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.870> what's<00:04:36.080> most<00:04:36.200> important<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.830> really

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
step is what's most important and really

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.250 
step is what's most important and really
like<00:04:41.090> I<00:04:41.180> said<00:04:41.210> before<00:04:41.450> you<00:04:41.900> don't<00:04:42.050> have<00:04:42.169> to

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
like I said before you don't have to

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.500 
like I said before you don't have to
worry<00:04:42.410> about<00:04:42.640> stepping<00:04:43.640> walking<00:04:44.210> like<00:04:44.330> this

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
worry about stepping walking like this

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.230 
worry about stepping walking like this
you<00:04:45.020> know<00:04:45.140> unless<00:04:45.620> you're<00:04:46.090> if<00:04:47.090> you're

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
you know unless you're if you're

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.580 
you know unless you're if you're
stalking<00:04:47.450> I<00:04:47.900> would<00:04:48.140> say<00:04:49.450> no<00:04:50.450> one's<00:04:50.660> gonna<00:04:51.140> hear

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
stalking I would say no one's gonna hear

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.370 
stalking I would say no one's gonna hear
you<00:04:52.330> really<00:04:53.330> it's<00:04:53.540> not<00:04:53.630> really<00:04:53.690> gonna<00:04:54.200> matter

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
you really it's not really gonna matter

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:01.540 
you really it's not really gonna matter
how<00:04:54.650> you<00:04:54.710> step<00:04:55.630> from<00:04:58.870> 20<00:04:59.870> yards<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.590> 15<00:05:01.370> yards

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
how you step from 20 yards to 15 yards

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.570 
how you step from 20 yards to 15 yards
and<00:05:01.970> then<00:05:02.390> when<00:05:02.479> you<00:05:02.570> get<00:05:02.720> that<00:05:03.050> close<00:05:03.580> then

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
and then when you get that close then

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.010 
and then when you get that close then
you<00:05:04.790> better<00:05:04.970> start<00:05:05.330> making<00:05:05.570> sure<00:05:05.900> you're

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
you better start making sure you're

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.540 
you better start making sure you're
doing<00:05:06.080> heel<00:05:06.380> toe<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.830> whole<00:05:06.950> time<00:05:07.160> always

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
doing heel toe and the whole time always

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.070 
doing heel toe and the whole time always
make<00:05:07.910> no<00:05:08.120> matter<00:05:08.210> what<00:05:08.479> make<00:05:08.690> sure<00:05:08.870> you<00:05:08.960> don't

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
make no matter what make sure you don't

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.150 
make no matter what make sure you don't
step<00:05:09.860> on<00:05:10.570> sticks<00:05:11.570> dead<00:05:12.050> leaves<00:05:12.290> and<00:05:12.530> even<00:05:13.040> if

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
step on sticks dead leaves and even if

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.620 
step on sticks dead leaves and even if
you're<00:05:13.280> just<00:05:13.310> in<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:13.520> woods<00:05:13.669> doing<00:05:14.180> nothing

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
you're just in the woods doing nothing

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.469 
you're just in the woods doing nothing
just<00:05:14.810> walking<00:05:15.050> around<00:05:15.200> for<00:05:15.290> fun<00:05:15.440> try<00:05:15.919> to<00:05:15.979> just

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
just walking around for fun try to just

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.240 
just walking around for fun try to just
learn<00:05:17.479> to<00:05:17.900> automatically<00:05:18.710> look<00:05:19.039> where<00:05:19.190> you

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
learn to automatically look where you

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.500 
learn to automatically look where you
step<00:05:19.520> that's<00:05:19.880> what<00:05:20.030> I've<00:05:20.120> actually<00:05:20.240> learned

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
step that's what I've actually learned

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.210 
step that's what I've actually learned
to<00:05:20.570> do<00:05:20.720> sort<00:05:21.020> of<00:05:21.169> when<00:05:21.500> I<00:05:21.530> look<00:05:21.770> welcome<00:05:22.160> the

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
to do sort of when I look welcome the

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.460 
to do sort of when I look welcome the
woods<00:05:22.370> more<00:05:22.789> I<00:05:23.030> usually<00:05:23.479> just

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
woods more I usually just

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.370 
woods more I usually just
heel-toe<00:05:24.710> in<00:05:25.550> the<00:05:26.270> woods<00:05:26.480> but<00:05:26.780> I<00:05:27.020> really<00:05:27.230> need

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
heel-toe in the woods but I really need

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.440 
heel-toe in the woods but I really need
to<00:05:27.410> start<00:05:27.620> learning<00:05:28.040> how<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.190> I<00:05:28.670> hate<00:05:29.300> that

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
to start learning how to I hate that

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.690 
to start learning how to I hate that
mosquito<00:05:29.810> I'm<00:05:30.560> really<00:05:30.830> gonna<00:05:31.040> start<00:05:31.370> learning

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
mosquito I'm really gonna start learning

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.690 
mosquito I'm really gonna start learning
how<00:05:31.730> to<00:05:32.140> look<00:05:33.140> like<00:05:33.410> look<00:05:33.770> where<00:05:33.980> I<00:05:34.010> walk<00:05:34.310> or

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
how to look like look where I walk or

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.640 
how to look like look where I walk or
look<00:05:34.910> why<00:05:35.060> step<00:05:35.390> before<00:05:35.630> I<00:05:35.840> do<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.200> just

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
look why step before I do it just

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.010 
look why step before I do it just
because<00:05:36.950> it'll<00:05:37.340> be<00:05:37.460> good<00:05:37.610> to<00:05:37.850> make<00:05:38.570> a<00:05:38.600> habit<00:05:38.990> of

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
because it'll be good to make a habit of

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.430 
because it'll be good to make a habit of
so<00:05:39.830> then<00:05:40.070> when<00:05:40.820> you<00:05:40.850> get<00:05:41.000> closer<00:05:41.240> to<00:05:41.420> 15<00:05:41.990> yards

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
so then when you get closer to 15 yards

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.250 
so then when you get closer to 15 yards
to<00:05:42.740> you<00:05:43.670> know<00:05:43.760> 10<00:05:44.240> yards<00:05:44.600> or<00:05:44.690> 5<00:05:44.900> yards<00:05:45.050> or

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
to you know 10 yards or 5 yards or

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.720 
to you know 10 yards or 5 yards or
whatever<00:05:45.470> you'll<00:05:46.160> want<00:05:46.370> to<00:05:46.460> walk<00:05:46.580> really

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
whatever you'll want to walk really

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.970 
whatever you'll want to walk really
slowly<00:05:47.380> if<00:05:48.380> you<00:05:48.470> want<00:05:48.620> to<00:05:48.680> walk<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.860> lace

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
slowly if you want to walk the lace

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.780 
slowly if you want to walk the lace
slowly<00:05:49.340> and<00:05:50.440> make<00:05:51.440> sure<00:05:51.650> you<00:05:52.040> looking<00:05:52.610> where

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
slowly and make sure you looking where

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.730 
slowly and make sure you looking where
you're<00:05:52.910> stepping<00:05:56.110> and<00:05:57.110> make<00:05:57.470> sure<00:05:57.620> you're

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
you're stepping and make sure you're

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.190 
you're stepping and make sure you're
always<00:05:57.830> walking<00:05:58.040> heel<00:05:58.340> toe<00:05:58.550> and<00:05:58.930> see<00:05:59.930> I<00:05:59.960> just

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
always walking heel toe and see I just

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.120 
always walking heel toe and see I just
stepped<00:06:00.350> on<00:06:00.440> that<00:06:00.500> it<00:06:00.710> didn't<00:06:00.860> really<00:06:00.950> matter

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
stepped on that it didn't really matter

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.100 
stepped on that it didn't really matter
because<00:06:01.280> I<00:06:01.700> walk<00:06:01.970> heel<00:06:02.240> toe<00:06:02.420> and<00:06:02.720> I<00:06:02.990> was

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
because I walk heel toe and I was

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.640 
because I walk heel toe and I was
careful

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
careful

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.410 
careful
it<00:06:04.250> looks<00:06:04.460> slow<00:06:04.730> that's<00:06:04.940> another<00:06:05.150> thing<00:06:05.270> it

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
it looks slow that's another thing it

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:13.570 
it looks slow that's another thing it
looks<00:06:05.630> slow<00:06:08.500> so<00:06:11.320> that's<00:06:12.320> basically<00:06:12.830> my<00:06:12.980> video

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
looks slow so that's basically my video
