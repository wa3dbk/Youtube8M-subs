00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.720 

have<00:03:04.480> some<00:03:04.659> fun<00:03:04.810> repeat<00:03:05.110> yourself<00:03:05.610> make<00:03:06.610> up

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
have some fun repeat yourself make up

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.910 
have some fun repeat yourself make up
your<00:03:06.819> little<00:03:07.000> patterns<00:03:07.390> try<00:03:07.659> it<00:03:07.720> faster<00:03:08.319> try

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
your little patterns try it faster try

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.649 
your little patterns try it faster try
it<00:03:08.980> once<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.310> get<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.609> try<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.239> in<00:03:10.329> a<00:03:10.359> faster

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
it once you get it try it in a faster

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:18.330 
it once you get it try it in a faster
beat<00:03:16.349> that's<00:03:17.349> going<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.620> lame<00:03:17.769> I<00:03:17.950> think<00:03:18.220> going

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
beat that's going to lame I think going

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:52.890 
beat that's going to lame I think going
slower<00:03:19.180> with<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.480> grue<00:03:19.659> is<00:03:19.810> more<00:03:19.989> fun<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.780> there

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
slower with a grue is more fun so there

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.509 
slower with a grue is more fun so there
