hero<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:40.790> think<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.810> gamestick<00:01:42.140> is<00:01:42.290> a<00:01:42.320> good

hero I think the gamestick is a good

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.860 
hero I think the gamestick is a good
idea<00:01:42.770> because<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.850> brings<00:01:44.030> down<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.270> cost<00:01:44.600> of

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
playing games on a television so not

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.900 
playing games on a television so not
every<00:01:47.509> game<00:01:47.750> should<00:01:48.650> be<00:01:48.680> played<00:01:48.800> on<00:01:49.250> a<00:01:49.280> four<00:01:49.759> or

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
every game should be played on a four or

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.210 
there are a lot of great games that
people<00:01:53.570> can<00:01:53.810> play<00:01:53.930> on<00:01:54.080> their<00:01:54.170> television<00:01:54.380> but

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
people can play on their television but

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.650 
people can play on their television but
don't<00:01:55.460> require<00:01:55.820> all<00:01:56.090> of<00:01:56.210> that<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.540> I<00:01:56.630> think

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
don't require all of that and I think

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.440 
don't require all of that and I think
the<00:01:56.930> game<00:01:57.110> sleep<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.880> perfect<00:01:59.270> product

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
the game sleep is is a perfect product

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.600 
the game sleep is is a perfect product
for<00:01:59.630> bringing<00:02:00.020> that<00:02:00.050> type<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.410> game<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:01.070> the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
for bringing that type of game to the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.310 
for bringing that type of game to the
mass<00:02:01.790> market<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.660> thing<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:02.960> always<00:02:02.990> think

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
mass market the thing I always think

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.560 
mass market the thing I always think
about<00:02:03.470> with<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.890> gamestick<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.550> not<00:02:05.150> only<00:02:05.300> its

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
about with the gamestick is not only its

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.240 
about with the gamestick is not only its
affordability<00:02:06.050> but<00:02:06.440> its<00:02:06.590> accessibility

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
affordability but its accessibility

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.820 
affordability but its accessibility
that's<00:02:07.729> that's<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.450> area<00:02:08.600> that<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:08.989> think<00:02:09.110> game

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
that's that's the area that I think game

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.620 
that's that's the area that I think game
developers<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.610> also<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:10.970> consumer<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.600> the
