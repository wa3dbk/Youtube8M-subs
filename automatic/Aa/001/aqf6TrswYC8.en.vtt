00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
kind of gills floor there any other bike

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.620 
kind of gills floor there any other bike
because<00:01:31.890> my<00:01:32.640> whole<00:01:32.760> background<00:01:33.000> has<00:01:33.390> been

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
because my whole background has been

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.050 
because my whole background has been
everything<00:01:34.080> bought<00:01:34.440> Harley's<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.430> started

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
everything bought Harley's I started

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.390 
everything bought Harley's I started
looking<00:01:36.270> into<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.870> history<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.440> Harley's<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
looking into the history of Harley's and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.670 
looking into the history of Harley's and
the<00:01:38.460> racing<00:01:38.880> between<00:01:39.450> Evel<00:01:39.900> Knievel<00:01:40.290> between

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
the racing between Evel Knievel between

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.380 
the racing between Evel Knievel between
all<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:40.920> flat<00:01:41.130> track<00:01:41.280> racing<00:01:41.550> and<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.030> xr7

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
all the flat track racing and the xr7

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.719 
all the flat track racing and the xr7
50s<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.170> them<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.890> got<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> lot<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> heritage

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
50s in them it's got a lot of heritage

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.960 
50s in them it's got a lot of heritage
behind<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:45.510> I<00:01:46.409> think<00:01:47.070> that's<00:01:47.430> kind<00:01:47.909> of

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
behind it and I think that's kind of

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.800 
behind it and I think that's kind of
cool<00:01:48.150> to<00:01:48.270> stand<00:01:48.450> behind<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:50.060> think<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.420> basic

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
cool to stand behind I think the basic

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.740 
cool to stand behind I think the basic
formula<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.590> good<00:01:52.770> tracker<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.750> pretty

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
formula for a good tracker is pretty

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.160 
formula for a good tracker is pretty
simple

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
simple

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.020 
simple
throw<00:01:55.680> some<00:01:55.890> shocks<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.370> there<00:01:56.580> some

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
throw some shocks on there some
