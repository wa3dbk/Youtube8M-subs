 Hu Jia as it all began it was probably 1986 when we decided to do so 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.390
 have to drive around the world and if you think about it to drive around the world 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.359
 then one also thinks about horizons over borders one wonders where 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.350
 are my limits our horizons had no limits that was for iron 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.440
 Special funds from the beginning Bossert 86 provided Coentrão 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.010
 Arnoldshain 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.300
 I know one percent where can come I had never thought with one 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.820
 Motoring around the world I am more likely to be a job accountant higher 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.570
 of music and games cards 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.900
 and then I met these people actually wanted to travel and he wanted 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.770
 driving around the world on a motorbike 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.470
 I've never sat on a motorbike so I said yes I can 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.200
 try and some years later we quit our jobs all 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.780
 ours sold nonsense from Vancouver to South America 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.280
 that was the beginning of our journey around the world, which of course was totally different 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.159
 has run out as planned it has more 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.050
 around countless Herrmann dream apartment 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.810
 Beck said the old master 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.970
 it was in the school year and we were waiting for a ship that would otherwise be in the 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.759
 Antarctica should bring at this time it comes to Erfurts based on 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.549
 and we thought well that there were some pictures and stories from the way into the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.220
 Internet 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.030
 So we had this website Christmas 1997 and as we did 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.880
 We already had a lot of e-mails with questions from people who came back 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.890
 wanted to know how we got on the way and what they know 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.610
 would have if they wanted to make a trip to Africa or South America 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.410
 8 with it 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.820
 I think the worst thing is to make a decision that was special 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.920
 Hard for me, I was at the peak of my career 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.759
 then to decide year off is hard 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:16.369
 SC Freiburg also be one must set a time at which one drives off 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.609
 for example, peasant on 11 in April I go off there 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.180
 with the postponement has no sense 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.680
 This is the most important December on the program annoyed Kemmerzell 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.619
 have in it 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.589
 You should not worry too much about not being the one 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:35.369
 has a big overview or that this is going to happen with one the most important thing 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:39.779
 the first step of Dennis g is because Union Karlsruhe can fulfill 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:41.620
 we release only one spark of the highest 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.959
 At the last moment we get the turn we know that so far that all means 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.080
 Many people have been inspired to travel when they take advantage of travel 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.320
 They tell us that we have changed their lives because they always thought 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.600
 they are crazy and their friends and relatives thought she was crazy 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.620
 Most people think "It's too dangerous" is riding a motorcycle 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.770
 dangerous because a trip is dangerous Africa and South America 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.929
 are more dangerous 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.219
 and we have always encouraged people to take the motorcycle to foreign countries 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.319
 Traveling because we know that it changes your life, that your life is not 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.349
 the same would be the questioning puppet stage as personal Bing de 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.349
 France 2 minutes per 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:53.760
 from wife Alene 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.390
 this year were more body parts for me it is just so from the 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.129
 Motorcycle itself will be fascinated by being on the road especially on the road 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.940
 which one does not know and of course it is the people on the way 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.090
 It's really important to meet people when you meet people quickly 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.200
 They are not as much about you as you are and it is exciting 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.640
 find out what people in another country are about certain things 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:17.319
 think 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:21.269
 The test has become more and more a passion to find out 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.800
 what people think about certain topics and issues 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.249
 that can

 Book tip into the dark shoes Farnerud would have made the head way 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:31.930

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.460
 nice long holidays 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.580
 If you are traveling for more than a year, something else happens as well 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.699
 You will never stop traveling even if you are at one point 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.060
 comes where you have no more money and has to go back home to work 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.310
 and to finance the next step you will not stop 1 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.890
 to be on the move yes to all the places you have not seen 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.700
 is like an addiction you will not let go of her when will she always have and 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.889

 you want to make a long-distance trip here began 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.430
 with a small 45-minute presentation 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.380
 Over the years that grew to a 5 hour lecture that was 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.650
 Of course quite exhausting but people like it and we did 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.539
 Recorded us at the 2006 meeting in England on video 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.810
 We then steamed this material and packed it on a DVD 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:52.879
 which we also sold and the 2000 pieces we did 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.370
 sold out quickly 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.710

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.419
 second is about the equipment the third part is called Gondola Coach there goes 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.600

 His and her DVD is dedicated exclusively to women 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.940
 The title is Ladies of Domains and it is the first and only one before the 

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:24.460
 which deals with what women need to know alone with a motorcycle 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.879
 On the way are Rheine Hypo driven apartments and apartments 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:30.349
 but not yet sold 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:32.250
 which paths are headed Euro 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.160
 they are actually the contents of the first three DVDs but they are from the 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.380
 Wolfe's perspective is much the same but a few points 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.220
 are especially for Mrs. Merkel what women must deal with if 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.890
 they are on the go, women should be on their own or not all that is on the way 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.330
 fourth DVD 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.370
 that is just a difference if you can hear women as women 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.750
