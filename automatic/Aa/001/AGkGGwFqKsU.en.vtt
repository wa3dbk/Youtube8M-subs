what<00:05:18.460> you're<00:05:18.640> actually<00:05:18.820> doing<00:05:19.090> is<00:05:19.900> you're

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
what you're actually doing is you're

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.700 
what you're actually doing is you're
allowing<00:05:20.560> more<00:05:20.980> room<00:05:21.280> for<00:05:22.050> the<00:05:23.050> smaller<00:05:23.440> fish

allowing more room for the smaller fish

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.980 
allowing more room for the smaller fish
to<00:05:23.770> grow<00:05:24.040> into<00:05:24.430> even<00:05:24.730> bigger<00:05:25.090> predator<00:05:25.690> and

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
to grow into even bigger predator and

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.620 
to grow into even bigger predator and
because<00:05:26.380> of<00:05:26.410> that<00:05:26.530> it's<00:05:27.010> the<00:05:27.490> simple<00:05:28.300> rule<00:05:28.480> of

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
because of that it's the simple rule of

because of that it's the simple rule of
the<00:05:28.720> Safari<00:05:29.110> where<00:05:29.440> if<00:05:29.620> you<00:05:29.770> have<00:05:29.980> a<00:05:30.220> few

been living side by side with Sam let's

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:25.170 
been living side by side with Sam let's
do<00:06:24.940> it

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
do it

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.510 
do it
but<00:06:25.450> the<00:06:25.570> reason<00:06:25.930> for<00:06:26.140> their<00:06:26.290> real<00:06:26.710> population

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
but the reason for their real population

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.150 
but the reason for their real population
explosion<00:06:28.180> is<00:06:28.360> due<00:06:28.930> to<00:06:29.170> the<00:06:29.290> damming<00:06:29.740> of<00:06:29.950> these

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
explosion is due to the damming of these

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.460 
explosion is due to the damming of these
rivers<00:06:30.610> because<00:06:30.970> Pike<00:06:31.240> what<00:06:31.750> we've<00:06:31.930> done<00:06:32.170> is

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
rivers because Pike what we've done is

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.640 
rivers because Pike what we've done is
we've<00:06:32.680> clearly<00:06:33.190> created<00:06:33.550> more<00:06:33.910> suitable

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
we've clearly created more suitable

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.050 
we've clearly created more suitable
habitats<00:06:35.650> of<00:06:35.830> spawning<00:06:36.280> grounds<00:06:36.670> for<00:06:36.790> pike

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
habitats of spawning grounds for pike

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.709 
habitats of spawning grounds for pike
minnow<00:06:37.270> over<00:06:37.780> favoring<00:06:38.290> of<00:06:38.500> salmon<00:06:38.890> and<00:06:38.980> steel

minnow over favoring of salmon and steel

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:42.439 
minnow over favoring of salmon and steel
so<00:06:40.050> you<00:06:40.139> gotta<00:06:40.379> put<00:06:40.710> that<00:06:40.889> into<00:06:41.069> a<00:06:41.610> reminder

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:42.449 
so you gotta put that into a reminder

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.179 
so you gotta put that into a reminder
before<00:06:42.599> you<00:06:43.020> actually<00:06:43.199> just<00:06:43.530> Beach<00:06:43.770> and<00:06:44.009> kill

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:44.189 
before you actually just Beach and kill

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:45.860 
before you actually just Beach and kill
these<00:06:44.370> things<00:06:44.639> because<00:06:44.969> you're<00:06:45.180> like<00:06:45.360> oh<00:06:45.569> yeah

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
these things because you're like oh yeah

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.499 
these things because you're like oh yeah
sure<00:06:46.289> they're<00:06:46.620> trash<00:06:47.039> fish<00:06:47.280> and<00:06:47.550> they<00:06:47.849> do<00:06:48.090> East

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.509 
sure they're trash fish and they do East

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.890 
sure they're trash fish and they do East
salmon<00:06:48.870> and<00:06:49.020> steelhead<00:06:49.080> and<00:06:50.210> we<00:06:51.210> tend<00:06:51.750> to

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
salmon and steelhead and we tend to

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.040 
salmon and steelhead and we tend to
blame<00:06:52.110> it<00:06:52.469> on<00:06:52.500> them<00:06:52.889> for<00:06:53.219> the<00:06:54.050> population

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
blame it on them for the population

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.409 
blame it on them for the population
decline<00:06:55.409> of<00:06:55.680> salmon<00:06:56.099> and<00:06:56.250> steelhead<00:06:56.310> but<00:06:57.060> we

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 
decline of salmon and steelhead but we

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:00.800 
decline of salmon and steelhead but we
got<00:06:57.569> a<00:06:57.599> look<00:06:57.780> at<00:06:57.900> the<00:06:57.960> real<00:06:58.259> factor<00:06:58.889> who<00:06:59.879> really

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
got a look at the real factor who really

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.629 
got a look at the real factor who really
caused<00:07:01.080> the<00:07:01.229> problem<00:07:01.680> as<00:07:01.800> if<00:07:01.949> really<00:07:02.280> the<00:07:02.430> pike

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 
caused the problem as if really the pike

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:04.339 
caused the problem as if really the pike
minnow<00:07:02.819> or<00:07:03.120> is<00:07:03.270> it<00:07:03.419> us<00:07:03.569> because<00:07:03.900> we've<00:07:04.050> dammed

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:04.349 
minnow or is it us because we've dammed

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:06.230 
minnow or is it us because we've dammed
off<00:07:04.560> this<00:07:04.710> river<00:07:04.919> we<00:07:05.189> create<00:07:05.580> a<00:07:05.610> more<00:07:05.879> suitable

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 
off this river we create a more suitable

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.089 
off this river we create a more suitable
spawning<00:07:06.599> ground<00:07:06.990> for<00:07:07.080> them<00:07:07.379> than<00:07:07.620> salmon<00:07:07.979> and

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:08.099 
spawning ground for them than salmon and

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:10.429 
spawning ground for them than salmon and
steelhead<00:07:08.189> and<00:07:08.729> we<00:07:09.419> don't<00:07:09.659> off<00:07:09.840> the<00:07:09.990> fish<00:07:10.229> for

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:10.439 
steelhead and we don't off the fish for

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:12.019 
steelhead and we don't off the fish for
pike<00:07:10.590> minnow<00:07:10.830> they're<00:07:11.189> not<00:07:11.400> considered<00:07:11.909> good

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:14.819 
table fare and because of that we tend

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:16.869 
table fare and because of that we tend
