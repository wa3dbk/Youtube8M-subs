00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.629
 Welcome to food hygiene training 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.939
 microbiological basics 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.039
 some genetic functioning contributes to this 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.470
 the microorganisms do not get on food and get there 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.029
 multiply 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.669
 they are microorganisms at all 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.109
 Microorganisms are mostly unicellular organisms 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.369
 they are so small 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.670
 that the human eye can not see them 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.360
 only with the help of a microscope can microorganisms be seen 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.830
 and be investigated 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.569
 There are different classes of microorganisms 

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:44.000
 that is, microorganisms are not uniform living things 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.870
 they differ from each other, for example, by their shape 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.050
 her behaviour 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.979
 their development and their cell structures 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.280
 In the following we will deal more closely with the two classes 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.280
 bacteria 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.549
 Microorganisms are also called germs 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.259
 In general parlance is usually a germ with germs 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.259
 Painted microorganism 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.310
 Prevent multiplication of microorganisms 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.910
 by the proliferation of microorganisms spoil food 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.300
 to prevent or slow down the spoilage 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.300
 Mustique be reduced to an increase 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.550
 Let us remember the factors the microorganisms propagate 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.050
 need temperature 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.540
 humidity 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.690
 Vigil 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.010
 oxygen 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.890
 more substances 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.140
 let's change those factors like that 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.520
 The Remis Choir Dennis Mimm is in a bad environment 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.600
 they multiply more slowly and food stays longer 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.140
 the three areas of food hygiene 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.150
 Food hygiene can be divided into three areas of industrial hygiene 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 Product type those and that but hygiene 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.240
 to occupational hygiene 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.990
 special requirements for the business premises 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.420
 the cleaning and disinfection as well as cleaning plans 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.979
 to product type one counts the pest control 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.339
 the goods receipt and inspection 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.829
 warehousing 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.790
 Creation of the sale and disposal of food 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.900
 The Genet Personality includes personal hygiene 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.570
 and hand hygiene of employees as well as work clothes and condition 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.819
 the social rooms 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.849
 to achieve a good hygiene practice in dealing with food 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.499
 Cen all three areas are taken into account 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.279
 cleaning and desinfection 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:55.559
 to prevent microorganisms from reproducing Nissen plants equipment 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:59.499
 and commodities are cleaned and fixed by a 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:03.629
 Thorough regular cleaning will be microorganisms and others 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.649
 Dirt reduces additional disinfection kills microorganisms 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:13.269
 however, we must be careful that we are neither too much nor too little 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.269
 use cleaning agents and disinfectants 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.169
 too little cleaning or disinfectant can under 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.369
 Circumstances lead Nico organisms would not be eliminated then 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.349
 and could continue to multiply 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.859
 too many cleaners or disinfectants, however, can 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.929
 Residues that like to contaminate our food we have to carry 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:38.809
 So always pay close attention to the information provided by the detergent manufacturer 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.809
 and stick to the recommended guidelines 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.199
 All cleaned surfaces and objects should be removed before 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.279
 Disinfecting and rinsing with pure water to detergent 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:53.629
 completely remove 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.629
 Surfaces should be dried with a clean paper towel once 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.359
 become 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:00.729
 it is also important 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:04.069
 the sheets stems and cloths after cleaning with clear water 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.699
 They also need to be rinsed out and dry properly 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:13.159
 to be changed frequently best several times a day because of unclean 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.359
 Slats or donors are only abducted and microorganisms 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.359
 not disseminated but eliminated 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:25.559
 Receipt and inspection 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.660
 before taking food 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.920
 If we have to control it carefully, this is a visual inspection of the goods 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.529
 important 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:43.169
 is to packaged goods 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.919
 to check if the goods are spoiled 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.930
 for example moldy is rotten vegetables 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.690
 this must be sorted out 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.150
 For packaged goods, the packaging should be for damage or damage 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.889
 Pollution are investigated 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.409
 In addition, the goods on grass must be examined for damage from pests 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:01.889
 become 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.009
 with food 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.520
 and which are cool to store 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.030
 In addition, a temperature control must be carried out cool dutiable goods 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.340
 We store cool immediately after delivery so as not to interrupt the cold chain 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.110
 At the time of delivery, we notice that food with animal 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.010
 pests 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.509
 Nico organisms 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.539
 stubborn or harmful substances are contaminated 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.869
 We must not accept these whales, moreover we must in principle 

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:32.029
 always check the best before date 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.450
 if the goods have expired, we may of course no longer accept them 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.190
 a sale of baked goods is to pay attention 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.010
 that the products are not touched directly with their hands so they can 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.920
 not contaminated, the tools use the sliced ​​bread 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.500
 Pouch knives never dipped was a pastry Zanger disposable gloves and without 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.300
 Cream paper 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.759
 there were the pastries cantatas and knives in a glass filled with water 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.159
 Container on 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.159
 we have to replace the water regularly 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.000
 In addition, it should be sufficient cooling of perishable 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.110
 food 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.659
 Pastry shops and snacks must be respected for spoiled food 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.659
 We remove immediately from the sales counter 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:31.759
 personal hygiene 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.530
 we have to be aware 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.700
 that we are a danger to our fellow human beings due to inadequate hygiene 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.289
 we have to act on our own responsibility 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.930
 and begin with the hygiene already in personal hygiene 

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:47.839
 belong to the body hygiene 

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:50.680
 the daily cleansing of the entire body 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.780
 including a thorough moon and his keeper 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:58.319
 the regular cleaning and care of the head met 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:01.940
 as the couple met or a regular shave 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.360
 clean and well-groomed fingernails cut short no nail polish no 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.789
 artificial fingernails 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:11.939
 before starting work 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:13.169
 now should also rings 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:14.860
 Morin bracelets 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.999
 and other jewelry will be filed 

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:21.019
 because here too a transfer of microorganisms can take place
