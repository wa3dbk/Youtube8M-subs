00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.420
 ah 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.100
 Y 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.970
 very well 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.590
 okay 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.710
 I said explain some small concepts 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.109
 that will be very useful first 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.480
 that nothing a computer is composed 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.550
 by a microprocessor which is like 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.660
 the serious one of the computer since it is the 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.329
 in charge of doing all the operations 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.129
 of calculation and control what happens 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.379
 danny receive orders so that all the 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.149
 computer work exist diverse 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.149
 types or processors today 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.000
 is a processor that within the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.750
 combined we are processors 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.750
 independent 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.150
 everything starts with the riva which 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.120
 is made up of silicon and this is a 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.220
 this excellent semiconductor melts 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.290
 to form a crystal mode that is a 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.390
 small cylinder with which 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.450
 they make small sized transistors 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.270
 really small some up to 45 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.300
 nanometer which equals the size of 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.830
 200 readers together then at 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.430
 put them all together in a microprocessor 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.840
 we get billions of them the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.330
 which do the operations of the 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.490
 smaller computer if between 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.190
 smaller ones generate less heat and 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.560
 they consume less energy besides they go 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.990
 increasing functional clock which 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.090
 is measured at the hertz level but currently 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.700
 they no longer focus on increasing it because 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.649
 the faster the signal the processor 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.119
 produces more heat that's why 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.920
 they started creating the processors 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.230
 multi cores 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.630
 imagine you a person but a 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.340
 series of activities and works she 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.459
 will finish the work in a certain amount 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.440
 of time but if we put more people 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.050
 helping it will end this very 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.060
 work in less time the same happens 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.950
 with the multi-core processor 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.620
 but not all activities can be 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.970
 executed by the various nuclei 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.340
 many applications are not designed 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.500
 for this process only some 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.220
 the majority focused on programs of 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.410
 audio videogames graphics and calculations 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.690
 scientists these processes that 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.370
 divide into others for each nucleus they are 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.370
 they know as execution wines 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:56.680
 it is relatively currently the 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.230
 tendency is to increase the nuclei of the 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.530
 processor but actually the first 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.460
 that existed was the ibm power football 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:10.130
 year 2000 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:13.070
 so then for desktop computers 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.290
 there are two main brands intel and m 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.150
 de jaime started throwing the first 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.440
 name the business core in the makes a 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.140
 64 x 200 thousand 520 jll against the rest with 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.960
 the pepteam of each company has its 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.880
 own procedural technologies that is 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.620
 inter has to see trading which 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.840
 simulates logical or virtual cores 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.520
 inside the processor a logical core 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.250
 is when the processor is divided into 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.930
 processes to simulate other nuclei by 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.630
 The other side has the technology 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.660
 of hardware transport which improves the 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.820
 transmission of the data as pentium of 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.550
 did not compete against the processor 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.220
 athlon stocking integrate over the cord 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.820
 which later updated it to cord 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.400
 had in 2007 intel the first partner 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.430
 quad core processor the core 2 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.560
 quad and then to md was at first pitch 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.460
 an 8-core physical processor in the 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.500
 fx bulldozer series winning the cia intel 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.440
 since it also has 8 cores but 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.260
 four physical and 8 logical 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.030
 to socialize libertchÃ© and so on until the 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.320
 currently we are still competing on the one 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.320
 against one 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.940
 almost any electrical device of the 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.050
 currently has microprocessors by 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.370
 example that phone you have 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.770
 at 73 this phone has a processor 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.360
 quad-core that competes almost 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.190
 against any computer under 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.750
 level and also in the use of 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.240
 telephony the prudence of thanks 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.699
 processors increasingly media 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.569
 example the first dual core cellular that 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.770
 existed was from iii and was called optimus 2x 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.970
 wine your phone is from the 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.970
 more powerful and there are 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.670
 Currently the standard is four 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.830
 cores but there is a problem when increasing 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.020
 more and more the nuclei the voices to tura 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.150
 that is, with the same example of 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.290
 people have been working for a while now 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.600
 a time when the amount of 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.850
 people is so much that they can pass all 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.100
 at the same time so we have to 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.020
 wait for both of you to pass so 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.660
 becomes inefficient and turns out to be worse than 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.180
 you have a few people right is 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.560
 same with the cores if they continue every time 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.360
 putting more nuclei the voice of 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.430
 processor saturates and if it's a neck of 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.480
 bottle but the processes have to 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.480
 wait for them to pass 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.160
 with the ones you have 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.389
 ok right away I bring
