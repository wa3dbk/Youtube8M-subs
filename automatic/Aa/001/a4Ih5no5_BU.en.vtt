the<00:02:37.820> antenna<00:02:38.320> facing<00:02:39.320> straight<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:42.890> put

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
the antenna facing straight and you put

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.730 
the antenna facing straight and you put
it<00:02:43.280> on<00:02:44.260> first<00:02:45.260> part<00:02:45.850> like<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:48.410> then<00:02:48.590> you

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
it on first part like that and then you

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.270 
it on first part like that and then you
take<00:02:48.950> your<00:02:49.480> non-optional<00:02:50.480> green<00:02:51.230> button<00:02:51.710> or

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
take your non-optional green button or

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.270 
take your non-optional green button or
studs<00:02:52.720> put<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:53.840> like<00:02:54.020> that<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.860> then<00:02:55.100> we<00:02:55.160> have

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
studs put it like that and then we have

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.700 
studs put it like that and then we have
a<00:02:55.310> little<00:02:55.580> control<00:02:55.940> panel<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:57.230> get<00:02:57.380> actually

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
a little control panel you get actually

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.190 
a little control panel you get actually
this<00:02:57.980> as<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.190> lever<00:02:58.490> I<00:02:58.880> think<00:02:59.660> is<00:02:59.900> what<00:03:00.110> it

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
this as a lever I think is what it

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.610 
this as a lever I think is what it
should<00:03:00.410> be

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
should be

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.270 
should be
Marvin<00:03:01.490> Taz<00:03:01.840> or<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:02.930> could<00:03:03.110> be<00:03:03.290> an<00:03:03.470> antenna<00:03:03.920> for

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
Marvin Taz or it could be an antenna for

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.800 
Marvin Taz or it could be an antenna for
an<00:03:04.520> antenna<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:06.760> now<00:03:07.760> after<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.600> have<00:03:08.720> these

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
an antenna so now after you have these

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.680 
an antenna so now after you have these
three<00:03:11.810> competed<00:03:12.670> completed<00:03:13.670> pieces<00:03:14.209> with

other side like that now take your
little<00:03:32.930> control<00:03:33.470> panel<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:34.130> stick<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.610> right

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.300 

you<00:03:40.489> can<00:03:40.670> move<00:03:40.760> that<00:03:41.000> like<00:03:41.600> in<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.739> option<00:03:43.160> the

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
you can move that like in the option the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.790 
you can move that like in the option the
other<00:03:43.489> optional<00:03:44.090> piece<00:03:44.330> I<00:03:44.690> think<00:03:45.200> it<00:03:45.590> just

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
other optional piece I think it just

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.920 
other optional piece I think it just
looks<00:03:45.860> good<00:03:46.250> is<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:47.230> top<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.760> smooth<00:03:49.760> 4x4<00:03:50.630> or

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
looks good is the top of smooth 4x4 or

00:03:50.930 --> 00:04:01.309 
looks good is the top of smooth 4x4 or
two<00:03:51.200> by

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.740 

it's<00:04:02.319> like<00:04:02.620> salt<00:04:03.520> always<00:04:03.970> compares<00:04:04.600> two

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
it's like salt always compares two

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.050 
it's like salt always compares two
minifigures<00:04:08.310> minifigures<00:04:09.310> fights<00:04:09.580> work<00:04:09.819> I

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
minifigures minifigures fights work I

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.300 
minifigures minifigures fights work I
should<00:04:10.480> say<00:04:10.990> but<00:04:11.050> they're<00:04:11.410> perfect<00:04:11.800> tight<00:04:11.980> for

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
should say but they're perfect tight for

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.180 
should say but they're perfect tight for
the<00:04:12.870> control<00:04:13.870> panel<00:04:14.290> right<00:04:14.530> there<00:04:16.230> so<00:04:17.230> it<00:04:18.010> goes

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
the control panel right there so it goes

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.849 
the control panel right there so it goes
all<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.400> way<00:04:18.489> up<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:19.329> even<00:04:19.810> if<00:04:20.109> you<00:04:20.290> would

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
like you can take those little spinners

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.170 
like you can take those little spinners
and<00:04:23.830> throw<00:04:23.980> it<00:04:24.070> on<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.280> bottom<00:04:24.639> wherever<00:04:25.000> you

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
and throw it on the bottom wherever you

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.650 
and throw it on the bottom wherever you
