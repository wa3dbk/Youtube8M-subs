never satisfied with my performance with
this<00:00:23.039> weapon<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.670> had<00:00:24.330> seen<00:00:24.539> some<00:00:24.750> players<00:00:25.050> do

attack to kill someone and I had never
really<00:00:31.679> been<00:00:31.740> able<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.040> do<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.369> myself<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:33.030> got

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
really been able to do that myself I got

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.240 
really been able to do that myself I got
pretty<00:00:33.899> close<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.380> still<00:00:34.590> can't<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.130> but

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
pretty close I still can't do it but

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.830 
pretty close I still can't do it but
I've<00:00:35.309> gotten<00:00:35.579> pretty<00:00:35.790> close<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.300> doing<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.690> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
I've gotten pretty close to doing it and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.740 
I've gotten pretty close to doing it and
twice<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.590> video<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.950> almost<00:00:38.309> had<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.850> but

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
twice in this video I almost had it but

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.619 
twice in this video I almost had it but
it<00:00:40.170> didn't<00:00:40.590> end<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:40.739> working<00:00:40.980> out<00:00:41.340> either<00:00:42.329> way

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
it didn't end up working out either way

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.290 
it didn't end up working out either way
though<00:00:42.870> my<00:00:43.350> lack<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.180> satisfaction<00:00:45.180> while

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
though my lack of satisfaction while

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.420 
though my lack of satisfaction while
using<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.809> weapon<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.350> not<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> good<00:00:46.980> excuse

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
using this weapon is not a good excuse

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.970 
using this weapon is not a good excuse
for<00:00:47.460> me<00:00:47.700> not<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> showcase<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.989> so

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
for me not to do a showcase on it so

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.180 
for me not to do a showcase on it so
getting<00:00:50.820> started<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:52.199> weapon<00:00:52.680> has<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> weight

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
getting started this weapon has a weight

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.180 
getting started this weapon has a weight
of<00:00:53.399> 12<00:00:53.910> units<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.750> has<00:00:56.300> strength<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.600> strength

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
of 12 units it has strength a strength

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.110 
of 12 units it has strength a strength
requirement<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.370> 28<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.469> dexterity<00:01:01.469> 13<00:01:02.250> so

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
requirement of 28 in dexterity 13 so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.910 
requirement of 28 in dexterity 13 so
that<00:01:03.750> makes<00:01:03.930> sense<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.350> mean<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.739> big

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
that makes sense I mean it's a big

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.509 
that makes sense I mean it's a big
weapon

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
weapon

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.880 
weapon
it<00:01:05.640> weighs<00:01:05.970> 12<00:01:06.479> units<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.170> should<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> high

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
it weighs 12 units it should have a high

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.760 
it weighs 12 units it should have a high
strength<00:01:08.280> requirement<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:11.430> has<00:01:11.939> an<00:01:12.390> e<00:01:12.930> scaling

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
strength requirement it has an e scaling

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.390 
strength requirement it has an e scaling
in<00:01:13.950> strength<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.360> scaling<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.400> dexterity

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
in strength and a scaling in dexterity

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
in strength and a scaling in dexterity
which<00:01:18.030> also<00:01:18.240> makes<00:01:18.570> sense<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.930> mean<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
which also makes sense I mean it is a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.200 
which also makes sense I mean it is a
dexterity<00:01:19.860> weapon<00:01:20.310> even<00:01:20.670> though<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.030> does

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
dexterity weapon even though it does

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.020 
dexterity weapon even though it does
have<00:01:21.479> 28<00:01:22.110> strengths<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.740> still<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.520> next

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
have 28 strengths it still is the next

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.770 
have 28 strengths it still is the next
arity<00:01:24.330> weapon

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
arity weapon

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.020 
arity weapon
i've<00:01:25.200> heard<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.530> few<00:01:25.650> people<00:01:25.740> classify<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.729> as

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
i've heard a few people classify it as

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.319 
i've heard a few people classify it as
quality<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:27.840> US<00:01:28.200> dexterity<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.670> saying<00:01:30.150> it's

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
quality if US dexterity I'm saying it's

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.899 
quality if US dexterity I'm saying it's
going<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.869> classified<00:01:31.799> as<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> dexterity

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
going to be classified as a dexterity

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.550 
going to be classified as a dexterity
weapon<00:01:33.390> because<00:01:33.689> even<00:01:34.020> though<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.229> does<00:01:34.380> have

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
weapon because even though it does have

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.580 
weapon because even though it does have
a<00:01:34.590> high<00:01:34.799> strength<00:01:35.280> requirement<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:37.200> doesn't

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
a high strength requirement it doesn't

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.920 
a high strength requirement it doesn't
have<00:01:37.860> much<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.430> strength<00:01:38.729> scaling<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.600> mean<00:01:39.780> E

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
have much of a strength scaling I mean E

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.730 
have much of a strength scaling I mean E
is<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:41.070> next<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.549> nothing<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.960> moving<00:01:43.619> on

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
is really next to nothing so moving on

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
is really next to nothing so moving on
from<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:44.189> for<00:01:44.520> me<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.970> weapon<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.659> should

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
from here for me this weapon I should

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.859 
from here for me this weapon I should
mention<00:01:45.960> with<00:01:46.860> my<00:01:47.009> 35<00:01:47.520> dexterity<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.390> 40

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
mention with my 35 dexterity and 40

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.950 
mention with my 35 dexterity and 40
strength<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.649> weapon<00:01:50.070> does<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:50.729> has<00:01:51.119> an<00:01:51.540> AR

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
strength this weapon does or has an AR

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.719 
strength this weapon does or has an AR
of<00:01:52.729> 531<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.200> pretty<00:01:55.530> good<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:55.979> about

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
of 531 so that's pretty good it's about

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.899 
of 531 so that's pretty good it's about
average<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> great<00:01:58.049> sword<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.590> as<00:01:59.579> far<00:01:59.850> as

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
average for a great sword and as far as

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.330 
average for a great sword and as far as
great<00:02:00.630> swords<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.170> curved<00:02:01.439> great<00:02:01.770> swords<00:02:02.130> are

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
great swords and curved great swords are

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.670 
great swords and curved great swords are
concerned<00:02:02.790> they're<00:02:03.509> stun<00:02:03.810> locking<00:02:04.229> ability

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
concerned they're stun locking ability

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.639 
concerned they're stun locking ability
is<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.399> same<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.509> that's<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.780> very<00:02:07.020> good<00:02:07.350> thing

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
is the same so that's a very good thing

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.070 
is the same so that's a very good thing
for<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.009> weapon

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
for this weapon

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.620

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.320 
you still get souls in humidity or
whatever<00:02:37.349> either<00:02:37.950> way<00:02:38.190> as<00:02:38.250> long<00:02:38.640> as<00:02:38.819> they<00:02:39.060> die

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
other things about the weapon it's

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.860 
other things about the weapon it's
running<00:03:53.100> attacks<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.700> do<00:03:54.209> not<00:03:54.480> believe<00:03:54.810> that

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
running attacks I do not believe that

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.960 
running attacks I do not believe that
it's<00:03:55.200> running<00:03:55.470> attacks<00:03:55.799> can<00:03:56.069> be<00:03:56.100> parried<00:03:56.670> if

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
it's running attacks can be parried if

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.809 
it's running attacks can be parried if
they<00:03:57.840> can<00:03:58.049> it's<00:03:58.410> really<00:03:58.560> really<00:03:59.370> hard<00:03:59.549> I've

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
they can it's really really hard I've

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.789 
they can it's really really hard I've
never<00:04:00.180> actually<00:04:00.510> successfully<00:04:01.380> done<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.590> and

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
never actually successfully done it and

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.160 
never actually successfully done it and
I've<00:04:01.980> tried<00:04:02.010> for<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.639> good<00:04:02.880> few<00:04:03.150> hours<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.840> do<00:04:03.989> it

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
I've tried for a good few hours to do it

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.830 
I've tried for a good few hours to do it
it<00:04:05.010> just<00:04:05.069> doesn't<00:04:05.670> seem<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.030> happen<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:06.569> right

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
it just doesn't seem to happen and right

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.229 
it just doesn't seem to happen and right
they're<00:04:07.139> so<00:04:08.069> close<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.579> getting<00:04:08.819> that<00:04:08.880> kind<00:04:09.150> of

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
they're so close to getting that kind of

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.059 
they're so close to getting that kind of
moment<00:04:09.420> mentioned<00:04:09.870> earlier<00:04:10.170> in<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.350> video<00:04:10.440> so

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
moment mentioned earlier in the video so

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.940 
moment mentioned earlier in the video so
close<00:04:11.400> but<00:04:12.299> didn't<00:04:12.870> end<00:04:13.049> up<00:04:13.139> working<00:04:13.350> got<00:04:13.920> a

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
close but didn't end up working got a

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.860 
close but didn't end up working got a
pairing<00:04:14.280> instead<00:04:14.609> though<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.060> made<00:04:15.540> me<00:04:15.630> feel<00:04:15.840> a

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
pairing instead though so made me feel a

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.229 
pairing instead though so made me feel a
little<00:04:16.049> bit<00:04:16.289> better<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:17.130> just<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.609> little<00:04:18.060> bit

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
little bit better just just a little bit

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.499 
little bit better just just a little bit
but<00:04:18.930> then<00:04:19.169> so<00:04:19.859> close<00:04:20.459> I'll<00:04:20.849> get<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.120> someday<00:04:21.479> I

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509 
but then so close I'll get it someday I

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:22.039 
but then so close I'll get it someday I
will

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
will

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.670 
will
but<00:04:23.039> anyway<00:04:23.639> other<00:04:23.970> pros<00:04:24.569> about<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.169> weapon<00:04:25.500> I

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
but anyway other pros about the weapon I

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.529 
but anyway other pros about the weapon I
mentioned<00:04:26.069> it's<00:04:26.340> running<00:04:26.699> attack<00:04:26.789> I<00:04:27.180> do<00:04:27.240> not

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
mentioned it's running attack I do not

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:29.270 
mentioned it's running attack I do not
believe<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:27.870> can<00:04:28.139> get<00:04:28.259> parried<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:28.800> mentioned

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
believe that can get parried I mentioned

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.850 
believe that can get parried I mentioned
its<00:04:29.780> ability<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.810> dead<00:04:31.229> angle<00:04:31.349> eyes<00:04:31.650> the

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
its ability to dead angle eyes the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.300 
its ability to dead angle eyes the
biggest<00:04:32.280> Pro<00:04:33.199> another<00:04:34.199> really<00:04:34.919> good<00:04:35.039> Pro

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
biggest Pro another really good Pro

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.210 
biggest Pro another really good Pro
would<00:04:35.880> be<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.449> ability<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.930> stun<00:04:37.500> lock<00:04:37.710> you

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
would be the ability to stun lock you

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.730 
would be the ability to stun lock you
can<00:04:38.430> have<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:38.940> same<00:04:39.120> stun<00:04:39.599> ability<00:04:40.199> as<00:04:40.410> a

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
can have the same stun ability as a

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.740 
can have the same stun ability as a
regular<00:04:41.220> great<00:04:41.550> sword<00:04:41.819> class<00:04:42.060> weapon<00:04:42.509> with

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
regular great sword class weapon with

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.270 
regular great sword class weapon with
this<00:04:42.990> curved<00:04:43.319> great<00:04:43.650> sword<00:04:43.889> in<00:04:44.069> the<00:04:44.250> other

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
this curved great sword in the other

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.800 
this curved great sword in the other
curve<00:04:44.639> great<00:04:44.970> swords<00:04:45.270> too<00:04:45.449> for<00:04:45.690> that<00:04:45.720> matter

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
curve great swords too for that matter

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.189 
curve great swords too for that matter
so<00:04:46.770> it's<00:04:46.919> running<00:04:47.160> attacks<00:04:47.550> done<00:04:47.940> at<00:04:48.240> 50<00:04:48.960> or

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
so it's running attacks done at 50 or

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.580 
so it's running attacks done at 50 or
it's<00:04:49.979> running<00:04:50.220> attack<00:04:50.280> stop<00:04:50.699> stunning<00:04:51.590> you

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
can stand through a running attack at 56

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.029 
can stand through a running attack at 56
poise<00:04:54.750> that's<00:04:55.110> what<00:04:55.259> I'm<00:04:55.349> trying<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:55.650> say

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
poise that's what I'm trying to say

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.159 
poise that's what I'm trying to say
regular<00:04:56.849> two-handed<00:04:57.389> attacks<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:57.840> can<00:04:57.990> take

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
all that good stuff now the cons of the

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.010 
all that good stuff now the cons of the
weapon<00:05:16.800> it's<00:05:17.639> kind<00:05:18.030> of<00:05:18.150> hard<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.419> classify

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
weapon it's kind of hard to classify

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.800 
weapon it's kind of hard to classify
this<00:05:19.080> weapon<00:05:19.770> as<00:05:19.979> a<00:05:20.430> strength<00:05:20.970> or<00:05:21.270> dam

this weapon as a strength or dam

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.990 
this weapon as a strength or dam
strength<00:05:22.199> but<00:05:22.320> as<00:05:22.440> a<00:05:22.469> quality<00:05:23.039> or<00:05:23.190> a<00:05:23.250> dexterity

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
strength but as a quality or a dexterity

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.659 
strength but as a quality or a dexterity
weapon<00:05:24.449> just<00:05:24.690> because<00:05:25.199> of<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:25.620> way<00:05:26.219> the<00:05:26.370> level

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
weapon just because of the way the level

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.790 
weapon just because of the way the level
requirements<00:05:27.419> are<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.960> mean

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
requirements are I mean

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.760 
requirements are I mean
28<00:05:29.280> strength<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:29.820> wield<00:05:29.940> it<00:05:30.180> is<00:05:30.300> kind<00:05:30.960> of<00:05:31.229> a<00:05:31.440> lot

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
28 strength to wield it is kind of a lot

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.830 
28 strength to wield it is kind of a lot
and<00:05:32.130> it's<00:05:32.580> very<00:05:32.820> high<00:05:33.030> for<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.389> dexterity

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
and it's very high for a dexterity

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.560 
and it's very high for a dexterity
weapon<00:05:34.349> so<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:35.400> high<00:05:35.550> strength<00:05:36.060> can<00:05:36.539> be

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
weapon so the high strength can be

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.680 
weapon so the high strength can be
considered<00:05:37.349> a<00:05:37.500> con<00:05:37.770> if<00:05:38.130> you're<00:05:39.000> a<00:05:39.030> dexterity

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
considered a con if you're a dexterity

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.930 
considered a con if you're a dexterity
build<00:05:40.050> because<00:05:40.409> I<00:05:40.560> mean<00:05:40.889> it's<00:05:41.550> a<00:05:41.669> strength

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
build because I mean it's a strength

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.689 
build because I mean it's a strength
level<00:05:42.469> you<00:05:43.469> don't<00:05:43.560> really<00:05:43.800> want<00:05:44.070> that<00:05:44.310> on<00:05:44.520> a

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
level you don't really want that on a

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.860 
level you don't really want that on a
dexterity<00:05:45.120> build<00:05:45.479> so<00:05:46.409> I<00:05:47.449> guess<00:05:48.449> that<00:05:48.659> could<00:05:48.750> be

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
dexterity build so I guess that could be

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.930 
dexterity build so I guess that could be
considered<00:05:49.289> a<00:05:49.380> can<00:05:49.560> other<00:05:50.400> cons<00:05:50.699> of<00:05:50.880> the

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
considered a can other cons of the

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.339 
considered a can other cons of the
weapon<00:05:51.240> I<00:05:51.389> would<00:05:51.509> have<00:05:51.599> to<00:05:51.719> say<00:05:51.870> would<00:05:51.990> be<00:05:52.050> the

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
weapon I would have to say would be the

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.830 
weapon I would have to say would be the
slow<00:05:52.620> swing<00:05:52.949> speed<00:05:53.370> which<00:05:54.000> really<00:05:54.389> isn't<00:05:54.630> that

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
slow swing speed which really isn't that

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
slow swing speed which really isn't that
slow<00:05:55.620> but<00:05:56.550> in<00:05:56.819> comparison<00:05:57.150> to<00:05:57.419> and<00:05:57.960> in

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
slow but in comparison to and in

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.830 
slow but in comparison to and in
comparison<00:05:59.280> to<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.639> majority<00:05:59.969> of<00:06:00.210> dexterity

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
comparison to the majority of dexterity

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.010 
comparison to the majority of dexterity
weapons<00:06:01.409> I<00:06:01.710> could<00:06:02.430> talk

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
weapons I could talk

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.740 
weapons I could talk
it<00:06:04.260> is<00:06:04.590> slow<00:06:05.010> in<00:06:05.220> comparison<00:06:05.400> so<00:06:06.210> that's<00:06:06.570> one

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
it is slow in comparison so that's one

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.850 
it is slow in comparison so that's one
thing<00:06:06.960> to<00:06:07.080> keep<00:06:07.200> in<00:06:07.350> mind

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
thing to keep in mind

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.740 
thing to keep in mind
now<00:06:08.400> it's<00:06:08.700> jumping<00:06:09.090> attacks<00:06:09.360> on<00:06:09.540> the<00:06:09.630> other

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
now it's jumping attacks on the other

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.930 
now it's jumping attacks on the other
hand<00:06:09.990> I<00:06:10.140> love<00:06:10.530> this<00:06:10.830> weapons<00:06:11.250> jumping<00:06:11.640> attacks

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
hand I love this weapons jumping attacks

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.450 
hand I love this weapons jumping attacks
they<00:06:12.150> are<00:06:12.270> very<00:06:12.570> strong<00:06:12.930> very<00:06:13.680> damaging<00:06:14.310> and

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
they are very strong very damaging and

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.160 
they are very strong very damaging and
it's<00:06:14.640> really<00:06:14.940> easy<00:06:15.120> to<00:06:15.270> pick<00:06:15.510> people<00:06:15.750> up<00:06:15.990> in

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 
it's really easy to pick people up in

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.010 
it's really easy to pick people up in
the<00:06:16.260> middle<00:06:16.320> of<00:06:16.560> a<00:06:16.680> roll<00:06:16.920> and<00:06:17.820> they<00:06:18.360> just<00:06:18.600> don't

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
the middle of a roll and they just don't

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.260 
the middle of a roll and they just don't
seem<00:06:19.290> to<00:06:19.410> be<00:06:19.530> expecting<00:06:19.860> it<00:06:20.160> and<00:06:20.280> that's<00:06:21.120> one

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
seem to be expecting it and that's one

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.540 
seem to be expecting it and that's one
thing<00:06:21.450> I<00:06:21.540> really<00:06:21.570> like<00:06:21.930> and<00:06:22.410> actually<00:06:23.340> another

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
thing I really like and actually another

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.950 
thing I really like and actually another
thing<00:06:23.790> I<00:06:23.880> really<00:06:24.000> like<00:06:24.120> that<00:06:24.450> people<00:06:24.720> don't

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
thing I really like that people don't

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.370 
thing I really like that people don't
expect<00:06:25.170> is<00:06:25.680> the<00:06:25.740> r2<00:06:26.340> attacks<00:06:26.960> now<00:06:27.960> what<00:06:28.110> I<00:06:28.140> mean

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
expect is the r2 attacks now what I mean

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.200 
expect is the r2 attacks now what I mean
by<00:06:28.500> that<00:06:28.530> is<00:06:28.920> for<00:06:29.280> you<00:06:29.580> to<00:06:29.670> follow<00:06:29.850> them<00:06:30.090> up

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
by that is for you to follow them up

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.390 
by that is for you to follow them up
like<00:06:30.420> I<00:06:30.540> just<00:06:30.750> did<00:06:30.900> right<00:06:30.930> there<00:06:31.440> people<00:06:32.190> never

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
like I just did right there people never

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.700 
like I just did right there people never
expect<00:06:33.120> the<00:06:33.330> second<00:06:33.660> r2<00:06:33.990> attack<00:06:34.320> on<00:06:34.530> this

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
expect the second r2 attack on this

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.380 
expect the second r2 attack on this
weapon<00:06:35.100> same<00:06:35.340> with<00:06:35.490> this<00:06:35.610> Y<00:06:35.760> hander<00:06:36.120> for<00:06:36.300> that

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
weapon same with this Y hander for that

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.770 
weapon same with this Y hander for that
matter

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
matter

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.010 
matter
they<00:06:37.320> never<00:06:37.620> expect<00:06:38.130> a<00:06:38.250> second<00:06:38.670> r2<00:06:39.090> so<00:06:39.870> that's

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
they never expect a second r2 so that's

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.450 
they never expect a second r2 so that's
one<00:06:40.230> thing<00:06:40.380> you<00:06:40.440> can<00:06:40.680> really<00:06:40.890> do<00:06:41.100> with<00:06:41.280> this

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
one thing you can really do with this

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.360 
one thing you can really do with this
weapon<00:06:41.850> and<00:06:42.090> this<00:06:42.480> white<00:06:42.660> hinder<00:06:43.080> -<00:06:43.530> you<00:06:44.280> know

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
weapon and this white hinder - you know

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.790 
weapon and this white hinder - you know
just<00:06:44.640> throw<00:06:44.880> people<00:06:45.090> off<00:06:45.390> and<00:06:46.050> it<00:06:46.500> adds<00:06:46.650> a<00:06:46.770> bit

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
just throw people off and it adds a bit

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.370 
just throw people off and it adds a bit
more<00:06:46.950> variety<00:06:47.640> to<00:06:47.670> your<00:06:47.850> PvP<00:06:48.450> and<00:06:48.780> makes<00:06:49.200> you<00:06:49.350> a

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
more variety to your PvP and makes you a

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.200 
more variety to your PvP and makes you a
little<00:06:49.620> bit<00:06:49.740> less<00:06:49.980> predictable<00:06:50.490> which<00:06:51.060> is

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
little bit less predictable which is

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.370 
little bit less predictable which is
always<00:06:51.360> a<00:06:51.480> good<00:06:51.600> thing<00:06:51.840> so<00:06:52.050> you<00:06:52.110> don't<00:06:52.290> get

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 
always a good thing so you don't get

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.170 
always a good thing so you don't get
parried<00:06:52.800> and<00:06:52.950> apparently<00:06:53.370> some<00:06:53.580> people<00:06:53.880> don't

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
parried and apparently some people don't

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.110 
parried and apparently some people don't
learn<00:06:54.570> that<00:06:55.440> I<00:06:55.470> like<00:06:55.800> to<00:06:55.920> follow<00:06:56.100> up<00:06:56.370> my<00:06:56.550> r2

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
learn that I like to follow up my r2

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.060 
learn that I like to follow up my r2
with<00:06:57.270> a<00:06:57.300> second<00:06:57.660> r2<00:06:57.990> so<00:06:58.350> they<00:06:58.530> go<00:06:58.770> in<00:06:58.920> and

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
with a second r2 so they go in and

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.240 
with a second r2 so they go in and
attack<00:06:59.130> me<00:06:59.490> anyway<00:06:59.790> oh<00:07:00.470> well<00:07:01.470> I'm<00:07:01.770> not<00:07:02.070> going

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
attack me anyway oh well I'm not going

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.990 
attack me anyway oh well I'm not going

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
weapon as far as I'm concerned the

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.280 
weapon as far as I'm concerned the
biggest<00:07:11.820> kind<00:07:12.090> I<00:07:12.360> believe<00:07:12.750> I<00:07:12.840> forgot<00:07:12.990> to

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
biggest kind I believe I forgot to

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.110 
biggest kind I believe I forgot to
mention<00:07:13.410> the<00:07:13.860> biggest<00:07:14.160> con<00:07:14.370> in<00:07:14.550> my<00:07:14.670> opinion

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 
mention the biggest con in my opinion

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.540 
mention the biggest con in my opinion
would<00:07:15.690> be<00:07:15.870> for<00:07:16.380> a<00:07:16.410> dexterity<00:07:16.830> build<00:07:17.160> the<00:07:17.370> high

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
would be for a dexterity build the high

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.470 
would be for a dexterity build the high
strength<00:07:17.970> level<00:07:18.450> requirement<00:07:19.370> it's

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:20.480 
strength level requirement it's

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.180 
strength level requirement it's
definitely<00:07:21.480> the<00:07:21.570> biggest<00:07:21.660> hand<00:07:22.080> but<00:07:22.890> I<00:07:22.919> mean

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.190 
definitely the biggest hand but I mean

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.430 
definitely the biggest hand but I mean
for<00:07:23.370> this<00:07:23.490> weapon<00:07:23.690> what<00:07:24.690> do<00:07:24.750> you<00:07:24.840> expect<00:07:24.900> and

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 
for this weapon what do you expect and

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.380 
for this weapon what do you expect and
right<00:07:25.650> there<00:07:25.860> that<00:07:26.100> running<00:07:26.400> attack<00:07:26.490> I<00:07:26.820> really

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:27.390 
right there that running attack I really

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.970 
right there that running attack I really
wish<00:07:27.540> I<00:07:27.660> landed<00:07:27.960> that<00:07:28.110> running<00:07:28.380> attack<00:07:28.620> on<00:07:28.800> him

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:28.980 
wish I landed that running attack on him

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.140 
wish I landed that running attack on him
because<00:07:29.520> that<00:07:29.550> would<00:07:29.820> have<00:07:29.910> just<00:07:30.090> been

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.150 
because that would have just been

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.320 
because that would have just been
perfect<00:07:30.960> just<00:07:31.650> a<00:07:31.800> really<00:07:32.460> nice-looking<00:07:32.669> camo

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.330 
perfect just a really nice-looking camo

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.730 
perfect just a really nice-looking camo
would<00:07:33.780> have<00:07:33.870> just<00:07:34.080> been<00:07:34.140> perfect<00:07:34.680> but

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 
would have just been perfect but

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.260 
would have just been perfect but
apparently<00:07:35.310> when<00:07:35.580> you're<00:07:35.730> running<00:07:35.850> straight

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:36.270 
apparently when you're running straight

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.540 
apparently when you're running straight
the<00:07:36.930> running<00:07:37.230> attack<00:07:37.320> goes<00:07:37.860> off<00:07:38.070> to<00:07:38.250> your<00:07:38.340> left

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:38.550 
the running attack goes off to your left

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.050

side who woulda guessed I wouldn't I
would<00:07:42.180> assume<00:07:42.450> that<00:07:42.510> it<00:07:42.930> would<00:07:42.960> hit<00:07:43.169> you<00:07:43.380> know
