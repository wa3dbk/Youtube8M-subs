00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.870
 we like to jump and columnist at 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.220
 hunting and fishing trail magazine 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.539
 today I would like no connection with 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.070
 the article I started in the background 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.650
 as such writing we spoke is this 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.530
 we should scoreless regards 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.660
 calls in a hunting context open 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.460
 Signs of the presence of sick or my 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.989
 experience as a guide especially 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.120
 in forests as if these two types 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.370
 of forests that I exploit I have a small 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.290
 guide and in the big forests enough 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.860
 mature who made a variety of barley 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.610
 at the level of the shrubby regrowth the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.340
 technique brought to a specific place 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.290
 like here where we have mountains that we 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.000
 surround then the idea that's it the 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.280
 prospecting find signs demand 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.890
 will make them add hirata do a 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.860
 good pre-season protection or 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.689
 spring is here to find a cool there 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.209
 you lie like here where we put a stone 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.670
 of that of reality the charges are 

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:13.799
 usual come we photographed them and 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.079
 here creed and solve 106 males 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.600
 females at terra and vomit 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.289
 eat here they will come down from 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.529
 mountains 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.999
 the strategy the strategy set which 

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:26.340
 is a lot hunters who live this 

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:29.700
 situation there and have a lot of trouble to 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.770
 god of night observes under the cameras 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.990
 then this kind behavior 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.979
 is happening it hurts come either 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.380
 to be postponed irg to the forest during 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.069
 the period surrounding their clients the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.950
 observe and often especially when the site 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.689
 slaughterhouse says open on toulouse a 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.819
 big hunting pressure the sick there 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.829
 are used because often Quebec 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.509
 the young males are taken so that 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.219
 becomes danger zones for the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.139
 males who know if they show up 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.869
 where there is a viewpoint of a tree or a 

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:02.729
 silhouette in the boat a bib 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.709
 risks are very high that will stay 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.239
 set back near the Basque mountains 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.670
 hussars that cumulations are handmade 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.820
 this fact this place there again specifies the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.240
 day be morning or late evening 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.550
 Alas 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.940
 lee died at busquÃ© nickname happily 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.160
 away from the book to wear so yes we 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.980
 bait is a very good alternative 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.140
 it is extremely extremely 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.030
 for mature males were not that 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.760
 look at naoufel active on this site 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.890
 but we feel busca recessed we observe 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.720
 the hairy trails are observed 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.160
 especially the signs of marle and one 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.990
 install miradors says what is 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.480
 often just a little platform I 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.280
 sad know n as they say and try 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.590
 to observe the child behaviors 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.750
 starts in the last years it's a 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.280
 little like that I guide that favors 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.200
 looking for me we see less deer 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.940
 as if we were in the contributions but we 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.460
 see deer trophy we did 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.820
 serve sure we want to take and not a 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.340
 large amount of young deer 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.830
 juvenile trunks small bins or 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.530
 females with level so to remember 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.770
 we continue sharing but we exploit 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.120
 the whole corridor surrounds is site the lot 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.830
 where women will urinate where 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.710
 the women they will pass it will be there 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.530
 where males will feel safe 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.420
 so the idea can not neglect sharing 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.030
 but maybe change his way 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.760
 to address a hunting offensive to a 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.050
 site like that we want to go to 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.940
 background of surrounding mountains as 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.920
 this one marks are going to feel in 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.740
 security to present themselves during 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.180
 legal hunting hours on this trail 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.290
 hunting and fishing wish you a good 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.290
 net hunting season
