through a wizard for creating your new
machine<00:01:16.680> we're<00:01:17.400> gonna<00:01:17.520> try<00:01:17.850> Windows<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:20.750> you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
machine we're gonna try Windows here you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.300 
machine we're gonna try Windows here you
can<00:01:21.869> decide<00:01:22.170> how<00:01:22.380> much<00:01:22.500> memory<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.009> want<00:01:23.220> to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
can decide how much memory you want to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.490 
can decide how much memory you want to
give<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> VM<00:01:25.549> let's<00:01:26.549> give<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:27.000> gig<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.360> ram

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
give the VM let's give it a gig of ram

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.780 
give the VM let's give it a gig of ram
create<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> new<00:01:28.680> hard<00:01:28.920> disk<00:01:31.790> dynamically

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
create a new hard disk dynamically

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.940 
create a new hard disk dynamically
allocated<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.570> means<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.470> disk<00:01:34.740> will

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
allocated this means the disk will

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.230 
allocated this means the disk will
adjust<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:36.360> will<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.990> 25<00:01:37.380> gigs<00:01:37.740> I

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
adjust it will have up to 25 gigs I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.670 
adjust it will have up to 25 gigs I
won't<00:01:39.240> use<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.229> will<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.470> use

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
won't use all that it will just use

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.590 
won't use all that it will just use
what's<00:01:40.950> needed<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.430> increased<00:01:41.850> dynamically

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
what's needed and increased dynamically

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.060 
what's needed and increased dynamically
as<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.380> use<00:01:43.560> more<00:01:45.350> let's<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.530> ahead<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.829> create

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
as we use more let's go ahead and create

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.620 
as we use more let's go ahead and create
that<00:01:48.290> create<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> virtual<00:01:49.799> machine<00:01:50.570> now<00:01:51.570> we

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
that create a virtual machine now we

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.950 
that create a virtual machine now we
need<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> CD<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.450> let's<00:01:54.450> click<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.899> storage<00:01:55.380> here

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
need a CD so let's click on storage here

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.289 
need a CD so let's click on storage here
we<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.729> use<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.000> host<00:02:00.299> drive<00:02:01.610> for<00:02:02.610> our<00:02:02.729> CD<00:02:03.119> or

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
we can use the host drive for our CD or

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.730 
we can use the host drive for our CD or
we<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.630> select<00:02:03.780> an<00:02:04.140> image<00:02:05.210> in<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:07.200> case<00:02:07.469> I

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
we can select an image in this case I

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.670 
we can select an image in this case I
created<00:02:08.280> a

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.280

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
ISO file of my windows 7 desk so I'm

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.900 
ISO file of my windows 7 desk so I'm
gonna<00:02:14.410> use<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.890> instead<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.310> using<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.670> host

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
gonna use that instead of using the host

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.850 
gonna use that instead of using the host
Drive<00:02:17.970> let's<00:02:18.970> click<00:02:19.300> OK

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860

and<00:02:20.860> let's<00:02:21.460> start<00:02:22.180> our<00:02:22.360> machine<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.730> you'll

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
and let's start our machine and you'll

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.970 
and let's start our machine and you'll
see<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.060> machine<00:02:25.390> boot<00:02:25.690> just<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:26.740> normal

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
see the machine boot just like a normal

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.210 
see the machine boot just like a normal

that now that our virtual machine is
back<00:05:48.250> up<00:05:48.520> and<00:05:48.670> running<00:05:48.760> what<00:05:49.750> we<00:05:49.840> want<00:05:50.050> to<00:05:50.140> do

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
back up and running what we want to do

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.480 
back up and running what we want to do
is<00:05:50.470> we<00:05:50.650> can<00:05:50.770> click<00:05:50.950> view<00:05:52.500> and<00:05:53.500> switch<00:05:54.250> to
