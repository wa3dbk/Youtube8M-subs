00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.550
 hello good and welcome to our 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.840
 new video of the yellow pokemon xlix in 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.090
 this time I will show you how 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.970
 get friend 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.110
 again without having passed friendship what 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.599
 Only here I have already had it 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.309
 but it can be done just before 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.070
 I realized that it could be done 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.000
 when I reviewed in the previous video 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.940
 when I opened the state of openness 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.010
 you look at the special statistic put 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.989
 21 what do we need them to have 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.350
 that of special the last enemy against 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.140
 the one that we fight for that we're going to do 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.920
 here another way to get another way 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.920
 to capture it 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.640
 ok the first thing we have to do is 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.940
 be on route 11 that is right at the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.230
 right of carmine city where is the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.230
 third leader of gyms 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.670
 and good what you have to do is 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.579
 as in previous videos try 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.530
 face the coach and push to be 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.530
 and here we use abra teleportation 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.990
 it catches us and as always we escape 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.580
 We all blocks and the menu 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.890
 practically as always we can not 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.680
 take out the menu and what we have to do 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.880
 First, unlock the menu by fighting 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.659
 with any other coach 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.759
 if we go if we go to the area where I was 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.890
 your coach the other coaches 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.930
 although we have not fought with them, 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.970
 We will fight them or leave it 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.020
 they do not find us we have blocked that 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.460
 that's why we're going to go to the ship because 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.500
 I had already been on the previous route 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.370
 eliminated all the all 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.100
 rival trainers 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.790
 and on the boat sure there 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.560
 trainers against whom I can 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.830
 fight because I have not been on the ship 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.830
 still 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.110
 see if this fight is important that the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.239
 enemy approaches us as you 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.099
 I explained in the previous video if we 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.560
 we put in front of him and he does not catch us and 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.330
 it moves the game is blocked and we have 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.950
 to do a turn on and off of the 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.190
 machine in this case a reset of the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.190
 emulator 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.490
 a leeds 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.930
 here you have one of my friends 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.909
 second I left it lying in the box 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.909
 and here we are going to use against Greece 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.910
 good to diego at the end I am roar and 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.910
 they take me out of my hand to fight 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.750
 14 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.800
 in these editions I do not know if you remember 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.810
 that if it went up is a level if you passed 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.580
 a level where he set off an attack without 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.360
 directly go up that level you had left 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.360
 without learning it 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.989
 they are horrible things but 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.790
 for me they were the best editions 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.879
 together 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.640
 to the crystal silver and gold editions but 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:56.410
 to the first ones not to the remakes that 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.180
 they have done that they are also very good 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.180
 but nothing like the originals 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.519
 surely I will be criticized 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.430
 people who have started to play more 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.019
 late that I and you will say you play editions 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.400
 of shit to the cameras or the new 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.290
 but no 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.570
 the people who enjoyed it when 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.180
 were these the first editions 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.430
 sure he understands me okay and we continue 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.180
 with the trick now I think we can 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.180
 to be yes 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.900
 what we have to do now is fight 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.130
 against a work at the next level of the 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.830
 that come out of this area that is where 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.110
 ran over here I came I'll catch the 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.580
 wta to be able to do the whole trick 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.580
 this one that I show you in the last video 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.950
 but I'm going to hit the fast 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.950
 because that way we go better 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.480
 in the end they will kill pikachu vesta 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:07.199
 already put yesterday fly the first to 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.199
 to be able to escape from the fighting 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.180
 we want a work 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.340
 and it does not even need to be killed 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.270
 simply with having it there as the last 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.270
 combat in the vouchers 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.270
 ah 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.990
 comes out of everything but a bloody open 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.990
 now 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.070
 that does not want to leave now is going to make 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.190
 this happens to be from a video of four 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:50.530
 minutes five minutes to one of eight 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.530
 words because he is to blame 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:59.129
 you do not want to leave 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:59.129
 because they come out click others 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.960
 finish 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.940
 bird 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.280
 so we're going to kill him 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.839
 he has not asked 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:23.859
 good, that's not worth it if 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.859
 escaped the same 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:31.730
 and now if we take and why 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:35.200
 now if we catch ourselves and we go to where 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.200
 there was the coach that 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.950
 the menu opens we only give it once 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.650
 and another one for us we could already 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:51.440
 have a third or a third 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.240
 generation of my music 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.870
 and well I think I 'm going to cut it here 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.720
 because I do not want another for another of mine 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.550
 and we leave it here, I hope that you 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.960
 have liked this trick also if it is 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:06.310
 so you see how I like to like me 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.950
 leave the odd comment because 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.810
 there are the super abandoned videos 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.810
 and greetings goodbye
