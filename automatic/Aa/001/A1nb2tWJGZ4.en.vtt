 our decor decoration channel 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.900
 that a screen is pretty 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 screen that we just saw web 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.309
 princess let's put even those 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.380
 beside furniture is what molds 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.270
 it has also come that we are going to 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.700
 need for this type of screen 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.110
 this then the truth simply wood 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.550
 of which you want can not 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.550
 leave even with 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.570
 with quartz we are going to occupy stairs of 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.610
 black wool quartz normal stairs and 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.220
 what is this the slab of that same 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.640
 Extra decoration material can be a 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.949
 vase can be what a picture is and 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.870
 it can be a chest or they can be chests 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.570
 speakers what you like bands 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.810
 here that picture was not this one here 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.750
 to the sprint stick 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.790
 of this you are going to remove 64 because it is 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.220
 a file is very good that's the 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.810
 statement that we can put extra very 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.250
 well that state too simple this 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.680
 I do it in order to have a 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.909
 interior decoration well let's go to 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.909
 start doing the screen 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.350
 let's do one to simulate one that 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.190
 we have a wall a wall here 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.900
 let's say you are the wall of your house not 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.900
 let her finish doing is prime 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.530
 but he takes it all crazy from the tastings 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.200
 that's our super wall 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.820
 originality at full 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.219
 although this has to go here from this 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.159
 side now let's do what is the 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.719
 legs on TV we are going to place one like this 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.549
 looking towards us after we give the 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.530
 turn completely and place the other 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.469
 so that we have legs 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.840
 we make a rectangle of 2 x 4 and already 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.880
 we will have the full screen so alone 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.890
 It looks chingona but we want to put 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.330
 some furniture not then how can 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.010
 make the furniture the furniture to make 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.220
 As you like, I will put them 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.370
 alone can they do so as well 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.060
 like that crazy style style 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.730
 European 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.360
 I'm going to leave it like this, even mouth 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.100
 down 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.040
 They can leave the furniture even like this 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.010
 like what I'm going to put 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.250
 they can not put it so simply 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.250
 same 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.000
 Now that it's as small as it would look 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.000
 same this wey 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.140
 supposes the same because 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.640
 this is and we are going to leave the found ones 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.920
 because I'm already castrated ok already found 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.450
 we have a ledge a little crazy che a 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.520
 good I do not repeat a piece of furniture a little crazy 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.010
 with this we are going to do it a little bit more 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.950
 this as well as more open and that what 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.810
 we do with the ladder is upside down 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.460
 let's remove the one on the left 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.280
 to put some flowers we are going to place 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.690
 here a few slabs and place another 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.640
 staircase because we carry the collection 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.530
 here on this side we are going to invite 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.080
 to do something different with the stairs 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.490
 and for this we are going to place this like this and 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.680
 then one found down like this 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.510
 the other one we are going to put it normally and 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.290
 we would have a little girl there 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.290
 where is he 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.530
 the furniture 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.620
 what are we going to do another here towards 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.650
 down ok and we would have another effect 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.709
 different from what the original moves 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.030
 and you can see everything mattress very well 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.430
 you play with the stairs when 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.220
 you can with what matters to you in 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.709
 this case what is this and then they will 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.750
 like good says is going to have been for 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.480
 example here we have a different 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.909
 where do you put your music discs where 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.379
 you put the memories the photograph can 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.870
 put some flowers here because 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.549
 it goes crazier with something here is the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.889
 stellar knows it here you're going to place another 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.510
 little flower and then nothing band 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.919
 this is a simple tutorial in fact what 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.930
 that matters on the screen not so much the 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:13.669
 Furniture can place some pictures 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.859
 so you have the screen as well as what 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:19.070

 bad is that they can not put anything inside 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.440
