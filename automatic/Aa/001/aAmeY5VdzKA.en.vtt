00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
with two pieces the power pack and then

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.050 
with two pieces the power pack and then
the<00:01:56.140> solar<00:01:56.439> panels<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.579> power<00:01:57.789> pack<00:01:58.030> is

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
the solar panels the power pack is

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.899 
the solar panels the power pack is
pretty<00:01:58.570> cool<00:01:58.810> it's<00:01:58.990> got<00:01:59.229> built-in<00:02:00.100> cable<00:02:00.579> here

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
pretty cool it's got built-in cable here

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.580 
pretty cool it's got built-in cable here
so<00:02:01.149> it's<00:02:01.329> got<00:02:01.539> USB<00:02:02.820> regular<00:02:03.820> size<00:02:03.999> and<00:02:04.590> then
