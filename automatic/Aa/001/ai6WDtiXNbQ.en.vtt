really<00:00:11.550> like<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:11.969> gun<00:00:12.179> quite<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> bit<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:13.019> have

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
really like this gun quite a bit I have

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.350 
really like this gun quite a bit I have
had<00:00:13.710> some<00:00:13.950> baubles<00:00:14.280> with<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:14.849> we<00:00:15.089> will<00:00:15.210> be

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
had some baubles with it so we will be

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.950 
had some baubles with it so we will be
working<00:00:15.599> on<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.199> as<00:00:16.529> well<00:00:17.090> I'm<00:00:18.090> either

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
working on that as well I'm either

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.200 
working on that as well I'm either
thinking<00:00:19.080> mag<00:00:19.619> issue<00:00:19.859> or<00:00:20.279> underpowered<00:00:20.789> ammo

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
thinking mag issue or underpowered ammo

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.939 
thinking mag issue or underpowered ammo
I've<00:00:21.449> been<00:00:21.570> using<00:00:21.750> some<00:00:22.020> bulk<00:00:22.260> ammo<00:00:22.500> Anna

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
I've been using some bulk ammo Anna

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.140 
I've been using some bulk ammo Anna
so<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.369> time<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.550> brought<00:00:23.760> out<00:00:23.910> some

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
so this time I brought out some

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.060 
so this time I brought out some
different<00:00:24.539> ammo<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.080> addition<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> bulk

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
different ammo in addition to the bulk

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.099 
different ammo in addition to the bulk
ammo<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.000> that'll<00:00:27.210> be<00:00:27.269> kind<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.630> side<00:00:27.869> note

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
ammo so that'll be kind of a side note

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.529 
ammo so that'll be kind of a side note
we'll<00:00:28.289> just<00:00:28.439> see<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.740> happens<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.539> when

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539

might<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> little<00:02:04.890> bit<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.130> limp-wristed<00:02:05.369> -

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
might be a little bit of limp-wristed -

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.490 
might be a little bit of limp-wristed -
okay<00:02:07.170> we'll<00:02:07.350> do<00:02:07.439> two<00:02:07.649> more<00:02:07.860> shots

good good now look at that look at your
grouping<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:21.220> those<00:02:21.490> there's<00:02:21.940> five<00:02:22.210> shots<00:02:22.570> all

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
grouping so those there's five shots all

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.440 
grouping so those there's five shots all
nice<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.620> group<00:02:23.770> together<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:25.150> then<00:02:25.270> that

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
nice and group together and then that

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.880 
nice and group together and then that
one<00:02:25.660> down<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.110> bottom<00:02:26.470> is<00:02:26.560> because<00:02:26.650> you

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
one down to the bottom is because you

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.410 
one down to the bottom is because you
jerk<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.340> trigger<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:27.910> when<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.120> get<00:02:28.300> that

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
jerk the trigger so when you get that

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.620 
jerk the trigger so when you get that
nice<00:02:28.660> trigger<00:02:29.020> pull<00:02:29.820> outs<00:02:30.820> that<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:31.060> work<00:02:31.240> on<00:02:31.390> to

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
nice trigger pull outs that I work on to

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:47.630 
nice trigger pull outs that I work on to
the<00:02:32.020> basics<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.590> not<00:02:32.740> jerking<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.520> trigger

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.500 

so<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.730> did<00:02:48.910> five<00:02:49.120> shots<00:02:49.420> just<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.780> kind<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.050> see

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
so I did five shots just to kind of see

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.690 
so I did five shots just to kind of see
where<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.660> was<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:53.830> think<00:02:53.860> at<00:02:54.370> least<00:02:54.580> with

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
where it was and I think at least with

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.880 
where it was and I think at least with
my<00:02:54.820> wife<00:02:55.030> on<00:02:55.300> those<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:55.690> was<00:02:55.780> some<00:02:56.410> limp<00:02:56.680> wrist

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
my wife on those it was some limp wrist

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.410 
my wife on those it was some limp wrist
in<00:02:57.040> going<00:02:57.280> on<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.580> there<00:02:57.700> wasn't<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:58.000> good<00:02:58.150> a

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
in going on so there wasn't a good a

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.860 
in going on so there wasn't a good a
good<00:02:58.990> enough<00:02:59.200> grip<00:03:00.240> we<00:03:01.240> are<00:03:01.360> doing<00:03:01.630> another

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
good enough grip we are doing another
