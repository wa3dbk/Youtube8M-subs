00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.759

in<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:42.099> lipstick<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:42.730> move<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.269> around<00:03:43.360> a

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
in the lipstick and move it around a

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:54.860 
in the lipstick and move it around a
such<00:03:44.799> if<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:46.239> want<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.599> process<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:47.019> speed<00:03:47.680> up

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.380 

because<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:55.950> friction<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.519> going<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.909> melt<00:03:57.090> it

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
because the friction is going to melt it

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.660 
because the friction is going to melt it
faster<00:03:58.170> and<00:04:00.530> there<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.650> go<00:04:01.830> don't<00:04:02.310> melt<00:04:02.519> it

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
faster and there you go don't melt it

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.289 
faster and there you go don't melt it
down<00:04:04.159> a<00:04:05.569> lot<00:04:06.569> faster<00:04:06.599> as<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.349> can<00:04:07.560> see<00:04:08.299> and

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
down a lot faster as you can see and

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:21.050 
down a lot faster as you can see and
that's<00:04:10.110> all<00:04:18.799> they<00:04:19.799> just<00:04:20.100> kind<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.489> let<00:04:20.699> it<00:04:20.790> dry

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
that's all they just kind of let it dry

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.629 
that's all they just kind of let it dry
before<00:04:21.419> you<00:04:22.169> use<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.680> obviously<00:04:23.280> because<00:04:23.520> you

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
before you use it obviously because you

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.090 
before you use it obviously because you
don't<00:04:23.790> want<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:24.000> bring<00:04:24.210> your<00:04:24.360> lips<00:04:25.100> there's

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
don't want to bring your lips there's

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.980 
don't want to bring your lips there's
always<00:04:26.400> that<00:04:26.550> one<00:04:26.610> special<00:04:26.940> person<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.720> might

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
always that one special person I might

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.380 
always that one special person I might
do<00:04:28.199> it<00:04:28.350> up<00:04:29.960> you<00:04:30.960> never<00:04:31.169> know
