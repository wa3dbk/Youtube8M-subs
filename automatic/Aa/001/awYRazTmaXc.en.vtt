00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.810 
so we'll go ahead and I'll show you guys
that<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.560> don't<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.829> much<00:01:53.009> power<00:01:53.310> there<00:01:53.549> so

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that we don't have much power there so

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.700 
that we don't have much power there so
I'm<00:01:53.909> gonna<00:01:54.030> go<00:01:54.180> ahead<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.720> power<00:01:55.439> down<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
I'm gonna go ahead and power down the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.340 
I'm gonna go ahead and power down the
phone<00:01:59.450> and<00:02:00.450> we'll<00:02:00.689> put<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.020> bootloader

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
phone and we'll put it in bootloader

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.800 
phone and we'll put it in bootloader
mode<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.360> see<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.659> says

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
mode so here you can see that says

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.010 
mode so here you can see that says
