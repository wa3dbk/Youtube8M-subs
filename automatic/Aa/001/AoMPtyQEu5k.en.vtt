this<00:00:00.390> is<00:00:00.510> my<00:00:00.659> tip<00:00:00.900> and<00:00:01.110> on<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.589> five<00:00:01.740> minutes

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
this is my tip and on to five minutes

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.599 
this is my tip and on to five minutes
and<00:00:02.330> I'm<00:00:03.330> going<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.570> be<00:00:03.689> talking<00:00:03.899> about

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:04.609 
and I'm going to be talking about

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:18.470 
and I'm going to be talking about
gaskets<00:00:05.810> try<00:00:06.810> quite<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.109> gaskets<00:00:17.480> alright

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
gaskets try quite the gaskets alright

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.439 
gaskets try quite the gaskets alright
I'm<00:00:19.470> here<00:00:19.500> today<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.070> talk<00:00:20.400> about<00:00:20.460> tri<00:00:21.029> clover

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
I'm here today to talk about tri clover

I'm here today to talk about tri clover
gaskets<00:00:22.279> now<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.340> gasket<00:00:23.789> there's<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> bit

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
gaskets now the gasket there's the bit

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.120 
gaskets now the gasket there's the bit
that<00:00:24.960> goes<00:00:25.050> between<00:00:26.689> to<00:00:27.689> try<00:00:27.900> clovers<00:00:28.289> that

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
that goes between to try clovers that

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.830 
that goes between to try clovers that
makes<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> seal<00:00:29.640> there<00:00:29.880> are<00:00:30.359> silicone

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
makes the seal there are silicone

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.299 
makes the seal there are silicone
gaskets<00:00:31.260> which<00:00:31.679> are<00:00:31.830> normally<00:00:32.099> clear

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
gaskets which are normally clear

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.479 
gaskets which are normally clear
although<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.270> get<00:00:33.450> them<00:00:33.540> as<00:00:33.630> white<00:00:33.809> and

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
although you can get them as white and

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.580 
although you can get them as white and
they<00:00:35.489> are<00:00:35.610> probably<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.030> most<00:00:36.590> common

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
they are probably the most common

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.680 
they are probably the most common
gaskets<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.340> get<00:00:38.520> they<00:00:39.480> get<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
gaskets that you can get they get a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.209 
gaskets that you can get they get a
little<00:00:39.780> bit<00:00:39.989> gummy<00:00:40.230> overtime<00:00:40.860> if<00:00:41.100> they're

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
little bit gummy overtime if they're

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.880 
little bit gummy overtime if they're
used<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.610> strong<00:00:41.879> acids<00:00:42.320> but<00:00:43.320> they<00:00:43.469> take<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
used with strong acids but they take the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
used with strong acids but they take the
highest<00:00:44.219> temperature<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.910> they<00:00:45.210> make<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
highest temperature and they make the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.910 
highest temperature and they make the
best<00:00:45.690> seal<00:00:46.079> because<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:46.620> they're<00:00:46.800> nice

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
best seal because you know they're nice

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.240 
best seal because you know they're nice
and<00:00:46.950> nice<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.760> soft<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:49.860> next<00:00:50.070> type<00:00:50.219> of

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
and nice and soft the next type of

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.069 
and nice and soft the next type of
gaskets<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:53.600> EPDM<00:00:54.600> gaskets

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
gaskets that you can get EPDM gaskets

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.529 
gaskets that you can get EPDM gaskets
now<00:00:55.800> these<00:00:55.980> take<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> little<00:00:56.489> bit<00:00:56.699> less<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
now these take a little bit less of the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.910 
now these take a little bit less of the
heat<00:00:57.690> tolerance<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.350> don't<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:58.680> like

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
heat tolerance so they don't really like

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.319 
heat tolerance so they don't really like
direct<00:00:59.430> heat<00:00:59.670> as<00:01:00.059> much<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:01.379> they<00:01:01.530> are<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:02.789> lot

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
direct heat as much but they are a lot

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.080 
direct heat as much but they are a lot
more<00:01:03.359> resistant<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.110> acids<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.220> these<00:01:05.880> would

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
more resistant to acids so these would

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.880 
more resistant to acids so these would
be<00:01:06.240> best<00:01:06.450> these<00:01:07.110> are<00:01:07.140> these<00:01:07.470> are<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> best

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
be best these are these are the best

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.380 
be best these are these are the best
gaskets<00:01:09.080> for<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.200> longevity<00:01:10.470> I'd<00:01:11.100> say<00:01:11.390> in

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
gaskets for your longevity I'd say in

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.640 
gaskets for your longevity I'd say in
your<00:01:12.510> system<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.350> they're<00:01:13.470> going<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
your system because they're going to

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.960 
your system because they're going to
last<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.950> lot<00:01:14.070> longer<00:01:14.130> than<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> silicon

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
last a lot longer than the silicon

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.090 
last a lot longer than the silicon
gasket<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:16.380> next<00:01:16.590> kind<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.799> guess<00:01:16.979> because

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
gasket the next kind of guess because

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.910 
gasket the next kind of guess because
you<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.820> PTFE<00:01:18.810> now<00:01:19.080> there<00:01:19.320> are<00:01:19.380> teflon

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you can get a PTFE now there are teflon

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.980 
you can get a PTFE now there are teflon
gaskets<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.060> they<00:01:21.240> take<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> very<00:01:21.810> high

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
gaskets and they take a very high

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.010 
gaskets and they take a very high
temperature<00:01:22.200> as<00:01:22.560> well<00:01:22.790> but<00:01:23.790> unlike<00:01:24.150> unlike

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
temperature as well but unlike unlike

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.670 
temperature as well but unlike unlike
the<00:01:25.909> silicone<00:01:26.909> gaskets<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:30.680> that

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the silicone gaskets and the and that

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.090 
the silicone gaskets and the and that
EPDM<00:01:32.280> gaskets<00:01:32.900> teflon<00:01:33.900> gaskets<00:01:34.560> are<00:01:34.710> heart

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
EPDM gaskets teflon gaskets are heart

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.770 
EPDM gaskets teflon gaskets are heart
so<00:01:35.490> they're<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:35.939> solid<00:01:36.509> yeah

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
so they're really solid yeah

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.270 
so they're really solid yeah
unfortunately<00:01:37.020> haven't<00:01:37.530> got<00:01:37.650> any<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:37.950> hand<00:01:38.100> at

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
unfortunately haven't got any on hand at

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.429 
unfortunately haven't got any on hand at
the<00:01:38.340> moment<00:01:38.750> now<00:01:39.750> there's<00:01:39.990> varying<00:01:40.290> different

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the moment now there's varying different

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.840 
the moment now there's varying different
things<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.009> want<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.549> with

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
things that you want to do with it with

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.749 
things that you want to do with it with
a<00:01:41.880> gasket<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.590> there's<00:01:43.590> probably<00:01:43.979> three<00:01:44.490> main

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
a gasket and there's probably three main

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.480 
a gasket and there's probably three main
features<00:01:45.530> this<00:01:46.530> first<00:01:46.829> feature<00:01:47.100> when<00:01:47.369> you're

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
features this first feature when you're

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.359 
features this first feature when you're
buying<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.759> gasket<00:01:48.829> there's<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> size<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
buying a gasket there's the size of the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.789 
buying a gasket there's the size of the
hole<00:01:50.579> inside<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.329> see<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.930> has<00:01:52.020> got<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> big<00:01:52.380> 50

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
hole inside it see this has got a big 50

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.999 
hole inside it see this has got a big 50
millimeter<00:01:53.159> hole<00:01:53.780> or<00:01:54.780> saw<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> big<00:01:55.259> 1<00:01:55.860> inch

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
millimeter hole or saw a big 1 inch

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.440 
millimeter hole or saw a big 1 inch
diameter<00:01:56.219> hole<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> half-inch<00:01:57.270> diameter

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
diameter hole for a half-inch diameter

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.800 
diameter hole for a half-inch diameter
pipe<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.469> there's<00:01:59.280> some<00:01:59.430> wasted<00:01:59.850> space<00:02:00.060> around

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
pipe so there's some wasted space around

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.959 
pipe so there's some wasted space around
here<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> B<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:02.610> stuck<00:02:02.820> in

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
here that the B is going to get stuck in

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.459 
here that the B is going to get stuck in
so<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:03.960> you're<00:02:04.079> gonna<00:02:04.229> use<00:02:04.920> half<00:02:05.399> inch<00:02:05.579> pipes

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
so if you're gonna use half inch pipes

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.029 
so if you're gonna use half inch pipes
these<00:02:07.469> gaskets<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.459> half<00:02:09.450> inch<00:02:09.569> roll<00:02:10.039> then

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
these gaskets with a half inch roll then

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.920 
these gaskets with a half inch roll then
you've<00:02:11.160> got<00:02:11.310> less<00:02:11.790> wasted<00:02:12.150> space<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.720> you've

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
you've got less wasted space and you've

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.210 
you've got less wasted space and you've
got

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
got

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.670 
got
or<00:02:13.280> seal<00:02:13.550> around<00:02:13.880> there<00:02:14.210> as<00:02:14.300> well<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.530> there's

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
or seal around there as well so there's

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.230 
or seal around there as well so there's
one<00:02:15.860> thing<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:17.630> next<00:02:17.810> thing<00:02:17.960> is<00:02:18.470> if<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:20.090> can

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
one thing the next thing is if you can

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.990 
one thing the next thing is if you can
get<00:02:20.360> guest<00:02:20.600> gets<00:02:20.810> with<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:20.990> flange<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:21.530> them<00:02:22.000> so

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
get guest gets with a flange on them so

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.280 
get guest gets with a flange on them so
this<00:02:23.120> one<00:02:23.300> is<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.480> flange<00:02:23.690> on<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:25.060> by<00:02:26.060> those

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
this one is the flange on it by those

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.270 
this one is the flange on it by those
cuz<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.320> don't<00:02:27.470> fall<00:02:27.680> off<00:02:29.530> these<00:02:30.530> gaskets<00:02:33.280> fall

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
cuz I don't fall off these gaskets fall

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.510 
cuz I don't fall off these gaskets fall
off<00:02:35.080> that's<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.230> pain<00:02:36.500> especially<00:02:36.980> when<00:02:37.310> it

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
off that's a pain especially when it

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.580 
off that's a pain especially when it
drops<00:02:37.780> splash<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.050> your<00:02:39.140> beer

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
drops splash and your beer

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.160 
drops splash and your beer
these<00:02:40.160> ones<00:02:40.960> will<00:02:41.960> stay<00:02:43.750> one<00:02:44.750> other<00:02:44.870> thing<00:02:45.080> to

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
these ones will stay one other thing to

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.670 
these ones will stay one other thing to
consider<00:02:45.290> with<00:02:45.650> your<00:02:45.740> gaskets<00:02:46.130> is<00:02:47.680> what

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
consider with your gaskets is what

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.710 
consider with your gaskets is what
application<00:02:49.340> are<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:49.790> using<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.180> Tri<00:02:50.360> clover

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
application are you using the Tri clover

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.780 
application are you using the Tri clover
on<00:02:50.810> if<00:02:51.709> you're<00:02:51.860> just<00:02:52.010> making<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.400> joint<00:02:52.610> like

on if you're just making a joint like
that

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
that

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.330 
that
that's<00:02:53.510> cool<00:02:53.720> that's<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:54.020> nice<00:02:54.200> physical<00:02:54.709> tight

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
that's cool that's a nice physical tight

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.970 
that's cool that's a nice physical tight
joint<00:02:55.730> because<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.360> silicon<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:57.530> nice<00:02:57.800> and

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
joint because the silicon is nice and

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.980 
joint because the silicon is nice and
soft<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:59.090> two<00:02:59.270> things<00:02:59.540> stick<00:02:59.840> together

soft and the two things stick together
really<00:03:00.350> well<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.940> then<00:03:01.940> take<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.150> clamp<00:03:02.450> off

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
really well and then take a clamp off

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.790 
really well and then take a clamp off
and<00:03:02.840> they're<00:03:02.930> still<00:03:03.080> gonna<00:03:03.230> sit<00:03:03.470> there<00:03:03.590> nicely

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
and they're still gonna sit there nicely

you using a favor but anyway if you want

you using a favor but anyway if you want

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
to use it for a raking arm so if it's

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.030 
to use it for a raking arm so if it's
going<00:03:16.340> into<00:03:16.520> a<00:03:16.580> kettle<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:18.200> has<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.440> a

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
going into a kettle and this has a a

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.400 
going into a kettle and this has a a
draw<00:03:19.580> tube<00:03:20.180> on<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:20.720> want<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:20.959> rake<00:03:21.170> the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
draw tube on it and you want to rake the

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.590 
draw tube on it and you want to rake the
draw<00:03:21.590> tool<00:03:21.830> around<00:03:24.310> that's<00:03:25.310> really<00:03:26.269> hard<00:03:26.480> to

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
draw tool around that's really hard to

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.060 
draw tool around that's really hard to
do<00:03:26.780> with<00:03:26.989> a<00:03:27.019> silicon<00:03:27.410> gasket<00:03:27.620> because<00:03:27.860> it

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
do with a silicon gasket because it

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.220 
do with a silicon gasket because it
sticks<00:03:28.310> so<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.330> coil<00:03:29.510> guess<00:03:29.810> that<00:03:29.989> you<00:03:30.080> want

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
sticks so the coil guess that you want

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.509 
sticks so the coil guess that you want
to<00:03:30.290> use<00:03:30.410> there<00:03:30.620> is<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:32.620> PTFE<00:03:33.620> gasket<00:03:34.040> which<00:03:34.370> is

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
to use there is a PTFE gasket which is

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:34.960 
to use there is a PTFE gasket which is

here<00:03:36.950> at<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.190> moment<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:37.580> they've<00:03:38.030> had<00:03:38.239> I

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
here at the moment but they've had I

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.570 
here at the moment but they've had I
guess<00:03:38.540> kids<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.500> they<00:03:40.010> take<00:03:40.160> a<00:03:40.220> bit<00:03:40.430> ball

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
guess kids so they take a bit ball

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
clamping to tighten them up but you can

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.720 
clamping to tighten them up but you can
just<00:03:42.530> undo<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.860> clamp<00:03:43.070> a<00:03:43.160> little<00:03:43.190> bit<00:03:43.549> and

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
just undo the clamp a little bit and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.970 
just undo the clamp a little bit and
then<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.840> can<00:03:44.989> turn<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.260> raking<00:03:45.530> now<00:03:45.650> because

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
then you can turn the raking now because

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.440 
then you can turn the raking now because
