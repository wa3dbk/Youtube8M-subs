freeride kite it has a great mix of
performance<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> surf<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.290> well<00:01:37.470> as

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
performance in the surf as well as

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.740 
performance in the surf as well as
freeride<00:01:38.010> ability<00:01:38.430> what<00:01:39.240> makes<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.600> great

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
freeride ability what makes it so great

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.030 
freeride ability what makes it so great
in<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> surf<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:40.830> quick

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
in the surf is that it's really quick

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.920 
in the surf is that it's really quick
turning<00:01:41.520> has<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> really<00:01:42.180> short<00:01:42.300> bar<00:01:42.600> stroke

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
turning has a really short bar stroke

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.890 
turning has a really short bar stroke
for<00:01:43.170> really<00:01:43.350> quick<00:01:43.560> D<00:01:43.710> power<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.280> also<00:01:45.180> great

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
for really quick D power and also great

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.900 
for really quick D power and also great
drifting<00:01:46.350> ability<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:47.400> makes<00:01:47.550> it<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:47.790> great

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
drifting ability what makes it so great

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.690 
drifting ability what makes it so great
for<00:01:48.119> freeride<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.650> it<00:01:49.710> has<00:01:49.830> great<00:01:50.369> sheet

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
for freeride is that it has great sheet

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.300 
for freeride is that it has great sheet
and<00:01:50.910> go<00:01:51.060> power<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.950> out<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and go power so you can get out and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.890 
and go power so you can get out and
really<00:01:53.520> light<00:01:53.670> win<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.060> packs<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.390> lot<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.630> power

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
really light win it packs a lot of power

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.260 
really light win it packs a lot of power
and<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.830> great<00:01:56.190> kite<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.729> jumping<00:01:57.090> as

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
and it's a great kite for jumping as

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.719 
and it's a great kite for jumping as
massive<00:01:57.690> hang<00:01:57.840> time<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.200> well

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.820 

so<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:06.150> waveshape<00:02:06.780> patch<00:02:07.320> at<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.650> back<00:02:07.799> of

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
so this waveshape patch at the back of

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.380 
so this waveshape patch at the back of
the<00:02:07.979> canopy<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.490> something<00:02:08.819> we've<00:02:08.940> updated

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the canopy is something we've updated

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.430 
the canopy is something we've updated
from<00:02:09.569> last<00:02:09.780> year<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.350> purpose<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.130> to

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
from last year the purpose of it is to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.020 
from last year the purpose of it is to
go<00:02:13.440> on<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.620> joint<00:02:14.040> between<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.459> super-tough

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
go on the joint between the super-tough

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.970 
go on the joint between the super-tough
Jack<00:02:15.600> run<00:02:15.810> at<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.020> trailing<00:02:16.260> edge<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.890> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
Jack run at the trailing edge and the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.800 
Jack run at the trailing edge and the
lighter<00:02:17.220> ripstop<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.300> main<00:02:18.480> part<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
lighter ripstop of the main part of the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.530 
lighter ripstop of the main part of the
canopy<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.459> what<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.580> does<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.120> diminishes

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
canopy and what it does is it diminishes

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.900 
canopy and what it does is it diminishes
the<00:02:21.660> chance<00:02:22.380> for<00:02:22.650> fatigue<00:02:23.069> right<00:02:23.489> along<00:02:23.760> this

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
the chance for fatigue right along this

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.910 
the chance for fatigue right along this
line<00:02:24.209> here<00:02:24.239> we've<00:02:25.230> made<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> little<00:02:25.800> bit

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
line here we've made it a little bit

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.160 
line here we've made it a little bit
deeper<00:02:26.100> wave<00:02:26.430> than<00:02:27.090> last<00:02:27.569> year<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.050> that

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
deeper wave than last year and that

00:02:28.170 --> 00:03:04.100 
deeper wave than last year and that
improves<00:02:28.650> its<00:02:28.830> function<00:02:29.160> we<00:02:29.280> think<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.550> it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.290 

the<00:03:05.110> 2014<00:03:06.010> rebel<00:03:06.370> we've<00:03:06.670> gone<00:03:06.820> back<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.270> a

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
the 2014 rebel we've gone back to a

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.750 
the 2014 rebel we've gone back to a
little<00:03:07.480> bit<00:03:07.690> deeper<00:03:08.070> profile<00:03:09.070> here<00:03:09.580> and

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
little bit deeper profile here and

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.360 
little bit deeper profile here and
throughout<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.690> canopy<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.380> what<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.160> does

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
throughout the canopy and what this does

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.670 
throughout the canopy and what this does
it<00:03:12.550> is<00:03:12.880> helps<00:03:13.210> the<00:03:13.390> kite<00:03:13.660> fly<00:03:14.050> forward<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
it is helps the kite fly forward in the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.070 
it is helps the kite fly forward in the
window<00:03:14.920> really<00:03:15.100> easily<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:15.870> transit<00:03:16.870> through

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
window really easily and transit through

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:53.280 
window really easily and transit through
the<00:03:17.170> wind<00:03:17.320> window<00:03:17.920> without<00:03:18.730> hesitation

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.679 

for<00:03:53.830> 2014<00:03:54.640> we<00:03:54.819> still<00:03:55.060> have<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.269> streamline

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
for 2014 we still have the streamline

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.229 
for 2014 we still have the streamline
struts<00:03:56.110> and<00:03:56.610> but<00:03:57.610> this<00:03:57.760> year<00:03:57.970> we've<00:03:58.120> added

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
struts and but this year we've added

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.449 
struts and but this year we've added
segments<00:03:58.930> down<00:03:59.260> here<00:03:59.560> in<00:03:59.680> this<00:03:59.799> section<00:03:59.860> that

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
segments down here in this section that

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.780 
segments down here in this section that
removed<00:04:01.390> wrinkles<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:02.489> slightly<00:04:03.489> improved

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
removed wrinkles and slightly improved

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:14.740 
removed wrinkles and slightly improved
performance

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.180 

the<00:04:15.750> rebel<00:04:16.109> really<00:04:16.350> is<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.650> perfect<00:04:17.070> height

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
the rebel really is the perfect height

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.130 
the rebel really is the perfect height
for<00:04:17.459> someone<00:04:17.760> looking<00:04:18.090> for<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.630> kite<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:19.019> is

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
for someone looking for a kite that is
