00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello guys well found in this 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.540
 new video by iphoneitalia.com 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.269
 today iphoneitalia new always version 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.580
 special focus iphone 6 as you wish 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.170
 call it back to talk about 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.170
 battery of the next iphone 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.220
 well guys here we are again today 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.910
 let's talk about the battery of the next iphone 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.100
 6 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.300
 then first of all the battery 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.699
 of the iPhone 5 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.780
 if it is right to take it as a term 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.489
 of comparison at least as regards 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.199
 iPhones is from 1500 60 miles per think 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.300
 to have said it well yes the number is 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.059
 that then the battery of the iPhone 5 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.800
 if to this amperage as we know not 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.860
 lasts a lot 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.159
 or rather it lasts longer than maybe a 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.080
 that of the iphone 4 of the iPhone 5 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.089
 however in short it is not one of the batteries 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.640
 the longest on the market this is 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.590
 no doubt how long the battery will last 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.750
 iPhone sign better than it will last 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.909
 the battery of the iPhone 6 will depend 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.439
 precisely from the type of battery that will come 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.780
 inserted in this device e 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.060
 especially from the amperage the good 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.009
 news there is good news and one 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.990
 bad news is the good news 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.590
 the iphone will mount a battery more 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.170
 capable therefore bigger able to 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.119
 therefore have a longer life with a 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.560
 greater amperage than that 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.319
 of the iPhone 5 s 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.270
 the bad news is that according to 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:37.240
 information thus emerged from the factories 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.590
 Chinese who is already in contact with 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.490
 the iPhone 6 with the production line 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.170
 of the iPhone 6 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.530
 however this improvement in terms 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.060
 There would be battery but it wouldn't be 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.759
 colossal then with regards to 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.429
 the iphone singers and not 4.7 inches 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.459
 it is said that the battery compared to 1560 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.939
 Milan loses the iPhone 5 could be 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:00.759
 from 1800 miles to 1,900 billion 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.130
 in short, including between these two broad 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.530
 therefore rays already already a 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.819
 improvement that there can be that can 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.770
 be interesting 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.690
 the problem is that the iPhone 6 anyway 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.020
 both this version and more 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.580
 5.5 inch large will mount one 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.420
 larger screen than that 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.280
 of the iPhone 5 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.370
 so all this extra battery 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.680
 it may not be noticed in the sense 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.019
 a larger screen and consumes more 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.310
 increased amperage as far as 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.440
 concerns the battery of the iPhone 6 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.330
 however, it may not be sufficient 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.480
 to guarantee an increase of the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.920
 performance even if just the employees 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.720
 at work they say that anyway 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.540
 iPhone 6 battery should last 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.879
 a little bit more than that of iphone 5 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.159
 if even in the smaller version the 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:48.030
 more good news I always do 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.470
 look at the numbers and the 5.5 model 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.269
 inch instead the larger one 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.420
 could have a ben 2 battery 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.879
 thousand and 500 milliamps now leaving 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.790
 stand the other market proposals but 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.049
 however considered true that as far as 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.640
 precisely the batteries of the iPhone do not 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.870
 be those more capable than most 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.420
 large and so on 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.099
 at the level of optimization in comparison 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.569
 with other android devices the iphone 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.209
 still behaves well then one 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.769
 2500 villiam pair battery on the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.659
 larger model could anyway 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.970
 really guarantee real performance 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.220
 really interesting consider that 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.620
 practically a thousand millian per in 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.419
 more than the current battery 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.280
 of the iPhone 5 if so in short there is to 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:28.560
 expect significant improvements in 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.959
 terms of autonomy on the iPhone more 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.120
 not so big on the 4.7 though 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.030
 in short, even on 4.7 of improvements 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.590
 there may be now because apple yes 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.690
 is deciding only this year to 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.359
 probably increase the battery 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.760
 on the iPhone because this year will come 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.599
 as we have probably seen 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.319
 increased in size by 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:51.660
 device is in the 4.7 inches as much 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.579
 more in the 5.5 inch version of the 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.290
 deliveries therefore in this case 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.930
 enlarging the device and not only it 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.120
 screen there is more space for a battery 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.819
 that as much as it will have to be thinner 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.889
 because in any case the device itself 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.510
 this advice will be much more 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.069
 thin 5 s 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.769
 at the same time it will be bigger and therefore 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.109
 the internal space guaranteed by the 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.389
 display but also usable for others 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.190
 purposes could be occupied in good 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.650
 own percentage of a battery more 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.780
 large and especially on the 5.5 inch 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.680
 you consider for example that the 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.710
 dad and children 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.350
 any ipad models are for a 70 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.050
 percent internally battery then 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.910
 having a bigger iphone will be 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.919
 possible to exploit not 70 percent 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.410
 of the battery device but 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.520
 certainly a higher percentage 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.380
 of the internal space of the device 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.449
 can be dedicated to the 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.229
 battery and therefore will be bigger will be 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.789
 longer lasting 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.250
 then clearly much will depend on 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.050
 optimization of ios 8 which will be mounted 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.410
 on iphone if you need to see how 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.000
 the icon will react to the spots and with 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.470
 the subsequent updates because maybe 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.830
 the battery could improve 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.240
 further with ios 8.1 we have seen 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.660
 than the battery of all the iphone 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.639
 has practically improved with ios 7.1 and 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.169
 later than the duration that 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.180
 had with the earliest versions of ios 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.740
 7 so I am very likely to be the 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.720
 optimization process 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.599
 battery will take a few more months 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.220
 even after the release of the iPhone 6 for 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.289
 arrive at an acceptable result 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.759
 however we say without a doubt the fact that 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.039
 the next iphone will be bigger and there 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:25.380
 bodes well for the battery not 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.849
 let's have high expectations though 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.560
 because at least on the model more 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.720
 small improvements could be 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.070
 in short, not so revolutionary 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.289
 guys, let's take what's coming 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.030
 iphone 6 bigger batteries hopefully 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.070
 longer lasting good guys for today too 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.919
 it's all was a hot news italy version 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.289
 special focus iphone 6 will be back on thursday 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.870
 next we will talk about the name of the neighbor 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.130
 iphone because you call the board 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.289
 we all call in a yes but apple 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.150
 it might surprise us then week 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:52.830
 next we'll talk about what they are 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.650
 alternative names for the advice 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.060
 probable for the two new devices of 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.620
 apple house 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.849
 I am Andrea Cervone I thank you for
