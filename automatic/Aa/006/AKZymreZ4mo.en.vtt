00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
think that's needs how can we be better

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.640 
think that's needs how can we be better
the<00:01:28.120> next<00:01:28.270> day<00:01:28.420> or<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.720> last<00:01:28.870> day<00:01:29.140> in<00:01:29.380> our<00:01:29.470> and
