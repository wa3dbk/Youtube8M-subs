00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
same category we have several categories

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.569 
same category we have several categories
here<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.020> if<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.620> same<00:00:34.829> category<00:00:35.010> I

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
here so if it is in the same category I

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.139 
here so if it is in the same category I
would<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.090> please<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.809> round<00:00:37.110> up<00:00:37.380> if

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
it is one that you decide later on it's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.639 
it is one that you decide later on it's
not<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.570> much<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:42.899> you're<00:00:43.050> fast<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.500> can

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
not so much like you're fast you can

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.029 
not so much like you're fast you can
round<00:00:43.890> down<00:00:44.870> but<00:00:45.870> don't<00:00:46.079> round<00:00:46.530> down<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
round down but don't round down to a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.799 
round down but don't round down to a
half<00:00:47.250> decimal<00:00:47.760> only<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> whole<00:00:48.539> number

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
half decimal only to a whole number

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.299 
half decimal only to a whole number
mm-hmm<00:00:49.500> okay

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
mm-hmm okay

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.400 
mm-hmm okay
so<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.660> example<00:00:52.969> what<00:00:53.969> one<00:00:54.420> good<00:00:54.750> one

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
so for example what one good one

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.479 
so for example what one good one

it means schnell move over dummkopf
you're<00:02:21.150> going<00:02:21.299> too<00:02:21.420> slow<00:02:21.450> I'm<00:02:22.079> in<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.319> hurry

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.930 

this<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:35.299> fast<00:02:36.470> deprivation<00:02:37.940> experiment

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
this is the fast deprivation experiment

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.240 
this is the fast deprivation experiment
and<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.970> slowed<00:02:41.970> him<00:02:42.120> down<00:02:42.290> even<00:02:43.290> more<00:02:43.410> you're

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
and so slowed him down even more you're

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.580 
and so slowed him down even more you're
going<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.579> see<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> lot<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.120> images<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:46.380> want

we've<00:03:26.930> learned<00:03:27.260> much<00:03:27.500> about<00:03:27.710> fast<00:03:28.490> but<00:03:29.030> still

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
we've learned much about fast but still

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.290

ships<00:04:31.350> are<00:04:31.500> fast<00:04:31.740> all<00:04:32.340> right<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:35.300> hope<00:04:37.130> this

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
ships are fast all right I hope this

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.800 
ships are fast all right I hope this
that's<00:04:38.760> pretty<00:04:38.880> much<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.210> same<00:04:39.360> as<00:04:39.570> when<00:04:39.720> you

about fast than anyone had ever known
about<00:04:45.990> fast<00:04:46.850> we<00:04:47.850> went<00:04:48.000> deeper<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:48.810> anyone<00:04:49.470> was
