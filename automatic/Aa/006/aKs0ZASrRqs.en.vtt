00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
uh like me this was my favorite figure

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.510 
uh like me this was my favorite figure
evolved<00:00:45.480> um<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.930> all<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> Digimon<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.980> thought

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
evolved um of all the Digimon I thought

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.350 
evolved um of all the Digimon I thought
he<00:00:47.640> was<00:00:47.730> pretty<00:00:47.910> cool

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
he was pretty cool

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.479 
he was pretty cool
concerning<00:00:48.960> looks<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> t-rex<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:50.399> this

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
concerning looks like a t-rex for this

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.520 
concerning looks like a t-rex for this
one<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.879> looks<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.270> he<00:00:51.390> had<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.719> bit<00:00:51.899> too<00:00:52.170> many

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
one it looks like he had a bit too many

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.020 
one it looks like he had a bit too many

Krispy Kreme Doughnuts

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.630 
Krispy Kreme Doughnuts
because<00:00:54.360> honestly<00:00:54.870> he's<00:00:55.620> pretty<00:00:56.129> fat<00:00:56.340> but

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
because honestly he's pretty fat but

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.189 
because honestly he's pretty fat but
that's<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.149> compensate<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.960> all<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that's just to compensate for all the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.319 
that's just to compensate for all the
other<00:00:58.770> stuff<00:00:59.280> inside<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.670> him<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.210> can

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
other stuff inside of him so we can

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.349 
other stuff inside of him so we can
digivolve<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.609> and<00:01:02.609> I'm<00:01:02.730> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.910> show<00:01:03.090> you

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
digivolve so and I'm going to show you

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.410 
digivolve so and I'm going to show you
how<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.280> turn<00:01:05.280> him<00:01:05.519> back<00:01:05.549> enough<00:01:06.119> metal

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
how to turn him back enough metal

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.460 
how to turn him back enough metal

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.470 

and<00:01:55.440> on<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.830> bottom<00:01:57.290> this<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.830> tail<00:01:59.480> that

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
and on the bottom this like tail that

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:14.240 
and on the bottom this like tail that
comes<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.470> folds<00:02:01.890> right<00:02:02.040> out<00:02:13.070> again<00:02:14.070> the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
comes out just folds right out again the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.920 
comes out just folds right out again the
tough<00:02:14.460> part<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:15.170> getting<00:02:16.550> everything<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:18.630> fit

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
tough part is getting everything to fit

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.300 
tough part is getting everything to fit
inside<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.950> little<00:02:20.130> fat<00:02:20.580> gut<00:02:20.910> abyss<00:02:22.310> because

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
inside that little fat gut abyss because

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.710 
inside that little fat gut abyss because
I'm<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.880> he's<00:02:24.180> very<00:02:24.510> bad<00:02:26.330> now<00:02:27.330> another

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
I'm just like he's very bad now another

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.900 
I'm just like he's very bad now another
part<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.440> got<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.740> do<00:02:28.980> as<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.459> switch<00:02:29.730> around

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
part you got to do as you switch around

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.570 
part you got to do as you switch around
your<00:02:30.330> chest<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.140> he<00:02:31.170> has<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.530> chest<00:02:31.890> plates

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:48.910 

and<00:02:38.580> kind<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.660> pushes<00:02:40.260> together

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.570 

so<00:02:49.920> what<00:02:50.280> though<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.760> arm<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.390> definitely<00:02:51.750> a

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
so what though that arm is definitely a

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.100 
so what though that arm is definitely a
tricky<00:02:53.580> one<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.209> pull<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.660> through<00:02:54.990> the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
tricky one and you pull that through the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.030 
tricky one and you pull that through the
horn<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.030> pretty<00:02:57.270> much<00:02:57.390> snaps<00:02:57.990> together

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.310
