super simple and you should probably put

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.760 
super simple and you should probably put
the<00:02:11.459> files<00:02:11.970> at<00:02:12.270> the

that's<00:02:32.480> really<00:02:32.690> as<00:02:33.080> simple<00:02:33.410> as<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.830> is<00:02:33.860> I'm

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
that's really as simple as it is I'm

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.980 
that's really as simple as it is I'm
don't<00:02:35.150> know<00:02:35.270> how<00:02:35.420> long<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.750> gonna<00:02:35.870> take

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
don't know how long this is gonna take

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.790 
don't know how long this is gonna take
but<00:02:36.410> I<00:02:36.470> might<00:02:36.740> cut<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.400> video<00:02:37.670> if<00:02:38.600> it<00:02:38.800> takes

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
but I might cut this video if it takes

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.960 
but I might cut this video if it takes
very<00:02:39.950> long<00:02:41.380> but<00:02:42.380> even<00:02:42.830> until<00:02:43.130> then<00:02:43.280> keep<00:02:43.790> in

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
very long but even until then keep in

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.220 
very long but even until then keep in
mind<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.240> this<00:02:44.330> does<00:02:44.390> not<00:02:44.570> void<00:02:45.020> your

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
mind that this does not void your

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.490 
mind that this does not void your
warranty<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.430> should<00:02:46.850> do<00:02:47.290> recovery<00:02:48.290> of

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
warranty and you should do recovery of

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.240 
warranty and you should do recovery of
your<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:49.760> mean<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.570> backup<00:02:50.990> of<00:02:51.080> all<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:52.100> user

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
your I mean a backup of all the user

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.690 
your I mean a backup of all the user
settings<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:53.210> can<00:02:53.390> use<00:02:53.600> up<00:02:53.840> hose<00:02:54.130> own<00:02:55.130> backup

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
settings you can use up hose own backup

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.610 
settings you can use up hose own backup
and<00:02:55.880> recovery<00:02:56.030> tool<00:02:56.480> but<00:02:56.690> I<00:02:56.900> don't<00:02:57.350> really

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
and recovery tool but I don't really

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.040 
and recovery tool but I don't really
advise<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.160> do<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.430> because<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:59.060> loses<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.780> lot

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
advise to do that because it loses a lot

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.440 
advise to do that because it loses a lot
of<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.320> data<00:03:00.500> sometimes<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.910> works<00:03:02.120> for<00:03:02.330> me

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
of the data sometimes it works for me

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.660 
of the data sometimes it works for me
for<00:03:02.660> most<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:03.020> the<00:03:03.140> applications<00:03:03.680> but<00:03:04.490> then

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
for most of the applications but then

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.820 
for most of the applications but then
for<00:03:05.000> some<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.540> doesn't<00:03:05.960> and<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.680> then

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
for some it doesn't and and then

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.540 
for some it doesn't and and then
sometimes<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:08.110> backs<00:03:09.110> up<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.560> launcher<00:03:10.430> as

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
sometimes it backs up the launcher as

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.250 
sometimes it backs up the launcher as
well<00:03:10.730> as<00:03:10.850> sometimes<00:03:11.210> it<00:03:11.390> doesn't<00:03:11.600> so<00:03:12.140> it's

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
well as sometimes it doesn't so it's

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.590 
well as sometimes it doesn't so it's
really<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.500> hit<00:03:12.860> or<00:03:13.010> miss<00:03:13.270> it's<00:03:14.270> better<00:03:14.450> than

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
really a hit or miss it's better than

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.190 
really a hit or miss it's better than
nothing<00:03:14.960> but<00:03:15.490> I<00:03:16.570> probably<00:03:17.570> referred<00:03:18.020> to

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
nothing but I probably referred to

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.949 
nothing but I probably referred to
something<00:03:18.530> like<00:03:18.680> titanium<00:03:19.130> backup<00:03:19.550> if<00:03:19.880> if<00:03:20.750> you

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
something like titanium backup if if you

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.430 
something like titanium backup if if you
want<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.200> be<00:03:21.320> sure<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.660> keeping<00:03:23.660> all<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.930> data

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
want to be sure of keeping all the data

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.960 
want to be sure of keeping all the data
I'm<00:03:24.680> not<00:03:24.860> very<00:03:27.190> worried<00:03:28.190> about<00:03:28.250> keeping<00:03:28.700> my

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
I'm not very worried about keeping my

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.940 
I'm not very worried about keeping my
data<00:03:29.209> in<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.540> applications<00:03:30.110> because<00:03:30.530> I<00:03:30.709> don't

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
data in the applications because I don't

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.220 
data in the applications because I don't
I<00:03:31.190> don't<00:03:31.400> do<00:03:31.550> any<00:03:31.730> gaming<00:03:32.150> or<00:03:32.510> or<00:03:32.840> anything

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
I don't do any gaming or or anything

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.890 
I don't do any gaming or or anything
where<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.430> would<00:03:34.610> lose<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.820> lot<00:03:34.970> of<00:03:35.120> my<00:03:35.390> progress

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
where I would lose a lot of my progress

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.350 
where I would lose a lot of my progress
but<00:03:36.530> if<00:03:36.740> you<00:03:37.130> if<00:03:37.459> you<00:03:37.580> do<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.700> keep<00:03:38.060> in<00:03:38.209> mind

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
but if you if you do that keep in mind

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.540 
but if you if you do that keep in mind
that<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:38.570> should<00:03:38.600> always<00:03:39.370> back<00:03:40.370> up<00:03:40.400> your
