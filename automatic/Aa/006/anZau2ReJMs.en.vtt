00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.610
 The little gal , it is logical that 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.530
 they will grow in the future but for 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.220

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.840

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.579

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.450

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:47.069

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:51.079

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.669

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.980

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.090
 cuter I made this, it was almost to 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.540
 Sic says no 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.599

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.269
 I thought it was cooler 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.909
 unfortunately it was not all that I 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.470
 hoped it's not a cute fish but hey 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.750
 it's very hidden 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.900
 I like something more alive in the 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.840
 block more colors things understood 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.209
