app store or Play Store the helicopter
itself<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.369> amazing<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.060> comes<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
itself is amazing and it comes to the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.599 
itself is amazing and it comes to the
built<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.900> gyro<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.800> get<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> very<00:00:26.160> stable

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
built in gyro so you get a very stable

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.910 
built in gyro so you get a very stable
flight<00:00:27.150> whether<00:00:27.539> you're<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> beginner<00:00:27.960> or<00:00:28.439> an

expert but what else do you get inside

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.950 
expert but what else do you get inside
the<00:00:31.769> box<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.669> obviously<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> copter

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the box so obviously you get the copter

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.229 
the box so obviously you get the copter
itself<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.649> then<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.160> get<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.489> cable<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.180> USB

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
itself and then you get the cable a USB

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.470 
itself and then you get the cable a USB
cable<00:00:37.200> which<00:00:37.320> charges<00:00:37.800> both<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.790> helicopter

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
cable which charges both the helicopter

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.530 
cable which charges both the helicopter
and<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.590> transmitter<00:00:41.309> now<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.000> transmitter

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and the transmitter now the transmitter

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.720 
and the transmitter now the transmitter
you<00:00:42.719> then<00:00:42.870> plug<00:00:43.110> into<00:00:43.350> your<00:00:43.530> phone<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:43.920> that's

you then plug into your phone and that's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.700 
you then plug into your phone and that's
how<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.149> becomes<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.690> remote<00:00:45.989> control<00:00:46.500> as

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
how it becomes the remote control as

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.740 
how it becomes the remote control as
this<00:00:46.890> connects<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.550> helicopter<00:00:48.120> you

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
this connects for the helicopter you

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.720 
this connects for the helicopter you
also<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> toolkit<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:49.920> extra<00:00:50.340> rotary

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
also get a toolkit with extra rotary

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.700 
also get a toolkit with extra rotary

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
blades in case you have any accidents

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.619 
blades in case you have any accidents
and<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.699> your<00:00:53.940> instruction

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and then you have your instruction

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.290 
and then you have your instruction
