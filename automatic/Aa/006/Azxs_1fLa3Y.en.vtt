hey everybody it's steve from B&amp;H photo

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.669 
hey everybody it's steve from B&amp;H photo
and<00:00:11.160> i'm<00:00:11.400> here<00:00:11.580> with<00:00:11.730> Colin<00:00:12.240> Gwen<00:00:12.599> from<00:00:13.259> 3d

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
and i'm here with Colin Gwen from 3d

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.289 
and i'm here with Colin Gwen from 3d
robotics<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.519> we're<00:00:14.790> going<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:14.969> talk<00:00:15.120> about

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
robotics and we're going to talk about

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.349 
robotics and we're going to talk about
the<00:00:15.660> new<00:00:15.990> solo<00:00:16.699> absolutely<00:00:17.699> yeah<00:00:17.910> super

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
the new solo absolutely yeah super

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.480 
the new solo absolutely yeah super
excited<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.710> got<00:00:19.920> some<00:00:20.130> heft<00:00:20.400> to

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
excited so this is it's got some heft to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.029 
excited so this is it's got some heft to
it<00:00:20.609> but<00:00:23.060> there<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.240> flowing<00:00:24.890> it's<00:00:25.890> pretty

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
it but there it is flowing it's pretty

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.429 
it but there it is flowing it's pretty
quiet<00:00:26.250> yeah<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.330> not<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.960> not<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.289> we've

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
quiet yeah it's not it's not that we've

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.830 
quiet yeah it's not it's not that we've
got<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> really<00:00:28.890> tuned<00:00:29.220> propulsion<00:00:29.789> system<00:00:30.179> we

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
got a really tuned propulsion system we

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.690 
got a really tuned propulsion system we
did<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> lot<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.320> aeronautical<00:00:32.009> engineering<00:00:32.460> on

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
did a lot of aeronautical engineering on

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.729 
did a lot of aeronautical engineering on
the<00:00:32.850> propeller<00:00:33.120> design<00:00:33.600> which<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.260> why<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:34.649> a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
the propeller design which is why it's a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.380 
the propeller design which is why it's a
little<00:00:34.950> quieter<00:00:35.070> which<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.850> why<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.180> very

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
little quieter which is why it's very

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.510 
little quieter which is why it's very
efficient<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.710> feel<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.219> heavier

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
efficient as you can feel it's a heavier

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.100 
efficient as you can feel it's a heavier
system<00:00:38.910> which<00:00:39.030> means<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.390> fight<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> lot<00:00:39.989> of

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
system which means it can fight a lot of

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.190 
system which means it can fight a lot of
wind<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.829> flies<00:00:41.160> 55<00:00:41.820> miles<00:00:42.090> an<00:00:42.270> hour<00:00:42.390> well<00:00:43.020> it

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
wind it flies 55 miles an hour well it

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.650 
wind it flies 55 miles an hour well it
is<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.410> very<00:00:43.710> powerful<00:00:43.950> little<00:00:44.309> machine<00:00:44.700> but

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
is a very powerful little machine but

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.500 
is a very powerful little machine but
yet<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.110> small<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.559> pretty<00:00:47.070> quiet<00:00:47.399> now<00:00:48.329> this

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
yet it's small and pretty quiet now this

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240 
yet it's small and pretty quiet now this
is<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.079> basically<00:00:49.440> out<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.980> box

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
is this is basically out of the box

is<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.759> designed<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> green

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
is that we we designed this as a green

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.920 
is that we we designed this as a green

part of getting good shot is the control

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.209 
part of getting good shot is the control
it's<00:02:00.299> actually<00:02:00.420> getting<00:02:00.960> dynamic<00:02:01.770> shots

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
it's actually getting dynamic shots

basically a slider in the sky you've
just<00:03:32.580> set<00:03:33.030> up<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.209> slider<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:34.050> know<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.770> can<00:03:34.950> go

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
just set up a slider you know you can go

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.250 
just set up a slider you know you can go
back<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.370> forth<00:03:35.670> yourself<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.420> just<00:03:37.050> do

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
back and forth yourself and just do

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260 
back and forth yourself and just do

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
that point I target it I hit orbit and

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.310 
that point I target it I hit orbit and
then<00:04:29.280> I<00:04:29.370> hit<00:04:29.580> play<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:30.090> it<00:04:30.810> just<00:04:31.020> starts

then I hit play and it just starts

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.260 
then I hit play and it just starts
perfectly<00:04:32.040> orbiting<00:04:32.580> around<00:04:32.700> that<00:04:33.030> subject

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
when I hit play I can have it set to

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.220 
when I hit play I can have it set to
automatically<00:04:36.240> start<00:04:36.600> rolling<00:04:36.870> on<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.050> GoPro

automatically start rolling on the GoPro
right<00:04:37.920> when<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.310> hit<00:04:38.520> stop<00:04:38.850> it<00:04:39.120> automatically

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
right when I hit stop it automatically

a there's not a real physical limit I

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.800 
a there's not a real physical limit I
mean<00:04:47.280> there's<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.580> good<00:04:47.790> bang<00:04:48.030> you<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:48.330> yourself

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
mean there's a good bang you it yourself

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.050 
mean there's a good bang you it yourself
you<00:04:49.380> can<00:04:49.560> increase<00:04:49.890> your<00:04:50.040> radius<00:04:50.580> by<00:04:50.730> pulling

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
you can increase your radius by pulling

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.540 
you can increase your radius by pulling
back<00:04:51.270> not<00:04:51.630> to<00:04:51.810> decrease<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.380> radius<00:04:52.740> if<00:04:53.250> I<00:04:53.490> do

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
back not to decrease the radius if I do

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.610 
back not to decrease the radius if I do
altitude<00:04:54.270> up<00:04:54.420> and<00:04:54.570> down<00:04:54.720> while<00:04:54.990> it's<00:04:55.200> orbiting

whatever you had in target you guys have
really<00:05:00.060> thought<00:05:00.360> out<00:05:00.600> this<00:05:00.780> I<00:05:00.960> hear<00:05:01.950> about

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
really thought out this I hear about

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.420 
really thought out this I hear about
Josh<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.910> optical<00:05:03.660> flow<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.530> part<00:05:05.190> of<00:05:05.310> the

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
Josh the optical flow so part of the

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.820 
Josh the optical flow so part of the
solo<00:05:05.670> story<00:05:06.060> is<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.600> ability<00:05:06.870> to<00:05:07.170> update<00:05:07.410> it

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
solo story is the ability to update it

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.860 
solo story is the ability to update it
and<00:05:07.950> expand<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.580> over<00:05:08.820> time<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.390> we<00:05:09.540> want<00:05:09.750> the

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
and expand it over time and we want the

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.330 
and expand it over time and we want the
system<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.230> just<00:05:10.440> get<00:05:10.590> better<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:10.950> better<00:05:11.100> and

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
system to just get better and better and

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.220 
system to just get better and better and
better<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.480> first<00:05:12.720> part<00:05:12.870> of<00:05:12.990> that<00:05:13.050> is

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
better so the first part of that is

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.020 
better so the first part of that is
being<00:05:13.470> built<00:05:13.740> on<00:05:13.830> computers<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.550> being<00:05:14.940> able

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
crash it doesn't affect the autopilot so

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.080 
crash it doesn't affect the autopilot so
it'll<00:05:55.920> still<00:05:56.130> it's<00:05:56.310> a<00:05:56.460> domain<00:05:56.850> change
