00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.120
 hello good today in this video I'm going to 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.070
 explain them in a very simple way and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.520
 Quick to draw the face of the character 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.790
 of naruto we would start doing this 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.790
 line 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:34.570
 we would do this curve so now we will 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:39.430
 well above and to the other side 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:43.680
 so we will go down and we will unite everything now 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.680
 we will draw the central part 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:52.110
 so we'll do like a small insert like this 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.220
 this side and we join it 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.980
 Now in this money we have 123 points to 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.980
 each side and this symbol in the middle 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.890
 Y 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.450
 that piquito 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.280
 now we will draw the hair we will do 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.650
 here in the middle that line 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.100
 and it consists in making little pits 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.740
 we will do 1 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.040
 and another one like that 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.820
 another one over here 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.490
 A) Yes 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.250
 this other 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.540
 right here in the middle and on the other side 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.450
 we would do the same 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.500
 we would see their little pits 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.430
 already going down 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.430
 another one 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.939
 this last one we will do it from this 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.150
 third piquito would do that and 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:58.500
 from this third equal 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:01.410
 so now of this we find in this and in 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.160
 this side like this we would have done 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.740
 the hair now we go with the face leaving 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.289
 some spaces on each side we will 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.980
 down 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:18.900
 we'll start here 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:23.599
 and we'll go up here as well leaving a 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.599
 space there we will give the ears 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.400
 this curved and until here we will give the 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:33.080
 inner shape 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.120
 the other ear like 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.159
 we will do so 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.629
 well up here and the way of the 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:44.610
 inside so now we will draw you the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:48.790
 first eye will be here 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.600
 and we see it in this way we will draw 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.590
 in the place 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.590
 form well inside we will do 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.170
 this circle 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.170
 a little dot and I will now do 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.420
 in this line 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.470
 this curve is around here and the other eye 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.860
 which will be another curve 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.950
 this other line this small line and 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.440
 as if the eye were closed 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.430
 brush 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:26.220
 so now we will give mouth to mouth 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.220
 here we will do so 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.100
 we will unite it for something 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.730
 I will make this row of teeth these two 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.940
 small lines the nose would be two 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.250
 curves so small with dots and 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.000
 the three lines that leads to each side of 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.950
 the blackboard 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.270
 yes 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.490
 and so 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.020
 and we would have drawn in a way 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.610
 very simple and fast 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.340
 the character in high 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.890
 I hope you liked that I have 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.620
 it was very easy to do this 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.040
 drawing and see you in my next 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.040
 videos
