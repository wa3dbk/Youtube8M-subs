00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hello there I am again I have half dm 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.710
 lea shocked the bathing department me that 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.440
 first time in my life of the bathtub 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.660
 yes it is indeed so I am 34 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.639
 and never had a bathtub of its own 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.080
 I did not have any with my parents 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.699
 Although we had a large apartment but 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.199
 we only had such a tiny little bathroom 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.359
 soft again in the age is so 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.250
 the same now claim in the apartment where 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.600
 I lived then so in the wg 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.550
 in which I lived the last ten 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.740
 years and now I have that first time 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.560
 a bathtub and have me very much 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.320
 happy that many things in the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.329
 but bought midsummer so what 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.190
 which must then be held sometimes simply 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.140
 when it is summer and you are 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.329
 I just want to buy bathing suits 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.800
 so i just show you now 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.059
 so all around what I bought and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.550
 nonsense does not last that long 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:53.879
 I have this cuddle from Kneip here 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:57.059
 Bad not so good so tasty 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.590
 So I actually spice up more 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.379
 Christmassy so really 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.690
 not summery but maybe so 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.430
 a rainy summer evening where it is 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.520
 neither was it so when I had mine 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.170
 We also times here what determines toll 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.360
 so it kinda smells like christmas 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.430
 but somehow orient and somehow like 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.380
 Christmas in the orient so totally delicious 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.780
 and then I bought this 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.710
 Also from Kneipp this nursing oil beard 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.619
 coat flowers 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.390
 I got the skincare oil from them 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.939
 directly on the skin takes place 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.740
 Body lotion and love that hot and heartfelt 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.150
 and that for 20 years even 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.579
 safer backing I think so too 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.229
 not for ten years and I have that 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.210
 now bought this one does as 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.150
 bath additive give it pure and smells 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.400
 as well and 80 certain dream so 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.390
 if I imagine my whole 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.820
 bathroom and then the whole 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.369
 patrick and then that's me 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.399
 like an oil from determined super nice 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.300
 and then that fits here too 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.620
 the cream asked because I thought 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.090
 that's one of my favorites 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.250
 Maybe I have to do it all 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.550
 have what there is even yes that 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.650
 is precisely the one discrete non Kremlin 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.150
 one is care oil bath and the other 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.100
 It is nonsense and then I already have 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.330
 as a precaution to the winter thought yes the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.270
 next winter comes to everyone 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.900
 fall and got herbs from barriers 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.850
 I got it that made me so smell 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.380
 what does my omi always remember 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.820
 had and if i was with my grandma too 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.660
 of course I have always been there 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:26.080
 bathed and that smells like one 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.350
 spruce forest so a bit extreme 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.030
 but there were childhood memories 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.430
 just for me, I believe that 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.020
 At that time, sometime or two, pine-jaw was called 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.000
 bath additive and certainly exists today 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.850
 even but I thought I'll buy 'times 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.680
 then have the adapted variant of it 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.560
 I bought three sons here 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.450
 I think that's always the case for one 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.970
 Agreed thought and I have to you 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.620
 love lavender totally totally 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.710
 That's why I'm right here too 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.900
 conceived tilting pearls dreams of 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.600
 waldrapp all the dreams of provence 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:03.160
 I like lavender and lavender 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.020
 pleasant as room scent and that reminds 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.209
 somehow so pure relaxation 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.650
 summer meadow i me i can do it 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.440
 do not describe so in the end is for 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.000
 me just such a wellness smell and 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.940
 I thought that in a bathtub 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.920
 certainly the blockbuster just like 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.750
 then this dresdner essence 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.590
 also lavender with minister, however 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.000
 while relaxing bath I am so happy 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.640
 on it and me out could it now 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.260
 get really cold so I the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.820
 can take advantage of where a man should always 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.570
 Be careful with what you look at 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.520
 wishes 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.380
 no i take that back i want 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.260
 does not get cold like that and then I have 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.780
 still from valeo true moments respite 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.090
 I like to relax with a jasmine fragrance 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.650
 also very much and I'm really curious 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.490
 you can not smell that 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.020
 times as sniff it because the 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.420
 are closed and judge is that 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.600
 I scoffed then this set here 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.560
 and I have to have it so it stands on it 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.060
 when at home for 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.130
 that I would have been 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.540
 that's exactly what is in my mind 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.090
 come when I saw what was there 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.300
 everything is inside that is really his son 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.090
 spoiled package where you get it right 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.770
 what can treat and that's all that 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.500
 smell peony and there are so 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.920
 different things in it so twice 60 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:19.070
 gram bades 126 milliliters face mask 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.930
 2 x 8 millimeters of body cream and then 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.030
 once two milliliters of moisture 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.980
 concentrate and back is described 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.800
 how to apply that best so that 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.030
 you just that this bath is in the 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.590
 bathtub is doing the 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.080
 face mask does and 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.820
 afterwards the body cream is creamed 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.560
 and the moisture concentrate is 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.500
 I think also for the face that you 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.420
 to read again and my dear 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.100
 I hope that smells as good as it does 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.310
 looks like and how it sounds 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.140
 then this is my very good thing 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.700

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.320
