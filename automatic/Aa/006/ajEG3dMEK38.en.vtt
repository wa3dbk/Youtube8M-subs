00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
were being able but then you know we we

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.300 
were being able but then you know we we
don't<00:00:21.960> like<00:00:22.170> making<00:00:22.380> things<00:00:22.560> easy<00:00:23.160> for

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
don't like making things easy for

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.550 
don't like making things easy for
ourselves<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.970> obviously<00:00:24.810> we've<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.350> Maya

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
ourselves and obviously we've with Maya

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.800 
ourselves and obviously we've with Maya
getting<00:00:25.920> sent<00:00:26.189> off<00:00:26.310> it's<00:00:27.300> always<00:00:27.570> going<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.720> be

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
getting sent off it's always going to be

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.689 
getting sent off it's always going to be
difficult<00:00:27.869> from<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.619> point<00:00:28.830> onwards<00:00:29.250> well

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
difficult from that point onwards well

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.429 
difficult from that point onwards well
having<00:00:29.939> said<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.359> know<00:00:30.539> from<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> from

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
having said that you know from the from

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.790 
having said that you know from the from
the<00:00:31.470> free<00:00:31.800> kick<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:33.230> resulted<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.350> him<00:00:34.469> you

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the free kick the resulted in him you

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.650 
the free kick the resulted in him you
know<00:00:34.890> getting<00:00:35.130> sent<00:00:35.430> off<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:36.059> had<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> great

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
know getting sent off we had a great

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.630 
know getting sent off we had a great
chance<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.020> score<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:38.309> if<00:00:38.430> we'd<00:00:38.550> have

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
chance to score and think if we'd have

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.030 
chance to score and think if we'd have
scored<00:00:38.910> then<00:00:39.809> maybe<00:00:40.050> maybe<00:00:40.530> would<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.800> held

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
scored then maybe maybe would have held

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.200 
scored then maybe maybe would have held
on<00:00:41.219> even<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.059> ten<00:00:42.270> men<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:43.399> as<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.520> said<00:00:44.730> when

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
on even with ten men but as I said when

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.400 
on even with ten men but as I said when
he<00:00:45.239> gets<00:00:45.329> sent<00:00:45.690> off<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:45.989> always<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.350> be

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
he gets sent off it's always going to be

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.880 
he gets sent off it's always going to be
difficult<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.850> ports<00:00:48.600> mrs.<00:00:48.960> survive<00:00:49.680> their
