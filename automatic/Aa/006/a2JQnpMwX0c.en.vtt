00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.250
 look I tell you honestly I 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.450
 I tremble every time the 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.430
 vacation because back there is a lot of life 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.160
 Every time we go on vacation, look 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.059

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.059

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.170

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.680

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.440
 a determination 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.349
 I will go with her 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.349
 [Music] 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.320
 being the palm of the hand 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.869
 [Applause] 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.450

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.600
 come on with the serious jokes that are 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.430
 bad because they are not serious and they have it 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.070
 nicolÃ¡s a 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.920

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.150
 my corpse 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.150

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.080

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.530
 Yes I go 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.750
 Hello 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.840
 cell because he spends it saying that you 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.540
 husband is very distracted or distracted 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.570
 wife figured that last night he stayed 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.560
 asleep in the bathtub the bathtub filled with 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.810
 water and what is worse the open jet 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.870
 that awful 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.340
 I suppose I would deny the whole house 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.590
 because fortunately my husband has 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.650
 the good habit of sleeping with your mouth 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.650
 open 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.010
