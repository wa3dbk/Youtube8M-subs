00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 So what's going on the victim photographer today 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.899
 I'll show you how to do it right 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:16.560
 photographing five professional tips from 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:19.320
 profi like me so my name is dj me 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.570
 am a pro photographer and a pity 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.720
 already photographed class photos 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.160
 I had dax already photographed me 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.130
 I have already photographed stars and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.070
 Bürgerhaus, for example, wants one on the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.719
 street as the just expired is 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.460
 sounds a viewer photographers say 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.719
 other 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.460
 you think you know each other really well 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.930
 you think you have your camera 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.450
 you have eaten everything already heard 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.079
 the world quite honestly you may even know 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.050
 Nothing 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.050
 These are the ultimate photography tips 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.930
 the important thing when photographing is that 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.010
 Always wear sunglasses with you 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.379
 You do not just see a pair of sunglasses 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.210
 unbelievably sexy from no one 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.320
 impressed the women and the other 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.600
 Covers the customer must be incredible 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.220
 competent and of course a great one 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.229
 Advantage if I start my other 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.240
 the world looks very much look after from 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:18.450
 everything is flat does not contrast himself 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.409
 the probe on moderate aging a foto 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.549
 through the sunglasses and I see 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.369
 immediately on the display 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.860
 It looks like it was a bit of chips 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.240
 okay you really asked for what 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.540
 actually all these letters on 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.579
 the camera i explained for everyone now 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.159
 The letter says a lot already there 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.860
 this mode does not use any sau is only 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.810
 no one falls for music either 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.780
 at that time from playstation hv play 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.430
 means video mode tv is quite simple 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.280
 but the movie look is used very much 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.200
 rarely theme by for professionals 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.509
 that's the profi button always on 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.320
 photographs and of course very important 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.200
 always with lightning man 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.340
 give me a man a man ok you but 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.960
 that does not mean everything in mine 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.250
 Camera you need to know the most important 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.560
 things are a cliché it back 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.780
 So I am now in profi mode and 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.429
 This professional mode has your pay these 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.180
 Number the faster these pay higher 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.920
 this number 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.100
 You will notice that it always varies 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.240
 is getting faster and faster as well 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.050
 speed at the car approximately must 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.050
 you imagine 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.780
 So now I was with a 25 km h and 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.850
 thus over four this camera is a 25 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.560
 km h so that speed ever 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.810
 the higher the number the better the camera 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.370
 Of course , focus means I am 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.980
 now here are the jerseys of 3,5 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:39.770
 means good picture and iso is like that 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.750
 just so you are so interpreted is 100 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.380
 100 a good number, that's why the picture is 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.489
 also OK 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.740
 the rest needs to be interested 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:51.470
 first here 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.200
 your camera is on by default so on 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.600
 stand alone but he stands for user 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.850
 too big you need big ones 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.190
 Pictures TV in front of the Ankick Station 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.830
 three full hd my iphone is full hd 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.770
 So where the hell do you need the l 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.380
 Mode I always go for it in quality 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.840
 because it's up to full hd and I have a lot 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.450
 many more pictures in mainz two modes 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.980
 full hd i have good instructors as june 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.080
 Man I tuned my card my 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.819
 Camera with tuneup with better quality 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.280
 as eleventh and full hd m6 normal times 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.870
 ok another important tip from me this one 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.310
 here too, no one needs a game 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.079
 If you go through this fun however 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.430
 everything looks too small 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.870
 you can not see anything at all 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.569
 not by the sunglasses because of that 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.420
 You can always monitor monitor on yourself 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.769
 no matter how you look no matter what 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.750
 you really need to be on your own 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.930
 and then you take a picture with you 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.370
 luck is also this monitor 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.650
 of course extremely good for yourself 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.760
 just look around camera still 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:56.239
 any lightning and that's awesome 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.739
 for that the sls are done okay me 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.540
 It is not easy in the world of the world 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.209
 professional photographers but I believe mine 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.079
 tips you bring you further understand 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:09.739
