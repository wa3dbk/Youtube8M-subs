00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.580 
gun we're getting ready to apply it to
our<00:01:20.700> prime<00:01:21.119> surface<00:01:21.630> here<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.080> are<00:01:22.110> using<00:01:22.380> an

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
our prime surface here we are using an

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.300 
our prime surface here we are using an
HVLP<00:01:23.009> gun<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:24.390> optimal<00:01:24.840> PSI<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.350> an<00:01:25.740> HVLP<00:01:26.130> gun

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
HVLP gun the optimal PSI for an HVLP gun

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.310 
HVLP gun the optimal PSI for an HVLP gun
is<00:01:26.580> going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.850> around<00:01:27.030> 20<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:28.080> you're<00:01:28.200> using

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
is going to be around 20 if you're using

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.690 
is going to be around 20 if you're using
a<00:01:28.470> conventional<00:01:28.799> gun<00:01:29.220> you're<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.579> want

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
a conventional gun you're going to want

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.060 
a conventional gun you're going to want
to<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.850> around<00:01:29.970> 30<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.530> important<00:01:32.009> to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
to be around 30 now it's important to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370 
to be around 30 now it's important to
note<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.970> does<00:01:33.210> vary<00:01:33.540> from<00:01:33.750> gun<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.229> gun

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
note that it does vary from gun to gun

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.289 
note that it does vary from gun to gun
so<00:01:35.040> make<00:01:35.189> sure<00:01:35.220> you're<00:01:35.490> testing<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.210> an
