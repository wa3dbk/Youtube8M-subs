00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
now if i remember correctly I think this

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.570 
now if i remember correctly I think this
was<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.780> dungeon<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.140> only<00:03:29.470> had<00:03:29.860> one<00:03:30.250> chest

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
was the dungeon that only had one chest

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.610 
was the dungeon that only had one chest
in<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.910> which<00:03:31.300> I<00:03:31.420> guess<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.840> is<00:03:32.050> a<00:03:32.080> rare<00:03:32.380> thing

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
in it which I guess it is a rare thing

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.200 
in it which I guess it is a rare thing
but<00:03:32.860> I'm<00:03:33.160> disappointing<00:03:33.730> at<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.910> same<00:03:34.030> time

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.910 
but I'm disappointing at the same time
but<00:03:34.720> look<00:03:34.930> at<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.110> amount<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.380> buckets<00:03:35.800> you

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
but look at the amount of buckets you

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.100
