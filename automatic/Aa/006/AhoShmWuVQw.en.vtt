00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
domination is that you play two halves

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.770 
domination is that you play two halves
you<00:02:23.370> play<00:02:23.550> too<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.790> believe<00:02:24.000> six<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.750> half

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
you play too I believe six and a half

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.690 
you play too I believe six and a half
minute<00:02:25.170> halves<00:02:25.410> each<00:02:25.770> team<00:02:26.100> gets<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.460> spawn

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
minute halves each team gets to spawn

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.180 
minute halves each team gets to spawn
from<00:02:26.850> each<00:02:27.030> spawn<00:02:27.750> point<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.770> first<00:02:28.980> half

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
from each spawn point and the first half

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.590 
from each spawn point and the first half
as<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.460> can<00:02:29.580> see<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.910> ends<00:02:30.240> here<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.450> think

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
as you can see is it ends here I think

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.330 
as you can see is it ends here I think
in<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.900> second<00:02:31.260> or<00:02:31.380> maybe<00:02:31.590> not<00:02:31.680> knuckles<00:02:32.160> gets

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
in a second or maybe not knuckles gets

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.980 
in a second or maybe not knuckles gets
another<00:02:32.550> little<00:02:32.850> clutch<00:02:33.150> don't<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.690> try<00:02:33.930> to

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
another little clutch don't you try to

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.380 
another little clutch don't you try to
drop<00:02:34.230> shot<00:02:34.500> knuckles<00:02:34.890> he<00:02:35.370> ain't<00:02:35.610> no<00:02:35.700> bitch<00:02:36.030> and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
drop shot knuckles he ain't no bitch and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.530 
drop shot knuckles he ain't no bitch and
so<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.830> first<00:02:38.130> half<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.580> knuckles<00:02:39.000> continues

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
so the first half as knuckles continues

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.330 
so the first half as knuckles continues
to<00:02:39.660> go<00:02:39.750> clutch<00:02:39.960> you<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:40.320> see<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.500> common<00:02:41.130> theme

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
to go clutch you can see a common theme

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.580 
to go clutch you can see a common theme
