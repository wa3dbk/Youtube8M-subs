until<00:00:59.449> Goku<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.750> know<00:01:00.870> did<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> first<00:01:01.469> during

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
until Goku you know did it first during

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.509

vigorous<00:01:02.309> his<00:01:02.609> long<00:01:02.850> slumber<00:01:03.290> so<00:01:04.290> what<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
vigorous his long slumber so what if and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
again this is just my theory what if the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
again this is just my theory what if the
scene<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> trailer<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.150> earth

of<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.460> know<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.790> they'll<00:02:06.000> they'll<00:02:06.600> win

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
of it you know that they'll they'll win

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.910 
of it you know that they'll they'll win
we've<00:02:07.649> trained<00:02:08.039> them<00:02:08.160> or<00:02:08.459> whatever<00:02:08.819> but

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
we've trained them or whatever but

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.260 
we've trained them or whatever but
they're<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.069> gonna<00:02:11.220> go<00:02:11.430> overboard<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:12.120> you

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
they're not gonna go overboard like you

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.790 
they're not gonna go overboard like you
did<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.510> think<00:02:12.870> that's<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.410> know<00:02:13.530> that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
did I think that's you know that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100 
did I think that's you know that
would<00:02:13.890> be<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.040> total<00:02:14.460> Toriyama<00:02:15.000> asked<00:02:15.330> seen<00:02:15.750> I

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
would be a total Toriyama asked seen I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.320 
would be a total Toriyama asked seen I
think<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:17.100> would<00:02:17.190> explain<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.730> explosion

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
think it would explain the explosion

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.380 
think it would explain the explosion
without<00:02:18.480> actually<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.680> being<00:02:20.150> something<00:02:21.150> else

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
without actually it being something else

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.460 
without actually it being something else
so<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.930> speak<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:23.960> don't<00:02:24.960> know<00:02:25.110> what<00:02:25.260> just

think<00:02:33.690> now<00:02:33.840> with<00:02:34.020> Lisa's<00:02:34.440> ability<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.010> reverse

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
think now with Lisa's ability to reverse

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.350 
think now with Lisa's ability to reverse
time<00:02:36.210> I<00:02:36.600> think<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.650> he<00:02:38.100> knew<00:02:39.030> there's

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
time I think that he knew there's

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.630 
time I think that he knew there's
there's<00:02:39.630> all<00:02:39.870> kinds<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.320> wacky<00:02:40.640> possibilities

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
there's all kinds of wacky possibilities

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.010 
there's all kinds of wacky possibilities
