and it's going to make it lay as flat as
possible<00:06:43.970> and<00:06:44.970> now<00:06:45.600> my<00:06:45.810> closure<00:06:46.140> and<00:06:46.350> my<00:06:47.690> hair

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
possible and now my closure and my hair

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.050 
possible and now my closure and my hair
were<00:06:49.200> two<00:06:49.470> different<00:06:49.680> textures<00:06:50.340> so<00:06:50.550> I<00:06:50.580> kind<00:06:50.970> of

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
were two different textures so I kind of

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.240 
were two different textures so I kind of
just<00:06:51.270> kind<00:06:52.200> of<00:06:52.380> try<00:06:52.560> to<00:06:52.620> make<00:06:52.830> it<00:06:52.860> a<00:06:53.040> little

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
just kind of try to make it a little

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.730 
just kind of try to make it a little
wavy<00:06:53.970> like<00:06:54.330> the<00:06:54.480> hair<00:06:54.720> and<00:06:54.750> try<00:06:55.290> to<00:06:55.350> blend<00:06:55.590> it

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
wavy like the hair and try to blend it

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.080 
wavy like the hair and try to blend it
in<00:06:55.940> when<00:06:56.940> I<00:06:56.970> got<00:06:57.270> this<00:06:57.540> closure<00:06:58.430> there<00:06:59.430> was<00:06:59.880> a

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
in when I got this closure there was a

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.290 
in when I got this closure there was a
very<00:07:00.720> very<00:07:00.930> very<00:07:01.050> small<00:07:01.590> part<00:07:01.980> in<00:07:02.160> it<00:07:02.370> you

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
very very very small part in it you

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.820 
very very very small part in it you
could<00:07:03.540> hardly<00:07:03.750> tell<00:07:04.140> that<00:07:04.350> there<00:07:04.440> was<00:07:04.470> a<00:07:04.620> part

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
could hardly tell that there was a part

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.070 
could hardly tell that there was a part
so<00:07:05.010> i<00:07:05.040> did<00:07:05.340> pluck<00:07:05.700> a<00:07:05.850> lot<00:07:06.060> of<00:07:06.180> the<00:07:06.270> hairs<00:07:06.540> out<00:07:06.780> i

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 
so i did pluck a lot of the hairs out i

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.670 
so i did pluck a lot of the hairs out i
think<00:07:07.890> i<00:07:08.040> did<00:07:08.250> plug<00:07:08.730> maybe<00:07:09.420> too<00:07:09.720> much<00:07:09.930> but<00:07:10.440> you

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
think i did plug maybe too much but you

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.710 
think i did plug maybe too much but you
all<00:07:10.890> can<00:07:10.920> be<00:07:11.160> the<00:07:11.250> judge<00:07:11.460> of<00:07:11.490> that<00:07:13.970> and<00:07:14.970> i<00:07:15.660> think

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 
all can be the judge of that and i think

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.930 
all can be the judge of that and i think
i<00:07:15.990> did<00:07:16.230> cut<00:07:16.620> it<00:07:16.650> a<00:07:16.830> little<00:07:16.860> bit<00:07:17.220> too<00:07:17.460> much<00:07:17.640> on

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
i did cut it a little bit too much on

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.170 
i did cut it a little bit too much on
the<00:07:18.530> sides<00:07:19.530> but<00:07:20.160> this<00:07:20.340> is<00:07:20.460> my<00:07:20.580> first<00:07:20.880> time
