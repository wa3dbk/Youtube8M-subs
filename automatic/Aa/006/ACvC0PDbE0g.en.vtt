00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.040
Heat up a pan or a wok

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.600
Once the oil is hot these are few seeds of

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.930
Fenugreek or methi &amp; this is half a tsp of cumin or zeera 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.160

One tip for new people who have started

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.220
Trying their hand in cooking always peel

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.520
Your onion &amp; then wash it then cut it

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.520
Dont wash after cutting or chopping

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.740
Because it will going to take a very long

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.260
time to get pink or brown

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.380
Add green chillies  

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.540
These small green chillies are very hot

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.640
So i have put only two small you adjust

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.900
The quantity according to your choice

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.350
And now we are putting ladyfinger

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.720
We will going to add all the masalas after

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.820
Some time when this lady finger settles little bit

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.640
Generally lady finger is cooked without

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.060
Covering become it gets lumpy

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.940
This is termeric powder 1/2 a tsp

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.040
Slow down the flame

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.580
Red chilli powder according to your taste

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.680
About one tsp

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.140
&amp; just cover it for a min

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.020
After cooking it for 2 min. remove the lid

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.120
This is dry garam masala powder

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.080
Coriander powder

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.430
Once the bhindi or lady finger settles

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.150
you have an exact idea how much

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.080
Salt you require and now this is the time when

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.490
We will add salt according to our taste

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.250
In the begining if you add salt it will get
too salty

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.080
And this vegetable cooks on slow flame

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.580
The last thing is this mango powder

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.360
or amchoor powder we will add it after

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.200
2 min.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.080
 just spread it like this &amp; let it cook

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.350
See the bhindi is getting cooked in

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.449
Its own moisture we dont have to put

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.329
Any water in it 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.100
