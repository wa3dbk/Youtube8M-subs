sent me this yesterday and I remembered

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.849 
sent me this yesterday and I remembered
this<00:00:24.449> man<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.019> his<00:00:25.109> colleagues<00:00:25.619> when<00:00:25.830> they

this man and his colleagues when they
were<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.339> the<00:00:26.490> few<00:00:26.699> groups<00:00:26.970> who<00:00:27.179> were

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
were one of the few groups who were

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.179 
were one of the few groups who were
looking<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> weakening<00:00:28.230> solar<00:00:28.529> magnetics

looking at the weakening solar magnetics

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.579 
looking at the weakening solar magnetics
and<00:00:29.400> they<00:00:29.849> predicted<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.480> weak<00:00:30.720> cycle<00:00:31.259> at<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
and they predicted a weak cycle at the

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.320 
and they predicted a weak cycle at the
