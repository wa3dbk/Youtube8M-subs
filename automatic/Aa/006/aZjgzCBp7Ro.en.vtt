00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
heard that others are just not so great

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.750 
heard that others are just not so great
so<00:02:16.950> I'm<00:02:17.070> glad<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.280> got<00:02:17.490> lucky<00:02:17.790> with<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.030> one

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
so I'm glad I got lucky with this one

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.200 
so I'm glad I got lucky with this one
for<00:02:20.760> seven<00:02:21.000> by<00:02:21.090> seven<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.600> use<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.440> Oh<00:02:23.210> foo

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
for seven by seven I use the Oh foo

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.450 
for seven by seven I use the Oh foo
seven<00:02:24.660> by<00:02:24.720> seven<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:25.230> like<00:02:25.740> pillow<00:02:25.980> at<00:02:26.130> seven<00:02:26.370> by

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
seven by seven I like pillow at seven by

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.180 
seven by seven I like pillow at seven by
seven<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.570> speed<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.230> just<00:02:29.010> fine

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
seven and the speed of this is just fine

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.820 
seven and the speed of this is just fine
it's<00:02:29.940> not<00:02:30.090> as<00:02:30.240> fast<00:02:30.390> as<00:02:30.570> my<00:02:30.720> Sheng<00:02:30.990> Xiao<00:02:31.200> but

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
it's not as fast as my Sheng Xiao but

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.250 
it's not as fast as my Sheng Xiao but
it's<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:33.000> fine<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.140> performs<00:02:34.560> well<00:02:36.260> 24

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
it's just fine and it performs well 24

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.810 
it's just fine and it performs well 24

small<00:02:44.960> because<00:02:45.960> it<00:02:46.410> will<00:02:47.010> be<00:02:47.040> uncomfortable

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700

blind<00:03:29.330> for<00:03:30.330> megaminx<00:03:30.690> i<00:03:30.960> use<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.610> diamond

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
blind for megaminx i use the diamond

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.590 
blind for megaminx i use the diamond
megaminx<00:03:33.030> i<00:03:35.000> actually<00:03:36.000> use<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.270> one<00:03:36.420> without

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
megaminx i actually use the one without

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.840 
megaminx i actually use the one without
ridges<00:03:37.020> it<00:03:37.620> feels<00:03:37.890> just<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.370> little<00:03:38.460> bit<00:03:38.700> more

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
ridges it feels just a little bit more

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.680 
ridges it feels just a little bit more
natural<00:03:39.030> for<00:03:39.420> me<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:40.440> that's<00:03:41.190> why<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.670> all<00:03:42.510> the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
natural for me so that's why and all the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.340 
natural for me so that's why and all the
sides<00:03:42.930> are<00:03:43.050> equally<00:03:43.950> fast<00:03:44.660> really<00:03:45.660> nice<00:03:45.840> cube

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
sides are equally fast really nice cube

is the shin shell with lemon springs
this<00:03:59.370> can<00:03:59.550> be<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.700> little<00:03:59.970> bit<00:04:00.260> too<00:04:01.260> fast<00:04:01.590> but<00:04:02.430> I

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
this can be a little bit too fast but I

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.210 
this can be a little bit too fast but I
actually<00:04:03.180> like<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:03.990> way<00:04:04.020> it<00:04:04.680> feels<00:04:04.920> so

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
actually like it that way it feels so

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.090 
actually like it that way it feels so
nice<00:04:05.400> like<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.300> way<00:04:06.650> my<00:04:07.650> backup<00:04:07.950> for

nice like it that way my backup for

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.449 
nice like it that way my backup for
Scoob<00:04:08.310> though<00:04:08.490> is<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.330> noise<00:04:09.450> cube<00:04:10.310> it's<00:04:11.310> a

Scoob though is the noise cube it's a

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.970 
Scoob though is the noise cube it's a
little<00:04:11.640> bit<00:04:11.730> more<00:04:11.850> controllable<00:04:12.620> smooth<00:04:13.620> and

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
little bit more controllable smooth and
