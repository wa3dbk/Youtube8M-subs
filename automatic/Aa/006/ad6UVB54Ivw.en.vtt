00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.559
 withdrawing their acts we can observe the 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.219
 fibrous ring of the fibrous skeleton of the 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.459
 heart 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.170
 we will find the fibrous ring of the 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.890
 tribes ask for the right and the fibrous ring 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.450
 of the metal found between the fibrous ring 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.120
 of the route 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.310
 i of the metral we can observe two 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.510
 tribulos fibrosos is the fibrous tribune 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:32.200
 right and the left fibular triangle 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.420
 between the garden and the tricuspid because 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.280
 of this difference in the implantation of the ring 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.460
 fiber from the central 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.149
 we find here in this region the right to 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.149
 regular trivento 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.650
 cd out of the right voice in the garden 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.140
 is the right coronary its 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.530
 first branch goes toward our 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.309
 sinus that is the leg of our natal 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.470
 second branch is the mandible channel artery 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.280
 some games for arterial connie and even 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.890
 chocolate on the right margin of the heart 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.150
 it will send to the marginal artery 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.840
 right and continues through the coronary juice 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.520
 up to here the sport that is the union of the south 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.490
 coronary consumption popular internet 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.830
 posterior and will send to the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.450
 posterior interventricular 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.380
 before sending the internal letter stated 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.570
 outdoor 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.509
 she sends another branch that is oval world in the 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.220
 athletic there to play so the system 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.750
 of heart conduction 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:44.289
 the left coronary artery leaves the cd 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.960
 advanced left the garden right out 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.360
 it divides into two artery branches 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.670
 anterior ventricle that comes to 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.720
 the south with previous clear internet that 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.830
 will send the diagonal games and the branches 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.069
 be vital within which there is a 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:09.039
 major branch is the magnum hospital that is 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:12.760
 This is still going on here. 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.760
 she was being complex and going to run 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.880
 coronary juice to the left goes 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.069
 send the marginal skin left and 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.520
 ending with the artery can have another 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.520
 Left ventricle 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.580
 the blood drama of the part 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.230
 heart comes to see cardiac magnitude that 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.180
 runs along with the artery 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.430
 anterior interventricular 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.780
 it goes towards the left together with 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.600
 that complex scene and receives even 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.020
 Thank you the left who does not have it here. 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:53.580
 to transform the coronary sinus dac 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:56.340
 this time together with the internal hierarchy 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.340
 have to see cardiac 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.740
 which also falls in the final part of the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.620
 coronary training and continuation with 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.320
 Right coronary artery from right 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.200
 from the heart to juice in the 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.750
 going on here to see Pope heart falling 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.130
 at the end of your corollary, sir 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.170
 Honorio runs in juice is coronary is 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.020
 along with the left however it goes 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.290
 ends in the medial part of the side 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.290
 right
