00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
it did yeah but yeah I don't know if he

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:39.610

should<00:03:38.840> have<00:03:39.080> been<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.230> little<00:03:39.440> more

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
should have been a little more

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.310 
should have been a little more
conservative<00:03:40.100> with<00:03:40.459> it<00:03:40.670> or<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:42.040> just<00:03:44.200> one<00:03:45.200> of

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
conservative with it or and just one of

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.050 
conservative with it or and just one of
those<00:03:45.410> things<00:03:45.470> you<00:03:45.770> hate<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.250> lose<00:03:46.490> you<00:03:46.760> know

point I think you could have been a
little<00:03:51.500> bit<00:03:51.709> more<00:03:51.860> conservative<00:03:52.160> with<00:03:52.490> it

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
little bit more conservative with it
