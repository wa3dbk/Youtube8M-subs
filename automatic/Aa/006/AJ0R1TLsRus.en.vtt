of course through the more normal ways

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.140 
of course through the more normal ways
of<00:00:24.840> getting<00:00:25.230> honor<00:00:25.439> by<00:00:25.740> just<00:00:26.070> say<00:00:26.460> going

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
of getting honor by just say going

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.210 
of getting honor by just say going
around<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.570> killing<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.619> rares<00:00:28.859> in

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
around and killing the the rares in

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.209 
around and killing the the rares in
karasov<00:00:30.119> wilds<00:00:30.570> but<00:00:30.750> I've<00:00:31.050> got<00:00:31.769> another<00:00:31.980> way

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
karasov wilds but I've got another way

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.430 
karasov wilds but I've got another way
which<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.669> suppose<00:00:33.090> isn't<00:00:33.300> massively<00:00:33.809> used<00:00:34.200> but

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
which I suppose isn't massively used but

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.479 
which I suppose isn't massively used but
actually<00:00:34.860> Nets<00:00:35.130> extremely<00:00:36.090> good<00:00:36.420> amounts<00:00:37.050> of

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
actually Nets extremely good amounts of

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.459 
actually Nets extremely good amounts of
of<00:00:38.489> Honor<00:00:38.670> points<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.690> involves<00:00:40.140> going

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
of Honor points and this involves going

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.530 
of Honor points and this involves going
to<00:00:40.649> tol<00:00:40.950> proud<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.520> wintergrasp<00:00:42.149> oddly

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
to tol proud and wintergrasp oddly

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.299 
to tol proud and wintergrasp oddly
enough<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.170> how<00:00:43.410> much<00:00:43.530> honor<00:00:43.770> will<00:00:43.950> list<00:00:44.129> get

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
enough so how much honor will list get

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.580 
enough so how much honor will list get
you<00:00:44.489> well<00:00:44.730> each<00:00:45.030> win<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.690> them<00:00:46.170> either<00:00:46.410> of

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
you well each win of them either of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.040 
you well each win of them either of
these<00:00:46.739> will<00:00:47.190> give<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.489> 400<00:00:48.210> honor<00:00:48.420> points<00:00:48.870> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
these will give you 400 honor points and

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.410 
these will give you 400 honor points and
in<00:00:49.680> tool<00:00:49.920> Brad<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.399> will<00:00:50.550> find<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:51.329> is

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
in tool Brad you will find that there is

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.180 
in tool Brad you will find that there is
a<00:00:51.449> weekly<00:00:51.840> quest<00:00:52.110> which<00:00:52.320> gives<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.710> an<00:00:52.829> extra

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
a weekly quest which gives you an extra

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.740 
a weekly quest which gives you an extra
two<00:00:53.340> hundred<00:00:53.370> honor<00:00:53.789> points<00:00:54.239> actually<00:00:54.629> no<00:00:54.719> I

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
two hundred honor points actually no I

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.290 
two hundred honor points actually no I
think<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.079> 300<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.800> then<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.760> wintergrasp

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
think it's 300 and then for wintergrasp

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.869 
think it's 300 and then for wintergrasp
there<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.960> three<00:00:58.379> daily<00:00:58.739> quests<00:00:59.129> which<00:00:59.609> will

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
there are three daily quests which will

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.930 
there are three daily quests which will
give<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.300> 75<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.199> or<00:01:01.379> H<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.890> upon<00:01:02.579> completion

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
give you 75 on or H and upon completion

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.399 
give you 75 on or H and upon completion
and<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.300> all<00:01:03.420> completed<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
and they are all completed in the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.320 
and they are all completed in the
duration<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.280> battle<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.240> this

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
duration of the battle so what this

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.210 
duration of the battle so what this
means<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.960> let's<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.530> forget<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.920> quests

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
means is let's just forget the quests

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.890 
means is let's just forget the quests
and<00:01:08.310> bonus<00:01:08.640> stuff<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.360> get<00:01:09.570> eight<00:01:09.869> hundred

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
and bonus stuff you get eight hundred

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.590 
and bonus stuff you get eight hundred
honor<00:01:10.409> if<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.770> do<00:01:10.920> both<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:11.460> these<00:01:12.150> happen

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
honor if you do both now these happen

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600 
honor if you do both now these happen
roughly<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> think<00:01:13.650> every<00:01:13.860> two<00:01:14.040> hours<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.460> ten

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
roughly I think every two hours and ten

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.810 
roughly I think every two hours and ten
minutes<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.630> least<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.960> my<00:01:16.080> server<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
minutes and at least in my server and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.539 
minutes and at least in my server and
wintergrasp<00:01:17.820> happens<00:01:18.770> I'd<00:01:19.770> say<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> think<00:01:20.430> it's

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
wintergrasp happens I'd say I think it's

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.969 
wintergrasp happens I'd say I think it's
about<00:01:20.700> 20<00:01:21.210> minutes<00:01:21.330> after<00:01:21.750> tool<00:01:22.200> barrage<00:01:22.470> so

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
about 20 minutes after tool barrage so

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.289 
about 20 minutes after tool barrage so
you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.250> really<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.759> them<00:01:23.909> both<00:01:24.060> within

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
you can really just do them both within

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.789 
you can really just do them both within
a<00:01:24.420> 40-minute<00:01:24.930> period<00:01:25.229> or<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.409> thirty<00:01:25.619> minute

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
a 40-minute period or a thirty minute

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.969 
a 40-minute period or a thirty minute
period<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> giant<00:01:27.750> wad<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.350> Honor<00:01:28.530> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
period and get a giant wad of Honor you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.679 
period and get a giant wad of Honor you
can<00:01:29.130> probably<00:01:29.340> get<00:01:29.729> upwards<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> thousand

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
can probably get upwards of a thousand

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.840 
can probably get upwards of a thousand
just<00:01:31.259> every<00:01:31.590> two<00:01:31.740> hour<00:01:31.890> period<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.670> do

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
just every two hour period so if you do

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.260 
just every two hour period so if you do
this<00:01:33.030> 2-3<00:01:33.900> times<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.380> day<00:01:34.560> then<00:01:35.520> you're<00:01:35.970> nearly

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
this 2-3 times a day then you're nearly

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.120 
this 2-3 times a day then you're nearly
on<00:01:36.540> or<00:01:36.689> copping<00:01:37.079> not<00:01:37.409> two<00:01:37.590> or<00:01:37.619> three<00:01:37.740> well<00:01:38.070> if

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
on or copping not two or three well if

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.469 
on or copping not two or three well if
you<00:01:38.220> do<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.340> multiple<00:01:38.490> times<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.939> day<00:01:38.970> then

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you do it multiple times a day then

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.390 
you do it multiple times a day then
you're<00:01:39.630> nearly<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:40.170> copping<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
you're nearly on or copping and in a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.560 
you're nearly on or copping and in a
single<00:01:41.700> day<00:01:41.850> which<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.479> quite

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
single day which is really quite

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.230 
single day which is really quite
fantastic<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.680> let's<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.640> jump<00:01:44.700> into<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.060> few

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
fantastic so let's just jump into a few

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
fantastic so let's just jump into a few
different<00:01:45.270> tips<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.899> things<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.409> now<00:01:46.860> first

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
different tips and things and now first

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.800 
different tips and things and now first
of<00:01:47.220> all<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> want<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> say<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.939> will<00:01:48.210> probably

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
of all I want to say this will probably

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.200 
of all I want to say this will probably
only<00:01:49.049> work<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.100> faction<00:01:50.610> which

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
only work if you are the faction which

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.080 
only work if you are the faction which
is<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.290> highest<00:01:52.619> population<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.820> server

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
is the highest population on your server

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.630 
is the highest population on your server
now<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.350> probably<00:01:55.770> means<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
now that probably means like the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.459 
now that probably means like the
majority<00:01:56.909> because<00:01:57.270> most<00:01:57.630> servers<00:01:57.869> do<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.439> a

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
majority because most servers do have a

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.319 
majority because most servers do have a
faction<00:01:59.040> imbalance<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.939> means<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
faction imbalance that means the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.230 
faction imbalance that means the
majority<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.810> people<00:02:00.990> will<00:02:01.469> be<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.549> like

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
majority of people will be on the like

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.209 
majority of people will be on the like
on<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> side<00:02:03.689> with<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.680> larger<00:02:04.950> number

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
on the side with the the larger number

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.039 
on the side with the the larger number
so<00:02:05.250> there<00:02:05.549> shouldn't<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.850> giant<00:02:06.149> issue<00:02:06.390> but

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
so there shouldn't be a giant issue but

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.320 
so there shouldn't be a giant issue but
if<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.350> are<00:02:07.619> an<00:02:07.829> aside<00:02:08.129> that's<00:02:08.429> got<00:02:08.970> lesser

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
if you are an aside that's got lesser

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.210 
if you are an aside that's got lesser
numbers<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> opposite<00:02:10.170> faction<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:11.009> may

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
numbers in the opposite faction you may

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.030 
numbers in the opposite faction you may
have<00:02:11.430> issues<00:02:11.580> actually<00:02:12.060> just<00:02:12.540> winning

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
have issues actually just winning

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.209 
have issues actually just winning
he's<00:02:13.659> personally<00:02:14.659> in<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.349> about<00:02:15.590> five<00:02:15.890> times

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.219 
he's personally in the about five times

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.979 
he's personally in the about five times
I've<00:02:16.430> done<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:17.090> have<00:02:17.420> not<00:02:17.629> seen<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.870> single

I've done this I have not seen a single
hoard<00:02:18.620> player<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.189> I<00:02:19.879> know<00:02:19.939> on<00:02:20.150> other<00:02:20.239> servers

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
hoard player and I know on other servers

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.170 
hoard player and I know on other servers
people<00:02:21.140> will<00:02:21.290> have<00:02:21.439> similar<00:02:21.709> experiences<00:02:22.489> so

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
people will have similar experiences so

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.940 
people will have similar experiences so
portal<00:02:23.599> broad<00:02:23.870> really<00:02:24.409> there's<00:02:24.590> no<00:02:24.739> way<00:02:24.890> to

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
portal broad really there's no way to

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.949 
portal broad really there's no way to
speed<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.430> up<00:02:25.549> you<00:02:25.730> just<00:02:26.209> go<00:02:26.359> in<00:02:26.510> there<00:02:26.750> and

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
speed it up you just go in there and

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.319 
speed it up you just go in there and
you're<00:02:27.319> stuck<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:28.310> have<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.519> wait<00:02:28.640> 15<00:02:29.060> minutes

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
you're stuck you have to wait 15 minutes

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.630

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
then you win and that's really about the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.849 
then you win and that's really about the
height<00:02:31.939> of<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.269> you<00:02:32.930> will<00:02:33.049> get<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.290> weekly<00:02:33.500> quest

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
height of it you will get a weekly quest

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.589 
height of it you will get a weekly quest

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:52.669 
some of the Horde NPCs I find the best

middle of wintergrasp up and down that

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.610 
middle of wintergrasp up and down that
you'll<00:02:57.950> find<00:02:58.689> opposite<00:02:59.689> faction<00:02:59.840> NPCs<00:03:00.409> that

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
you'll find opposite faction NPCs that

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.110 
you'll find opposite faction NPCs that
can<00:03:00.829> be<00:03:00.950> killed<00:03:01.189> which<00:03:01.430> gives<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:01.819> quest

credit you can't there's there is also
of<00:03:04.489> course<00:03:04.549> I<00:03:04.939> think<00:03:05.120> it's<00:03:05.239> a<00:03:05.299> daily<00:03:05.629> victory

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760

of course I think it's a daily victory
daily<00:03:07.760> quest<00:03:08.030> but<00:03:08.419> I'm<00:03:08.659> it<00:03:08.989> could<00:03:09.200> be<00:03:09.290> weekly

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
daily quest but I'm it could be weekly

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.890 
daily quest but I'm it could be weekly
I'm<00:03:09.739> not<00:03:09.950> particularly<00:03:10.250> sure<00:03:10.459> at<00:03:11.299> any<00:03:11.480> rate<00:03:11.720> if

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
I'm not particularly sure at any rate if

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.449 
I'm not particularly sure at any rate if
you're<00:03:12.049> defending<00:03:12.530> it's<00:03:12.709> pretty<00:03:13.010> easy<00:03:13.189> and

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
you're defending it's pretty easy and

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.349 
you're defending it's pretty easy and
it's<00:03:13.579> usually<00:03:13.730> just<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.450> case<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:16.329> winning<00:03:17.329> a

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
it's usually just a case of winning a

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.460 
it's usually just a case of winning a
little<00:03:17.569> bit<00:03:17.690> of<00:03:17.780> time<00:03:17.959> now<00:03:17.989> if<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.379> are

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
little bit of time now if you are

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.960 
little bit of time now if you are
defending<00:03:18.829> it<00:03:19.280> could<00:03:19.489> be<00:03:19.579> a<00:03:19.609> little<00:03:19.729> bit

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
defending it could be a little bit

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.789 
defending it could be a little bit
arduous<00:03:20.150> having<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.840> 30-minute<00:03:21.319> wait<00:03:21.530> so

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
arduous having that 30-minute wait so

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.219 
arduous having that 30-minute wait so
what<00:03:21.979> you<00:03:22.099> want<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.430> do<00:03:22.609> is<00:03:22.819> kill<00:03:23.479> those<00:03:23.690> NPCs

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:24.229 
what you want to do is kill those NPCs

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:26.409 
what you want to do is kill those NPCs
and<00:03:24.470> then<00:03:24.739> you'll<00:03:24.889> rank<00:03:25.129> up<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.849> I<00:03:26.150> think

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
and then you'll rank up and I think

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:27.699 
and then you'll rank up and I think
after<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:26.720> kill<00:03:26.900> ten<00:03:27.169> and<00:03:27.379> then<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:27.560> just

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
after you kill ten and then you just

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.020 
after you kill ten and then you just
keep<00:03:27.829> on<00:03:27.919> killing<00:03:28.159> them<00:03:28.370> until<00:03:28.549> you<00:03:28.639> rank<00:03:28.849> up

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
keep on killing them until you rank up

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.259 
keep on killing them until you rank up
again<00:03:29.329> this<00:03:29.840> will<00:03:30.079> allow<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.349> to<00:03:30.530> use<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.849> the

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
again this will allow you to use the the

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.689 
again this will allow you to use the the
siege<00:03:32.510> engines<00:03:32.959> and<00:03:33.199> the<00:03:33.290> demolishers<00:03:33.829> then

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:34.699 
siege engines and the demolishers then

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:36.189 
siege engines and the demolishers then
what<00:03:34.909> you<00:03:35.000> want<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.209> do<00:03:35.329> is<00:03:35.540> grab<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:35.870> demolisher

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:36.199 
what you want to do is grab a demolisher

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.649 
what you want to do is grab a demolisher
and<00:03:36.709> go<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:37.489> southern<00:03:37.909> towers<00:03:38.329> there<00:03:38.569> are

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
and go to the southern towers there are

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.180 
and go to the southern towers there are
three<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:39.019> them<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:39.349> if<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:39.739> destroy<00:03:40.040> all<00:03:40.159> of

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
three of them and if you destroy all of

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.099 
three of them and if you destroy all of
those<00:03:40.459> I<00:03:40.489> think<00:03:40.639> the<00:03:40.909> enemy<00:03:41.180> loses<00:03:41.329> like<00:03:41.659> 15

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
those I think the enemy loses like 15

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.509 
those I think the enemy loses like 15
minutes<00:03:42.440> on<00:03:42.590> their<00:03:42.680> timer<00:03:42.949> or<00:03:43.190> something

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
minutes on their timer or something

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.849 
minutes on their timer or something
which<00:03:43.970> means<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.659> you<00:03:45.019> will<00:03:45.139> get<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.379> quicker

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
which means that you will get a quicker

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.830 
which means that you will get a quicker
victory<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:46.970> that's<00:03:47.120> always<00:03:47.299> good<00:03:47.540> now<00:03:47.720> if

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
victory so that's always good now if

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.270 
victory so that's always good now if
you're<00:03:48.019> attacking<00:03:48.349> wintergrasp<00:03:48.859> you<00:03:49.069> want<00:03:49.190> to

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
you're attacking wintergrasp you want to

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.379 
you're attacking wintergrasp you want to
do<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.459> same<00:03:49.609> thing<00:03:49.819> just<00:03:50.000> go<00:03:50.120> into<00:03:50.269> the

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
do the same thing just go into the

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.270 
do the same thing just go into the
middle<00:03:50.629> of<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.840> zone<00:03:50.870> start<00:03:51.769> grinding<00:03:51.979> out

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
middle of the zone start grinding out

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.979 
middle of the zone start grinding out
those<00:03:52.489> mobs<00:03:52.760> level<00:03:53.299> yourself<00:03:53.629> rank<00:03:53.900> yourself

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
those mobs level yourself rank yourself

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.159 
those mobs level yourself rank yourself
up<00:03:54.349> then<00:03:54.919> get<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.250> siege<00:03:55.459> engine<00:03:55.909> and<00:03:56.060> just

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
up then get a siege engine and just

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.990 
up then get a siege engine and just
start<00:03:57.189> battering<00:03:58.189> the<00:03:58.280> place<00:03:58.459> down

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
start battering the place down

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.809 
start battering the place down
I<00:03:59.030> think<00:04:00.019> demolishes<00:04:00.979> are<00:04:01.159> the<00:04:01.250> fastest<00:04:01.669> and

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
I think demolishes are the fastest and

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.759 
I think demolishes are the fastest and
honestly<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.389> is<00:04:02.569> a<00:04:02.599> little<00:04:02.959> bit<00:04:03.229> slow<00:04:03.590> and

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
honestly it is a little bit slow and

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.460 
honestly it is a little bit slow and
arduous<00:04:03.919> if<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.939> are<00:04:05.090> on<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.479> attacking<00:04:06.079> side

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
arduous if you are on the attacking side

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.080 
arduous if you are on the attacking side
it<00:04:06.680> will<00:04:06.739> probably<00:04:07.129> take<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:07.340> 20<00:04:07.699> minutes<00:04:07.970> if

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
it will probably take you 20 minutes if

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.729 
it will probably take you 20 minutes if
you're<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.329> only<00:04:08.540> person<00:04:08.900> there<00:04:09.049> but<00:04:09.290> I

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
you're the only person there but I

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.499 
you're the only person there but I
suppose<00:04:10.189> it<00:04:10.400> is<00:04:10.519> definitely<00:04:10.939> easier<00:04:11.000> honor

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:11.509 
suppose it is definitely easier honor

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.819 
suppose it is definitely easier honor
and<00:04:11.840> quicker<00:04:12.259> honor<00:04:12.530> than<00:04:13.310> can<00:04:14.030> be<00:04:14.150> got<00:04:14.419> in

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
and quicker honor than can be got in

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.779 
and quicker honor than can be got in
battlegrounds<00:04:15.829> at<00:04:15.919> least<00:04:16.070> for<00:04:16.220> some<00:04:16.340> people<00:04:16.639> I

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
battlegrounds at least for some people I

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.430 
battlegrounds at least for some people I
know<00:04:16.970> personally<00:04:17.299> in<00:04:17.599> my<00:04:17.630> battle<00:04:17.989> group<00:04:18.169> as

know personally in my battle group as
Alliance<00:04:18.919> it's<00:04:19.039> just<00:04:19.190> very<00:04:19.430> hard<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:20.539> to<00:04:20.900> win

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
Alliance it's just very hard to to win

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.589 
Alliance it's just very hard to to win

like consecutively anyway that's it for

like consecutively anyway that's it for
this<00:04:23.719> little<00:04:23.900> guide<00:04:24.260> video<00:04:24.620> thingy<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:25.070> know

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
it's not all

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.809 
it's not all
rare<00:04:26.659> knowledge<00:04:27.169> but<00:04:27.500> I<00:04:27.560> think<00:04:28.009> it's<00:04:28.189> probably

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819 
rare knowledge but I think it's probably

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:30.159 
rare knowledge but I think it's probably
something<00:04:29.090> that<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.360> lot<00:04:29.509> of<00:04:29.539> people<00:04:29.840> didn't
