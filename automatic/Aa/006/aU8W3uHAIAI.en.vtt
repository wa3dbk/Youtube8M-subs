making<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.500> video<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:08.739> would<00:04:08.950> be<00:04:09.100> so

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
making a video that would be so

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.790

unappealing<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.200> you<00:04:11.319> I<00:04:11.350> guess<00:04:11.560> you<00:04:11.590> could<00:04:11.770> say

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
unappealing to you I guess you could say

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.380 
unappealing to you I guess you could say
because<00:04:12.069> it<00:04:12.340> was<00:04:12.459> a<00:04:12.489> joke<00:04:12.550> and<00:04:12.910> most<00:04:13.239> of<00:04:13.330> you
