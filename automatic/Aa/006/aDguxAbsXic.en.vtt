really<00:05:36.669> get<00:05:36.790> used<00:05:36.940> to<00:05:37.090> them<00:05:37.210> but<00:05:37.870> it<00:05:38.110> is

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
really get used to them but it is

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.230 
really get used to them but it is
actually<00:05:38.440> pretty<00:05:38.800> fun<00:05:39.040> and<00:05:39.250> you<00:05:39.820> feel<00:05:39.850> cool

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
actually pretty fun and you feel cool

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.270 
actually pretty fun and you feel cool
while<00:05:40.930> you're<00:05:41.080> playing<00:05:41.169> it<00:05:41.410> somehow<00:05:41.770> even

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
while you're playing it somehow even

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.800 
while you're playing it somehow even
though<00:05:42.310> it's<00:05:42.550> a<00:05:42.790> plane<00:05:43.180> going<00:05:43.360> through<00:05:43.600> rings

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
though it's a plane going through rings

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.750 
though it's a plane going through rings
so<00:05:44.229> you<00:05:45.010> guys<00:05:45.130> should<00:05:45.190> check<00:05:45.370> that<00:05:45.700> out

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
so you guys should check that out

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.760 
so you guys should check that out

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
apparently I was not expecting that to

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.460 
apparently I was not expecting that to
be<00:05:47.890> in<00:05:48.160> my<00:05:48.280> reaction<00:05:48.700> but<00:05:49.050> who<00:05:50.050> ha<00:05:50.460> fantastic
