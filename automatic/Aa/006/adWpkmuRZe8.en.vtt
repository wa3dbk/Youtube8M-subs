sad<00:01:57.479> because<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.680> lady<00:01:58.860> made<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.250> also<00:01:59.640> great

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
sad because the lady made is also great

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.420 
sad because the lady made is also great
and<00:02:00.299> at<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.930> end<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.469> really<00:02:01.950> wasn't<00:02:01.979> all

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and at the end it just really wasn't all

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.020 
and at the end it just really wasn't all
that<00:02:02.490> much<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.590> cream<00:02:04.860> American<00:02:05.759> cream

it also has a weird smell

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.980 
it also has a weird smell
supposed<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.460> smell<00:02:14.640> like<00:02:14.700> vanilla<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.600> really

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
supposed to smell like vanilla it really

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.900 
supposed to smell like vanilla it really
didn't<00:02:16.260> feel<00:02:16.470> like<00:02:16.530> it's<00:02:16.830> not<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.370> much<00:02:17.400> like

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910

didn't feel like it's not that much like
vanilla<00:02:18.270> it's<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:19.530> not<00:02:19.790> weird<00:02:20.790> that's

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820

vanilla it's just not weird that's
that's<00:02:21.630> one<00:02:21.780> thing<00:02:21.990> though<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.260> mean<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.530> guess

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
that's one thing though I mean I guess

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.320 
that's one thing though I mean I guess
if<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.220> smell<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.760> smell<00:02:24.030> does
