versatility

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.790 
versatility
I<00:00:23.820> used<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.570> aggressively<00:00:25.109> at<00:00:25.199> close<00:00:25.410> ranges

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
I used it aggressively at close ranges

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.160 
I used it aggressively at close ranges
with<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> laser<00:00:26.220> sight<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.699> great<00:00:26.910> success<00:00:27.170> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
with a laser sight to great success the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.870 
with a laser sight to great success the
recoil<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.650> fairly<00:00:28.949> manageable<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:29.519> hipfire

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
recoil is fairly manageable with hipfire

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.759 
recoil is fairly manageable with hipfire
and<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.779> keep<00:00:30.990> your<00:00:31.109> shots<00:00:31.380> within<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
and you can keep your shots within the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.280 
and you can keep your shots within the
head<00:00:31.949> box<00:00:32.189> making<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.270> pack<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> very<00:00:33.840> potent

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
head box making it pack a very potent

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.729

punch

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739

punch
I<00:00:34.920> think<00:00:35.399> heavy<00:00:35.579> shield<00:00:35.820> also<00:00:36.090> gives<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.450> a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
I think heavy shield also gives you a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.940 
I think heavy shield also gives you a
little<00:00:36.690> time<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.930> get<00:00:37.170> your<00:00:37.260> shots<00:00:37.530> into<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
little time to get your shots into the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.270 
little time to get your shots into the
sweet<00:00:38.160> spot<00:00:38.960> often<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.140> even<00:00:40.469> came<00:00:40.680> out<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:41.100> top

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
of other heavies however it is also able

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.709 
of other heavies however it is also able
to<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.160> very<00:00:44.280> competitive<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:45.000> mid<00:00:45.149> ranges<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
to be very competitive in mid ranges and

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.720 
to be very competitive in mid ranges and
even<00:00:46.230> has<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> chance<00:00:46.530> at<00:00:46.860> longer<00:00:47.039> ranges<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
even has a chance at longer ranges I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.119 
even has a chance at longer ranges I
also<00:00:48.510> found<00:00:48.989> myself<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.410> burning<00:00:49.620> snipers

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.479 
who weren't so quick on the trigger
mostly<00:00:52.440> though<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.039> be<00:00:53.129> very<00:00:53.280> accurate

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
for the light assault

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.830 
for the light assault
I<00:01:36.840> picked<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> NCAC<00:01:37.890> x11<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> weapon<00:01:39.810> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
I picked the NCAC x11 as a weapon that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.080 
I picked the NCAC x11 as a weapon that
makes<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.170> salivate<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.920> very<00:01:41.610> high<00:01:41.820> damage

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
makes you salivate as very high damage

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.880 
makes you salivate as very high damage
and<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.689> only<00:01:42.780> takes<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.170> handful<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.560> bullets

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and it only takes a handful of bullets

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
and it only takes a handful of bullets
to<00:01:44.040> kill<00:01:44.070> an<00:01:44.310> enemy<00:01:44.430> which<00:01:45.420> makes<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> almost

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
to kill an enemy which makes it almost

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
to kill an enemy which makes it almost
like<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> shotgun<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.680> close<00:01:46.860> causes<00:01:47.220> combat

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
like a shotgun in close causes combat

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.789 
like a shotgun in close causes combat
but<00:01:48.149> up<00:01:48.240> further<00:01:48.509> Rangers<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.200> headshots<00:01:49.409> it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
but up further Rangers with headshots it

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.530 
but up further Rangers with headshots it
is<00:01:49.920> still<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> very<00:01:50.369> competitive<00:01:50.670> carbine<00:01:51.329> I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
is still a very competitive carbine I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.929 
is still a very competitive carbine I
found<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.590> really<00:01:52.890> paid<00:01:53.399> off<00:01:53.430> with<00:01:53.850> an

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
found it really paid off with an

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.580 
found it really paid off with an
aggressive<00:01:54.149> play<00:01:54.479> style<00:01:54.540> paired<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
aggressive play style paired with the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.050 
aggressive play style paired with the

suppressor to conceal your location

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.730 
suppressor to conceal your location
because<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.899> such<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> high<00:01:58.380> damage

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
because you have such a high damage

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.490 
because you have such a high damage
potential<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.369> wreak<00:01:59.520> absolute<00:02:00.000> havoc<00:02:00.500> also

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
potential to wreak absolute havoc also

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.770 
potential to wreak absolute havoc also

it that edge at ranges furthermore

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.370 
it that edge at ranges furthermore
because<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.420> only<00:02:06.540> need<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.810> land<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.140> few

bullets with it up close it still felt

fine to hit fire and guessing headshots

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.440 
fine to hit fire and guessing headshots

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
really played this class a whole lot but

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.560 
really played this class a whole lot but
it<00:03:28.740> was<00:03:28.770> hard<00:03:29.010> me<00:03:29.190> not<00:03:29.340> say<00:03:29.550> my<00:03:29.760> NC<00:03:30.030> combination

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
it was hard me not say my NC combination

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.090 
it was hard me not say my NC combination
of<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.720> scatter<00:03:31.020> cannon<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.590> grinder

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
of a scatter cannon and the grinder

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.640 
of a scatter cannon and the grinder
which<00:03:32.790> in<00:03:33.150> close<00:03:33.420> quarters<00:03:33.780> combat<00:03:33.810> can<00:03:34.440> kill

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
which in close quarters combat can kill

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.920 
which in close quarters combat can kill
whole<00:03:34.890> congregations<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.760> enemies<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.420> it

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
whole congregations of enemies and it

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.050 
whole congregations of enemies and it
can<00:03:37.110> do<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.260> Picabo<00:03:37.740> maneuver<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.580> kill<00:03:38.760> people

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
can do a Picabo maneuver to kill people

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.720 
can do a Picabo maneuver to kill people
very<00:03:39.300> satisfying<00:03:39.840> through<00:03:40.320> Windows<00:03:40.770> but

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
very satisfying through Windows but

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.130 
very satisfying through Windows but
because<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.180> isn't<00:03:42.300> as<00:03:42.510> effective<00:03:42.720> against

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
because it isn't as effective against

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.200 
because it isn't as effective against
other<00:03:43.410> Maxis<00:03:43.830> unless<00:03:44.550> you<00:03:44.700> charge<00:03:44.970> them<00:03:45.120> an

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
exclusively headshot which in turn

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.620

power to damage vehicles

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.550 
power to damage vehicles
I'd<00:03:50.130> go<00:03:50.700> with<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:50.850> TR<00:03:51.150> pounders<00:03:51.600> which<00:03:52.020> you

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
I'd go with the TR pounders which you

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.230 
I'd go with the TR pounders which you
get<00:03:52.800> one<00:03:52.980> by<00:03:53.130> default<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.880> second<00:03:54.150> one

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
get one by default and the second one

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.410 
get one by default and the second one
only<00:03:54.480> costs<00:03:54.720> 250<00:03:55.590> certs<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:56.190> no-brainer<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.300> my

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
only costs 250 certs a no-brainer in my

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.660 
only costs 250 certs a no-brainer in my
opinion<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:57.960> was<00:03:58.680> surprised<00:03:58.980> by<00:03:59.130> how<00:03:59.250> well<00:03:59.280> they

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
opinion I was surprised by how well they

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.160 
opinion I was surprised by how well they
seemed<00:03:59.850> to<00:03:59.970> form<00:04:00.180> against<00:04:00.450> vehicles<00:04:00.930> and

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
seemed to form against vehicles and

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.080 
seemed to form against vehicles and
they're<00:04:01.680> very<00:04:01.980> capable<00:04:02.250> against<00:04:02.730> enemy

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
they're very capable against enemy

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.730 
they're very capable against enemy
infantry<00:04:03.330> as<00:04:03.720> long<00:04:03.930> as<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:04.140> can<00:04:04.260> get<00:04:04.350> direct

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
infantry as long as you can get direct

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.240 
infantry as long as you can get direct
hits

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
hits

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.360 
hits
also<00:04:06.150> like<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.570> comets<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.230> falcons<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:08.010> think

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
also like the comets and falcons I think

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.460 
also like the comets and falcons I think
for<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.700> NC<00:04:09.030> they're<00:04:09.630> very<00:04:09.960> good<00:04:10.200> against

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
for the NC they're very good against

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.040 
for the NC they're very good against
other<00:04:10.740> Maxis<00:04:11.330> furthermore<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.690> way<00:04:12.780> they<00:04:12.930> act

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
other Maxis furthermore the way they act

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.720 
other Maxis furthermore the way they act
like<00:04:13.140> grenades<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.800> have<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:13.980> drop<00:04:14.250> makes<00:04:14.610> them

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
like grenades and have a drop makes them

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.690 
like grenades and have a drop makes them
quite<00:04:14.970> satisfying<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.720> try<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.110> control

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.220 

I'm<00:04:21.330> taking<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.780> shoot-down

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.990 

I<00:04:25.260> also<00:04:25.500> don't<00:04:25.740> spend<00:04:26.010> all<00:04:26.190> too<00:04:26.520> much<00:04:26.670> time<00:04:26.880> as

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
I also don't spend all too much time as

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.880 
I also don't spend all too much time as
a<00:04:27.030> medic<00:04:27.420> I<00:04:27.630> spent<00:04:27.990> most<00:04:28.080> my<00:04:28.200> early<00:04:28.560> gameplay

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
a medic I spent most my early gameplay

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.620 
a medic I spent most my early gameplay
as<00:04:28.950> a<00:04:29.010> class<00:04:29.310> but<00:04:29.640> I've<00:04:29.820> only<00:04:29.970> just<00:04:30.150> started

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
as a class but I've only just started

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
as a class but I've only just started
getting<00:04:30.900> back<00:04:31.020> into<00:04:31.200> it

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
getting back into it

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.470 
getting back into it
with<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.310> vs<00:04:32.520> for<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.760> most<00:04:32.940> part<00:04:33.210> I<00:04:33.330> was

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
with the vs for the most part I was

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.300 
with the vs for the most part I was
using<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.810> Pandora<00:04:34.200> because<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.040> nature

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
using the Pandora because of the nature

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.860 
using the Pandora because of the nature
of<00:04:35.370> medics<00:04:35.700> being<00:04:35.910> in<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.120> firing<00:04:36.360> line<00:04:36.510> all

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.780 
of medics being in the firing line all
the<00:04:36.990> time<00:04:37.020> saving<00:04:37.620> your<00:04:37.740> buddies<00:04:38.040> you'll<00:04:38.700> be

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
the time saving your buddies you'll be

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.970 
the time saving your buddies you'll be
up<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.030> close<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.510> personal<00:04:39.960> but<00:04:40.620> I<00:04:40.650> really

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
up and close and personal but I really

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.950

a different reason to the heavy where it

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.660 
a different reason to the heavy where it
is<00:05:34.230> more<00:05:34.440> of<00:05:34.470> a<00:05:34.650> quirky<00:05:35.010> gun<00:05:35.220> that<00:05:35.460> feels

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
is more of a quirky gun that feels

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.880

a forward grip and flash suppressor to
be<00:05:54.990> honest<00:05:55.260> I<00:05:55.410> think<00:05:55.650> even<00:05:55.890> with<00:05:56.160> the<00:05:56.250> laser

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
comfortable at medium ranges so it is

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.500 
comfortable at medium ranges so it is
always<00:05:59.520> something<00:05:59.730> to<00:05:59.850> think<00:06:00.060> about<00:06:00.180> to<00:06:00.390> keep

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
always something to think about to keep
