00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
main outlines with that pen this is a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.880 
main outlines with that pen this is a
great<00:00:36.630> pen<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:37.050> creating<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> thick<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
great pen for creating the thick and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.180 
great pen for creating the thick and
thin<00:00:37.950> lines<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.660> then<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.649> final<00:00:40.800> lines

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
thin lines and then for the final lines

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.130 
thin lines and then for the final lines
on<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> inside<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> web<00:00:42.270> design<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.809> had

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
on the inside with the web design I had

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.350 
on the inside with the web design I had
to<00:00:43.290> use<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.710> Sharpie<00:00:44.370> pen<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.149> feel<00:00:45.329> like

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
to use a Sharpie pen because I feel like

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.850 
to use a Sharpie pen because I feel like
I<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> lot<00:00:45.870> more<00:00:46.020> control<00:00:46.260> with<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.530> pen

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
I have a lot more control with that pen

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.250 
I have a lot more control with that pen
because<00:00:47.820> we've<00:00:48.480> obviously<00:00:48.780> with<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> web

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
because we've obviously with the web

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.590 
because we've obviously with the web
design<00:00:49.530> I've<00:00:49.920> had<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.670> draw<00:00:50.879> each<00:00:51.090> line<00:00:51.390> with

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
design I've had to draw each line with

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.240 
design I've had to draw each line with
just<00:00:51.899> one<00:00:52.050> single<00:00:52.320> motion<00:00:52.590> without<00:00:52.949> any

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
just one single motion without any

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.090 
just one single motion without any
shaking<00:00:53.809> with<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.350> Pentel<00:00:55.680> pocket<00:00:55.710> brush<00:00:55.980> pen

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
shaking with the Pentel pocket brush pen

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.670 
shaking with the Pentel pocket brush pen
I've<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.199> difficult<00:00:58.320> pen<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
I've that is a really difficult pen to

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.720 
I've that is a really difficult pen to
get<00:00:58.770> used<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> didn't<00:00:59.550> really<00:00:59.640> want

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
get used to have so I didn't really want

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.180 
get used to have so I didn't really want
to<00:00:59.969> risk<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> Sharpie<00:01:01.649> pen<00:01:01.829> was<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
to risk it so the Sharpie pen was a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.250 
to risk it so the Sharpie pen was a
really<00:01:02.520> great<00:01:02.579> option<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.750> had

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
really great option for this and I had

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.080 
really great option for this and I had
no<00:01:04.409> issues<00:01:04.799> whatsoever<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
no issues whatsoever and for the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.580 
no issues whatsoever and for the
coloring<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.540> spider-man<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.080> used<00:01:07.290> Copic

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
coloring of spider-man I used Copic

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.890 
coloring of spider-man I used Copic
markers<00:01:08.090> for<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> darker<00:01:09.479> shade<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.659> red<00:01:09.840> I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
markers for the darker shade of red I

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.590 
markers for the darker shade of red I
used<00:01:10.170> cardinal<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.580> lighter<00:01:11.970> shade<00:01:12.270> was

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
used cardinal and the lighter shade was

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.710 
used cardinal and the lighter shade was
crimson<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.740> left<00:01:14.460> some<00:01:14.700> really<00:01:15.000> large<00:01:15.180> areas

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
crimson I left some really large areas

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.240 
crimson I left some really large areas
of<00:01:15.840> white<00:01:16.020> around<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.680> outside<00:01:17.040> of

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
of white around the outside of

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.270 
of white around the outside of
spider-man<00:01:17.580> two<00:01:17.790> crates<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.210> backlit<00:01:18.630> effect

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
spider-man two crates of backlit effect

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.950 
spider-man two crates of backlit effect
and<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.580> really<00:01:20.729> works<00:01:20.909> out<00:01:21.090> well<00:01:21.930> for

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
and I think it really works out well for

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.560 
and I think it really works out well for
this<00:01:22.320> drawing<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:23.009> you'll<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:24.090> later<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.540> I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
this drawing as you'll see later on I

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.320 
this drawing as you'll see later on I
used<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.259> darker<00:01:25.710> background<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:27.150> really

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
used a darker background and it really

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
used a darker background and it really
helps<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.780> make<00:01:27.960> spider-man<00:01:28.259> stand<00:01:28.740> out<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.130> I

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
helps to make spider-man stand out and I

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.740 
helps to make spider-man stand out and I
wanted<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.939> create<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.210> sort<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.420> highlight

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
wanted to create a sort of highlight

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.569 
wanted to create a sort of highlight
effects<00:01:31.170> around<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.650> webbing<00:01:32.159> design<00:01:32.430> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
effects around the webbing design of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.030 
effects around the webbing design of
spider-man<00:01:32.880> suits<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.530> used<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
spider-man suits and for that I used a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.770 
spider-man suits and for that I used a
prismacolor<00:01:35.400> pencil<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.450> worked<00:01:36.630> out

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
prismacolor pencil and it worked out

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.840 
prismacolor pencil and it worked out
really<00:01:36.930> well<00:01:37.020> because<00:01:37.920> beforehand<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
really well because beforehand the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.490 
really well because beforehand the
drawing<00:01:39.180> was<00:01:39.329> looking<00:01:39.540> quite<00:01:39.720> flat<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.320> as

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
drawing was looking quite flat but as

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
drawing was looking quite flat but as
soon<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.860> added<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.189> pencil<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:41.939> made

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
soon as I added this pencil it just made

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.569 
soon as I added this pencil it just made
it<00:01:42.210> stand<00:01:42.360> out<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.780> much<00:01:42.810> more<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.409> added<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.340> dark

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
it stand out so much more I added a dark

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.010 
it stand out so much more I added a dark
gray<00:01:44.790> background<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> drawing<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:45.990> I

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
gray background to the drawing because I

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.990 
gray background to the drawing because I
wanted<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.439> able<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.710> draw<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.310> spiderweb

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
wanted to be able to draw a spiderweb

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.960 
wanted to be able to draw a spiderweb
and<00:01:48.560> that's<00:01:49.560> when<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> could<00:01:50.009> use<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.490> uniball

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and that's when I could use the uniball

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.719 
and that's when I could use the uniball
signo<00:01:51.030> broad<00:01:51.360> pigment<00:01:52.049> ink<00:01:52.170> white<00:01:52.409> pen<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.890> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
signo broad pigment ink white pen and I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.700 
signo broad pigment ink white pen and I
just<00:01:53.939> created<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.360> really<00:01:54.630> quick<00:01:54.840> web<00:01:55.290> design

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
just created a really quick web design

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.679 
just created a really quick web design
in<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> background<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.820> think<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.149> it

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
in the background and I think it just it

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.469 
in the background and I think it just it
helps<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.520> centralize<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.729> drawing<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.240> think

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
helps to centralize the drawing I think

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.789 
helps to centralize the drawing I think
it<00:02:00.570> kind<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.780> helps<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.140> turn<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> focus

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
it kind of helps to turn the focus

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.469 
it kind of helps to turn the focus
towards<00:02:02.280> spider-man's<00:02:02.700> face<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.240> I'm<00:02:03.360> really

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
towards spider-man's face so I'm really

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.389 
towards spider-man's face so I'm really
pleased<00:02:03.810> with<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> effect<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.219> enjoy

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
pleased with the effect if you enjoy
