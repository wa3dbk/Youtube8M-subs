00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
with a little bit of oil the key part of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.149 
with a little bit of oil the key part of
cooking<00:01:18.420> these<00:01:18.659> burgers<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.470> flipping<00:01:19.979> them

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
cooking these burgers is flipping them

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.670 
cooking these burgers is flipping them
every<00:01:20.880> 15<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.330> 20<00:01:21.600> seconds<00:01:21.960> sounds<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> bit

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
every 15 to 20 seconds sounds like a bit

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.289 
every 15 to 20 seconds sounds like a bit
of<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.830> pain<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.400> will<00:01:23.490> make<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.880> massive

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
of a pain but it will make a massive

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.100 
of a pain but it will make a massive
difference

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
difference

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.650 
difference
the<00:01:27.100> reason<00:01:27.370> for<00:01:27.460> flipping<00:01:27.730> them<00:01:27.970> is<00:01:28.210> each

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
the reason for flipping them is each

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.270 
the reason for flipping them is each
time<00:01:28.990> we<00:01:29.110> turn<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.500> burger<00:01:29.890> over<00:01:30.040> you're

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
time we turn the burger over you're

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.440 
time we turn the burger over you're
going<00:01:30.400> to<00:01:30.460> all<00:01:30.580> that<00:01:30.610> heat<00:01:31.000> going<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.360> the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
going to all that heat going to the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.600 
going to all that heat going to the
underside<00:01:31.840> but<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.800> surface<00:01:33.070> is<00:01:33.370> going<00:01:33.550> to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
underside but the surface is going to

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.400 
underside but the surface is going to
start<00:01:33.880> cooling<00:01:34.090> down<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.570> that<00:01:34.690> pulsing<00:01:35.230> of

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
start cooling down and that pulsing of

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.590 
start cooling down and that pulsing of
heat<00:01:35.620> is<00:01:35.890> going<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:36.610> give<00:01:36.790> you<00:01:36.910> a<00:01:36.940> nice<00:01:37.240> cross
