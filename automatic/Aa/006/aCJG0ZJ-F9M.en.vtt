00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 hey hello to all it's guillaume of 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.049
 Cotonou underlines this video for a 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:12.570
 unpacking so this is the unpacking of 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:18.029
 the fifth generation ipod touch so 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.039
 the 1st of august well special yj 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.820
 so if we had not spoiled a bet 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.710
 so here you are alerting but 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.019
 why you simply ipod touch you 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.160
 did not have your ipod touch 4g all 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.430
 just when I was doing my 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.350
 internship at apple so at the apple store 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.059
 I made an appointment to the services 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.640
 techniques for the home button of my 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.350
 ipod touch that no longer worked donkey 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.590
 world be there I repeat the same for 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.770
 130 francs or more for his franc 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.289
 more I have this one with 10% above 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.660
 so the best paid 230 I pay him 200 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.920
 francs so it's called an exchange so 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.199
 I changed my ipod touch 4 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.670
 when the 5 so the ipod touch 4 young and 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.070
 plus i have more than the box it is 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.539
 accessory so if all that remains 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.610
 I do not think you compare 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.990
 but diageo 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.150
 the video of comparatives in dise ipod 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.159
 touch 4 and the ipod touch 15 on my channel 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.570
 crowd said koubrit down I had done that 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.710
 the ipod touch cruise to my sister we went 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.409
 sitting or red meat and this time 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.409
 this is the friend so turda sees so 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.880
 here we marked ipod touch in red so 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.619
 it's 16 giga and the same capacity 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.380
 like the iphone makes this ipod touch 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.159
 it's more a compliment of memory to 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.350
 my iphone 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.140
 since we are made to vibrate this kind a 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.869
 giga all the messages I was changed 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.450
 so then on this side we have the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.220
 producer ed special edition 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:45.960
 so I write in red everything is written in 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:50.250
 red so that's at least cdm flow 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.840
 ubilla ipod touch 16 giga so help the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.490
 apple on here I sold everything that 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.470
 I did but to close the fashion for 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.729
 that she stands up for 25 shows so 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.159
 the apple is also red 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:06.600
 so I'm going to go open the bad 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.720
 we have the ipod on a new base 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.240
 so I tried not to stick too much 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.560
 these 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.150
 because I like or do protection 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.660
 of screen it will go in ball when I 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.150
 want the tab so that's after which 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.650
 here way back &amp; design by apple in 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.990
 california then cost as soon as 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.760
 we open we have this paper so who you 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:34.060
 say I tell you all that so chedjou 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.630
 but I would pause you to read on 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.700
 said we have all the manuals of the ipod and 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.280
 the apple stickers that are just 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.960
 right here 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.360
 so here and then we find asia 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:51.370
 that lightning cable here and selvedge 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.200
 buddies without the remote so for a 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.640
 ipod that is still more than 200 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.780
 frank for I believe I find 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.590
 personally that they could have 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.260
 put the remote 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.680
 it would have been better but it would have been a 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:08.950
 marketing advantage or not so I'm going 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:11.500
 in fact it smells all the parcels that's it 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.820
 did not take off I'm happy no I 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.340
 pulls my ipod i throw the base away 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.090
 so here I was little bubble here at 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.610
 cause I shot this video 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.300
 many times so it had me up 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.190
 so that's so the red touch ipod have 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.980
 so it is equipped it is I turn it from 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.010
 behind here basically we have a device 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.910
 5 megapixel photo so this is a 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.520
 isight with a led flash so the same 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.650
 price on iphone 5 or iphone 4 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.060
 fourth and the camera it's 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.700
 5000 pixels play already said this is the 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.070
 same worship to green 4 pretty much so here 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.700
 we drown we have the case to pass the 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.990
 wifi and bluetooth antennas simply 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.210
 here we have 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:01.060
 the apple apple with the ipod and you're 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:04.620
 finally do almost everything thoroughly we have the 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.050
 producer ed writing I pass you have 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.490
 tried to do the best we see there 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:15.100
 and here we have the little button for the 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.630
 wrist strap ah yes I was to clarify that 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.980
 for model cjga there is no 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.240
 dredger ants will have to buy it 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.310
 achieved what I have fun, but I have not 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.290
 full mouth so the ipod he has a 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.060
 screen 2 4 inches 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:39.850
 so here is the role of my iphone 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:43.920
 you see it's the same they are 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.930
 are taken over 4 inches So here 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.300
 it has a chip a5 so certainly it is that 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.730
 the processor of the iphone 5 but compared 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.440
 iphone 4 iphone touch processor 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.260
 so there is a4 chip here it's a 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.150
 great update so that there is going to 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.750
 twice as fast 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.160
 so here it goes then ios 5 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.580
 is basic so you will be able to pass 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.710
 under ayo suite it's pretty cool no 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.870
 we will unlock our hooks 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.730
 my little dear so here's to go 262 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.140
 mail believed it's here it's the match 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.200
 that I see the youtube channel for 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.840
 specify long time I have a lot of stuff 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:29.620
 on my ipod not relics I have a lot 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:31.750
 more of that stuff on it so no 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.180
 tweeted safe for those who would have planned 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.950
 still the video 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:41.320
 this is it too it is rather mag 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.910
 yt so the director presents but 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:48.660
 youtube and you see that I pose when 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.660
 I was doing a video 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.650
 so we do not know if you follow me there 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.260
 on it you will know all nightmare of 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.650
 videos so what can I not 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:03.990
 compare we can compare just the 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.990
 starting the apple store 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.580
 I had an interest so I emptied 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:15.100
 know that job that serves no good 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:19.430
 sure the iphone it's obvious 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:22.180
 it has much faster 4th must there the 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.570
 obligations of labouheyre pure one here 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.080
 so it's not going to make it clear 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.480
 so I'm going to dance 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.040
 the app store at the same time we see 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.560
 iphone 5 ha it's because charged and 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.440
 the ipod touch arrives after a small 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.880
 moment no I'm going to put a little bug in 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:45.169
 the ipod for paul I avoid breaking it 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:47.120
 so again it was just a small 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:49.310
 unpacking the ipod touch 4 so is 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.500
 just too good red does not believe I 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.260
 caught I stole the cochlea to my sister the 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.160
 transparent 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.040
 so she welcomed me on it but I 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.630
 I do not care so this was the 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.180
 unpacking the ipod touch this 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:05.380
 generation gp apr idiot will have you pleased and 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.380
