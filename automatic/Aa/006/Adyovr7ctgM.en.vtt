00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
it of course we will max refraction by 7

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.450 
it of course we will max refraction by 7
and<00:01:07.320> take<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:08.040> level<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> melt<00:01:08.790> at<00:01:09.000> 4<00:01:10.460> you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and take one level and melt at 4 you

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.760 
and take one level and melt at 4 you
ultimate<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> skill<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.540> standard<00:01:12.810> 6<00:01:13.140> 11

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
ultimate a skill that is standard 6 11

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.460 
ultimate a skill that is standard 6 11
and<00:01:13.920> 16<00:01:14.250> after<00:01:15.090> maxing<00:01:15.720> out<00:01:15.810> refraction<00:01:16.380> you

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
and 16 after maxing out refraction you

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.890 
and 16 after maxing out refraction you
want<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.799> max<00:01:17.009> melt<00:01:17.310> second<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.540> will<00:01:18.720> give

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
want to max melt second this will give

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.570 
want to max melt second this will give
you<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.080> much<00:01:19.259> needed<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.890> beef<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:20.520> your

you a much needed you can beef up your

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.700 
you a much needed you can beef up your
right-clicks<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.140> bad<00:01:22.350> at<00:01:22.380> melt

you want to max them out lost depending
on<00:01:29.310> your<00:01:29.430> lane<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.060> might<00:01:30.270> want<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.659> switch

on your lane you might want to switch

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.590 
on your lane you might want to switch
melt<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.380> sites<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:32.070> 2<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.520> 4<00:01:32.759> or<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
melt and sites at 2 and 4 or if you

melt and sites at 2 and 4 or if you
desire<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.200> max<00:01:34.799> melt<00:01:35.100> before<00:01:35.310> refraction<00:01:36.119> but

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
desire so max melt before refraction but

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.130 
desire so max melt before refraction but
this<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> little<00:01:37.290> bit<00:01:37.409> more<00:01:37.650> uncommon

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
normally you want to take the mid role

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.280 
normally you want to take the mid role
