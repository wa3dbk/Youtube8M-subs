the beginning of the video is massive I
think<00:01:20.229> I<00:01:20.320> put<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.590> seed<00:01:20.830> in<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:21.130> description

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
think I put the seed in the description

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.570 
think I put the seed in the description
and<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.930> actually<00:01:23.140> found<00:01:23.619> some<00:01:24.430> of<00:01:24.760> this<00:01:26.040> or<00:01:27.040> I

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.700 
and I actually found some of this or I
don't<00:01:28.450> know<00:01:28.540> how<00:01:28.659> much<00:01:28.840> is<00:01:28.960> here<00:01:29.229> but<00:01:29.470> I<00:01:29.500> think

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
don't know how much is here but I think

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.340 
don't know how much is here but I think
it's<00:01:29.860> quite<00:01:30.010> a<00:01:30.100> lot<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.689> need<00:01:31.900> a<00:01:31.930> diamond

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
it's quite a lot you need a diamond

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.730 
it's quite a lot you need a diamond
pickaxe<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.860> mine<00:01:32.979> I<00:01:33.130> think

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.190 

this<00:01:36.740> takes<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.790> long<00:01:38.030> time<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.330> mind<00:01:38.780> isn't<00:01:39.140> it

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
this takes a long time to mind isn't it

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.969 
this takes a long time to mind isn't it
whoa<00:01:42.490> whoa<00:01:44.800> that's<00:01:45.800> down<00:01:46.280> also<00:01:46.729> doing<00:01:46.970> it<00:01:47.979> okay

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
whoa whoa that's down also doing it okay

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.820 
whoa whoa that's down also doing it okay
then<00:01:49.190> it<00:01:49.610> looks<00:01:49.790> like<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:50.810> spurts<00:01:51.229> out<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.500> bunch

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
then it looks like it spurts out a bunch

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.150 
then it looks like it spurts out a bunch
of<00:01:51.950> man<00:01:52.160> a<00:01:52.550> bunch<00:01:53.510> of<00:01:53.630> things<00:01:56.740> like<00:01:57.740> England's

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
of man a bunch of things like England's

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.969 
of man a bunch of things like England's
they<00:01:58.520> look<00:01:58.729> like<00:01:58.910> ingots<00:01:59.650> okay<00:02:00.650> when<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.800> have

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
they look like ingots okay when I have
