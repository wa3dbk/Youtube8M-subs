00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.979 
of testing right now um I'll make
another<00:00:35.340> kind<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.760> show<00:00:35.970> sort<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.750> this

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
become related to test character now for

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.800 
become related to test character now for
our<00:00:51.300> alpha<00:00:52.460> okay<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.790> is<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.060> map<00:00:54.300> we

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
our alpha okay so this is the map we

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.360 
our alpha okay so this is the map we
created<00:00:55.790> in<00:00:56.790> other<00:00:57.300> video<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.340> I

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
created in other video as you can see I

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.280 
created in other video as you can see I
can<00:00:59.520> walk<00:00:59.910> in<00:00:59.970> different<00:01:00.480> directions<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:01.140> can

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
can walk in different directions I can

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.890 
can walk in different directions I can
more<00:01:01.470> front<00:01:01.830> and<00:01:02.100> backwards<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> click<00:01:05.250> or

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
more front and backwards and a click or

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.200 
more front and backwards and a click or
full<00:01:06.900> stop<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:08.310> run<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:11.370> animations<00:01:12.060> they

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
full stop I can run the animations they

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.630 
full stop I can run the animations they
are<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:13.350> need<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.620> be<00:01:13.710> fixed<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.159> little<00:01:14.460> bit

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
are they need to be fixed a little bit

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.399 
are they need to be fixed a little bit
they're<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> lot<00:01:15.720> better<00:01:15.900> than<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.380> last

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
they're a lot better than the last

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.520 
they're a lot better than the last
videos<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:18.270> really<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.900> had<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> whole<00:01:19.290> lot

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
videos and really we had a whole lot

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.870 
videos and really we had a whole lot
more<00:01:19.650> animations<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.370> well<00:01:20.580> um<00:01:22.370> we<00:01:23.370> still<00:01:23.670> have

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
more animations as well um we still have

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.219 
more animations as well um we still have
what<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.270> had<00:01:24.420> me<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.659> video<00:01:24.900> I'm<00:01:24.990> pretty

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
what we had me on the video I'm pretty

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.750 
what we had me on the video I'm pretty
sure<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.530> had<00:01:25.680> all<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.190> we<00:01:26.490> didn't<00:01:26.670> actually

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
sure we had all this we didn't actually

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.330 
sure we had all this we didn't actually
have<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> directionals<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.770> had<00:01:28.920> sprint

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
have the directionals but we had sprint

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.100 
have the directionals but we had sprint
as<00:01:30.270> well<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:32.600> sprint<00:01:33.600> still<00:01:33.870> in<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.760> course

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
as well so sprint still in it course

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.180 
as well so sprint still in it course
will<00:01:37.110> show<00:01:37.260> off<00:01:37.320> that's<00:01:37.530> changing<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.010> be<00:01:38.130> you

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
will show off that's changing to be you

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.570 
will show off that's changing to be you
don't<00:01:38.250> know<00:01:38.370> it<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.670> think<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:40.580> more

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
don't know it but I think it is and more

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.240 
don't know it but I think it is and more
also<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.090> added<00:01:42.330> in<00:01:42.420> movement<00:01:42.960> wires<00:01:43.250> wells

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
also we added in movement wires wells

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.460 
also we added in movement wires wells
crouch<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.330> crash<00:01:45.990> looks<00:01:46.229> little<00:01:46.440> weird<00:01:46.940> but

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
crouch and crash looks little weird but

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.910 
crouch and crash looks little weird but
it's<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:50.400> good<00:01:50.610> enough<00:01:51.170> as<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.350> said<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.799> know

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
it's it's good enough as I said you know

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.980 
it's it's good enough as I said you know
these<00:01:53.130> animations<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.850> dummy<00:01:54.330> animations

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
these animations the dummy animations

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.570 
these animations the dummy animations
that<00:01:55.049> i<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.409> change<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.890> any<00:01:56.070> point<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.430> time

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
that i can change in any point in time

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.010 
that i can change in any point in time
and<00:01:56.880> they<00:01:56.940> probably<00:01:57.240> will<00:01:57.479> look<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.720> lot<00:01:57.840> better

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
and they probably will look a lot better

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.630 
and they probably will look a lot better
with<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.010> new<00:01:59.100> character<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:01.610> there<00:02:02.610> are

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
with the new character so there are

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.580 
with the new character so there are
other<00:02:03.150> animation<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.689> add<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.900> in<00:02:04.020> such<00:02:04.320> as

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
other animation to add it in such as

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.470 
other animation to add it in such as
dashing<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.979> side<00:02:07.979> Rolen

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.569 

and<00:02:12.480> also<00:02:12.930> back<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.469> word<00:02:15.650> they<00:02:16.650> use<00:02:16.889> main

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
and also back the word they use main

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.309 
and also back the word they use main
room<00:02:17.879> you<00:02:18.450> know<00:02:18.569> indicates<00:02:18.900> off<00:02:19.109> out<00:02:19.290> of

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
room you know indicates off out of

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.410 
room you know indicates off out of
situations<00:02:19.499> such<00:02:20.249> as<00:02:20.280> dodging<00:02:20.909> something

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
situations such as dodging something

the<00:03:24.359> alpha<00:03:24.859> so<00:03:27.409> you<00:03:28.409> know<00:03:28.530> i<00:03:29.389> can<00:03:30.389> pretty<00:03:30.540> much

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
the alpha so you know i can pretty much

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.899 
the alpha so you know i can pretty much
put<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.049> up<00:03:31.139> as<00:03:31.259> much<00:03:31.290> someone<00:03:31.889> gets<00:03:32.759> my

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
put it up as much someone gets my

put it up as much someone gets my
Shakespeare's<00:03:33.389> I<00:03:33.509> might<00:03:33.689> as<00:03:33.810> well<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.199> keep

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
Shakespeare's I might as well you keep

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.909 
Shakespeare's I might as well you keep
going<00:03:34.560> up<00:03:34.680> levels<00:03:35.040> because<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:36.919> yeah

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
going up levels because of it and yeah

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.259 
going up levels because of it and yeah
that's<00:03:38.879> really<00:03:39.389> a<00:03:39.689> character<00:03:40.229> stats<00:03:40.439> so<00:03:40.709> far

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
that's really a character stats so far

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.089 
that's really a character stats so far
course<00:03:42.269> as<00:03:42.569> I<00:03:42.989> said<00:03:43.139> as<00:03:43.470> soon<00:03:43.500> as<00:03:43.709> we<00:03:43.799> start

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
course as I said as soon as we start

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.270 
course as I said as soon as we start
alpha<00:03:44.370> testing<00:03:44.759> within<00:03:44.939> the<00:03:45.090> next<00:03:45.239> two<00:03:45.509> weeks

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
alpha testing within the next two weeks

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.249 
alpha testing within the next two weeks
should<00:03:47.280> be<00:03:47.430> able<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.729> edit<00:03:48.000> card<00:03:48.449> stats<00:03:48.840> and

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:49.259 
should be able to edit card stats and

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.559 
should be able to edit card stats and
see<00:03:49.829> that<00:03:50.040> effective<00:03:50.639> damage<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.269> damage

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
see that effective damage you damage

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.170 
see that effective damage you damage
taking<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.319> health<00:03:52.530> points<00:03:53.009> and<00:03:53.220> should<00:03:54.120> be

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
taking the health points and should be

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.219 
taking the health points and should be
able<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.359> balance<00:03:54.449> out<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.810> game<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.079> little

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:55.229 
able to balance out the game a little

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:59.479 
able to balance out the game a little
more<00:03:57.409> apart<00:03:58.409> from<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.590> it's<00:03:59.129> not<00:03:59.250> really

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
more apart from that it's not really

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.659 
more apart from that it's not really
much<00:03:59.609> else<00:03:59.790> sure<00:04:00.509> but<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:01.370> will<00:04:02.370> show<00:04:02.609> some

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
much else sure but I will show some

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:08.629 
much else sure but I will show some
other<00:04:03.209> things<00:04:03.479> like<00:04:04.250> trees<00:04:06.379> say<00:04:07.379> or<00:04:07.799> the

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
other things like trees say or the

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.659 
other things like trees say or the
mountains<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.150> stuff<00:04:09.329> I<00:04:09.509> mean<00:04:09.539> over<00:04:10.259> there

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
mountains and stuff I mean over there

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.779 
mountains and stuff I mean over there
you<00:04:11.669> can<00:04:11.849> see<00:04:11.879> them<00:04:12.409> that's<00:04:13.409> the<00:04:13.739> rock<00:04:14.400> texture

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:14.789 
you can see them that's the rock texture

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:17.390 
you can see them that's the rock texture
we<00:04:14.969> have<00:04:15.120> so<00:04:15.389> far<00:04:15.689> i'm<00:04:16.650> going<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:16.919> change<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.250> up

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
we have so far i'm going to change it up

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.709 
we have so far i'm going to change it up
a<00:04:17.519> little<00:04:17.549> i<00:04:17.789> don't<00:04:17.940> really<00:04:18.030> like<00:04:18.120> that<00:04:18.539> work

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:18.719 
a little i don't really like that work

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:22.189 
a little i don't really like that work
texture<00:04:19.549> but<00:04:20.549> same<00:04:20.849> on<00:04:21.000> each<00:04:21.180> trees<00:04:21.510> I'm<00:04:21.719> we're

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
texture but same on each trees I'm we're

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.970 
texture but same on each trees I'm we're
definitely<00:04:22.409> changing<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.039> trees

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
definitely changing the trees

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.520 
definitely changing the trees
but<00:04:24.370> right<00:04:25.240> now<00:04:25.450> we're<00:04:25.690> focusing<00:04:26.230> on<00:04:26.440> the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
but right now we're focusing on the

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.280 
but right now we're focusing on the
Alpha<00:04:26.950> just<00:04:27.600> getting<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.660> lot<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.840> programming

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
Alpha just getting a lot of programming

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.870 
Alpha just getting a lot of programming
done<00:04:29.530> not<00:04:29.740> so<00:04:29.860> much<00:04:30.010> graphics<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:30.640> mean<00:04:30.760> as<00:04:30.850> you

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
done not so much graphics I mean as you

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.390 
done not so much graphics I mean as you
can<00:04:31.060> see<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.300> graphics<00:04:31.660> aren't<00:04:31.840> so<00:04:32.080> bad<00:04:32.400> you

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
can see the graphics aren't so bad you

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.800 
can see the graphics aren't so bad you
know<00:04:33.520> they<00:04:33.640> actually<00:04:33.880> pretty<00:04:34.060> good<00:04:34.240> for<00:04:34.510> where

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
know they actually pretty good for where

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.110 
know they actually pretty good for where
we're<00:04:34.930> out<00:04:35.130> especially<00:04:36.130> you<00:04:36.520> know<00:04:36.670> I<00:04:36.700> could

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
we're out especially you know I could

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.020 
we're out especially you know I could
add<00:04:38.020> in<00:04:38.230> a<00:04:38.560> whole<00:04:39.040> lot<00:04:39.220> of<00:04:39.340> buildings<00:04:39.820> and

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
add in a whole lot of buildings and

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.250 
add in a whole lot of buildings and
stuff<00:04:40.180> and<00:04:40.330> make<00:04:40.450> this<00:04:40.540> place<00:04:40.780> actually<00:04:40.960> look

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
stuff and make this place actually look

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.600 
stuff and make this place actually look
quite<00:04:41.380> nice<00:04:41.740> but<00:04:42.130> oh<00:04:44.100> we're<00:04:45.100> just<00:04:45.220> mainly

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
quite nice but oh we're just mainly

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.850 
quite nice but oh we're just mainly
concentrating<00:04:46.480> on<00:04:46.630> getting<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.410> functions

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
concentrating on getting the functions

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.560 
concentrating on getting the functions
down<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.370> getting<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.730> base<00:04:48.880> programming

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
down and getting the base programming

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.120 
down and getting the base programming
down<00:04:49.780> so<00:04:49.960> we<00:04:50.080> can<00:04:50.200> just<00:04:50.350> interchange<00:04:50.860> our

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
down so we can just interchange our

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.540 
down so we can just interchange our
graphics<00:04:51.640> later<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.380> we<00:04:53.380> are<00:04:53.560> we<00:04:54.250> are<00:04:54.370> getting

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
graphics later and we are we are getting

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.830 
graphics later and we are we are getting
a<00:04:54.670> lot<00:04:54.760> of<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.940> programming<00:04:55.300> done<00:04:55.480> stuff

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
a lot of the programming done stuff

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.170 
a lot of the programming done stuff
which<00:04:56.620> is<00:04:56.770> good<00:04:56.980> that's<00:04:57.220> that's<00:04:57.640> what<00:04:57.850> we<00:04:57.970> want

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
which is good that's that's what we want

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.200 
which is good that's that's what we want
the<00:04:58.420> Alpha<00:04:59.760> especially<00:05:00.760> something<00:05:00.940> like<00:05:01.060> this

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
the Alpha especially something like this

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.610 
the Alpha especially something like this
tree<00:05:01.510> which<00:05:01.690> we're<00:05:01.810> going<00:05:01.930> to<00:05:02.020> change<00:05:02.200> out<00:05:02.440> but

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
tree which we're going to change out but

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.070 
tree which we're going to change out but
right<00:05:02.800> now<00:05:03.040> you<00:05:03.970> can<00:05:04.210> create<00:05:04.420> like<00:05:04.690> a<00:05:04.720> forest

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
right now you can create like a forest

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.920 
right now you can create like a forest
like<00:05:05.260> effect<00:05:05.650> just<00:05:05.920> at<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.310> distance<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.630> looks

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
like effect just at a distance it looks

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.330 
like effect just at a distance it looks
horrible<00:05:08.140> like<00:05:08.710> that<00:05:08.950> one<00:05:09.130> there<00:05:09.280> oh<00:05:10.860> yeah<00:05:11.860> if

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
horrible like that one there oh yeah if

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.340 
horrible like that one there oh yeah if
you<00:05:12.490> understood<00:05:12.850> in<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.210> game<00:05:13.420> anymore<00:05:13.810> this

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
you understood in the game anymore this

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.270 
you understood in the game anymore this
is<00:05:14.620> a<00:05:14.950> ninja<00:05:15.340> game<00:05:15.490> this<00:05:15.700> is<00:05:15.930> really<00:05:17.280> an

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
is a ninja game this is really an

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.760 
is a ninja game this is really an
original<00:05:18.790> game<00:05:19.000> and<00:05:19.330> it<00:05:19.390> will<00:05:19.690> kick<00:05:20.560> on<00:05:20.710> a
