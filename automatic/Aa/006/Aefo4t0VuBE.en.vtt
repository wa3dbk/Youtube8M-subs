 with half a cup of hot water 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.970
 in which we are going to dissolve two envelopes 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.970
 of unflavored gelatine 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.270
 we will mix the gelatin the 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.520
 online data has this design in the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.550
 which can hold perfectly for 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.680
 mix without risk of you risk 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.270
 we mix well the gelatin 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.950
 let's continue with a cup of milk 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.150
 we mix 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.620

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:30.230
 a cup of condensed milk a cup of 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.930
 milk cream and let's put 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.090
 the four clear ones that we have about to 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.740
 my 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.620
 let's mix very slowly and let's 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.190
 continue with the next step what is 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.040
 let's take the white chocolate that 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.800
 we have in our santafe bowl 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.250
 and we are going to cut it from very data 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.250
 little ones 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.270
 in this way 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.220
 chocolate and milk cream are already 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.190
 inside the glass flash cup we are going to 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.300
 seal it correctly we will lift 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.950
 the valve we will reach the microwave 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.720
 approximately 20 to 30 seconds up 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.880
 that chocolate is completely melted 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.140
 when we take it out of the chocolate goes to 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.240
 it seems that it is not melted but 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.160
 As we resolve will put the 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.160
 chosen consistency let's start 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.110
 this varies a lot depending on the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.540
 power and brand why you should not 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.810
 a good microwave oven let's take out 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.020
 our glass cup place the microwave 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.480
 we were careful 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.980
 let's stir a little so that the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.800
 pieces of chocolate that have not yet been 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.960
 melted are finished melting 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.130
 they're going to see that they barely get it out of the 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.350
 microwave will look like it's not 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.240
 completely melted but if mixed 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.880
 little all these little groups are leaving 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.500
 to undo back to our mix 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.600
 previous 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.110
 and we are going to add little by little 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.110
 chocolate 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.400
 we raise half we mix 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.620
 we add the other half 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.540
 I want to present you this wonderful 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.519
 product in multipurpose that is ideal for 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.890
 do all this kind of sponge voices 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.760
 two gelatins and others because it's going to take 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.760
 a beautiful shape 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.780
 we remove the stamp and we're going to put 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.780
 our mix in 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.090
 let's put the stamp correctly and 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.580
 we will reach the cooling 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.710
 less than an hour 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.900
 If I have one that I prepared a while ago 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.100

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.100

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.690
 let's use dark chocolate 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.390
 this is the white chocolate fluff 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.129
 dark chocolate to decorate it 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.590
