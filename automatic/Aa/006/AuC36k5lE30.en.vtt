00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
internally in the locker room then I'm

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.600 
internally in the locker room then I'm
my<00:03:55.660> wrong<00:03:56.170> prediction<00:03:56.680> with<00:03:56.800> that<00:03:56.980> Kevin<00:03:57.430> Love

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
my wrong prediction with that Kevin Love

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.820 
my wrong prediction with that Kevin Love
would<00:03:57.790> be<00:03:57.880> an<00:03:57.970> MVP<00:03:58.330> MVP<00:03:58.480> race<00:03:58.989> he<00:03:59.200> was<00:03:59.380> at<00:03:59.560> first

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
would be an MVP MVP race he was at first

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.470 
would be an MVP MVP race he was at first
then<00:04:00.459> I<00:04:00.489> said<00:04:00.790> that<00:04:00.910> he<00:04:01.000> would<00:04:01.120> be<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.300> best

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
then I said that he would be the best

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.030 
then I said that he would be the best
powerful<00:04:01.930> in<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.110> league<00:04:02.260> where<00:04:02.890> she

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
powerful in the league where she

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.420 
powerful in the league where she
definitely<00:04:03.489> wasn't<00:04:04.110> he's<00:04:05.110> not<00:04:05.380> even<00:04:05.440> top<00:04:06.010> four

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
definitely wasn't he's not even top four

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.270 
definitely wasn't he's not even top four
in<00:04:06.640> my<00:04:06.820> book<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.390> I<00:04:08.350> said<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.830> symbols<00:04:09.190> would

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
in my book and I said the symbols would

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.560 
in my book and I said the symbols would
make<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.459> playoffs<00:04:09.760> because<00:04:09.880> they<00:04:10.060> had<00:04:10.360> all

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570
