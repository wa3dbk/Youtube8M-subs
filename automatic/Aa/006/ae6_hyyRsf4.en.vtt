fourth generation Core processors these

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.390 
fourth generation Core processors these
are<00:00:12.809> not<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.110> be<00:00:13.139> confused<00:00:13.349> with<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.860> existing

fourth<00:00:14.639> generation<00:00:15.120> Core<00:00:15.330> processors<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.289> you

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
fourth generation Core processors so you

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.750 
fourth generation Core processors so you
may<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.590> heard<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.010> new<00:00:17.279> lineup<00:00:17.640> of

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
may have heard this new lineup of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.179 
may have heard this new lineup of
processors<00:00:18.270> as<00:00:18.420> has<00:00:19.140> well<00:00:19.380> refreshed<00:00:19.949> since

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
processors as has well refreshed since

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.410

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
gonna have compatibility then you should

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.179 
gonna have compatibility then you should
probably<00:01:11.159> go<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.960> h97<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.380> z97

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.350 
nice benefit of these intel retail box
processors<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.460> that<00:03:38.610> they<00:03:38.730> all<00:03:38.940> come<00:03:39.180> with<00:03:39.300> a

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
processors is that they all come with a

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.140 
processors is that they all come with a
three<00:03:39.750> year<00:03:39.950> manufacturer's<00:03:40.950> warranty

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150

finally<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.180> wanted<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.570> mention<00:03:42.800> overclocking

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
finally I wanted to mention overclocking

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.290 
finally I wanted to mention overclocking
briefly<00:03:44.280> here<00:03:44.610> because<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:44.970> know<00:03:45.030> that's<00:03:45.240> what

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
briefly here because I know that's what

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.670 
briefly here because I know that's what
a<00:03:45.420> lot<00:03:45.600> of<00:03:45.660> our<00:03:45.840> fans<00:03:46.020> from<00:03:46.230> our<00:03:46.380> YouTube

a lot of our fans from our YouTube

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.680 
a lot of our fans from our YouTube
channel<00:03:47.070> are<00:03:47.220> interested<00:03:47.880> in<00:03:48.000> all<00:03:48.210> the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
channel are interested in all the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.000 
channel are interested in all the
processors<00:03:49.200> we're<00:03:49.380> talking<00:03:49.620> about<00:03:49.770> here<00:03:49.950> and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
processors we're talking about here and

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.260 
processors we're talking about here and
the<00:03:50.070> ones<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.400> have<00:03:50.490> been<00:03:50.520> released<00:03:50.880> today

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
the ones that have been released today

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.020 
the ones that have been released today
or<00:03:51.510> just<00:03:51.540> recently<00:03:52.080> are<00:03:52.440> all<00:03:52.650> not<00:03:53.160> case<00:03:53.730> queue

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
or just recently are all not case queue

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.820 
or just recently are all not case queue
processors<00:03:54.630> which<00:03:54.810> means<00:03:55.080> they<00:03:55.260> do<00:03:55.320> not<00:03:55.440> have

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
processors which means they do not have

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.040 
processors which means they do not have
unlocked<00:03:56.280> multipliers<00:03:56.850> that's<00:03:57.480> totally<00:03:57.900> fine

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
unlocked multipliers that's totally fine

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.390 
unlocked multipliers that's totally fine
since<00:03:58.380> most<00:03:58.590> folks<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.010> don't<00:03:59.160> go<00:03:59.280> into

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
since most folks and don't go into

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.340 
since most folks and don't go into
overclocking<00:04:00.000> but<00:04:00.360> if<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:00.540> are<00:04:00.750> interested

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
overclocking but if you are interested

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.020 
overclocking but if you are interested
in<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.560> case<00:04:01.710> queue<00:04:01.950> processors<00:04:02.430> keep<00:04:02.850> your

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
in the case queue processors keep your

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.640 
in the case queue processors keep your
