00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
my Town Hall in the center and hopefully

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.540 
my Town Hall in the center and hopefully
I'm<00:01:00.470> gonna<00:01:00.560> win<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.830> bunch<00:01:01.040> of<00:01:01.130> defensive

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
I'm gonna win a bunch of defensive

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.820 
I'm gonna win a bunch of defensive
battles<00:01:01.910> and<00:01:02.150> by<00:01:02.630> the<00:01:02.690> time<00:01:02.960> my<00:01:02.990> Town<00:01:03.380> Hall<00:01:03.650> is

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
battles and by the time my Town Hall is

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.040 
battles and by the time my Town Hall is
upgraded<00:01:04.309> I'll<00:01:04.430> be<00:01:04.610> at<00:01:04.699> about<00:01:04.940> 1500<00:01:05.690> trophies

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050

the sweet spot

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.510 
the sweet spot
now<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.740> loot<00:01:15.950> system<00:01:16.130> is<00:01:16.370> being

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
now that the loot system is being

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.700 
now that the loot system is being
changed<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.180> speaking<00:01:18.080> once<00:01:18.290> again<00:01:18.530> about

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.870 
about two weeks since that update came
out<00:01:22.550> and<00:01:22.810> overall<00:01:23.810> I'd<00:01:24.380> say<00:01:24.410> loot<00:01:25.280> has<00:01:25.640> been

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
out and overall I'd say loot has been

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.000 
out and overall I'd say loot has been
okay<00:01:26.120> it<00:01:26.660> hasn't<00:01:26.840> been<00:01:27.080> great<00:01:27.350> but<00:01:27.530> I<00:01:27.560> do<00:01:27.650> find

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
okay it hasn't been great but I do find

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.490 
okay it hasn't been great but I do find
myself<00:01:28.160> clicking<00:01:28.909> next<00:01:29.210> a<00:01:29.540> lot<00:01:30.050> more<00:01:30.260> than<00:01:30.440> I

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
myself clicking next a lot more than I

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.060 
myself clicking next a lot more than I
did<00:01:30.680> before

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
did before

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.130 
did before
obviously<00:01:32.060> I'm<00:01:32.180> used<00:01:32.510> to<00:01:32.600> on<00:01:32.810> my<00:01:32.960> high-level

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
obviously I'm used to on my high-level

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.410 
obviously I'm used to on my high-level
account<00:01:33.680> clicking<00:01:34.100> next<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.520> ton<00:01:35.120> of<00:01:35.150> times

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
account clicking next a ton of times

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.210 
account clicking next a ton of times
because<00:01:35.930> I'm<00:01:36.260> having<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.710> look<00:01:36.830> for<00:01:37.010> all<00:01:37.100> these

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
because I'm having to look for all these

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.850 
because I'm having to look for all these
bases<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:37.820> look<00:01:37.940> for<00:01:38.060> all<00:01:38.120> these<00:01:38.210> trophies

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
bases and look for all these trophies

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.460 
bases and look for all these trophies
but<00:01:39.860> compared<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.850> old<00:01:41.000> farming<00:01:41.540> -<00:01:41.870> now<00:01:42.110> I

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
but compared to the old farming - now I

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.080 
but compared to the old farming - now I
think<00:01:43.070> I'm<00:01:43.190> definitely<00:01:43.370> clicking<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.940> next

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
think I'm definitely clicking the next

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.670 
think I'm definitely clicking the next
button<00:01:44.210> bore<00:01:44.630> more<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.290> there's<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.530> lot<00:01:45.650> of

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
button bore more and there's a lot of

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.200 
button bore more and there's a lot of
people<00:01:45.950> complaining<00:01:46.250> about<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:46.729> on<00:01:47.030> the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
people complaining about it on the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.960 
people complaining about it on the
forums<00:01:47.600> different<00:01:47.990> social<00:01:48.320> media<00:01:48.650> sites<00:01:48.970> but

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
forums different social media sites but

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.340 
forums different social media sites but
yeah<00:01:50.300> I<00:01:50.330> can<00:01:50.600> definitely<00:01:50.690> see<00:01:51.050> that<00:01:51.080> it's

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
yeah I can definitely see that it's

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.840 
yeah I can definitely see that it's
taking<00:01:51.620> a<00:01:51.680> little<00:01:51.770> bit<00:01:51.920> longer<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:52.340> find<00:01:52.430> basis

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
taking a little bit longer to find basis

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.370 
taking a little bit longer to find basis
but<00:01:53.000> I<00:01:53.060> can<00:01:53.240> still<00:01:53.450> find<00:01:53.630> some<00:01:53.870> good<00:01:54.020> bases

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
but I can still find some good bases

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.200 
but I can still find some good bases
don't<00:01:54.890> get<00:01:55.040> me<00:01:55.130> wrong<00:01:55.159> it's<00:01:55.520> just<00:01:55.550> costing<00:01:56.060> me

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
don't get me wrong it's just costing me

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.789 
don't get me wrong it's just costing me
a<00:01:56.240> little<00:01:56.450> bit<00:01:56.630> more<00:01:56.780> gold<00:01:57.049> to<00:01:57.260> keep<00:01:57.380> searching

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
a little bit more gold to keep searching

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.950 
a little bit more gold to keep searching
for<00:01:57.979> them<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.580> I<00:01:58.640> think<00:01:58.820> a<00:01:58.909> townhall<00:01:59.360> 9<00:01:59.390> I

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
for them and I think a townhall 9 I

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.190 
for them and I think a townhall 9 I
might<00:02:00.200> have<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.500> spend<00:02:01.510> 580<00:02:02.510> gold<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.930> find<00:02:03.049> a

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
might have to spend 580 gold to find a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.140 
might have to spend 580 gold to find a
new<00:02:03.320> base<00:02:03.470> or<00:02:03.710> maybe<00:02:03.740> I'm<00:02:04.070> already<00:02:04.640> doing<00:02:05.060> that

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
new base or maybe I'm already doing that

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.810 
new base or maybe I'm already doing that
right<00:02:05.330> now<00:02:05.500> maybe<00:02:06.500> even<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:07.040> like<00:02:07.190> upwards<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.790> a

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
right now maybe even I like upwards to a

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.730 
right now maybe even I like upwards to a
thousand<00:02:08.300> gold<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:08.780> overall<00:02:09.470> it's<00:02:09.679> not

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
thousand gold so overall it's not

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.140 
thousand gold so overall it's not
getting<00:02:09.979> any<00:02:10.100> better<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.580> I<00:02:10.640> hope<00:02:10.940> that

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
getting any better and I hope that

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.580 
getting any better and I hope that
townhall<00:02:11.630> 9

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
townhall 9

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.140 
townhall 9
maybe<00:02:13.590> has<00:02:13.800> some<00:02:13.980> improved<00:02:14.310> loot<00:02:14.490> or<00:02:14.730> I'm<00:02:14.970> also

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
maybe has some improved loot or I'm also

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.000 
maybe has some improved loot or I'm also
hoping<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.570> this<00:02:15.810> new<00:02:15.840> elixir<00:02:16.620> boost<00:02:16.830> that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
hoping that this new elixir boost that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.610 
hoping that this new elixir boost that
they<00:02:17.100> put<00:02:17.310> out<00:02:17.510> boosts<00:02:18.510> some<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.440> elixir

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
they put out boosts some of the elixir

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.960 
they put out boosts some of the elixir
we<00:02:19.860> find<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.220> I'm<00:02:20.280> really<00:02:20.460> hoping<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:20.850> we

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
we find and I'm really hoping that we

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.640 
we find and I'm really hoping that we
see<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.210> goldmine<00:02:21.660> boost<00:02:21.930> coming<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.380> before

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
see a goldmine boost coming up before

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.440 
see a goldmine boost coming up before
Christmas<00:02:23.070> but<00:02:23.250> maybe<00:02:23.760> that's<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.240> dream

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
Christmas but maybe that's just a dream

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.240 
Christmas but maybe that's just a dream
but<00:02:24.510> anyways<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.530> can<00:02:25.650> see<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:25.830> wrapped<00:02:26.100> up

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
but anyways you can see I wrapped up

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.710 
but anyways you can see I wrapped up
this<00:02:26.370> raid<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:26.850> had<00:02:26.940> some<00:02:27.090> dragons<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.570> took

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
this raid I just had some dragons I took

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.850 
this raid I just had some dragons I took
care<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.930> some<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.230> buildings<00:02:28.380> and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
care of some of the buildings and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.890 
care of some of the buildings and
overall<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.280> still<00:02:29.400> stole<00:02:29.850> almost<00:02:30.120> 400,000

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
overall I still stole almost 400,000

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.390 
overall I still stole almost 400,000
resources<00:02:31.380> as<00:02:31.530> well<00:02:32.070> as<00:02:32.190> two<00:02:32.340> hundred

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
resources as well as two hundred

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.580 
resources as well as two hundred
thousand<00:02:32.910> gold<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:33.990> wasn't<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.260> bad<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.440> a

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
thousand gold so it wasn't that bad of a

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.780 
thousand gold so it wasn't that bad of a
raid<00:02:34.740> at<00:02:34.860> all<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.160> go<00:02:35.370> ahead<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.580> check<00:02:35.670> out

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
raid at all and go ahead and check out

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.850 
raid at all and go ahead and check out
the<00:02:35.910> next<00:02:36.030> one<00:02:36.240> so<00:02:37.020> raid<00:02:37.200> number<00:02:37.440> two<00:02:37.650> I

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
the next one so raid number two I

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.230 
the next one so raid number two I
actually<00:02:38.190> skipped<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.790> think<00:02:38.970> one<00:02:39.090> or<00:02:39.210> two

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
actually skipped I think one or two

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.900 
actually skipped I think one or two
raids<00:02:39.540> after<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> one<00:02:40.620> right<00:02:41.400> before<00:02:41.550> there

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
raids after the one right before there

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.750 
raids after the one right before there
I'm<00:02:42.060> at<00:02:42.150> 2.86<00:02:42.780> right<00:02:43.260> now<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.340> steal<00:02:44.580> all

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
I'm at 2.86 right now so if I steal all

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.980 
I'm at 2.86 right now so if I steal all
this<00:02:44.910> gold<00:02:45.120> I'll<00:02:45.300> definitely<00:02:45.630> have<00:02:45.690> enough<00:02:45.900> to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
this gold I'll definitely have enough to

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.960 
this gold I'll definitely have enough to
do<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.230> Tesla<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.370> looking<00:02:47.610> at<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.790> base

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
do that Tesla and looking at this base

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.970 
do that Tesla and looking at this base
definitely<00:02:48.630> under<00:02:48.840> upgraded<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.500> lot<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.770> level

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
definitely under upgraded a lot of level

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
two Tesla's but I'm not too worried

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.199 
two Tesla's but I'm not too worried
about<00:03:31.440> those<00:03:31.739> guys<00:03:31.920> as<00:03:32.160> long<00:03:32.550> as<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:32.910> keep<00:03:33.060> him

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
about those guys as long as I keep him

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.610 
about those guys as long as I keep him
out<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.450> range<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.959> air<00:03:34.110> defense<00:03:34.290> he

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
out of range of the air defense he

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.460 
out of range of the air defense he
should<00:03:34.800> be<00:03:34.920> good<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.370> honestly<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.480> think<00:03:36.540> he's

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
should be good and honestly I think he's

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.690 
should be good and honestly I think he's
probably<00:03:37.650> going<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:37.980> get<00:03:38.040> pretty<00:03:38.310> close<00:03:38.459> in

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
probably going to get pretty close in

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.010 
probably going to get pretty close in
just<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.970> second<00:03:39.360> but<00:03:39.420> he<00:03:39.540> should<00:03:39.750> be<00:03:39.780> able<00:03:39.930> to

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
just a second but he should be able to

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.750 
just a second but he should be able to
take<00:03:40.230> out<00:03:40.380> at<00:03:40.590> least<00:03:40.830> one<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.280> gold<00:03:41.459> stores

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
take out at least one of the gold stores

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.790 
take out at least one of the gold stores
just<00:03:41.910> before<00:03:42.239> he<00:03:42.300> goes<00:03:42.390> down<00:03:42.630> alright<00:03:43.620> so

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
just before he goes down alright so

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.410 
just before he goes down alright so
right<00:03:43.890> now<00:03:44.010> we're<00:03:44.190> sitting<00:03:44.280> at<00:03:44.430> 61%<00:03:44.880> doing<00:03:45.360> a

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
right now we're sitting at 61% doing a

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.060 
right now we're sitting at 61% doing a
pretty<00:03:45.570> good<00:03:45.660> job<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:46.200> might<00:03:46.500> even<00:03:46.620> be<00:03:46.830> able<00:03:46.860> to

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
pretty good job I might even be able to

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.530 
pretty good job I might even be able to
get<00:03:47.190> three<00:03:47.430> stars<00:03:47.640> on<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:47.880> base<00:03:48.060> if<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.300> really

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540

right<00:04:04.680> now<00:04:04.800> it's<00:04:04.920> looking<00:04:05.100> pretty<00:04:05.250> good<00:04:05.370> we've

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
right now it's looking pretty good we've

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.670 
right now it's looking pretty good we've
taken<00:04:06.180> out<00:04:06.390> almost<00:04:06.959> all<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.200> gold<00:04:07.380> just<00:04:07.590> a

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
taken out almost all the gold just a

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.900 
taken out almost all the gold just a
little<00:04:07.920> bit<00:04:08.010> left<00:04:08.160> in<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.340> gold<00:04:08.640> storage

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
little bit left in that gold storage

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.030 
little bit left in that gold storage
because<00:04:09.540> my<00:04:09.690> dragon<00:04:10.019> got<00:04:10.170> shot<00:04:10.410> down<00:04:10.620> but<00:04:11.010> I

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
because my dragon got shot down but I

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.259 
because my dragon got shot down but I
think<00:04:11.430> we<00:04:11.519> should<00:04:11.700> be<00:04:11.790> able<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:11.970> get<00:04:12.060> three

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
think we should be able to get three

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.490 
think we should be able to get three
stars<00:04:12.480> on<00:04:12.600> this<00:04:12.720> base<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.140> I<00:04:13.170> should<00:04:13.350> go

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
stars on this base and I should go

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.490 
stars on this base and I should go
fairly<00:04:13.860> easily<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:15.480> right<00:04:15.780> now<00:04:15.870> I'm<00:04:15.959> at<00:04:16.080> 3.1

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
fairly easily so right now I'm at 3.1

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.020 
fairly easily so right now I'm at 3.1
million<00:04:16.799> gold<00:04:17.100> definitely<00:04:17.489> enough<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.700> do<00:04:17.910> my

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
million gold definitely enough to do my

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.970 
million gold definitely enough to do my
Tesla<00:04:18.450> if<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:18.930> look<00:04:19.080> at<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.260> Tesla<00:04:19.620> upgrade<00:04:19.950> I

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
Tesla if you look at the Tesla upgrade I

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.800 
Tesla if you look at the Tesla upgrade I
think<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.280> get<00:04:20.460> like<00:04:20.580> an<00:04:20.669> additional<00:04:21.060> 11<00:04:21.479> damage

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
think I get like an additional 11 damage

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.930 
think I get like an additional 11 damage
per<00:04:21.989> second<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:23.160> think<00:04:23.250> that's<00:04:23.550> enough<00:04:23.820> to

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
per second and I think that's enough to

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.290 
per second and I think that's enough to
like<00:04:24.060> take<00:04:24.330> care<00:04:24.360> of

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
like take care of

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.700 
like take care of
these<00:04:25.449> different<00:04:25.750> types<00:04:25.930> of<00:04:26.050> troops<00:04:26.319> in<00:04:26.470> one

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
these different types of troops in one

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.800 
these different types of troops in one
shot<00:04:27.009> so<00:04:27.039> literally<00:04:27.550> my<00:04:27.729> Tesla<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.300> just<00:04:28.720> going

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
shot so literally my Tesla is just going

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.300 
shot so literally my Tesla is just going
to<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:28.990> bang<00:04:29.289> bang<00:04:29.470> bang<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:30.039> it's<00:04:30.129> going<00:04:30.250> to

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
to a bang bang bang and it's going to

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.040 
to a bang bang bang and it's going to
take<00:04:30.520> out<00:04:30.699> all<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:30.970> different<00:04:31.060> troops<00:04:31.479> so

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
take out all the different troops so

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.909 
take out all the different troops so
it's<00:04:32.199> definitely<00:04:32.470> going<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.650> be<00:04:32.710> a<00:04:32.770> big
