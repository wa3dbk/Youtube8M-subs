okay<00:00:00.900> so<00:00:00.960> I<00:00:01.079> didn't<00:00:01.319> unbox<00:00:01.589> him<00:00:01.740> the<00:00:01.860> other<00:00:01.979> day

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
okay so I didn't unbox him the other day

computer<00:00:04.890> case<00:00:05.100> but<00:00:05.700> now<00:00:05.879> I've<00:00:06.029> actually<00:00:06.240> gone

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
computer case but now I've actually gone

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.419 
computer case but now I've actually gone
ahead<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:06.899> done<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.230> quick<00:00:07.529> build<00:00:07.830> inside<00:00:08.250> it

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
ahead and done a quick build inside it

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.150 
ahead and done a quick build inside it
just<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.790> kind<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.090> get<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> feel<00:00:10.019> for<00:00:10.320> how<00:00:10.769> easy

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
just to kind of get a feel for how easy

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.370 
just to kind of get a feel for how easy
it<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.820> build<00:00:11.940> inside<00:00:12.389> how<00:00:12.690> quiet<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.320> is

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
it is to build inside how quiet it is

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.959 
it is to build inside how quiet it is
because<00:00:13.889> that's<00:00:14.009> what<00:00:14.250> everyone<00:00:14.490> seem<00:00:14.790> to

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
because that's what everyone seem to

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.790 
because that's what everyone seem to
want<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.179> know<00:00:15.299> about<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:16.139> first<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.500> all<00:00:16.590> at

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
want to know about it so first of all at

want to know about it so first of all at
the<00:00:16.830> front<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.340> mentioned<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.119> my<00:00:18.210> unboxing

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the front I I mentioned in my unboxing

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.689 
the front I I mentioned in my unboxing
that<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.020> lights<00:00:19.140> up<00:00:19.320> with<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> blue<00:00:19.740> LED<00:00:19.890> now<00:00:20.640> we

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
that it lights up with a blue LED now we

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.130 
that it lights up with a blue LED now we
actually<00:00:21.180> get<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.330> see<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.810> looks<00:00:21.990> like

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
actually get to see what it looks like

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
on the case the door opens up where we

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.740 
on the case the door opens up where we
can<00:00:28.289> find<00:00:28.590> inside<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.880> one<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.480> haven't

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
can find inside the one I haven't

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.479 
can find inside the one I haven't
installed<00:00:31.109> any<00:00:31.410> aftermarket<00:00:31.830> fans<00:00:32.309> or

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
black-and-white fan and then I've

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.729 
black-and-white fan and then I've
installed<00:00:36.239> one<00:00:36.450> DVD<00:00:36.870> drive<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.649> this

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
installed one DVD drive for this

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.430 
installed one DVD drive for this
particular<00:00:38.370> demo<00:00:38.879> sister<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.020> can't

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
particular demo sister and you can't

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.510 
particular demo sister and you can't
really<00:00:40.649> look<00:00:40.829> through<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.219> see<00:00:41.399> the

really look through there and see the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.799 
really look through there and see the
hard<00:00:41.700> drives<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.120> that's<00:00:42.329> okay

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
hard drives but that's okay

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.200 
hard drives but that's okay
alright<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.649> why<00:00:43.800> don't<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.040> get<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.640> open

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
alright so why don't we get this open

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.500 
alright so why don't we get this open
here<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:47.399> not<00:00:47.640> used<00:00:47.879> their<00:00:48.149> mod<00:00:48.329> you

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510

here and I have not used their mod you
vent<00:00:48.690> feature<00:00:48.930> because<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.739> supposed<00:00:49.950> to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
vent feature because this is supposed to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.950 
vent feature because this is supposed to
be<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.430> silent<00:00:50.879> build<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.480> how<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.719> case

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
be a silent build that is how the case

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
be a silent build that is how the case
is<00:00:52.230> targeted<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.860> marketed<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.730> I've<00:00:53.850> left

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
is targeted and marketed so I've left

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.240 
is targeted and marketed so I've left
all<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> noise<00:00:55.020> deadening<00:00:55.530> materials<00:00:56.039> on

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
all of the noise deadening materials on

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.180 
all of the noise deadening materials on
the<00:00:56.550> extra<00:00:56.879> ventilation<00:00:57.449> holes<00:00:57.920> alright<00:00:58.920> so

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the extra ventilation holes alright so

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.040 
the extra ventilation holes alright so
I'm<00:00:59.280> taking<00:00:59.460> off<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.000> heavy<00:01:00.270> side<00:01:00.629> panel

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
I'm taking off that heavy side panel

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.479 
I'm taking off that heavy side panel
because<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.469> got<00:01:01.620> all<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.190> sound

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
because it's got all of that sound

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.179 
because it's got all of that sound
deadening<00:01:02.910> material<00:01:02.969> inside<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.739> inside

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
deadening material inside so the inside

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.160 
deadening material inside so the inside
of<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.549> case<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.090> actually<00:01:06.659> really<00:01:06.869> clever

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
of this case is actually really clever

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.620 
of this case is actually really clever
it<00:01:07.740> did<00:01:07.950> not<00:01:08.189> take<00:01:08.520> me<00:01:08.670> long<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:09.060> do<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.330> build

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
it did not take me long to do this build

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.080 
it did not take me long to do this build
and<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.170> was<00:01:10.350> able<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> very<00:01:11.130> tidy<00:01:11.520> job<00:01:11.880> as

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and I was able to do a very tidy job as

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.630 
and I was able to do a very tidy job as
you<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.570> see<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.409> cable<00:01:13.770> management<00:01:14.280> so

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
you can see of the cable management so

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.700 
you can see of the cable management so
I'm<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.939> using<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.570> modular<00:01:15.960> power<00:01:16.140> supply<00:01:16.380> I'm

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
I'm not using a modular power supply I'm

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.859 
I'm not using a modular power supply I'm
using<00:01:16.979> their<00:01:17.340> Tesla<00:01:17.850> 650<00:01:18.390> watt<00:01:18.509> power<00:01:18.720> supply

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
using their Tesla 650 watt power supply

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.830 
using their Tesla 650 watt power supply
and<00:01:19.350> I've<00:01:19.830> used<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> included<00:01:20.820> cable<00:01:21.060> ties<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and I've used the included cable ties to

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.380 
and I've used the included cable ties to
tie<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> unnecessary<00:01:23.189> cables<00:01:23.970> I'm

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
tie up all of the unnecessary cables I'm

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.660 
tie up all of the unnecessary cables I'm
running<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> GTX<00:01:25.259> 275<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.580> I've

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
running a GTX 275 and you can see I've

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.160 
running a GTX 275 and you can see I've
still<00:01:26.939> got<00:01:27.119> about<00:01:27.330> another<00:01:27.570> inch<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.020> half

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
still got about another inch and a half

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.870 
still got about another inch and a half

cool thing that I did not mention about
this<00:01:50.070> case<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:51.060> actually<00:01:51.450> has<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> noise

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
this case is it actually has a noise

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.899 
this case is it actually has a noise
deadening<00:01:52.320> material<00:01:52.399> where<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.430> mount<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
deadening material where you mount the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.910 
deadening material where you mount the
power<00:01:54.090> supply<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.840> case<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.649> there's<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
power supply to the case so there's a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.260 
power supply to the case so there's a
little<00:01:56.100> bit<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.280> foam<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.610> there<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.000> their

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
little bit of foam in there and their

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.600 
little bit of foam in there and their
power<00:01:57.509> supplies<00:01:57.930> actually<00:01:58.439> include<00:01:58.799> overly

power supplies actually include overly

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.429 
power supplies actually include overly
long<00:01:59.820> screws<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.899> attach<00:02:01.140> them

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
long screws so that you can attach them

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.469 
long screws so that you can attach them
easily<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.040> leave<00:02:02.219> enough<00:02:02.490> space<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:03.390> you

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
easily and leave enough space that you

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.700 
easily and leave enough space that you
are<00:02:03.659> going<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.869> take<00:02:04.049> advantage<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.590> that

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
are going to take advantage of that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.410 
are going to take advantage of that
annoys<00:02:04.950> deadening<00:02:05.369> another<00:02:05.909> cool<00:02:06.180> feature

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
annoys deadening another cool feature

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.749 
annoys deadening another cool feature
and<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.930> kind<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.409> why<00:02:08.280> didn't<00:02:08.580> anyone

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
and this is kind of a why didn't anyone

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.869 
and this is kind of a why didn't anyone
else<00:02:09.000> think<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.569> sort<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.289> thing<00:02:10.700> there<00:02:11.700> are

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
else think of it sort of thing there are

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.309 
else think of it sort of thing there are
extra<00:02:12.270> holes<00:02:12.510> on

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
extra holes on

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.809 
extra holes on
their<00:02:13.439> harddrive<00:02:13.859> mounting<00:02:14.219> sleds<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.670> can

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
their harddrive mounting sleds you can

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.020 
their harddrive mounting sleds you can
see<00:02:15.030> there's<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.480> four<00:02:16.249> rubber<00:02:17.249> rubberized

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
see there's the four rubber rubberized

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.089 
see there's the four rubber rubberized
holes<00:02:18.480> for<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.900> normal<00:02:19.290> hard<00:02:19.469> drive<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.920> then

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
holes for a normal hard drive and then

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.309 
holes for a normal hard drive and then
there's<00:02:20.310> actually<00:02:20.480> four<00:02:21.480> more<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.079> you<00:02:22.139> can

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
there's actually four more and you can

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.379 
there's actually four more and you can
see<00:02:22.469> that<00:02:22.590> they've<00:02:22.739> coded<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.219> here<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.639> is<00:02:24.120> for

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389 
see that they've coded it here a is for

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.360 
see that they've coded it here a is for
three<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.629> a<00:02:24.689> half<00:02:24.719> inch<00:02:25.109> B<00:02:25.709> is<00:02:25.859> for<00:02:26.099> two<00:02:26.219> and<00:02:26.340> a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
three and a half inch B is for two and a

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.520 
three and a half inch B is for two and a

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
half inch hard drive or SSD so you can

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.770 
half inch hard drive or SSD so you can
see<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.859> I've<00:02:28.980> installed<00:02:29.489> in<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:29.879> case<00:02:30.150> one

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
see that I've installed in this case one

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.959 
see that I've installed in this case one
SSD<00:02:31.319> drive<00:02:31.560> which<00:02:31.829> is<00:02:31.859> mounted<00:02:32.129> just<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.790> same

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
SSD drive which is mounted just the same

way<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> normal<00:02:33.510> drive<00:02:33.719> would<00:02:33.900> be<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.230> then<00:02:34.680> one

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
way a normal drive would be and then one

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.830

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
Western Digital black drive so I thought

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.729 
Western Digital black drive so I thought
that<00:02:39.450> was<00:02:39.659> one<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.900> one<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.409> cleverer

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
that was one of one of the cleverer

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.800 
that was one of one of the cleverer
things<00:02:41.129> about<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.639> particular<00:02:41.909> chassis<00:02:42.659> so

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
things about this particular chassis so

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.940
