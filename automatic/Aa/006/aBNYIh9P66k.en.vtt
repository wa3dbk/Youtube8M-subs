blushes<00:01:08.400> that's<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.000> said<00:01:09.210> before<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
blushes that's like I said before and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.140 
blushes that's like I said before and
this<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.010> colors<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.880> isn't

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
this is one of the colors and this isn't

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.899 
this is one of the colors and this isn't
toasted<00:01:12.720> almond<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:17.369> probably<00:01:17.670> really

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
toasted almond and I you probably really

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.359 
toasted almond and I you probably really
can't<00:01:18.119> see<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.920> very<00:01:20.130> neutral

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.399 
can't see it but it's a very neutral
color<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.330> probably<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.689> won't<00:01:21.810> show<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.140> as

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
color so it probably it won't show up as

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.120 
color so it probably it won't show up as
well<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.720> this<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.780> very<00:01:25.200> neutral<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.920> got

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
well but this is very neutral so you got

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.340 
well but this is very neutral so you got
like<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.310> brown-eyed<00:01:26.880> neutral<00:01:27.420> look<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:28.170> is
