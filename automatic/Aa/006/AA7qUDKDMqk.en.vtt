00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
to a one lash and then I'll just leave

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.050 
to a one lash and then I'll just leave
one<00:02:55.470> bare<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.100> can<00:02:56.340> see<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.670> difference

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
so I always start out by going from the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.790 
so I always start out by going from the
bottom<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.940> just<00:03:03.060> like<00:03:03.360> wiggling<00:03:03.690> my<00:03:04.230> way<00:03:04.470> up

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
bottom and just like wiggling my way up

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:16.350 
bottom and just like wiggling my way up

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.570 

and<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.050> actually<00:03:17.290> sometimes<00:03:17.800> like<00:03:18.250> roll<00:03:18.550> it

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
and I actually sometimes like roll it

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.560 
and I actually sometimes like roll it
like<00:03:19.180> I'm<00:03:19.390> curling<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.330> lash

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
like I'm curling so this is the lash

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
like I'm curling so this is the lash
with<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.740> mascara<00:03:27.250> this<00:03:28.180> is<00:03:28.420> without<00:03:28.660> so

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590

another<00:03:30.040> trick<00:03:30.340> I<00:03:30.460> like<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.850> do<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.390> really

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
another trick I like to do to really

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.660 
another trick I like to do to really
extend<00:03:32.050> my<00:03:32.260> lashes<00:03:32.710> because<00:03:32.830> my<00:03:33.130> lashes<00:03:33.370> are

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
extend my lashes because my lashes are

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.080 
extend my lashes because my lashes are
really<00:03:34.000> short<00:03:34.330> I<00:03:34.660> take<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.800> brush<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.640> take<00:03:36.910> it

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
really short I take the brush I take it

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.540 
really short I take the brush I take it
at<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.600> bottom<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.320> lash<00:03:38.530> line<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:39.100> I

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
at the bottom of the lash line and I

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.910 
at the bottom of the lash line and I
roll<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.240> up<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:41.610> out<00:03:42.610> I<00:03:43.290> actually<00:03:44.290> learn<00:03:44.710> that

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
roll it up and out I actually learn that

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.210 
roll it up and out I actually learn that
trick<00:03:45.340> when<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:45.820> was<00:03:46.090> at<00:03:46.270> Mac<00:03:46.650> so<00:03:47.650> you<00:03:47.680> take<00:03:48.040> the

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
trick when I was at Mac so you take the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.420 
trick when I was at Mac so you take the
brush<00:03:48.490> on<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:49.420> lash<00:03:49.720> line<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.620> twirl<00:03:51.160> it

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
brush on the lash line and you twirl it

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.270 
brush on the lash line and you twirl it
out<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:52.030> it'll<00:03:52.150> really<00:03:53.280> extend<00:03:54.280> your<00:03:55.110> lashes

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
out and it'll really extend your lashes

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.220 
out and it'll really extend your lashes
and<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.730> makes<00:03:58.000> your<00:03:58.150> mascara<00:03:58.600> go<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.810> long<00:03:59.080> way

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
and it makes your mascara go a long way

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:08.160 
and it makes your mascara go a long way
so<00:03:59.290> I<00:03:59.530> do<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.890> a<00:03:59.920> couple<00:04:00.190> times

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.680 

this<00:04:08.740> is<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.040> lash<00:04:09.250> with<00:04:09.520> the<00:04:09.640> Dior<00:04:10.030> Addict

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.350 
this is the lash with the Dior Addict
mascara<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.830> this<00:04:12.400> is<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.819> lash<00:04:13.030> with

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360

like<00:04:25.710> there's<00:04:26.710> not<00:04:27.040> a<00:04:27.100> major<00:04:27.430> difference<00:04:27.790> so<00:04:28.510> I

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
like there's not a major difference so I

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:38.780 
like there's not a major difference so I
should<00:04:30.580> do<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:30.790> couple<00:04:31.270> more

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.210 

all<00:04:39.330> right<00:04:39.570> so<00:04:39.840> that's<00:04:40.050> like<00:04:40.290> with<00:04:40.500> four<00:04:40.890> I

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
all right so that's like with four I

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.160 
all right so that's like with four I
don't<00:04:41.760> know<00:04:41.850> like<00:04:42.060> three<00:04:42.300> or<00:04:42.390> four<00:04:42.450> coats<00:04:42.900> of

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
don't know like three or four coats of

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:54.989 
don't know like three or four coats of
mascara

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:54.999 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.719 

so<00:04:55.509> that's<00:04:55.809> with<00:04:56.079> the<00:04:56.139> mascara<00:04:56.739> and<00:04:57.159> this<00:04:57.489> is

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
so that's with the mascara and this is

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.149 
so that's with the mascara and this is
without<00:04:57.909> so<00:04:58.809> this<00:04:58.989> is<00:04:59.139> the<00:04:59.259> eye<00:04:59.289> with<00:04:59.649> mascara

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
without so this is the eye with mascara

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:05.339 
without so this is the eye with mascara
and<00:05:00.549> this<00:05:00.969> is<00:05:01.239> no<00:05:01.959> mascara<00:05:02.939> you<00:05:03.939> be<00:05:04.269> the<00:05:04.449> judge

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
and this is no mascara you be the judge

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.189 
and this is no mascara you be the judge
my<00:05:05.499> friends<00:05:06.069> have<00:05:06.909> the<00:05:07.059> mess<00:05:07.239> card<00:05:07.599> now<00:05:07.869> but

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
my friends have the mess card now but

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.809 
my friends have the mess card now but
don't<00:05:08.349> judge<00:05:08.589> my<00:05:08.799> lashes<00:05:09.039> the<00:05:09.459> way<00:05:09.549> they<00:05:09.669> look

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
don't judge my lashes the way they look

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:11.729 
don't judge my lashes the way they look
now<00:05:09.999> because<00:05:10.179> I<00:05:10.449> put<00:05:10.659> this<00:05:10.809> on<00:05:11.049> and<00:05:11.349> then<00:05:11.589> I<00:05:11.619> put

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:11.739 
now because I put this on and then I put

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:14.459 
now because I put this on and then I put
lashes<00:05:12.429> on<00:05:12.789> but<00:05:13.119> in<00:05:13.329> the<00:05:13.389> footage<00:05:13.929> you<00:05:14.199> just

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:14.469 
lashes on but in the footage you just

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.369 
lashes on but in the footage you just
saw<00:05:14.679> I<00:05:15.039> actually<00:05:15.519> just<00:05:16.269> had<00:05:16.509> on<00:05:16.689> the<00:05:16.719> mascara

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:17.379 
saw I actually just had on the mascara

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:20.159 
saw I actually just had on the mascara
and<00:05:17.739> I<00:05:17.799> have<00:05:18.069> to<00:05:18.309> say<00:05:18.569> this<00:05:19.569> was<00:05:19.779> a<00:05:19.809> letdown

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
and I have to say this was a letdown

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.379 
and I have to say this was a letdown
because<00:05:20.799> this<00:05:21.159> is<00:05:21.309> my<00:05:21.489> first<00:05:21.849> time<00:05:22.089> ever

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
because this is my first time ever

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.350 
because this is my first time ever
buying<00:05:22.869> a<00:05:23.169> high-end<00:05:23.679> mascara<00:05:24.339> and<00:05:24.939> I<00:05:25.119> actually

00:06:13.989 --> 00:06:16.439 
mascara literally one or two coats and
my<00:06:14.110> lashes<00:06:14.319> are<00:06:14.679> thicker<00:06:14.919> longer<00:06:15.459> and<00:06:15.969> that

my lashes are thicker longer and that

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.439 
my lashes are thicker longer and that
cost<00:06:16.719> me<00:06:16.839> like<00:06:17.139> what<00:06:17.349> six<00:06:17.739> bucks<00:06:18.039> and<00:06:18.399> this<00:06:19.179> is
