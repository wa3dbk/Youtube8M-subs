taller than I was and it kind of became

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.900 
taller than I was and it kind of became
obvious<00:01:11.710> well<00:01:12.070> maybe<00:01:12.250> maybe<00:01:12.729> he's<00:01:12.850> a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
obvious well maybe maybe he's a

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.790 
obvious well maybe maybe he's a
basketball<00:01:13.180> player<00:01:13.420> instead<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.110> a<00:01:14.200> football

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
basketball player instead of a football

basketball player instead of a football
player<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:15.399> and<00:01:15.880> that's<00:01:16.450> that<00:01:16.990> was<00:01:17.080> pretty

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
player and and that's that was pretty

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.109

much<00:01:17.350> what<00:01:17.410> solidified<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.460> for<00:01:18.610> me<00:01:18.759> is<00:01:18.940> that

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
much what solidified it for me is that

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.469

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.219 
learning some learning a lot quickly and
over<00:01:48.580> under<00:01:48.880> Roger<00:01:49.119> teaching<00:01:50.050> me<00:01:50.110> everything

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
over under Roger teaching me everything

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.389 
over under Roger teaching me everything
and<00:01:50.679> I<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:52.360> started<00:01:52.720> progressing<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.440> you

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
and I just started progressing and you

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.859 
and I just started progressing and you
know<00:01:54.489> learning<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.149> game<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:55.599> really

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
know learning the game and really

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.660 
know learning the game and really
getting<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.229> good<00:01:56.470> fundamentals<00:01:57.099> from<00:01:57.280> him<00:01:57.459> and

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
getting a good fundamentals from him and

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.699 
getting a good fundamentals from him and
and<00:01:57.880> I<00:01:58.209> think<00:01:58.420> that's<00:01:58.599> what<00:01:58.810> really<00:01:59.259> helped<00:01:59.619> me

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
and I think that's what really helped me

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.889 
and I think that's what really helped me
in<00:02:00.069> the<00:02:00.250> beginning<00:02:00.399> I<00:02:00.819> always<00:02:01.450> just<00:02:01.599> kind<00:02:01.750> of

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
in the beginning I always just kind of

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.350 
in the beginning I always just kind of
have<00:02:02.200> played<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:02.739> not<00:02:02.890> really<00:02:03.330> you<00:02:04.330> know

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
have played and not really you know

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.940 
have played and not really you know
looked<00:02:04.720> at<00:02:04.869> rankings<00:02:05.349> or<00:02:05.470> any<00:02:05.590> stuff<00:02:05.800> like

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
looked at rankings or any stuff like

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.190 
looked at rankings or any stuff like
that<00:02:05.979> but<00:02:06.429> I<00:02:06.700> think<00:02:07.300> once<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.569> started<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:08.080> know

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
that but I think once I started you know

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.050 
that but I think once I started you know
caught<00:02:08.590> college<00:02:09.039> coaches<00:02:09.429> started<00:02:09.640> calling

feel I think that's what makes it a lot

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.520 
feel I think that's what makes it a lot
better<00:03:14.670> for<00:03:14.970> me<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.210> that<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:16.140> kind<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.380> my

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
better for me is that it's kind of my

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.290 
better for me is that it's kind of my
