00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
well let's start with the comes with 65

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:47.949 
well let's start with the comes with 65
watt<00:01:38.299> 20<00:01:38.689> volt<00:01:39.609> adapter<00:01:45.610> this<00:01:46.659> specific<00:01:47.659> model

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
watt 20 volt adapter this specific model

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:54.699 
watt 20 volt adapter this specific model
came<00:01:48.470> with<00:01:48.709> the<00:01:49.329> extended<00:01:50.329> battery<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:54.200> you

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
came with the extended battery so you

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.119 
came with the extended battery so you
can<00:01:54.890> see<00:01:55.130> it's<00:01:56.319> it's<00:01:57.319> much<00:01:57.500> larger<00:01:57.770> than<00:01:58.009> the

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:58.129 
can see it's it's much larger than the

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:01.359 
can see it's it's much larger than the
laptop<00:01:58.280> when<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.729> actually<00:01:58.819> go<00:01:59.060> here<00:01:59.799> this<00:02:00.799> part

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
laptop when I actually go here this part

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.219 
laptop when I actually go here this part
is<00:02:01.579> gonna<00:02:01.789> have<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.299> pile<00:02:02.539> up<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:02.689> back<00:02:02.989> of<00:02:03.140> the

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
is gonna have to pile up the back of the

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.910 
is gonna have to pile up the back of the
laptop<00:02:03.969> so<00:02:04.969> we<00:02:05.149> will<00:02:05.530> see<00:02:06.530> what<00:02:06.649> that<00:02:06.679> looks

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
laptop so we will see what that looks

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:17.400 
laptop so we will see what that looks
like<00:02:07.039> in<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.429> second<00:02:07.959> yeah<00:02:08.959> what<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:10.009> in<00:02:11.620> manuals

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.930 

screws<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.709> guess<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.250> always<00:02:19.400> find<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.880> the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
screws I guess I always find that the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.150 
screws I guess I always find that the
optical<00:02:20.720> drive<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.139> these<00:02:21.290> for<00:02:21.680> some<00:02:21.859> reason

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
optical drive in these for some reason

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.860 
optical drive in these for some reason
isn't<00:02:22.310> screwed<00:02:22.790> in<00:02:23.000> when<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.269> get<00:02:23.420> them<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:23.810> I

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
isn't screwed in when you get them so I

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.390 
isn't screwed in when you get them so I
guess<00:02:24.079> you<00:02:24.230> could<00:02:24.380> use<00:02:24.410> one<00:02:24.769> of<00:02:24.799> these<00:02:24.980> screws

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
guess you could use one of these screws

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:54.420 
guess you could use one of these screws
to<00:02:26.200> screw<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.440> in<00:02:28.389> and<00:02:29.389> that's<00:02:29.810> all<00:02:29.959> we<00:02:30.079> got

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430

previously<00:05:58.430> models<00:05:59.430> prior<00:05:59.699> to<00:05:59.850> this<00:05:59.970> one

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
previously models prior to this one

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.360 
previously models prior to this one
there<00:06:00.360> was<00:06:00.449> a<00:06:00.510> little<00:06:00.720> antennas<00:06:01.320> it's<00:06:01.740> jutting

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
there was a little antennas it's jutting

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.939 
there was a little antennas it's jutting
out<00:06:02.460> at<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.669> top<00:06:02.880> of<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.120> screen<00:06:03.770> so<00:06:04.770> much

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
out at the top of the screen so much

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:10.070 
out at the top of the screen so much
nicer<00:06:05.340> it's<00:06:05.639> all<00:06:05.760> embedded<00:06:08.720> still<00:06:09.720> comes<00:06:09.960> with

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
nicer it's all embedded still comes with

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.280 
nicer it's all embedded still comes with
the<00:06:10.880> track<00:06:11.880> planet<00:06:12.419> touchpad<00:06:13.340> we've<00:06:14.340> got<00:06:14.580> your

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
the track planet touchpad we've got your

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.090 
the track planet touchpad we've got your
fingerprint<00:06:16.400> fingerprint<00:06:17.400> scanner<00:06:17.669> and

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
fingerprint fingerprint scanner and

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.350 
fingerprint fingerprint scanner and
basically<00:06:20.100> the<00:06:20.250> the<00:06:20.520> standard<00:06:20.970> in<00:06:21.030> the<00:06:21.090> Novo

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
basically the the standard in the Novo

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.440 
basically the the standard in the Novo
keyboard<00:06:21.810> with<00:06:22.610> all<00:06:23.610> the<00:06:23.790> bells<00:06:23.970> and<00:06:24.120> whistles

doesn't<00:06:24.630> really<00:06:24.750> come<00:06:24.960> with<00:06:24.990> it<00:06:26.990> okay<00:06:27.990> so<00:06:30.229> I

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
doesn't really come with it okay so I

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.650 
doesn't really come with it okay so I
guess<00:06:31.410> next<00:06:31.680> thing<00:06:31.889> we<00:06:31.979> can<00:06:32.010> try<00:06:32.250> is<00:06:32.610> to<00:06:32.699> pop

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 
guess next thing we can try is to pop

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.640 
guess next thing we can try is to pop
the<00:06:33.840> battery<00:06:34.169> in<00:06:35.900> and<00:06:36.900> that's<00:06:37.380> pretty

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
the battery in and that's pretty

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:46.070 
the battery in and that's pretty
straightforward<00:06:44.570> like<00:06:45.570> that

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
straightforward like that

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.629 
straightforward like that
so<00:06:47.070> now<00:06:47.280> your<00:06:48.000> laptop<00:06:48.330> is<00:06:48.479> bigger<00:06:49.220> now<00:06:50.220> you<00:06:50.280> can

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 
so now your laptop is bigger now you can

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:51.980 
so now your laptop is bigger now you can
get<00:06:50.729> a<00:06:50.760> battery<00:06:51.090> that<00:06:51.150> doesn't<00:06:51.599> have<00:06:51.720> the<00:06:51.810> nine

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
get a battery that doesn't have the nine

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.589 
get a battery that doesn't have the nine
cells<00:06:52.289> in<00:06:52.500> it<00:06:52.620> this<00:06:53.490> is<00:06:53.669> for<00:06:53.849> extended<00:06:54.330> battery

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 
cells in it this is for extended battery

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:58.219 
cells in it this is for extended battery
life<00:06:54.690> so<00:06:55.200> as<00:06:55.590> you<00:06:55.770> can<00:06:55.889> see<00:06:56.750> it's<00:06:57.750> quite<00:06:58.020> large

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229 
life so as you can see it's quite large

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:02.420 
life so as you can see it's quite large
juts<00:06:58.919> out<00:06:59.039> the<00:06:59.220> back<00:07:00.650> personal<00:07:01.650> preference<00:07:02.280> I

juts out the back personal preference I

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.790 
juts out the back personal preference I
don't<00:07:02.610> really<00:07:02.760> like<00:07:03.000> get<00:07:03.630> jutting<00:07:04.470> out<00:07:04.590> the

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
don't really like get jutting out the

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.680 
don't really like get jutting out the
back<00:07:04.979> like<00:07:05.250> that<00:07:05.520> but<00:07:05.940> if<00:07:06.270> you<00:07:06.419> need<00:07:06.570> the

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
back like that but if you need the

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.080 
back like that but if you need the
battery<00:07:07.020> power<00:07:07.320> that's<00:07:08.250> there<00:07:08.520> for<00:07:08.700> you<00:07:08.789> it
