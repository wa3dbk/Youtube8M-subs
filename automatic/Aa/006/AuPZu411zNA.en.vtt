this thing not that great but whatever

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.620 
this thing not that great but whatever
it<00:00:21.960> doesn't<00:00:22.140> really<00:00:22.260> matter<00:00:23.390> you're<00:00:24.390> going<00:00:24.570> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
it doesn't really matter you're going to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.710 
it doesn't really matter you're going to
want<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.140> large<00:00:25.529> clip<00:00:25.920> size<00:00:26.210> usually<00:00:27.210> people<00:00:27.630> do

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
want a large clip size usually people do

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.080 
want a large clip size usually people do
this<00:00:27.869> with<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> Infinity<00:00:28.650> pistol<00:00:29.099> because<00:00:29.670> it

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
this with the Infinity pistol because it

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.450 
this with the Infinity pistol because it
never<00:00:30.210> runs<00:00:30.449> out<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.660> ammo<00:00:31.070> I'm<00:00:32.070> doing<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.430> with

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
never runs out of ammo I'm doing it with

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.250 
never runs out of ammo I'm doing it with
this<00:00:32.700> 58<00:00:33.500> magazine<00:00:34.500> size<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.130> should<00:00:35.160> be<00:00:35.460> fine

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
this 58 magazine size it should be fine

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.479 
this 58 magazine size it should be fine
so<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.040> start<00:00:38.070> with<00:00:38.309> that

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
so what you do is you start with that

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.270 
so what you do is you start with that
you<00:00:38.670> switch<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:40.040> then<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.129> just

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
you switch to this and then you just

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.459 
you switch to this and then you just
keep<00:00:41.370> switching<00:00:41.610> back<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.910> eventually

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
keep switching back and eventually

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.060 
keep switching back and eventually
you'll<00:00:43.469> get<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.160> that's<00:00:46.070> that's

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
you'll get that and that's that's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.000 
you'll get that and that's that's
usually<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:48.450> makes<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.989> gun<00:00:49.170> better<00:00:49.500> leave

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
usually it makes the gun better leave

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.340 
usually it makes the gun better leave
this<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.670> since<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.000> switch<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.570> affects

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
this one but since you switch it affects

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.709 
this one but since you switch it affects
that<00:00:52.530> gun<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.149> keep<00:00:54.300> doing<00:00:54.570> this

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
that gun so you just keep doing this

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.880 
that gun so you just keep doing this
until<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:56.820> feel<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.360> got<00:00:57.390> enough<00:00:57.890> I'm

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
down it's a absolute and that's the

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.100 
down it's a absolute and that's the
first<00:02:05.830> time<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.159> killed<00:02:06.610> terramorphous<00:02:07.110> it's

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
first time I killed terramorphous it's

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.600 
first time I killed terramorphous it's
an<00:02:08.259> absolute<00:02:09.160> ridiculous<00:02:10.149> glitch<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:12.489> can

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
an absolute ridiculous glitch you can

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.570 
an absolute ridiculous glitch you can
take<00:02:12.760> on<00:02:12.910> any<00:02:13.150> raid<00:02:13.450> boss<00:02:13.690> with<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.580> don't

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
take on any raid boss with it I don't

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.840 
take on any raid boss with it I don't
think<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.790> can<00:02:15.940> get<00:02:16.060> into<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.450> DLCs<00:02:17.020> actually

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
think you can get into the DLCs actually

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
think you can get into the DLCs actually
with<00:02:19.470> without<00:02:20.470> having<00:02:20.860> your<00:02:21.040> cash<00:02:21.310> up<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.610> date

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
with without having your cash up to date

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.940 
with without having your cash up to date
so<00:02:22.870> obviously<00:02:23.970> terramorphous<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.950> pretty

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
so obviously terramorphous is pretty

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.470 
so obviously terramorphous is pretty
