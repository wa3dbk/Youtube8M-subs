00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
that the opposite of that would be if

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.510 
that the opposite of that would be if
you<00:01:21.450> wore<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.020> don't<00:01:22.439> know<00:01:22.560> tones<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.220> brown

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you wore I don't know tones of brown

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.210 
you wore I don't know tones of brown
head<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.210> toe<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.810> rusts<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.470> Browns<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
head to toe like rusts and Browns and so

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.819 
head to toe like rusts and Browns and so
on<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.729> would<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:26.909> very<00:01:27.180> muted<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.740> you

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
on that would be very muted and so you

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.039 
on that would be very muted and so you
always<00:01:29.159> want<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.970> contrast<00:01:30.689> and
