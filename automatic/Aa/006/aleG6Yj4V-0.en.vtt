a trip circuit or a trip to GFI if this
happens<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.740> first<00:00:32.009> thing<00:00:32.219> you

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
happens to you the first thing you

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.639 
happens to you the first thing you
should<00:00:32.579> do<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:33.090> go<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.450> your<00:00:33.690> outlet<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.440> test

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
should do is go to your outlet and test

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.139 
should do is go to your outlet and test
to<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:34.950> if<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.250> power<00:00:35.460> at<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> outlet

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
to see if you have power at the outlet

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.090 
to see if you have power at the outlet
this<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.930> done<00:00:37.079> simply<00:00:37.110> by<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.680> plugging

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
this can be done simply by just plugging

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.920 
this can be done simply by just plugging
a<00:00:38.340> lamp<00:00:38.610> or<00:00:38.760> something<00:00:39.120> into<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.510> outlet<00:00:39.780> to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
a lamp or something into that outlet to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.139 
a lamp or something into that outlet to
see<00:00:40.079> if<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.379> power<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.730> not<00:00:41.879> have

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
see if you have power if you do not have

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.240 
see if you have power if you do not have
power<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.719> outlet<00:00:43.320> first<00:00:43.950> check<00:00:44.219> your

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
power at that outlet first check your

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.880 
power at that outlet first check your
circuit<00:00:44.730> panel<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.750> check<00:00:46.440> around<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
circuit panel then check around the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.130 
circuit panel then check around the

those are set and none of them are

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.369 
those are set and none of them are
tripped<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.750> you've<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:54.899> finished

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
tripped so you've just finished

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.220 
tripped so you've just finished
installing<00:00:56.340> your<00:00:56.610> system<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.840> one

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
installing your system and you have one

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.500 
installing your system and you have one
circuit<00:00:58.739> inside<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.430> transformer<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.239> is

is protecting against a short or simply

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.730 
is protecting against a short or simply
just<00:01:08.790> overloading<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.780> part<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.619> your

little more evenly in the transformer
the<00:01:33.210> second<00:01:33.509> thing<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.659> could<00:01:33.750> always<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.170> is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the second thing you could always do is

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.319 
the second thing you could always do is
if<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.070> an<00:01:35.220> amp<00:01:35.430> meter<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.000> just

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
if you have an amp meter you can just

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.300 
if you have an amp meter you can just
test<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.900> make<00:01:37.049> certain<00:01:37.320> that's<00:01:38.130> the

test it to make certain that's the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.310 
test it to make certain that's the
easiest<00:01:38.670> way<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.880> ensure<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.509> always<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:40.229> it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
easiest way to ensure you always get it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.399 
easiest way to ensure you always get it
perfect<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.130> third<00:01:41.909> issue<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.450> comes<00:01:42.659> up<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.170> a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:08.980 
all the time this is usually a problem

with your control unit most of time when
this<00:02:11.980> happens<00:02:12.370> it's<00:02:12.550> when<00:02:12.820> you<00:02:12.910> have<00:02:13.030> a

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
this happens it's when you have a

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.820 
this happens it's when you have a
photocell<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:13.930> has<00:02:14.080> gone<00:02:14.290> bad

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
out on one of the well lights this is a

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.160 
out on one of the well lights this is a
very<00:02:29.680> simple<00:02:30.160> process<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:31.690> involves<00:02:32.080> removing

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
very simple process it involves removing

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.080 
very simple process it involves removing
the<00:02:32.500> cover<00:02:32.680> now<00:02:33.190> one<00:02:33.460> thing<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.640> keep<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:33.910> mind

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
the cover now one thing to keep in mind

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.760 
the cover now one thing to keep in mind
after<00:02:34.480> about<00:02:34.630> three<00:02:34.930> years<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.410> becomes<00:02:35.680> a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
after about three years it becomes a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.590 
after about three years it becomes a
good<00:02:35.950> idea<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.430> change<00:02:36.700> out<00:02:36.940> your<00:02:37.120> light<00:02:37.330> bulb

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
good idea to change out your light bulb

good idea to change out your light bulb
so<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:39.400> reason<00:02:39.760> for<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.420> there<00:02:40.660> is<00:02:40.780> lumen

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
so the reason for that is there is lumen

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.630 
so the reason for that is there is lumen
depreciation<00:02:41.230> which<00:02:42.010> happens<00:02:42.460> where<00:02:42.580> the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
depreciation which happens where the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.430 
depreciation which happens where the
lights<00:02:42.940> just<00:02:43.060> no<00:02:43.390> longer<00:02:43.780> quite<00:02:43.990> as<00:02:44.170> bright

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
lights just no longer quite as bright

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.080 
lights just no longer quite as bright
it's<00:02:44.650> lost<00:02:44.890> some<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.130> its<00:02:45.370> reflective

it's lost some of its reflective

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.390 
it's lost some of its reflective
qualities<00:02:46.600> so<00:02:47.290> let's<00:02:47.440> go<00:02:47.590> ahead<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.890> flip

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
qualities so let's go ahead and flip

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.310 
qualities so let's go ahead and flip
this<00:02:48.670> light<00:02:50.130> over<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:52.630> need<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.810> flathead
