 in this video i will show how to shade 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.780
 the edges of the photo make the effect like this 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.820
 called endangered edges for this 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.960
 we press the tool rectangular 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:22.760
 selection we mark the borders now 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.199
 go to the selection menu 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:30.029
 tool modification shading 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.189
 choose the radius of the feathering I do not want 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.840
 do feathering on a very large scale 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.790
 so 25 will be ok enough 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.910
 as we see our highlighted edges 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.969
 rounded off now go in the selection 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.539
 inversion to shade out 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.110
 edges of the photo they center and click on 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.780
 keyboard button david this way 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.820
 we have the effect of fading edges 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.239
 on a transparent background 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.750
 let's set the background for this 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.750
 remove selection 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.920
 create a new layer now do 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.900
 fill this layer with 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.740
 tool fill find that this 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.170
 the layer went under the main 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.350
 This effect can be changed 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.180
 the black 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.710
 you can choose any 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.270
 color from the color palette and in addition 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.759
 I want to say that if you 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.479
 insert this photo on the site then 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.689
 can happen 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:44.040
 effect as you see the background of the site performed 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.439
 such a beige color picture border in 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.270
 white colors 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.720
 so I'm using the eyedropper tool 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.299
 I type this beige color and come back 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.780
 on the original picture now do 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:02.220
 fill this color which just 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.230
 visor now when pasting to the site 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.890
 the picture will be very harmonious 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.890
 to fit in
