00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.030
 do a maintenance so the challenges of 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.620

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.699
 message on the rockstar screen are in the process 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.920
 of 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.199
 we will say to change the challenges of croo 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.519
 they are correcting all that and 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.140
 it's frankly it's nice that they 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.359
 were still pretty responsive enough 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.399
 quick to see that cros challenges was 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.960
 we're going to say trapped I was really 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.059
 disgusting that people pay 250 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.070
 thousand dollars to come across a challenge 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.570
 who was we going to say trapped between 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.710
 parentheses for those who could see the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.570
 video that I showed you there is 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.650
 a few days the race on which I 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.600
 fell frankly it was really 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.070
 disgusting and as I say so from 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.810
 subscribers on twitter and it even happened 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.850
 based for those who were looking for 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.340
 either the fuck base has passed a challenge of 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.260
 crozon who he finished the race in the 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.730
 in the allotted time and in the end so 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.090
 there is no writing winner and he has nothing 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.800
 won 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.030
 no it made him lose his two hundred 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.170
 fifty thousand dollars while he 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.790
 had managed the race 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.070
 so frankly really disgusting 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.570
 so little information video for 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.430
 to tell you that rockstar is in the process of 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.570
 correct all that so the people who 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.550
 want to challenge for the fangs 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.410
 moment it's not available wait for a 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.790
 little and thereafter normally so he 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.920
 there will be more challenges of croo trapped 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.840
 everything will be back to normal and we will 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.540
 hope we will still have challenges at 250 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.830
 thousand dollars that are not trapping and 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.540
