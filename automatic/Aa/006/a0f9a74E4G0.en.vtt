00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
would try to argue it because that was

you<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.690> 21<00:00:55.140> year<00:00:55.289> old<00:00:55.440> he<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.070> used<00:00:56.610> to

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
you know 21 year old he just used to

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.250 
you know 21 year old he just used to
challenge<00:00:57.270> everything<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.899> then<00:00:57.989> eventually

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
challenge everything and then eventually

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.680 
challenge everything and then eventually
and<00:00:58.829> he'd<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.550> people<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> challenge<00:01:00.210> him<00:01:00.510> to

sell it you know in a red box or a blue
box<00:01:07.950> or<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.460> should<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.939> engineer<00:01:09.330> do

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
box or you should have the engineer do

box or you should have the engineer do
the<00:01:09.570> testing<00:01:09.960> or<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> different<00:01:10.470> group<00:01:10.590> through

this I just don't have good my
engineering<00:01:17.340> I'm<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.880> my<00:01:18.210> mouth<00:01:18.420> shut<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
engineering I'm like my mouth shut and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.749 
engineering I'm like my mouth shut and
he<00:01:18.930> thought<00:01:19.140> an<00:01:19.380> idiot<00:01:19.860> rather<00:01:20.130> open<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
he thought an idiot rather open and

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.469 
he thought an idiot rather open and
leave<00:01:20.909> know<00:01:21.090> though

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479

the<00:01:24.840> engineering<00:01:25.289> at<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> Safeway<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the engineering at the Safeway and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.090 
the engineering at the Safeway and
waited<00:01:27.960> although<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> don't<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.530> politics<00:01:28.979> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
waited although I don't like politics I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.249 
waited although I don't like politics I
don't<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:29.369> conflict<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> avoided<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
don't like conflict and so I avoided a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.200 
don't like conflict and so I avoided a
lot<00:01:31.289> of<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.649> business<00:01:32.340> ends<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.789> company

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
lot of the business ends of that company

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.940 
lot of the business ends of that company
you<00:01:33.420> know<00:01:34.079> when<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.380> my<00:01:34.500> own<00:01:34.560> startup

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you know when I have my own startup

do you see it evolving from here and
what<00:01:50.579> should<00:01:50.759> happen<00:01:50.969> for<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> best

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
what should happen for it to be the best

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.559 
what should happen for it to be the best
yeah<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.130> get<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.579> oh<00:01:53.640> when<00:01:53.819> I<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:53.880> young<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.450> be

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
yeah I get it oh when I was young to be

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.449 
yeah I get it oh when I was young to be
an<00:01:54.659> engineer<00:01:55.049> first<00:01:55.319> and<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> teacher<00:01:55.770> second<00:01:56.280> I

an engineer first and a teacher second I

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.820 
an engineer first and a teacher second I
told<00:01:56.819> my<00:01:56.970> dad<00:01:57.149> back<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> fifth<00:01:58.649> grade

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
teacher and it stuck with me my whole

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.449 
teacher and it stuck with me my whole
life<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.380> all<00:02:01.530> my<00:02:01.679> psychology<00:02:02.220> classes

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
life and in all my psychology classes

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.460 
life and in all my psychology classes
like<00:02:02.729> they've<00:02:02.909> attempted<00:02:03.209> to<00:02:03.840> develop<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.380> of

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
like they've attempted to develop one of

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.169 
like they've attempted to develop one of
the<00:02:04.560> human<00:02:04.860> mind<00:02:05.069> and<00:02:05.250> cognitive<00:02:05.729> development

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
the human mind and cognitive development

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.819 
the human mind and cognitive development
and<00:02:06.270> things<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.689> almost<00:02:07.380> got<00:02:07.679> my

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
and things like that almost got my

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.259 
and things like that almost got my
degree<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.130> psychology<00:02:08.340> instead<00:02:09.149> of

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
degree in psychology instead of

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.500 
degree in psychology instead of
engineering<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.739> eventually<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.760> had<00:02:12.239> kids

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
engineering and eventually I had kids

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.809 
engineering and eventually I had kids
make<00:02:12.750> money<00:02:13.049> and<00:02:13.500> he<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.739> money<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.610> in

make money and he have money in the in
Silicon<00:02:15.269> Valley<00:02:15.299> it<00:02:15.959> was<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.200> days<00:02:16.380> when

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
Silicon Valley it was the days when

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.690 
Silicon Valley it was the days when
schools<00:02:16.980> were<00:02:17.099> getting<00:02:17.400> their<00:02:17.519> first

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
schools were getting their first

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.210 
schools were getting their first
networks<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.299> computers<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.989> computer<00:02:19.680> room<00:02:19.890> a

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
networks of computers a computer room a

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.280 
networks of computers a computer room a
lab<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.120> course<00:02:21.269> I'm<00:02:21.450> giving<00:02:21.750> computers<00:02:22.170> to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
lab so of course I'm giving computers to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.809 
lab so of course I'm giving computers to
the<00:02:22.380> schools<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.829> then<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.340> thought<00:02:23.549> you<00:02:23.730> know

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
the schools and then I thought you know

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.430 
the schools and then I thought you know
if<00:02:23.910> you're<00:02:24.030> giving<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.480> stuff<00:02:24.599> money<00:02:25.140> that's

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
if you're giving this stuff money that's

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.930 
if you're giving this stuff money that's
nothing<00:02:25.829> that<00:02:26.220> really<00:02:26.340> doesn't<00:02:26.579> have<00:02:26.760> meaning

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
nothing that really doesn't have meaning

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.150 
nothing that really doesn't have meaning
you<00:02:27.180> give<00:02:27.420> what's<00:02:27.750> valuable<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:28.980> you

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
you give what's valuable to you you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.059 
you give what's valuable to you you
sacrifice<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.329> give<00:02:30.450> your<00:02:30.630> own<00:02:30.780> time<00:02:31.079> so<00:02:31.829> then

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
sacrifice and give your own time so then

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.309 
sacrifice and give your own time so then
I<00:02:32.250> started<00:02:32.670> teaching<00:02:32.910> not<00:02:33.870> knowing<00:02:34.170> if<00:02:34.230> I

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
I started teaching not knowing if I

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.870 
I started teaching not knowing if I
could<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.799> I<00:02:34.950> decided<00:02:35.280> what<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.519> would<00:02:35.670> teach

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
could and I decided what I would teach

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.120 
could and I decided what I would teach
was<00:02:36.150> based<00:02:36.359> on<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.840> competitor<00:02:37.680> who<00:02:37.709> would<00:02:37.920> one

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
was based on a competitor who would one

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.640 
was based on a competitor who would one
most<00:02:38.910> top<00:02:39.209> teacher<00:02:39.480> award<00:02:39.720> year<00:02:40.139> after<00:02:40.440> year

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
most top teacher award year after year

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.979 
most top teacher award year after year
after<00:02:40.739> year<00:02:40.889> in<00:02:41.160> Pittsburgh<00:02:41.609> and<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:42.209> said<00:02:42.780> how

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
after year in Pittsburgh and I said how

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.660 
after year in Pittsburgh and I said how
can<00:02:43.049> you<00:02:43.290> use<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.560> computer<00:02:43.680> for<00:02:44.160> every

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
can you use the computer for every

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.910 
can you use the computer for every
single<00:02:44.880> subject<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.540> have<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:45.930> school<00:02:46.290> to

single subject you have in school to
present<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:48.000> display<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.900> communicate<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
present to display to communicate the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.379 
present to display to communicate the
answers<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.370> whether<00:02:50.790> it's<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.120> right<00:02:51.359> in

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
answers and whether it's just right in

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.390 
answers and whether it's just right in
the<00:02:51.569> report<00:02:51.959> are<00:02:52.230> showing<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.680> timeline<00:02:53.190> for

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
the report are showing a timeline for

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.550 
the report are showing a timeline for
history<00:02:53.910> doing<00:02:54.450> some<00:02:54.600> graphics<00:02:55.109> at<00:02:55.230> all<00:02:55.350> that

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
history doing some graphics at all that

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.410 
history doing some graphics at all that
and<00:02:55.769> so<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> went<00:02:56.609> and<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.850> started<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.329> to

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
and so I went and I started just to

and so I went and I started just to
teach<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.780> map<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.139> was<00:02:58.230> my<00:02:58.380> goal<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.650> could

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
teach a map that was my goal I could

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.400 
teach a map that was my goal I could
teach<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.069> 200<00:02:59.609> our<00:02:59.700> course<00:03:00.090> for<00:03:00.810> one<00:03:00.989> in<00:03:01.200> one

did you think money's gonna solve the
problem<00:06:24.620> you<00:06:25.039> know<00:06:25.130> it's<00:06:25.250> like<00:06:25.400> thinking<00:06:25.669> if<00:06:25.789> I

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909 
problem you know it's like thinking if I

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:27.249 
problem you know it's like thinking if I
have<00:06:26.030> a<00:06:26.060> computer<00:06:26.509> there's<00:06:26.690> a<00:06:26.750> thousand<00:06:27.110> times

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
have a computer there's a thousand times

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:28.719 
have a computer there's a thousand times
faster<00:06:27.740> it<00:06:28.009> would<00:06:28.099> solve<00:06:28.310> a<00:06:28.400> lot<00:06:28.550> more

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
faster it would solve a lot more

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.430 
faster it would solve a lot more
problems<00:06:28.970> it<00:06:29.630> turns<00:06:29.810> out<00:06:30.050> that<00:06:30.259> those

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
problems it turns out that those

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.260 
problems it turns out that those
problems<00:06:30.830> only<00:06:31.039> get<00:06:31.159> solved<00:06:31.520> because<00:06:31.610> human

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
problems only get solved because human

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.089 
problems only get solved because human
intuition<00:06:32.479> knows<00:06:32.900> how<00:06:33.110> to<00:06:33.169> solve<00:06:33.470> it<00:06:33.650> so

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:34.099 
intuition knows how to solve it so

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:36.219 
intuition knows how to solve it so
computers<00:06:34.550> can't<00:06:34.789> do<00:06:34.970> that<00:06:35.180> yet<00:06:35.419> and<00:06:35.630> the

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:36.229 
computers can't do that yet and the

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.990 
computers can't do that yet and the
