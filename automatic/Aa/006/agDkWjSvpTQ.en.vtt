00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:17.190
 so here it is once you have 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.820
 arrived at this point you will have 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.349
 just look at this is the space that I 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.770
 I have nowhere to go, remember that I said 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.140
 that piece that piece of union 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.449
 above would then be in the middle of this 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.980
 because the turn is not 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.860
 and it really is this here that has to 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.010
 happen this little fellow has to be 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.519
 in this position in this direction so I know 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.540
 that I'm going to join the here and another here with 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.800
 two spacing peaks only 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.110
 if I'm going to do it, look what 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.390
 over 1 2 and 3 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.589
 I'm going to make three peaks, I'm going to get this one. 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:00.629
 I'll do 2 necks and I'll get this one. 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:03.479
 I 'll make 3 123 more and I'll get this 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.519
 part here realized how the mathematics of 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.890
 so that's it 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.110
 I arrived at the point of the next union then 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.740
 here to see I have three peaks that I 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.399
 I told you I'll do a chain I 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.329
 I get this bow pulls the know I make point 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.020
 low 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:24.060
 I do current and here I position 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.780
 to make low over the point 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.750
 high 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.969
 I'll do the sting then you'll follow 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.990
 than the first because they are two peaks of 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.320
 interval 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.609
 in these meetings then the first is 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.520
 the one you are following and now 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:44.579
 You will follow the second then here. 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.119
 The second peak for there I have to 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.640
 pick up right and here the low 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.439
 I'm going to the union again, it 's easy. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.469
 Easy to handle low arc current 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.810
 I make chain come back and do the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.179
 low over high point look there 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.090
 stop showing it looks like union 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.789
 happening there you realize that space 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.710
 from the top to the square space is 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.510
 less and so much that we stay that 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.750
 left but is softened does not stay so 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.940
 This is how they perceived it, and there 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.420
 I have to do 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.430
 the continuity we are understanding 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.730
 How is the thing then the staff? 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.550
 now it's just that we can unite this 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.370
 part of the lower portion to the outline 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.170
 the entire band is necessary to have the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.540
 contour todinho as we did the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.440
 from the top and then as soon as I have 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.570
 This whole piece made I go back to 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.160
 continue execution with you we'll go 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:54.180
 treat at the last moment, not two 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.860
 mind and now however already sewn I 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.950
 I come here to show you 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.520
 the end result of this seam is then 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.450
 You see you have to choose 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.180
 aligned with this is risk is aligned and 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.940
 here on this side we'll just bring more 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.900
 here we also have choice aligned with 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:20.520
 is this or is it more that is a front 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.340
 and one behind was at the end and in the 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:28.350
 end in the back 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:34.320
 Here we turn to play we put 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:38.580
 there in the back you notice that we 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:42.650
 we had the same alignment as the wait 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:47.070
 with this it is here to choose which israel was 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.250
 and it's this dark side with israel 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:54.330
 so you keep the drawing 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.550
 being an extra square in the 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.310
 Front and back 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.220
 in addition we already see here the 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:06.840
 because we only unite these 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.209
 points you remember, and the track is 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.330
 is making a totally 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.930
 run look here 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.519
 see're only now seeing the people to 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:24.750
 suggestion is that we make a 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:29.039
 Finishing a finish around 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.360
 all the openings here the ring sleeve that 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.550
 it would be manga 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.590
 we already have the finishing done then 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.390
 you have wide basses and where you have 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.270
 the current arc 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.940
 we do peak then realize here 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.520
 Let's just bring some more 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.750
 so the view looks better does not it look 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:57.010
 there are all the low points and the point 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.950
 stayed where the opening realized you 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.950
 will do this in all openings and 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:07.840
 so you can orient yourself 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:11.730
 I already come here with the part of the neck 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.860
 so let me put here look at 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.810
 so the opening of the neck is not 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.070
 We are going to work together for you. 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.960
 can observe 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.960
 so you choose any point 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.900
 any point of its execution 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.680
 it does not have to be a certain point 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:33.880
 specific and you start by making the point 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.970
 down and you are running a point 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:42.370
 down to each point you have at 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:44.860
 your way up to get in or better at 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.610
 resulting cord 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.490
 there the execution changes a bit then 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.080
 here I have string I make one 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.590
 low around 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.620
 I do three streams transforms 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.930
 three peak currents passing the needle 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.960
 in the first point and closing with dot 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.840
 very low again makes a low 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.450
 around the cord and I'm coming to the 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.440
 first high point that I have in 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:19.990
 sequence then we perform low points 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:23.650
 again with this, besides having the picot 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:27.390
 shape of the drawing is presented here. 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.920
 we also have a stiffening 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:33.810
 resulting from this 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:37.650
 so this is the pursuit in this finish 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:40.660
 to stiffen so that we do not have 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:44.500
 deformities during use're 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.689
 and so we are running both 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.439
 in this outline 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:54.399
 in all openings be on the arm in the 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:55.329
 neck or below the base of our 

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:58.659
 skirt 

00:06:55.329 --> 00:07:01.389
 They only like it, I hope so. 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:04.719
 I'm waiting for you on our next run. 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:06.579
 Of course, do not forget the company 

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:10.769
 designs knitting because many novelties 

00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:10.769
 are yet to come
