00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.690
 good instead of everyone from da gigi 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.929
 in this video we will replace the axis 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.410
 of the barbell is this the watch in 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:19.520
 this beautiful Sunday again 40 years 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:22.680
 and we would put a little back in the sixth 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:27.050
 movement as you see very oxidized e 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:31.759
 so we will do a nice job in order to 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:35.610
 make it return to its former glory 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.640
 very well then before explaining a little 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.210
 the work we're going to do 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:47.879
 we take the watch apart from the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:51.620
 case is already all the glass with the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.449
 ring around is the case back as you see 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.140
 I've already removed them so we put them for 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.579
 the moment aside at this point 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.880
 let's remove the hands e 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.330
 then we match with the cav a 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.900
 spheres as always as I showed you 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:18.840
 let's go to disassemble the hands 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:24.420
 at this point simply remove them 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.580
 the screws stop cash one two before 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.250
 but remove the screws we go to remove 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.350
 the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:37.390
 the post here is let's take a 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.070
 screwdriver to unscrew life life is 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.490
 this 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.710
 this is what we hope is that we will have a 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.360
 remove the post you need to plan 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.520
 floor without unhooking the diver 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.690
 completely in excellent ones 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.640
 the telethon would come, here it is 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.170
 We marched the post as they 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.360
 that unscrews life and press but why 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.580
 many times you send caste that go down 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.580
 then push the puller down a little 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.940
 then I feel myself challenged further 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.280
 it is automatically inspired 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:24.489
 take the screwdriver that we unscrew 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:29.260
 two karma cassero vines here is one e 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.720
 two prepared a triangle so read in 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.700
 plastic so as to put all the various 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.590
 pieces as they are disassembled 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.690
 inside so we do not risk 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.610
 lose them and then remember 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.549
 like having always said to keep me 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.720
 away from the work surface so as to 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.850
 prevent a sudden movement from going to 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:58.170
 flip the container with all the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:03:01.690
 pieces then we challenge the cash here is here 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.370
 under the house we put it aside and 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.370
 we reassemble the post 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.010
 and here we screw up life 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.900
 here they screech and put them back down 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:32.690
 from guided to push hard but without 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:35.750
 exaggerating is very little life force 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.900
 of the very good direct to there remains 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.240
 which will disassemble the second hand 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.020
 now that it 's easier than we have 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:49.790
 the chest and then challenge the layer 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.110
 dial always with the ball bearing that 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.060
 it is a tool that should not 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.940
 absolutely miss you here 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.780
 here because in fact it is easy and 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.240
 immediate without risk of ruining the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:11.570
 clock face 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:16.430
 here we put in the box well a 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:20.540
 at this point we are going to identify the le 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.280
 quarrels and that block the dial is not 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.260
 this is obviously the other if he had it 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:31.310
 found it looks like with a little one 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:34.010
 screwdriver do not unscrew all the whole 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.150
 all life is not enough to act in 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:41.120
 so to hook the dial here 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.740
 how many we support right and do 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:53.440
 slowly it elevates precisely so as to 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:56.410
 right easily the dial here 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.360
 I have to do calmly 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.629
 here 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.840
 summer with whom we will go to open 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:06.090
 even under several points of 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.789
 oxidation 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.340
 let's put the dial in place 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.979
 well at this point we parade to life 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.449
 hours because we could lose it is 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.050
 we put it in the small one 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:24.819
 container at this point we have 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:26.879
 the watch without the case accessories 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.979
 dial everything else 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:34.000
 then at this point I will explain a 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.949
 the work that we are going to fall 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.979
 give up a moment soldier we resume 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.979
 immediately
