00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.370
 Hello dear viewers and subscribers 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.890
 my channel is wrong with you and we 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.780
 consider the following attack aircraft weapon 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:18.029
 the game battlefield 3 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.579
 meet f2000 actually f2000 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.550
 opens at the twenty- fourth rank 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:26.789
 attack aircraft and the purchase of these weapons for 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.800
 60 thousand loans or nineteen hundred 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.589
 ninety nine pounds maximum 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.050
 damage 29 minimum 22 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:37.230
 capacity over the mouth of the store twenty 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.830
 two rounds of quick-fire 620 shots 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.320
 per minute 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.290
 possesses high range and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.670
 medium shooting accuracy 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.920
 recharges in 4.8 seconds 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.430
 f2000 belgian assault rifle 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.260
 made on the system in bullpup such 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.390
 layout should do more 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.390
 compact 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.590
 however seemingly bulky weapon and 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.580
 unbearable first thought to leave the battlefield 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.860
 change weapons to more decent 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.520
 damage is the same as most 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.940
 assault rifles 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.670
 but the range of damage over distances falls 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.490
 slowly making it possible to play 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.220
 as a sniper, unlike others 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.259
 medium range assault rifles 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.380
 demonstrates decent accuracy in 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.460
 time aiming shooting has a good 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:37.220
 the trade-off between power and precision 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:40.119
 weaker ak-47 and on color but more powerful than m4 and g3 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.700
 a4 and accuracy is the opposite 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.039
 recharging at f2000 lasts a long time so 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.520
 occasionally seek shelter 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.750
 as the Kalashnikov f2000 too 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.630
 unpleasant cottage 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.179
 what vertical such horizontal 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.899
 I â€™m getting too sick to 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.080
 clamp 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.170
 with proper skill this flaw 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.689
 it is possible to compensate 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.079
 shooting from the hip is best avoided because 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.640
 as you can see a strong trunk stem in 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.620
 sky 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.160
 because of what get into the enemy even in 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.610
 emphasis is not always possible 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.280
 mark f2000 the only weapon and sbu 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.130
 folders whose recoil is lateral 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.489
 not diagonal but vertically and and 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.500
 uniform initially has on one 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.350
 shop more unlike others 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.530
 assault 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.460
 rifles hence the belgian is in the lead 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.440
 by number of rounds in total 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.350
 open sight at first 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.440
 too unusual all the time 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.690
 I want to aim a little higher from 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.320
 sights better choose holographic 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.200
 sight set m 145 only in that case 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.600
 if you take the butt for the month itself 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.670
 optimal without and diligent bare all 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:05.220
 steel gray max and thunderbolt stock in 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.430
 the result is a good assault rifle f2000 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.820
 which can replace so 47 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.920
 but I would not advise taking newbies on 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.360
 my mind is preferably play on 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.270
 short distances 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.610
 This is due to the fact that the weapon 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.910
 too serious cottage which is not 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.250
 It allows you to give accurate fire 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.069
 irrigate I would not advise much better 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.150
 will go 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.159
 by 2 7 finishing off the wounded and that's it 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.840
 Thank you for watching! 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.790
