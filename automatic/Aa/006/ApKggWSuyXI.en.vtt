 hello everyone i'm roxy and that's it 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.439
 I will show you four simple videos 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.689
 hairstyles to do in five minutes 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.880
 when our hair is not al 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:31.009
 better let's say number one is a como 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.710
 take a rubber band neither and place it 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.540
 over the hair like that 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.640
 let it descend a little on the forehead and then 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.129
 take one strand at a time and 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.360
 roll it around the elastic from the 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.360
 face towards the ear 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.730
 you can then leave the hair like this or 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.640
 add a little rose for a more tone 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.199
 romantic 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.199
 or do both sides 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.550
 and then the hair races behind 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.979
 number two the bus 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.880
 send your hair back and play it 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.880
 central section 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.950
 once the desired volume is reached, there is no 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.340
 all that remains is to secure the hair with 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.340
 hairpins 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.340
 et voila 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.040
 here too you can decide to tie the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.489
 hair back in a queue or in one 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.489

 starting from a larger section 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.150

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.140

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.140
 created previously 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.000
 we take another elastic or maybe in 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.960
 this colorful case and we position it 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.960
 just behind the ear 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.950

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.950

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:20.490
