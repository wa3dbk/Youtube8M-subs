Saturday August 27th 2011 just put this
remote<00:00:05.130> food<00:00:05.310> plot<00:00:05.580> in<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.420> back<00:00:06.629> corner<00:00:07.020> of

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
remote food plot in the back corner of

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.749 
remote food plot in the back corner of
the<00:00:07.550> farmer's<00:00:08.550> field<00:00:08.790> two<00:00:09.630> weeks<00:00:09.809> ago<00:00:10.019> today

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
the farmer's field two weeks ago today

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.759 
the farmer's field two weeks ago today
it's<00:00:11.759> come<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:11.969> great<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.780> think<00:00:13.650> I've

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
it's come in great I think I've

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.460 
it's come in great I think I've
mentioned<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.219> got<00:00:14.780> huge<00:00:15.780> storms<00:00:16.260> just<00:00:16.379> a

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
mentioned we got huge storms just a

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.680 
mentioned we got huge storms just a
couple<00:00:16.770> hours<00:00:17.039> after<00:00:17.699> we<00:00:17.910> put<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
couple hours after we put this in the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.800 
couple hours after we put this in the
soil<00:00:18.960> was<00:00:19.140> all<00:00:19.260> loosened<00:00:19.619> up<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.660> now<00:00:21.660> that

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
soil was all loosened up so now that

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.269 
soil was all loosened up so now that
it's<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.020> little<00:00:22.199> further<00:00:22.350> along<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.769> can<00:00:23.070> see

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
it's a little further along you can see

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.929 
it's a little further along you can see
the<00:00:23.640> slope<00:00:25.250> this<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.460> high<00:00:26.580> ground<00:00:26.760> up

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
the slope this is the high ground up

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.460 
the slope this is the high ground up
here<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.269> kind<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.539> slopes<00:00:27.810> down<00:00:28.050> into<00:00:28.289> here

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
here that kind of slopes down into here

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040 
here that kind of slopes down into here
and<00:00:28.880> each<00:00:29.880> others<00:00:30.210> definitely<00:00:30.359> affect<00:00:30.929> from

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
and each others definitely affect from

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.650 
and each others definitely affect from
from<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> rain<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.160> had<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.640> didn't<00:00:33.540> have

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
from the rain that we had I didn't have

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.130 
from the rain that we had I didn't have
a<00:00:33.690> call<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.050> pack<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.410> anything<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.180> our<00:00:36.180> boots

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
a call to pack or anything so our boots

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.630 
a call to pack or anything so our boots
are<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> only<00:00:37.590> thing<00:00:37.800> packing<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.219> soil<00:00:38.460> down

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
are the only thing packing the soil down

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.299 
are the only thing packing the soil down
that<00:00:38.879> day<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.680> didn't<00:00:40.860> even<00:00:40.920> really<00:00:41.129> do

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
that day and we didn't even really do

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.430 
that day and we didn't even really do
much<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.700> rake<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> soil<00:00:42.930> over<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.260> top

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
much of that rake the soil over the top

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.340 
much of that rake the soil over the top
of<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:45.140> but<00:00:46.760> I'm<00:00:47.760> very<00:00:47.789> impressed<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:49.050> did<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
of it but I'm very impressed we did the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.389 
of it but I'm very impressed we did the
lime<00:00:49.530> fertilizer<00:00:50.129> application<00:00:52.219> I'm<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.280> to

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
lime fertilizer application I'm going to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.850 
lime fertilizer application I'm going to
come<00:00:53.550> out<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.820> another<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.590> just<00:00:55.590> because

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
come out and do another one just because

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.260 
come out and do another one just because
I<00:00:56.039> think<00:00:56.670> most<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.059> washed<00:00:57.570> down<00:00:57.809> into<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
I think most of it washed down into the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.240 
I think most of it washed down into the
low<00:01:00.270> ground<00:01:00.510> along<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.680> seed<00:01:01.890> because

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
low ground along with the seed because

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.100 
low ground along with the seed because
both<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> fertilizer<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.690> lime<00:01:03.750> were

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
both the fertilizer and lime were

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.950 
both the fertilizer and lime were
pelletized<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:04.979> weren't<00:01:05.189> liquid<00:01:05.810> I'm<00:01:06.810> going

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
pelletized they weren't liquid I'm going

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.820 
pelletized they weren't liquid I'm going
to<00:01:07.020> come<00:01:07.140> back<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.500> hit<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.310> grande

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
to come back and hit this with a grande

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.990 
to come back and hit this with a grande
lime<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.159> fertilizer<00:01:12.060> both<00:01:12.630> they're<00:01:12.840> liquid

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
lime and fertilizer both they're liquid

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.840 
lime and fertilizer both they're liquid
need<00:01:15.000> dilution<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.860> 10<00:01:16.860> gallons<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.369> water<00:01:17.520> I

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
need dilution in 10 gallons of water I

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.850 
need dilution in 10 gallons of water I
think<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.869> fertilizer<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.530> eight<00:01:19.650> for

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
think for the fertilizer and eight for

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.670 
think for the fertilizer and eight for
the<00:01:19.920> lime<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.850> could<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.119> backwards<00:01:21.680> but

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the lime and it could be backwards but

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.179 
the lime and it could be backwards but
what<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.890> did<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.369> came<00:01:23.430> out<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.920> all

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
what I did is I came out here and all

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.090 
what I did is I came out here and all
these<00:01:26.400> areas<00:01:26.640> where<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.240> was<00:01:27.330> pretty<00:01:27.570> bare

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
these areas where it was pretty bare

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.030 
these areas where it was pretty bare
this<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> only<00:01:29.970> low<00:01:30.390> ground<00:01:30.689> spots

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
this is one of the only low ground spots

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.010 
this is one of the only low ground spots
most<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.250> high<00:01:32.369> ground<00:01:32.610> spots<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.240> were

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
most of the high ground spots that were

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.039 
most of the high ground spots that were
pretty<00:01:34.259> bare<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> came<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.540> Irie<00:01:36.540> seeded

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
pretty bare I came in and I Irie seeded

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.630 
pretty bare I came in and I Irie seeded
with<00:01:37.950> whitetail<00:01:38.520> Institute<00:01:39.060> boast<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.640> you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
with whitetail Institute boast and you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.990 
with whitetail Institute boast and you
can<00:01:41.729> see<00:01:41.909> I'd<00:01:42.270> lost<00:01:42.540> quite<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.869> bit<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:44.000> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
can see I'd lost quite a bit in here the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.580 
can see I'd lost quite a bit in here the
soils<00:01:45.360> also<00:01:45.630> got<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> little<00:01:46.079> bit<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.350> green

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
soils also got a little bit of a green

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.469 
soils also got a little bit of a green
hue<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:47.970> think<00:01:48.060> my<00:01:49.280> pH<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.520> definitely

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
hue to it so I think my pH is definitely

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.870 
hue to it so I think my pH is definitely
in<00:01:51.540> need<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.689> adjustment<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.500> guess<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.850> a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
in need of adjustment I guess the the a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.959 
in need of adjustment I guess the the a
grande<00:01:54.299> lime<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.840> supposed<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> work<00:01:55.969> better

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
grande lime is supposed to work better

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.929 
grande lime is supposed to work better
and<00:01:57.320> quicker<00:01:58.320> than<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.820> pelletized<00:02:00.329> stuff

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
and quicker than the pelletized stuff

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.030 
and quicker than the pelletized stuff
and<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.329> supposed<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.719> grow<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.079> sunny<00:02:04.860> or

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
and this is supposed to grow in sunny or

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.679 
and this is supposed to grow in sunny or
partially<00:02:05.070> shaded<00:02:05.579> area<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> went<00:02:06.600> ahead

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
partially shaded area so I went ahead

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.750 
partially shaded area so I went ahead
and<00:02:07.580> followed<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> corn<00:02:08.879> line<00:02:09.090> there<00:02:09.330> and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
so I just raked it up and put the seed

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.920 
so I just raked it up and put the seed
down<00:02:33.360> raked<00:02:34.360> over<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.660> top<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:36.930> we

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.830 
then kind of left this a little bit
filled<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:35.790> just<00:03:36.790> figure<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.660> deer
