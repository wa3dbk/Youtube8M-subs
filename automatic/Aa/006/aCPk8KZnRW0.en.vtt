00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.040
 hey people what gives us and heart for 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.990
 art another admitting to all zdf 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.940
 Today, it's about how to be legal 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.830
 then fast money can make some 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.330
 it was because they were afraid 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.369
 have banned that by the glitch 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.660
 or be it because with the legal 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.220
 Money is a bit more fun 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.350
 I thought of everyone 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.910
 if you make a small series of it 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.800
 can start or three to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.689
 four videos will be added soon 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.080
 There is something about this topic 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.610
 more quickly 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.989
 at the other a bit slow 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.000
 if that's a little more fun for that 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.010
 it is forbidden with the other one 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.110
 just not so fun with my needs 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.059
 one does not make friends for the other one like that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.219
 After the factors could decide 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.930
 what trick you use which mission 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.030
 was which reindeer will perform 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.710
 we have with today here 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.300
 is it probably the streak of the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.219
 Most of the money is spent on the man, though 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.870
 also some skill needs if you 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.920
 in race always last will be there 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.760
 you actually already the trick 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.739
 to forget 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.809
 until the online must then press to the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.750
 start button pour category online 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.280
 shops job cost of rockstar poses 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.350
 Run and then you search the race 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.420
 channel frontal when the race is found 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.100
 that his knowledge right first 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.140
 then took on the display picture and on the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.939
 rating it has just seen and that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.070
 you start the whole thing quite simply 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.680
 settings works best like me 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.290
 Round as a class I will give you the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 Motorcycles suggest something with the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.560
 according to experience the fastest way and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.810
 own vehicles set when you 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.759
 have a tuned motorcycle if 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.799
 you no hate set the whole thing off 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.840
 and then you are looking for first-time players 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.939
 need three members best so 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.860
 that the four of them and have lots of money 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.360
 also get a good chance 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.400
 have the race to win 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.880
 the coaches want the cougar 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.680
 vehicle or motorcycle from that I think 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.020
 best if another is best 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.009
 when we start something else and start 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.710
 I'll show you the race now 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.130
 some tricks on the map to fast 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.110
 his 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.090
 on the one hand the tower between 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.799
 already relatively well known press some 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.290
 already rtl ii to start when the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.030
 author still at 213 should be the first 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.450
 make if there where stands at first 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.640
 Curve 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.409
 you should not necessarily before the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.729
 opponents are because otherwise they have 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.660
 Just enjoy it from the side 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.849
 the case was with me 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.180
 and you are very much in arrears 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.340
 second turn 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.750
 the same and there you can ne quantity 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.939
 catch up because then comes the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.590
 You can reach the finish line through wind shadows 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.180
 Maybe take a seat here 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.200
 In the front fight I'm on the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.700
 come first place 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.560
 but I have too far ahead of that 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.359
 make it so that they are 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.459
 just before celina first you first 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.420
 conquered space otherwise happens 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.430
 the same as mine 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.900
 you will be overtaken once more and 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.040
 then say again to second place 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.650
 came in second place 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.269
 There's a lot of coal for me to get 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.790
 here for a race the one and a half 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.769
 took 7500 dollars 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.049
 additionally 3800 apps 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.329
 that also means to leveln on legal 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.569
 it routes this race suited and 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.579
 first place receives just under $ 14,000 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.769
 makes a lot of money through it and for that 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.849
 first only wants a minute thirty 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.129
 the race makes that is already one 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.659
 pretty cool way even if you 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.900
 every time only the race second 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.219
 graduated receives per hour 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.780
 $ 275,000 and if you have one more 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.219
 Pieces better until the best case 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.349
 if you win races every thing 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:14.200
 rather unrealistic than well 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.209
 over $ 550,000 per hour through 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.099
 this trick i hope the video 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.409
 has celebrated rick has helped you me 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.409
 I'm out people and look 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.390
 permanent 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.890
