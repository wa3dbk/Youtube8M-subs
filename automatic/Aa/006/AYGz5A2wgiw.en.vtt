00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.259
 hurt by the removal but 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.129
 proud of themselves for the effort 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.530
 accomplished 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.530
 so he has seen the tie against the 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.200
 bayern a wardrobe that will now fight 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.260
 by the league 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.580
 to the people who are here I understand the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.710
 We have taken all the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.470
 true because it has been a very party 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:28.570
 vibrant from beginning to end spins 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.160
 this is going to affect for something else 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.079
 very well had two options we are going to 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.600
 missing in the ball will go very well 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.680
 team congratulate you and wish you luck in 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.720
 the final to the two teams of 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.399
 classified and good then to think about 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.840
 the league that this next Sunday our 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.909
 goal that we have pk a bit of 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.110
 hold the result we start very 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:45.920
 strong but good what the team does not 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.640
 you can ask for more 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.579
 he is very well touched 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.940
 it is complicated to get up and more an area 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.940
 of criminal 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.250
 and we are going to fight a lot we have worked 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.230
 we have said what we have been able 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.660
 and good we go from here with the head 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.300
 high because we have said a great great 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.970
 work we did not know what 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.420
 to the anteroom of the final to a match 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.890
 that takes us to give the pass and we 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.220
 had put the match very well and so 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.990
 a pity that we have failed to endure a 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.430
 little bit more the result the bayern 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.590
 he has also played well there are 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.850
 recognize it and then we're already a 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.150
 little tired and in the end in the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.150
 fronts 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.170
 we did everything we could 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.680
 maybe we did not have the luck that they 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.290
 played on it but well I think the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.540
 team will be good because it will have 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.580
 made a very big effort extremely 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.770
 between Saturday a very match 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.870
 important also against Barcelona and 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.140
 we arrived here you play and your 20 minutes 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.910
 will end with nutrition I think it is 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.790
 valued work and everything and I think that 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.650
 we are a little sad because I 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.810
 I think we will get there 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.130
 Real Madrid has given everything has left the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.310
 skin the weapon has been left inside the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.350
 field and the penalty is not sand but 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.210
 also thank not the madridismo for 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.520
 the support of the fans I think that the 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.890
 chapo and 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.180
 and continue because the league goes on and the 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.370
 Sunday then we have again another 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.320
 match tomorrow I have to throw it away 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.750
 again and I did not have the great luck of 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.460
 put it would throw it back enchanted 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.400
 because when you're like with a level of 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.110
 Trust is good, you always try 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.390
 contribute and give everything to the team and 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.910
 contribute to a penalty and playing you 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.010
 a final because it is a very big pressure 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.420
 but I personally have always 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.420
 known to be well
