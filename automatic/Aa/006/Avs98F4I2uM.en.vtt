suit<00:01:08.820> top<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:10.320> was<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> complex

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
suit top and it was a complex

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.300 
suit top and it was a complex
interlocking<00:01:12.509> design<00:01:12.929> he<00:01:13.679> had<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> hand<00:01:14.130> paint

interlocking design he had to hand paint
the<00:01:14.490> design<00:01:14.789> so<00:01:15.030> instead<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.330> applying<00:01:15.600> them

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:15.929 
the design so instead of applying them

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:17.960

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
rather than a high-shine finish because

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.720

a high-shine topcoat would create

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.580 
a high-shine topcoat would create
highlights<00:03:11.239> that<00:03:11.600> would<00:03:11.780> interfere<00:03:11.989> with<00:03:12.410> the
