was wearing glass he also decided to

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.500 
was wearing glass he also decided to
charge<00:03:12.340> her<00:03:12.489> because<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.879> that<00:03:13.120> now<00:03:13.450> the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
charge her because of that now the

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.970 
charge her because of that now the
current<00:03:13.810> time<00:03:13.930> many<00:03:14.139> states<00:03:14.439> actually<00:03:14.620> don't

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
current time many states actually don't

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.099 
current time many states actually don't
outlaw<00:03:15.430> using<00:03:15.849> google<00:03:15.969> glass<00:03:16.329> but<00:03:16.719> they<00:03:16.900> are

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
outlaw using google glass but they are

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.080 
outlaw using google glass but they are
pushing<00:03:17.560> forth<00:03:17.769> legislation<00:03:17.919> to<00:03:18.519> do<00:03:18.819> that

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
pushing forth legislation to do that

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.789 
pushing forth legislation to do that
basically<00:03:19.690> treating<00:03:20.019> google<00:03:20.290> glass<00:03:20.500> like<00:03:20.769> a

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
basically treating google glass like a

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.409 
basically treating google glass like a
smartphone<00:03:21.220> because<00:03:21.549> if<00:03:21.879> you<00:03:22.000> think<00:03:22.239> about<00:03:22.299> it

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
smartphone because if you think about it

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.449 
smartphone because if you think about it
that's<00:03:22.599> basically<00:03:23.169> what<00:03:23.409> it<00:03:23.440> is<00:03:23.620> except<00:03:24.099> it's

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
that's basically what it is except it's

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.619 
that's basically what it is except it's
even<00:03:24.699> worse<00:03:24.879> because<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.269> like<00:03:25.359> right<00:03:25.599> in

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
even worse because it's like right in

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.180 
even worse because it's like right in
front<00:03:25.989> of<00:03:26.109> your<00:03:26.260> eyes<00:03:26.290> so<00:03:26.799> when<00:03:27.010> doing

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
front of your eyes so when doing

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.830 
front of your eyes so when doing
something<00:03:27.430> like<00:03:27.549> driving<00:03:28.060> probably<00:03:28.569> not<00:03:28.720> the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
something like driving probably not the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.300 
something like driving probably not the
best<00:03:28.870> thing<00:03:29.109> so<00:03:29.590> it's<00:03:29.769> technically<00:03:30.189> not

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
best thing so it's technically not

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.099 
best thing so it's technically not
illegal<00:03:30.430> though<00:03:30.939> the<00:03:31.120> cop<00:03:31.299> did<00:03:31.569> find<00:03:31.840> another

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
illegal though the cop did find another

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.869 
illegal though the cop did find another
way<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.319> actually<00:03:32.590> position<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.669> being

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
way to actually position this that being

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.369 
way to actually position this that being
the<00:03:33.909> fact<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.359> device<00:03:34.540> can<00:03:34.810> provide<00:03:35.169> a

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
the fact that the device can provide a

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.439 
the fact that the device can provide a
