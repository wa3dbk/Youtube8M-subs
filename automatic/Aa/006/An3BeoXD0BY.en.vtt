00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.330
 stiffness adjustment needed 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.980
 so we look at the way 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.670

 have you bolts for the trunk 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.670
 under the disc brake though it seems to me 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.410
 even 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.930
 you can even put the usual trunk 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.490
 here that is 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.530
 stand if they go and do not interfere not 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:38.950
 there will be in principle here 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.880
 the trunk will be so that you can still 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.010
 say here's another 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:48.540
 48 centimeters inscription here is a profile 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.540
 this turned out a miner 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.940
 in principle, what I want to say with him 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.530
 the only thing we don't like here 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.460
 this is an entry level front 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.910
 switch 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.050
 Entry-level cassette and also the CEC 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.940
 eat want to ride them desirable 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.580
 we are lucky to replace with more expensive ones 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.880
