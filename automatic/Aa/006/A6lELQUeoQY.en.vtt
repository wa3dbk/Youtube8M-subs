lay<00:02:05.600> then<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.720> top<00:02:06.960> coat<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:07.759> with<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:09.119> gold

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
lay then you top coat and with with gold

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.950 
lay then you top coat and with with gold
leafing<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.290> different<00:02:11.220> than<00:02:11.340> foil<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:12.630> that

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
leafing is different than foil in that

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.760 
leafing is different than foil in that
it<00:02:13.230> does<00:02:13.500> not<00:02:13.530> have<00:02:14.490> too<00:02:14.910> much<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.770> reaction

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
it does not have too much of a reaction

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.280 
it does not have too much of a reaction
to<00:02:17.160> top<00:02:17.580> coat<00:02:17.850> okay<00:02:18.480> but<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.720> really<00:02:19.080> want<00:02:19.260> a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
to top coat okay but I really want a

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.830 
to top coat okay but I really want a
good<00:02:19.440> seal<00:02:19.800> because<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.400> needs<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.480> be<00:02:21.600> sealed

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
good seal because it needs to be sealed

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.440 
good seal because it needs to be sealed
down<00:02:22.520> but<00:02:23.520> I'm<00:02:23.610> going<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.790> top<00:02:23.970> coat<00:02:24.209> one<00:02:24.360> of

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
down but I'm going to top coat one of

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.030 
down but I'm going to top coat one of
these<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.750> let<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.930> see<00:02:25.170> how<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.560> acts<00:02:25.740> really

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
these and let you see how it acts really

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.380 
these and let you see how it acts really
quick<00:02:30.709> it's<00:02:31.709> going<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.040> stay<00:02:32.310> pretty<00:02:32.820> close<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
quick it's going to stay pretty close to

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.610 
quick it's going to stay pretty close to
looking<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.110> through<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> whole

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
looking like that through the whole

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.010 
looking like that through the whole
design<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.870> can<00:02:36.900> see<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> little<00:02:37.800> bit<00:02:38.220> of

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
design you can see a little bit of

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.870 
design you can see a little bit of
reaction<00:02:40.160> anyways<00:02:41.160> I'm<00:02:41.280> going<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.459> top<00:02:41.640> coat

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
reaction anyways I'm going to top coat

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.660 
reaction anyways I'm going to top coat
and<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:42.150> I'll<00:02:42.270> start<00:02:42.420> my<00:02:42.570> next<00:02:42.630> part<00:02:43.670> okay

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
and then I'll start my next part okay

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.840 
and then I'll start my next part okay
now<00:02:45.060> i'm<00:02:45.270> going<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.810> with<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:47.190> palette<00:02:47.700> i'm

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
now i'm going in with this palette i'm

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.550 
now i'm going in with this palette i'm
going<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.030> use<00:02:48.120> some<00:02:48.300> black<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.900> gold<00:02:49.290> mixed

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
going to use some black and gold mixed

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.290 
going to use some black and gold mixed
together<00:02:49.770> i'm<00:02:50.400> going<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.610> use<00:02:50.700> some<00:02:50.730> purple

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
together i'm going to use some purple

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.380 
together i'm going to use some purple
and<00:02:51.570> i'm<00:02:51.959> going<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.200> use<00:02:52.459> some<00:02:53.459> silver<00:02:54.090> purple

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
and i'm going to use some silver purple

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.479 
and i'm going to use some silver purple
and<00:02:54.810> i'm<00:02:55.170> going<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.410> try<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.650> make<00:02:55.950> an<00:02:56.100> opal

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
and i'm going to try to make an opal

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.890 
and i'm going to try to make an opal
color<00:02:56.700> but<00:02:57.570> i'm<00:02:57.900> starting<00:02:58.110> out<00:02:58.410> with<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.900> dark

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
color but i'm starting out with a dark

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
gold and i'm going to gold in some

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.430 
gold and i'm going to gold in some
circles<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.340> these<00:03:05.340> are<00:03:05.580> going<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.440> hold

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
circles and these are going to hold

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.930 
circles and these are going to hold
color<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.600> I'm<00:03:09.750> going<00:03:09.959> like<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:10.140> first

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
color and so I'm going like that first

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.070 
color and so I'm going like that first
making<00:03:11.940> circles<00:03:13.070> then<00:03:14.510> gather<00:03:15.510> my<00:03:15.690> circuit

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
making circles then gather my circuit

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.910 
making circles then gather my circuit
has<00:03:16.200> dried<00:03:16.620> I'm<00:03:17.519> going<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.790> go<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.680> just<00:03:19.680> like

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
has dried I'm going to go in just like

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.979 
has dried I'm going to go in just like
this<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.930> kind<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.940> just<00:03:23.940> stop<00:03:24.360> in<00:03:24.690> some

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
this and kind of just stop in some

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.039 
this and kind of just stop in some
circles<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.680> color<00:03:26.100> all<00:03:26.970> across<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.750> middle

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
circles of color all across the middle

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.170 
circles of color all across the middle
now<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:28.890> have<00:03:29.190> all<00:03:29.430> different<00:03:29.640> kinds<00:03:29.940> of

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
now I have all different kinds of

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.660 
now I have all different kinds of
tutorials<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.049> go<00:03:31.320> dot<00:03:31.560> dotting<00:03:32.010> across<00:03:32.459> the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
tutorials that go dot dotting across the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.600 
tutorials that go dot dotting across the
middle<00:03:33.000> but<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:34.260> user<00:03:34.470> uses<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.130> whole<00:03:35.400> bunch

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
middle but this user uses a whole bunch

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.740 
middle but this user uses a whole bunch
of<00:03:35.760> different<00:03:36.860> colors<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:37.890> textures<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:39.030> it

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
of different colors and textures and it

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.390 
of different colors and textures and it
just<00:03:39.959> really<00:03:40.320> is<00:03:40.350> going<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.769> be<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.920> beautiful

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
just really is going to be a beautiful

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.250 
just really is going to be a beautiful
beautiful<00:03:42.000> design<00:03:42.600> won't<00:03:42.900> fit

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
beautiful design won't fit

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.119 
beautiful design won't fit
so<00:03:44.010> let<00:03:44.159> me<00:03:44.189> do<00:03:44.400> one<00:03:44.640> more<00:03:47.120> like<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:49.129> you

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
so let me do one more like this and you

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.679 
so let me do one more like this and you
see<00:03:50.340> how<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.549> purple<00:03:50.909> goes<00:03:51.060> right<00:03:51.299> onto<00:03:51.450> that

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:51.689 
see how the purple goes right onto that

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:55.009 
see how the purple goes right onto that
color<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:53.099> color<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.610> then<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.689> blends

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
color the this color and then it blends

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.970 
color the this color and then it blends
in<00:03:55.349> so<00:03:55.890> I'm<00:03:56.099> blending<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.760> with<00:03:56.790> colors<00:03:57.980> then

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
in so I'm blending in with colors then

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.610 
in so I'm blending in with colors then
I'll<00:03:59.250> go<00:03:59.489> in<00:03:59.700> with<00:03:59.730> silver<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:02.190> dot<00:04:03.180> in

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
I'll go in with silver and and dot in

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.880 
I'll go in with silver and and dot in
silver<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.959> then<00:04:06.959> just<00:04:07.140> create<00:04:07.470> this<00:04:07.620> really

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
silver and then just create this really

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:17.360 
silver and then just create this really
really<00:04:08.220> pretty<00:04:08.579> face<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:10.170> centerline

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.789 

okay<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.959> then<00:04:19.079> i<00:04:19.169> will<00:04:19.350> show<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.590> what<00:04:19.769> i
