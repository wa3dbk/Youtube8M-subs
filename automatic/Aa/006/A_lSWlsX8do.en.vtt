point of let's say weight in case of day
dick<00:00:51.429> ball<00:00:51.639> look<00:00:51.819> how<00:00:51.999> look<00:00:52.659> how<00:00:52.690> it<00:00:52.960> bends

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:53.139 
dick ball look how look how it bends

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:56.399 
dick ball look how look how it bends
like<00:00:53.379> this<00:00:54.149> doesn't<00:00:55.149> that<00:00:55.269> look<00:00:55.449> look<00:00:56.049> which

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
like this doesn't that look look which

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.289 
like this doesn't that look look which
forms<00:00:56.799> a<00:00:56.889> statement<00:00:57.370> once<00:00:57.579> it's<00:00:57.850> in<00:00:57.999> a<00:00:58.030> year

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299

forms a statement once it's in a year
you<00:00:58.510> cannot<00:00:58.749> influence<00:00:59.049> it<00:00:59.350> anyhow<00:00:59.709> but<00:01:00.190> as

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
you cannot influence it anyhow but as

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.989 
you cannot influence it anyhow but as
you<00:01:00.489> move<00:01:00.899> backwards<00:01:02.069> forward<00:01:03.069> wherever<00:01:03.850> you

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
you move backwards forward wherever you

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:05.580 
you move backwards forward wherever you
move<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.390> look<00:01:04.720> how<00:01:04.930> it's<00:01:05.049> going<00:01:05.229> to<00:01:05.290> influence

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
move it look how it's going to influence

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
move it look how it's going to influence
so<00:01:05.740> don't<00:01:06.130> move<00:01:06.430> in<00:01:06.640> chaotic<00:01:07.000> formations<00:01:07.960> move

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
so don't move in chaotic formations move

wouldn't fall once I would do something
also<00:02:29.140> take<00:02:30.140> note<00:02:30.170> it's<00:02:31.100> very<00:02:31.160> important<00:02:31.700> the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
also take note it's very important the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.030 
also take note it's very important the
objects<00:02:32.720> when<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.960> put<00:02:33.170> them<00:02:33.350> they<00:02:33.620> will<00:02:33.800> not

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
objects when you put them they will not

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.790 
objects when you put them they will not
stay<00:02:34.460> once<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.450> quit<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.140> game<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.530> reload

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
stay once you quit the game and reload

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.050 
stay once you quit the game and reload
the<00:02:36.950> game<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.250> for<00:02:37.370> example<00:02:37.640> if<00:02:37.730> right<00:02:37.880> now<00:02:37.910> I

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
the game so for example if right now I

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.180 
the game so for example if right now I
save<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.450> game<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.810> load<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.290> they<00:02:39.950> will

save the game and load it they will

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.830 
save the game and load it they will
probably<00:02:40.430> stay<00:02:40.790> in<00:02:40.880> one<00:02:41.000> place<00:02:41.150> but<00:02:41.450> if<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.630> save

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
probably stay in one place but if I save

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.440

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.520 
it works good luck with your decoration
and<00:03:25.970> probably<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:26.630> would<00:03:26.780> rather<00:03:26.989> do<00:03:27.350> that

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
and probably you would rather do that

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.840 
and probably you would rather do that
for<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.830> screenshot<00:03:28.340> rather<00:03:28.610> than<00:03:28.760> the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
for the screenshot rather than the

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.160 
for the screenshot rather than the
decoration<00:03:29.570> because<00:03:29.660> usually<00:03:29.900> they<00:03:30.140> fall

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
decoration because usually they fall

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.710 
decoration because usually they fall
through<00:03:30.440> objects<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.190> everything<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:32.239> yeah

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
through objects and everything so yeah

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.449 
through objects and everything so yeah
