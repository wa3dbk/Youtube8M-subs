00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
can move up and down but don't try to

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.399

fly off the track because for some

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.719 
fly off the track because for some
reason<00:01:51.710> even<00:01:51.860> though<00:01:52.009> you're<00:01:52.250> in<00:01:52.340> an<00:01:52.460> airplane

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
reason even though you're in an airplane

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.240 
reason even though you're in an airplane
it'll<00:01:53.300> slow<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:53.780> down<00:01:53.960> or<00:01:54.170> knock<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:54.440> down<00:01:54.560> so

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
it'll slow you down or knock you down so

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.620 
it'll slow you down or knock you down so
these<00:01:55.400> are<00:01:55.520> obviously<00:01:56.000> really<00:01:56.360> crappy

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
these are obviously really crappy

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.039 
these are obviously really crappy
airplanes

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
airplanes

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.830 
airplanes
so<00:01:59.649> the<00:01:59.799> flying<00:02:00.159> in<00:02:00.430> banjo<00:02:01.030> pilot<00:02:01.600> actually

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
so the flying in banjo pilot actually

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.319 
so the flying in banjo pilot actually
defeats<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:03.039> entire<00:02:03.070> purpose<00:02:03.399> of<00:02:03.969> flying

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
defeats the entire purpose of flying

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.740 
defeats the entire purpose of flying
which<00:02:04.600> is<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:05.079> fly<00:02:05.350> above<00:02:05.859> roads<00:02:06.310> and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
which is to fly above roads and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.420 
which is to fly above roads and
obstacles<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:07.929> may<00:02:08.110> as<00:02:08.319> well<00:02:08.349> take<00:02:08.769> a<00:02:08.800> bus<00:02:10.140> I'm

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
obstacles you may as well take a bus I'm

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.949 
obstacles you may as well take a bus I'm
thinking<00:02:12.430> about<00:02:12.550> this<00:02:12.910> way<00:02:13.180> too<00:02:13.239> much<00:02:13.690> aren't

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
thinking about this way too much aren't

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.550 
thinking about this way too much aren't
I<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:15.099> realism<00:02:15.610> people<00:02:16.269> bears<00:02:17.170> flying

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
I it's the realism people bears flying

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.410 
I it's the realism people bears flying
airplanes<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.160> okay<00:02:18.489> but<00:02:18.670> requiring<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
airplanes is okay but requiring the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.180 
airplanes is okay but requiring the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
airplanes to stay on the road now that's

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.020 
airplanes to stay on the road now that's
just<00:02:21.430> crazy<00:02:23.640> okay<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:24.700> we've<00:02:25.000> established

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
just crazy okay so we've established

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.690 
just crazy okay so we've established
