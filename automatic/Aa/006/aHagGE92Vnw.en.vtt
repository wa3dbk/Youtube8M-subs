00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:09.960
 The galleys are welcome here is more 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.340
 a video of the maine blocks two who in the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.019
 Front Thiago Channel Free Games 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.040
 own message of friendship proposes 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.719
 dot com 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.850
 Today I want to do an experiment here. 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.640
 with you two more blocks I will leave 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.529
 nobody in the description of worlds galera 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.170
 if you could do the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.220
 download the world I'm using 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.130
 your computer 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.109
 so let's start by creating a world 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.300
 here first because only then have power 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.130
 make the test does not create a world that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.550
 anyone gives the name the cure and by 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.140
 example it will create the world and let's 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.640
 wait a little bit and it's loaded 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.040
 seeing that right is loading 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.660
 still is not basically going to do 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.899
 the next will carry the world for you 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.190
 and will save and will ask you some 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.500
 independent things and was the first 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.219
 Since you are playing this game here 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.800
 huh 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.539
 as we talked about before 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.250
 so lets take some time here you will 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.520
 ask if he does not ask us 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.650
 will leave and the next step to do 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.210
 understood it will be the following when you 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.270
 it is also here that the world was created 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.950
 nor are they in the creative and so on 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.689
 let's leave him want to leave 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.930
 the next thing you have to do 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.270
 is to open a specific folder in your 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.530
 computer that is going to be said to be 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.689
 exactly this way 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.930
 I'll leave it in the description for you, too. 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.460
 to understand what I'm doing is put the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.220
 wood and then look for 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.400
 macromedia flash player 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.579
 chernobyl ex this letter number will change 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.240
 on your local ros that will not change 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.159
 mbm b-26 also does not want more blogs 26 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.320
 in here as you are seeing no 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.869
 I do not even have English what was the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.329
 people just created how you 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.229
 Do you remember what you got? 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.360
 what to do 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.670
 first let me go back there and leave here 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.180
 the world did not close this folder 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.850
 here you see that now there are two has one 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.149
 folder does not even have a list 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.610
 This is important because I'm leaving. 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.819
 giving you a compressed file 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.539
 which is called the world of the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.330
 miniblog 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.860
 2 in case then what will have entered 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.950
 inside will have 3 to 1 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.140
 alive people understood will have the world 2 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.780
 survival and the same list that you 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.730
 just saw what you have to do 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.990
 you need to open the file in 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.990
 any folder on your computer 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.450
 first in this file decompression and 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.550
 will get these three here world 2 survival 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.800
 and six laws will weigh these three things 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.620
 and forget and zippy that after you did the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.800
 download is not accurate but not when I 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.959
 have these three files here are 123 if 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.160
 going back in that folder that was 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.790
 written 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.810
 these two will delete what was there 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.310
 saying that we are going to say that this is the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.690
 first time you're playing 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.709
 understood is not because to pay their 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.820
 worlds do not 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.850
 This is the way I'm saying. 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.500
 for you to use what I am 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.360
 Working, then you're going to erase this. 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.520
 here but if you have not playing 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.550
 you want to pay do not need you will come back 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.670
 There you will copy 63 files here 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.770
 op and copy and paste here 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.890
 so here as you can see there are three 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.340
 things a file two folders and each 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.630
 Step have your things in there too. 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:28.200
 we do now we will open 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:33.360
 again the largest block a block disappeared 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.549
 soon assumed that we will see that it gave 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.470
 my machine will work for me 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.430
 I tested then I'm sure it will 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.610
 succeed 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.670
 yesterday the two survivor two world no 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.530
 let's see a year survival mode nec is 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.450
 in survival mode 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.790
 if you remember the farm only one 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.280
 here 's the test in the evening 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.420
 so it will give you understand 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.970
 they work because you will see the same 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.130
 thing that is going to be that the bonfire is going 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.480
 Being at night is pretty good back there 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.580
 the other world of crime and you did not have 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.620
 One problem if you remember was one of the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.890
 first I thought I wanted a castle 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.489
 here but for some reason the world left 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.079
 to function while coming here he falls 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.660
 When you get up, are you there? 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.370
 to the left there are still things here 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.760
 so I do not know when you leave 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.710
 a blog that has in the game that what she 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.639
 who is still fixing you see that 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.919
 still have a lot there and here 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.960
 and from the right side I saw nothing I went 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.400
 quite on the right side and did not see anything 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.330
 Only on the left side there is a lot of 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.529
 You're seeing a lot of things, you know. 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.139
 to do something 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:44.020
 only bok happened he deleted the 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.889
 blocks of a certain height everything to 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.050
 low 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.669
 understood then, if I want to go down 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.229
 here you will have an idea of ​​what 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.370
 happened now 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:56.770
 Let him fall down there and get an idea. 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.960
 The less you see that the 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.479
 blocks of sand the water is coming down 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.159
 now but neither to the left nor to the 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.870
 right has nothing 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.939
 if I continue to develop water 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.009
 coming down you have something on the side 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:12.279
 From there there is lava on the side of there and try 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.319
 passing through here we can see that in a tabu cattle 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:17.020
 Why can not I go on like you do? 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.909
 they are seeing here it is blocked but it gives 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.150
 To see that there is lava on the side of there. 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:24.939
 Then something happened to the 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.729
 texture of the blocks imagine I 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:30.699
 I can get this one here and go back to 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.650
 there the sky appears again and the 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.319
 my castle is on the side of here 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.620
 so I guess if you guys try 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:41.020
 It'll be okay there, it's not certain anymore 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.779
 I hope you can give right are 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.139
 reviewing the link again in the description 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:49.629
 will contain a zip file having 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.189
 I opened it inside it will have a more 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.990
 two folders 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:55.569
 you will create a world in the largest block 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.909
 just so he can create this crazy folder 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:00.279
 rosé mb 26 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:03.279
 then when it has already created you 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:07.300
 back here takes the content of this 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:09.219
 file and puts it to a certain extent. 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.379
 which can not have anything if you already 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:13.810
 I've been playing your world, I have not 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.310
 I recommend paying only if you want 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.050
 make a new 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.149
 the new world in a test I do not even 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.069
 I know if it will work because I only have 

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:23.139
 a windows in another home that has mec 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:26.080
 so it will not work on the other 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.460
 computer but I hope it works 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.490
 You like it because it's going to be there. 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.550
 interesting starting from now 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.459
 is creating worlds is sharing 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.699

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.060
 There you are doing the same thing as me. 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:49.540
 I'm doing it 's plan to put
