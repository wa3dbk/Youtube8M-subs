better just because of the kind of the
the<00:04:36.840> display<00:04:37.289> size<00:04:37.590> basically<00:04:38.250> it's

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
the display size basically it's

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.770 
the display size basically it's
literally<00:04:38.849> just<00:04:38.909> because<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.479> display

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780

everything's a lot more open and large I

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:48.260 
everything's a lot more open and large I
mean<00:04:45.569> a<00:04:45.750> good<00:04:45.900> comparison<00:04:46.199> to<00:04:47.039> subway<00:04:47.789> so<00:04:47.849> here

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
mean a good comparison to subway so here

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.200 
mean a good comparison to subway so here
you<00:04:49.110> know<00:04:49.229> subway<00:04:49.560> surf<00:04:49.860> on<00:04:50.159> for<00:04:50.819> example<00:04:51.150> the

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
you know subway surf on for example the

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.999 
you know subway surf on for example the
iPhone<00:04:51.569> is<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:51.780> lot<00:04:52.229> different<00:04:52.650> when<00:04:52.860> you're

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
iPhone is a lot different when you're

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.860 
iPhone is a lot different when you're
playing<00:04:53.189> it<00:04:53.430> you<00:04:53.879> know<00:04:54.000> it's<00:04:54.240> just<00:04:54.449> generally

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
playing it you know it's just generally

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.360 
playing it you know it's just generally
more<00:04:54.990> fun<00:04:55.229> on<00:04:55.259> the<00:04:55.379> iPad<00:04:55.710> I<00:04:55.740> believe<00:04:56.009> that's

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
more fun on the iPad I believe that's

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.510 
more fun on the iPad I believe that's
how<00:04:56.460> I<00:04:56.940> see<00:04:57.270> it<00:04:57.300> anyway<00:04:57.659> for<00:04:58.370> example<00:04:59.370> here's

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
how I see it anyway for example here's

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.850 
how I see it anyway for example here's
subway<00:04:59.849> surfers<00:05:00.330> on<00:05:00.599> the<00:05:00.930> iPhone<00:05:01.800> 4s<00:05:02.569> you<00:05:03.569> know

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
subway surfers on the iPhone 4s you know

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.619 
subway surfers on the iPhone 4s you know
obviously<00:05:04.860> it's<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.520> lot<00:05:05.610> smaller<00:05:05.940> I<00:05:06.240> mean<00:05:06.539> it

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:06.629 
obviously it's a lot smaller I mean it

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:08.059 
obviously it's a lot smaller I mean it
depends<00:05:06.870> how<00:05:07.020> you<00:05:07.080> like<00:05:07.199> playing<00:05:07.469> I<00:05:07.650> mean<00:05:07.800> I've

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
depends how you like playing I mean I've

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:09.529 
depends how you like playing I mean I've
been<00:05:08.219> playing<00:05:08.430> this<00:05:08.580> on<00:05:08.699> the<00:05:08.789> iPhone<00:05:09.090> for<00:05:09.389> us

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
been playing this on the iPhone for us

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.409 
been playing this on the iPhone for us
I'd<00:05:09.750> say<00:05:09.780> more<00:05:10.319> than<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.639> iPad<00:05:11.819> that's<00:05:12.270> only

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
I'd say more than the iPad that's only

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.450 
I'd say more than the iPad that's only
because<00:05:12.569> I<00:05:13.110> have<00:05:13.379> my<00:05:13.530> phone<00:05:13.800> on<00:05:14.039> me<00:05:14.250> all<00:05:14.430> the

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
because I have my phone on me all the

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.209 
because I have my phone on me all the
time<00:05:14.610> you<00:05:15.000> can<00:05:15.960> see<00:05:16.169> it's<00:05:16.469> a<00:05:16.560> lot<00:05:16.710> smaller<00:05:16.949> but

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:17.219 
time you can see it's a lot smaller but

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:19.879 
time you can see it's a lot smaller but
it<00:05:17.610> still<00:05:17.849> is<00:05:17.969> fun<00:05:18.150> I<00:05:18.629> do<00:05:19.259> I<00:05:19.379> don't<00:05:19.590> know<00:05:19.710> why<00:05:19.860> I

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
it still is fun I do I don't know why I

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.159 
it still is fun I do I don't know why I
do<00:05:20.190> really<00:05:20.490> like<00:05:20.729> subway<00:05:21.150> surfers<00:05:21.539> it's<00:05:22.139> a

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
do really like subway surfers it's a

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.830 
do really like subway surfers it's a
great<00:05:22.319> game<00:05:22.439> to<00:05:22.620> play<00:05:22.680> and<00:05:23.240> I<00:05:24.240> think<00:05:24.599> it's<00:05:24.719> just

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
great game to play and I think it's just

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.450 
great game to play and I think it's just
because<00:05:24.930> it's<00:05:25.080> addictive<00:05:25.919> and<00:05:26.099> purely

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
because it's addictive and purely

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.369 
because it's addictive and purely
because<00:05:26.849> you<00:05:26.939> can<00:05:27.090> you<00:05:27.599> can<00:05:27.719> upgrade<00:05:27.930> things

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:28.379 
because you can you can upgrade things

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:31.399 
because you can you can upgrade things
etc<00:05:28.979> like<00:05:29.099> that<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:29.430> it<00:05:30.389> can't<00:05:30.840> be<00:05:30.930> quite

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
etc like that and it can't be quite

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.129 
etc like that and it can't be quite
quite<00:05:31.919> fun
