00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.570 

and<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.900> thought<00:02:39.020> like<00:02:39.170> these<00:02:39.380> hands<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:40.040> pigs

and I thought like these hands the pigs

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.960 
and I thought like these hands the pigs
are<00:02:40.820> really<00:02:41.270> tricky<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.900> use<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:43.670> let's<00:02:43.790> leave

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
are really tricky to use so let's leave

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.580 
are really tricky to use so let's leave
that<00:02:44.030> on<00:02:44.270> there<00:02:44.390> for<00:02:44.450> now<00:02:46.720> yeah<00:02:47.720> it's<00:02:48.320> like<00:02:48.470> I

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
that on there for now yeah it's like I

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.990 
that on there for now yeah it's like I
said<00:02:48.740> earlier<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.160> get<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.610> really<00:02:49.820> nice

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
said earlier you get that really nice

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.190 
said earlier you get that really nice
space<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.910> get<00:02:53.030> three<00:02:53.300> of<00:02:53.330> these<00:02:53.480> as<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:53.990> can

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
space you get three of these as you can

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.810 
space you get three of these as you can
see<00:02:54.290> they<00:02:54.440> have<00:02:54.560> little<00:02:54.890> cracks<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.490> them<00:02:55.610> a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
see they have little cracks in them a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.700 
see they have little cracks in them a
bunch<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:56.750> holes<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.080> you<00:02:57.140> could<00:02:57.320> put<00:02:57.500> the

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
bunch of holes so you could put the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.400 
bunch of holes so you could put the
stands<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.570> whatnot<00:02:59.570> every<00:02:59.870> anywhere<00:03:00.260> you

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
stands and whatnot every anywhere you

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.790 
stands and whatnot every anywhere you
want<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:02.420> also<00:03:02.570> comes<00:03:02.810> with<00:03:02.870> two<00:03:03.170> types<00:03:03.740> of<00:03:05.800> of

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
want it also comes with two types of of

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.270 
want it also comes with two types of of
the<00:03:07.190> actual<00:03:08.180> stands<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:08.960> mean<00:03:09.950> this<00:03:10.040> is<00:03:10.190> the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
the actual stands I mean this is the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.630 
the actual stands I mean this is the
base<00:03:10.430> rate<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.200> stands<00:03:12.470> itself<00:03:12.920> with

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
base rate and the stands itself with

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.080 
base rate and the stands itself with
Naxals<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:15.290> get<00:03:15.410> three<00:03:15.710> short<00:03:15.980> ones<00:03:19.090> three

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
Naxals so you get three short ones three

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.960 
Naxals so you get three short ones three
longer<00:03:20.660> ones<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:25.130> also<00:03:25.250> get<00:03:25.550> a<00:03:25.580> set<00:03:25.940> of

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
longer ones and you also get a set of

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.330 
longer ones and you also get a set of
three<00:03:26.270> of<00:03:26.420> these<00:03:26.570> larger<00:03:27.110> connector<00:03:27.890> hooks

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.290 

the<00:03:31.340> smaller<00:03:31.670> ones<00:03:33.910> see<00:03:34.910> these<00:03:35.060> side-by-side

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
the smaller ones see these side-by-side

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:44.650 
the smaller ones see these side-by-side
you<00:03:39.730> also<00:03:40.730> get<00:03:42.610> three<00:03:43.610> sets<00:03:43.940> of<00:03:44.120> these<00:03:44.270> effect

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
you also get three sets of these effect

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.610 
you also get three sets of these effect
parts<00:03:44.930> for<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.200> feet

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
parts for the feet

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.280 
parts for the feet
they<00:03:46.459> have<00:03:46.610> pigs<00:03:46.910> in<00:03:47.120> them<00:03:47.239> so<00:03:47.390> you<00:03:47.480> just<00:03:47.600> could

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
they have pigs in them so you just could

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.970 
they have pigs in them so you just could
pick<00:03:48.470> them<00:03:48.560> anywhere<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:48.980> want<00:03:49.130> in<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.310> base

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
pick them anywhere you want in the base

00:03:50.980 --> 00:04:04.260 
pick them anywhere you want in the base
right<00:03:51.980> there<00:03:57.220> yes<00:03:58.220> we'll<00:03:58.400> get<00:03:59.200> some<00:04:00.200> extenders

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.180 

so<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:04.990> say<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:05.290> just<00:04:05.380> need<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.680> little<00:04:05.980> bit

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
so you say you just need a little bit

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.680 
so you say you just need a little bit
more<00:04:06.400> length<00:04:06.880> I'll<00:04:07.090> stay<00:04:07.240> already<00:04:07.420> have<00:04:07.540> one

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
more length I'll stay already have one

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.420 
more length I'll stay already have one
on<00:04:07.810> there<00:04:10.020> so<00:04:11.020> you<00:04:11.170> just<00:04:11.380> put<00:04:11.590> it<00:04:11.680> on<00:04:11.770> like<00:04:11.830> so

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.580 

if<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:15.580> want<00:04:15.820> fit<00:04:16.239> that's<00:04:16.989> not<00:04:17.230> gonna<00:04:17.350> do<00:04:17.500> the

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
if you want fit that's not gonna do the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.680 
if you want fit that's not gonna do the
trick<00:04:18.390> they<00:04:19.390> have<00:04:19.540> an<00:04:19.690> even<00:04:19.930> longer<00:04:20.230> extender

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.460 

BAM<00:04:25.690> there<00:04:26.020> you<00:04:26.140> go

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
BAM there you go

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.150 
BAM there you go
look<00:04:26.650> at<00:04:26.740> all<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:27.270> it's<00:04:28.270> huge<00:04:29.130> compared<00:04:30.130> to

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
look at all that it's huge compared to

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:37.340 
look at all that it's huge compared to
the<00:04:30.250> figure

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.530 

I<00:04:38.840> also<00:04:39.840> get<00:04:40.110> four<00:04:41.000> connectors<00:04:42.000> so<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:42.360> could

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
I also get four connectors so you could

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.710 
I also get four connectors so you could
link<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.530> basis<00:04:43.890> together

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
link the basis together

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:57.500 
link the basis together
okay<00:04:45.720> that's<00:04:47.000> clamshell<00:04:51.530> these<00:04:53.690> cup<00:04:54.690> four<00:04:56.510> one

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
okay that's clamshell these cup four one

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.950 
okay that's clamshell these cup four one
two<00:04:57.750> three<00:04:58.080> four<00:04:58.380> five<00:04:58.560> six<00:04:58.890> different<00:04:59.960> spots

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
two three four five six different spots

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.960 
two three four five six different spots
these<00:05:01.290> little<00:05:01.590> holes<00:05:01.830> are<00:05:02.010> there<00:05:02.160> so<00:05:02.850> you

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
these little holes are there so you

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.260 
these little holes are there so you
pretty<00:05:03.150> much<00:05:03.270> just<00:05:03.360> peg<00:05:03.720> it<00:05:03.870> in<00:05:03.990> like<00:05:04.140> so<00:05:04.170> and

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
pretty much just peg it in like so and

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:13.100 
pretty much just peg it in like so and
you<00:05:06.270> do<00:05:06.360> on<00:05:06.480> either<00:05:06.630> side<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:08.180> fit<00:05:11.750> and<00:05:12.750> you

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
you do on either side and fit and you

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.150 
you do on either side and fit and you
also<00:05:13.260> get<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:15.530> these<00:05:16.530> little<00:05:16.710> cardboard

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
also get the these little cardboard

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.970 
also get the these little cardboard
clips<00:05:17.640> so<00:05:18.630> if<00:05:18.720> they<00:05:18.810> have<00:05:18.900> like<00:05:19.080> fairly<00:05:19.650> thick

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
clips so if they have like fairly thick

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.730 
clips so if they have like fairly thick
paper<00:05:20.900> like<00:05:21.900> this<00:05:23.060> cardboard<00:05:24.170> it<00:05:25.170> has<00:05:25.290> a<00:05:25.320> slit

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
paper like this cardboard it has a slit

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.630 
paper like this cardboard it has a slit
in<00:05:25.890> the<00:05:25.920> top<00:05:26.040> all<00:05:26.700> I<00:05:26.790> have<00:05:26.910> to<00:05:27.000> do<00:05:27.120> is<00:05:27.300> just<00:05:28.640> plug

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
in the top all I have to do is just plug

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.610 
in the top all I have to do is just plug
it<00:05:29.790> in<00:05:29.880> like<00:05:30.000> that<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.210> you<00:05:31.200> can<00:05:31.350> print<00:05:31.560> your

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
it in like that and you can print your

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.170 
it in like that and you can print your
own<00:05:31.680> at<00:05:31.890> home<00:05:31.920> like<00:05:32.640> I<00:05:32.730> said<00:05:32.880> if<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.060> have<00:05:33.150> the

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
own at home like I said if you have the

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.100 
own at home like I said if you have the
right<00:05:33.450> kind<00:05:33.660> of<00:05:33.720> a<00:05:34.070> paper<00:05:35.070> or<00:05:35.310> cardstock<00:05:36.110> and

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
right kind of a paper or cardstock and

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.690 
right kind of a paper or cardstock and
this<00:05:37.470> just<00:05:37.740> plugs<00:05:37.950> right<00:05:38.280> into<00:05:38.490> there<00:05:40.580> to<00:05:41.580> the

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
this just plugs right into there to the

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:51.560 
this just plugs right into there to the
base<00:05:42.020> like<00:05:43.020> so<00:05:44.750> that's<00:05:45.750> simple<00:05:46.080> enough<00:05:50.570> pretty

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
base like so that's simple enough pretty

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.880 
base like so that's simple enough pretty
much<00:05:51.810> it<00:05:52.490> like<00:05:53.490> I<00:05:53.610> said<00:05:53.760> you<00:05:53.940> get<00:05:54.650> six<00:05:55.650> of<00:05:55.770> these

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
much it like I said you get six of these

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:02.060 
much it like I said you get six of these
for<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.280> feet<00:05:57.890> three<00:05:58.890> short<00:06:00.650> you<00:06:01.650> know<00:06:01.770> the

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
for the feet three short you know the

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.750 
for the feet three short you know the
stands

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
I think it's well worth the money you

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.029 
I think it's well worth the money you
get<00:06:35.069> a<00:06:35.130> whole<00:06:35.400> lot<00:06:35.580> of<00:06:35.759> accessories<00:06:36.330> for<00:06:36.509> this

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
here around it so I can't really grasp

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.059 
here around it so I can't really grasp
it<00:06:58.169> get<00:06:58.289> the<00:06:58.410> kitten<00:06:58.650> or<00:06:58.740> anything

00:06:59.059 --> 00:06:59.069 
it get the kitten or anything

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:02.089 
it get the kitten or anything
there<00:06:59.550> you<00:06:59.639> go<00:07:00.410> there<00:07:01.410> you<00:07:01.500> go<00:07:01.590> the<00:07:01.650> stage<00:07:01.889> act

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:02.099 
there you go there you go the stage act

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:16.870 
there you go there you go the stage act
before<00:07:02.630> compared<00:07:03.630> to<00:07:03.720> this<00:07:04.009> so<00:07:05.009> a<00:07:05.039> lot<00:07:05.220> bigger

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.839 

things<00:07:17.880> I<00:07:18.949> think<00:07:19.949> they<00:07:20.190> should<00:07:20.370> be<00:07:20.400> identical

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:20.849 
things I think they should be identical

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:22.930 
things I think they should be identical
this<00:07:21.090> should<00:07:21.210> be<00:07:21.330> the<00:07:21.479> exact<00:07:21.690> same<00:07:21.870> one<00:07:22.080> yeah

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:22.940 
this should be the exact same one yeah

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.010 
this should be the exact same one yeah
there's<00:07:23.940> no<00:07:24.030> difference<00:07:24.360> there<00:07:24.509> that<00:07:24.720> this<00:07:24.840> is

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
there's no difference there that this is

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.330 
there's no difference there that this is
the<00:07:25.229> exact<00:07:25.590> same<00:07:25.710> one<00:07:25.830> you<00:07:25.949> get<00:07:26.039> with<00:07:26.190> the

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 
the exact same one you get with the

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.540 
the exact same one you get with the
normal<00:07:26.639> stage<00:07:26.820> acts<00:07:27.889> so<00:07:28.889> all<00:07:29.039> the<00:07:29.190> parts<00:07:29.460> are

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.550 
normal stage acts so all the parts are

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.189 
normal stage acts so all the parts are
interchangeable<00:07:29.699> so<00:07:30.360> if<00:07:30.449> you<00:07:30.539> have<00:07:30.659> some

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 
interchangeable so if you have some

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:34.100 
interchangeable so if you have some
normal<00:07:31.710> stage<00:07:32.069> acts<00:07:32.280> and<00:07:32.490> you<00:07:32.550> don't<00:07:32.960> need<00:07:33.960> to

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110 
normal stage acts and you don't need to

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.809 
normal stage acts and you don't need to
use<00:07:34.259> all<00:07:34.440> the<00:07:34.620> hooks<00:07:34.860> and<00:07:35.280> you<00:07:35.430> need<00:07:35.550> a<00:07:35.580> bigger

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 
use all the hooks and you need a bigger

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:38.180 
use all the hooks and you need a bigger
book<00:07:36.259> you<00:07:37.259> could<00:07:37.380> always<00:07:37.530> swap<00:07:37.889> it<00:07:38.039> out<00:07:38.130> with

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:38.190 
book you could always swap it out with

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:46.790 
book you could always swap it out with
the<00:07:38.520> normal<00:07:38.940> ones<00:07:44.000> like<00:07:45.000> so

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800
