which<00:03:56.180> is<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.630> MP<00:03:57.350> so<00:03:57.890> you<00:03:57.980> can<00:03:58.130> interchange

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
which is the MP so you can interchange

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.210 
which is the MP so you can interchange
are<00:03:58.670> more<00:03:58.850> with<00:03:58.940> these<00:03:59.060> two<00:03:59.299> and<00:03:59.600> it'll<00:03:59.870> match

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
are more with these two and it'll match
