00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.590
 very good to all I am fury we are in 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.290
 call of duty advanced warfare and we're going to 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.119
 see what the zombie mode at least what 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.460
 little that we can see in this way 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.560
 zombies so you do not know we have the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.300
 survival module that as you see 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.010
 we have four level 1 maps then 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.350
 four maps of level 2 4 maps of 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.880
 level 3 and finally the level 4 that 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.309
 is riot not that is where the 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.470
 zombies to advance to the level 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.360
 2 we have to do 50 rounds of level 1 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.790
 to do the level 3 we have to 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.650
 do 75 level 2 rounds and for 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.510
 unlock level 4 we have to do 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.280
 100 rounds of level 3 these rounds do not 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.159
 matter that they are all followed are 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.070
 cumulative that is we can do 10 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.659
 15 20 rounds in level 1 if they will go 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.000
 adding up to reach 50 rounds 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.640
 to be able to play level 2 and so on 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.519
 until you reach levels 4, which is the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.320
 that you are watching in the background to be able 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.360
 see in zombie mode not that for me it's 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.799
 as a say with a small prequel 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.049
 not what this zombies mode will be like 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.430
 because seen it very very scarce but 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.439
 well at least I liked it a lot 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.570
 now you will see it in the gameplay that 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.580
 you have background the rounds are happening 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.810
 like all of us usually for whoever 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.119
 seen or played 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.979
 to survival mode we start from the 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.320
 round 1 and we have to go killing 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.990
 soldiers and killing the drones and 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.539
 picking up the sheets and moving forward 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.409
 different rounds and improve our 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.539
 exo is one exoskeleton and weapons 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.610
 once we have completed round 10 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.939
 what is this round that comes in two 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.600
 embolias quite eight we will see what 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.600
 going to see below 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.740
 as a team a report of your state 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.740
 report 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.659
 allied forces here videos someone me 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.269
 receives 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.679
 there is someone there to the awlaki of on me 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.350
 they receive 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.700
 yes 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.950
 Y 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.950
 hello again I thought there were 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.319
 lost arsenals not available sexes 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.300
 deactivated the detonation pm must of 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.030
 have it without using the DNA pump 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.930
 I should have finished with you 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.269
 directed only to hostile forces but 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.310
 and after this little cinematic this is 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.989
 what we are going to have to do as you see 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.000
 we have just started with a 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.469
 gun have taken away the power of the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.719
 exoskeleton all the weapons that 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.760
 we had unlocked and we have to go 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.769
 quickly to search the ground 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.109
 any weapon that we have available 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.079
 to be able to defend ourselves against these zombies 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:52.139
 that as you see mann quite fast is 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.400
 very simple the subject is not very simple 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.109
 of this from the zombies because 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.060
 I have simply followed the same 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.469
 strategy that I did with for example in 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.239
 black ops on court 2 not on the 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.639
 terna ball is quite simple in a 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.780
 quite wide area and simply 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.430
 I was doing ball so 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.349
 accumulate them all to see how many 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.409
 zombies we can have on screen the 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.930
 time that by the way is a ball not very 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.849
 large and as we go eliminating 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.069
 these zombies will go out more but 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.439
 nothing, I will not tell you a couple of minutes 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.599
 as long as we have finished 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.879
 to eliminate them almost everyone will come out 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.870
 a message on the screen that we have to 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.209
 go to the area 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.610
 to the area to see evacuate and already 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.560
 we'll be done and completed in the 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.659
 sea ​​map in which we will have a kinematics 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.180
 pretty cool indeed that he too 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.400
 I would leave it until the end of the video and 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.860
 little more to say this is the mode 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.260
 zombie do enough rounds to be able 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.700
 get here and I wanted to teach and 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.400
 share with all of you you know what 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.940
 it seems to you and I'm waiting for you to take out 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.680
 more zombies I do not know if they will add it and 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.420
 soon new ones of excess as 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.879
 after what they do but from 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.190
 I liked it a lot and I'm going to 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.560
 waiting for more zombies to be taken out 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.329
 in call of duty since that has been all 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.560
 I leave the gameplay in the background I hope that you 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.970
 have liked and see you in the next 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.970
 video and until next time 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.799
 or of attraction to the prison yard of 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.799
 hurry 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.919
 quick extraction equipment in 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.840
 with all my bites and things of 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.680

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.289
 you are watching this 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.289
 to 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.840
 that's how knights fight for something 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.840
 we hire
