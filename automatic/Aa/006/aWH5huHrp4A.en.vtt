these days on people that are just
getting<00:00:33.930> into<00:00:34.050> barefoot<00:00:34.500> running<00:00:34.910> because

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
getting into barefoot running because

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.150 
getting into barefoot running because
they're<00:00:36.380> accentuating<00:00:37.380> different<00:00:37.710> types<00:00:37.920> of

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
they're accentuating different types of

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.459 
they're accentuating different types of
foot<00:00:38.430> strike<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:39.180> little<00:00:39.780> too<00:00:39.930> early<00:00:39.960> or<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
foot strike a little too early or a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.139 
foot strike a little too early or a
little<00:00:40.680> too<00:00:40.829> much<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.280> some<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.059> those

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
little too much and some of those

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.700 
little too much and some of those
conditions<00:00:42.629> are<00:00:42.780> very<00:00:42.960> difficult<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.469> treat

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
conditions are very difficult to treat

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.830 
conditions are very difficult to treat
so<00:00:44.100> we'd<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.940> help<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.300> avoid<00:00:45.539> those

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
so we'd like to help you to avoid those

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.110 
so we'd like to help you to avoid those
so<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:47.250> first<00:00:47.460> thing<00:00:47.640> I'm<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.059> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
so the first thing I'm going to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.450 
so the first thing I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:50.690> heel<00:00:51.690> strike<00:00:52.460> rollover

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
demonstrate is the heel strike rollover

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.189 
demonstrate is the heel strike rollover
gait<00:00:53.640> that's<00:00:53.879> typical<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.420> all<00:00:54.570> walking<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
gait that's typical to all walking and

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.529 
gait that's typical to all walking and
running<00:00:55.289> strides<00:00:55.789> more<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.969> flat<00:00:57.239> foot

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
running strides more of a flat foot

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.450 
running strides more of a flat foot
strike<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.260> will<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.680> then<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.980> forefoot

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
strike if you will and then the forefoot

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.540 
strike if you will and then the forefoot
strike<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.020> see<00:01:01.430> accentuated<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
strike that you see accentuated and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.490 
strike that you see accentuated and
talked<00:01:02.910> about<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.420> much<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.809> barefoot<00:01:04.350> running

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
talked about so much in barefoot running

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.550 
talked about so much in barefoot running
literature<00:01:04.979> now<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.700> we'll<00:01:06.479> go<00:01:06.600> ahead<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.840> do

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
literature now so we'll go ahead and do

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.219 
literature now so we'll go ahead and do
that<00:01:07.590> now<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> first<00:01:09.450> stride<00:01:09.990> will

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
that now so the first stride will

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.289 
that now so the first stride will
demonstrate<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.280> first<00:01:11.520> strike<00:01:12.090> will

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
demonstrate and first strike will

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.780 
demonstrate and first strike will
demonstrate<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.549> traditional<00:01:14.549> or

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
demonstrate is the traditional or

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.560 
demonstrate is the traditional or
typical<00:01:15.229> heel<00:01:16.229> strike<00:01:16.820> roll<00:01:17.820> over<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.299> push

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
typical heel strike roll over and push

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.420 
typical heel strike roll over and push
off<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.810> people<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:19.950> they<00:01:20.070> are<00:01:20.159> walking

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
off that people do when they are walking

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.749 
off that people do when they are walking
indoor<00:01:20.970> running<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.840> typical<00:01:22.290> shoes<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.830> when

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
indoor running in typical shoes so when

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.050 
indoor running in typical shoes so when
we<00:01:23.880> when<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.150> take<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.920> step<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.310> will<00:01:26.430> land<00:01:26.700> on

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
we when we take a step we will land on

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.929 
we when we take a step we will land on
the<00:01:27.119> outer<00:01:27.540> edge<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.979> heel<00:01:29.750> come<00:01:30.750> down

flatten the foot out roll over the
stride<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:37.020> push<00:01:37.470> off<00:01:37.820> with<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.030> great

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
stride and then push off with that great

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.469 
stride and then push off with that great
toe<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.079> that's<00:01:40.829> why<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.340> there<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.880> then

move<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.140> next<00:01:43.290> stride<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.130> heel

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
move on to the next stride so heel

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.469 
move on to the next stride so heel

swing through with the next foot and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.120 
swing through with the next foot and
this<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.220> your<00:01:53.520> typical<00:01:54.439> running<00:01:55.439> stride<00:01:55.829> I'm

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
this is your typical running stride I'm

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.550 
this is your typical running stride I'm
I'm<00:01:57.770> exaggerating<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.369> little<00:01:59.549> bit<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.840> if

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
I'm exaggerating it a little bit so if

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.410 
I'm exaggerating it a little bit so if
this<00:02:01.799> were<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.070> person<00:02:02.579> running<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:03.030> barefoot

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
this were the person running in barefoot

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.560 
this were the person running in barefoot
running<00:02:03.600> shoes<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.590> flat<00:02:05.219> surface<00:02:05.570> it

stride you would not see all the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.200 
stride you would not see all the

next the next type of strike you'll

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.590 
next the next type of strike you'll
you'll<00:02:24.980> use<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.010> barefoot<00:02:26.970> running<00:02:27.180> will<00:02:27.450> be

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
you'll use on barefoot running will be

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.420 
you'll use on barefoot running will be
the<00:02:27.870> more<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.440> flat<00:02:28.740> foot<00:02:29.040> strike

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
the more of a flat foot strike

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.300 
the more of a flat foot strike
especially<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.720> trails<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.260> flat<00:02:31.740> surfaces

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
especially on trails and flat surfaces

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.730 
especially on trails and flat surfaces
where<00:02:32.580> you're<00:02:33.360> really<00:02:33.630> not<00:02:33.990> striking<00:02:34.500> with

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
where you're really not striking with

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.830 
where you're really not striking with
the<00:02:34.890> heel<00:02:35.130> anymore<00:02:35.580> you're<00:02:35.790> really<00:02:36.150> landing

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
the heel anymore you're really landing

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.130 
the heel anymore you're really landing
almost<00:02:37.170> flat<00:02:37.890> with<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.280> foot<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.760> then<00:02:39.750> going

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
almost flat with the foot and then going

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.970 
almost flat with the foot and then going
to<00:02:40.170> push<00:02:40.560> off<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:43.320> would<00:02:43.500> with<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
to push off as you would with the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.479 
to push off as you would with the
traditional<00:02:44.810> heel<00:02:45.810> strike<00:02:46.370> rollover<00:02:47.370> and

traditional heel strike rollover and

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.150 
traditional heel strike rollover and
push<00:02:47.640> off<00:02:47.880> stride<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.680> what<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:49.950> would<00:02:50.130> look

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
push off stride so what that would look

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.690 
push off stride so what that would look
like<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:51.209> trail<00:02:52.080> or<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.320> flat<00:02:52.590> surface<00:02:52.860> would

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
like on a trail or a flat surface would

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.590 
like on a trail or a flat surface would
be<00:02:53.760> more<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:55.220> almost<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.400> slapping<00:02:56.910> dropping

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
be more of a almost a slapping dropping

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.260 
be more of a almost a slapping dropping
stride<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.800> that's<00:02:59.520> going<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.790> be<00:02:59.910> used<00:03:00.090> on

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
stride and that's going to be used on

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.910 
stride and that's going to be used on
certain<00:03:00.630> surfaces<00:03:00.900> which<00:03:01.380> we'll<00:03:01.590> talk<00:03:01.770> about

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
certain surfaces which we'll talk about

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.370 
certain surfaces which we'll talk about
a<00:03:02.040> little<00:03:02.190> later<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:04.440> last<00:03:05.160> type<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:06.380> running

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
a little later the last type of running

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.060 
a little later the last type of running
and<00:03:07.880> strike<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.450> last<00:03:09.630> type<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:10.020> strike<00:03:10.320> would

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
and strike the last type of strike would

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.860 
and strike the last type of strike would
be<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.310> forefoot<00:03:11.670> strike<00:03:11.820> where<00:03:12.720> we're

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
be the forefoot strike where we're

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.160 
be the forefoot strike where we're
landing<00:03:13.170> primarily<00:03:13.800> over<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.480> metatarsal

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
landing primarily over the metatarsal

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.039 
landing primarily over the metatarsal
heads<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.680> feet<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.660> pushing<00:03:18.660> off<00:03:18.780> from

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
heads of the feet and pushing off from

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.550 
heads of the feet and pushing off from
there<00:03:19.290> without<00:03:20.040> really<00:03:21.019> putting<00:03:22.019> too<00:03:22.410> much

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
there without really putting too much

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.680 
there without really putting too much
weight<00:03:22.860> on<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.940> hind<00:03:24.450> foot<00:03:24.780> or<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.049> heel<00:03:25.410> and

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
weight on the hind foot or the heel and

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.850 
weight on the hind foot or the heel and
so<00:03:28.580> that's<00:03:29.580> an<00:03:29.730> important<00:03:30.209> strike<00:03:30.510> in

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
so that's an important strike in

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
so that's an important strike in
barefoot<00:03:31.860> running<00:03:32.070> but<00:03:32.310> it's<00:03:32.459> also<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.790> one

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
barefoot running but it's also the one

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.400 
barefoot running but it's also the one
that's<00:03:33.090> causing<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.510> lot<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.720> injury<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.230> lot

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
that's causing a lot of injury and a lot

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.660 
that's causing a lot of injury and a lot
of<00:03:35.209> achilles<00:03:36.209> tendonitis<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:37.019> metatarsalgia

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
of achilles tendonitis in metatarsalgia

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.330 
of achilles tendonitis in metatarsalgia
so<00:03:38.670> what<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.269> one<00:03:39.450> looks<00:03:39.480> like<00:03:39.750> in<00:03:40.340> in

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
so what this one looks like in in

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.220 
so what this one looks like in in
running<00:03:41.730> gait<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.060> just<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.540> very<00:03:42.750> springy

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
running gait is just a very springy

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.490 
running gait is just a very springy
forward<00:03:44.209> moving<00:03:45.209> stride<00:03:46.100> which<00:03:47.120> helps<00:03:48.120> to

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
forward moving stride which helps to

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.550 
forward moving stride which helps to
drive<00:03:49.500> us<00:03:49.680> forward<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.280> help<00:03:50.790> us<00:03:50.880> climb<00:03:51.150> Hills

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
drive us forward and help us climb Hills

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.140 
drive us forward and help us climb Hills
it's<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.709> great<00:03:53.209> type<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.530> strike<00:03:55.530> very<00:03:56.489> helpful

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
it's a great type of strike very helpful

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.240 
it's a great type of strike very helpful
on<00:03:57.209> those<00:03:57.390> trails<00:03:57.690> but<00:03:58.110> it's<00:03:58.230> also<00:03:58.410> one<00:03:58.829> that

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
on those trails but it's also one that

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.250 
on those trails but it's also one that
can<00:03:59.430> be<00:03:59.519> dangerous<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.120> us<00:04:00.239> if<00:04:00.420> we<00:04:00.480> do<00:04:00.660> too<00:04:00.870> bit

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
can be dangerous to us if we do too bit

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.600 
can be dangerous to us if we do too bit
too<00:04:01.470> fast<00:04:01.709> too<00:04:02.070> soon

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
too fast too soon

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:15.230 
too fast too soon
