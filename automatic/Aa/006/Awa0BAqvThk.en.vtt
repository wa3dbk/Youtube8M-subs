00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.610
 left on a tree in a box 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.110
 shed or even glass container are often s 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.640

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.960

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.960

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:36.020
 hello john moments from though i am 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.580
 I found a box with kittens 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.180
 I think they are still very small 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.460
 found yes you often experience this 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.910
 regularly unfortunately yes and not only with 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.360
 kittens but also with puppies bunnies 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.010

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.500
 kittens are already 5 to 6 months old 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.030
 fertile is so important for that 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.640
 let your cat from that age 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:11.000
 sterilize or neuter such 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.980

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.240
 is going to happen to kittens now but we 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.880
 they don't go to it anyway 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.890
 bring animal shelter and leave from there 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.300
