where<00:00:12.559> California<00:00:13.559> now<00:00:13.769> only<00:00:14.099> has<00:00:14.400> about<00:00:14.700> one

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
where California now only has about one

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.990 
where California now only has about one
year<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.599> water<00:00:15.960> left<00:00:16.609> and<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.699> put<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
year of water left and I put the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.910 
year of water left and I put the
question<00:00:18.210> what<00:00:18.570> will<00:00:18.690> happen<00:00:19.140> when<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.619> all

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
question what will happen when it all

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.109 
question what will happen when it all
runs<00:00:20.640> out<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.240> mean<00:00:21.390> will<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.689> mean<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:23.119> you

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
runs out I mean will this mean that you

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.330 
runs out I mean will this mean that you
know<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.420> populace<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.350> California<00:00:26.039> the

know the populace in California the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.269 
know the populace in California the
population<00:00:26.789> will<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.869> disperse<00:00:28.590> to

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
population will have to disperse to

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.910

other portions of the United States you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920 
other portions of the United States you
know<00:00:32.040> how<00:00:32.219> will<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.610> play<00:00:33.000> into<00:00:33.600> everything

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
know how will this play into everything

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.430 
know how will this play into everything
