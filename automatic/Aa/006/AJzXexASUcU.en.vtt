alright so what I'm going to do is start
working<00:00:04.710> with<00:00:04.920> this<00:00:05.339> shape<00:00:05.609> right<00:00:05.910> here<00:00:05.960> for<00:00:06.960> a

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
working with this shape right here for a

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.259 
working with this shape right here for a
while<00:00:07.400> and<00:00:08.400> just<00:00:08.550> kind<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:08.849> playing<00:00:09.090> around

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
while and just kind of playing around

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
showing you some stuff so I like this

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.600 
showing you some stuff so I like this
piece<00:00:11.639> what<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> want<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.870> do<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.259> now<00:00:13.769> take<00:00:14.099> it

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
piece what I want to do is now take it

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.970 
piece what I want to do is now take it
in<00:00:14.880> mirror<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.420> X<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.500> want<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.830> make<00:00:16.949> sure

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
in mirror in X so I want to make sure

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.939 
in mirror in X so I want to make sure
that<00:00:17.190> it's<00:00:17.609> Mirabal<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.420> X<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.930> what<00:00:19.770> that

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
that it's Mirabal in X and what that

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.509 
that it's Mirabal in X and what that
means<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.550> right<00:00:21.359> now<00:00:21.539> it's<00:00:22.160> Mirabal<00:00:23.160> an<00:00:23.310> ex

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
means is right now it's Mirabal an ex

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.150 
means is right now it's Mirabal an ex
but<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.210> X<00:00:24.449> my<00:00:25.109> right<00:00:25.320> hand<00:00:25.529> side<00:00:25.710> what<00:00:26.130> I

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
but this is X my right hand side what I

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.640 
but this is X my right hand side what I
want<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.670> rotate<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.779> around<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.500> I'm

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
want to do is rotate this around so I'm

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.140 
want to do is rotate this around so I'm
going<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.830> rotate<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.279> just<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.550> little<00:00:29.609> bit<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
going to rotate it just a little bit and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.810 
going to rotate it just a little bit and
then<00:00:30.210> type<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.289> number<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.619> 90<00:00:32.219> degrees<00:00:32.550> over

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
then type in a number of 90 degrees over

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.430 
then type in a number of 90 degrees over
here<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.590> that's<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.040> be<00:00:35.420> now<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.480> X<00:00:36.960> is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
here and that's going to be now the X is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.060 
here and that's going to be now the X is
on<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.280> side<00:00:38.520> okay<00:00:39.260> so<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.680> part<00:00:40.950> is

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
on this side okay so if a part is

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.310 
on this side okay so if a part is
Mirabal<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.820> X<00:00:43.460> that<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:44.850> more<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:46.079> you

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
Mirabal on X that that's more what you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.440 
Mirabal on X that that's more what you
need<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:47.070> when<00:00:47.550> you're<00:00:47.730> developing<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
need to do when you're developing a

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
need to do when you're developing a
character<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.379> look<00:00:49.559> at<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.800> thing<00:00:50.039> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
character and if I look at this thing it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.400 
character and if I look at this thing it
kind<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.610> looks<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.940> head<00:00:51.210> if<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.989> kind<00:00:52.289> of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
kind of looks like a head if you kind of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.500 
kind of looks like a head if you kind of
use<00:00:52.559> your<00:00:52.710> imagination<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.969> got<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.239> weird

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
use your imagination it's got this weird

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.000 
use your imagination it's got this weird
thing<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.750> off<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> top<00:00:55.350> maybe<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:55.829> some

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
thing going off the top maybe it's some

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.340 
thing going off the top maybe it's some
kind<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.309> robotic<00:00:56.969> alien<00:00:57.510> simba<00:00:57.899> night<00:00:58.079> or

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
kind of robotic alien simba night or

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.110 
kind of robotic alien simba night or
whatever<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.399> got<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.940> head

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
whatever but it's got the head

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.990 
whatever but it's got the head
properties<00:01:00.710> it's<00:01:01.710> got<00:01:01.980> terrible<00:01:02.460> topology

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
properties it's got terrible topology

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.420 
properties it's got terrible topology
for<00:01:03.329> something<00:01:03.750> I'll<00:01:04.379> sculpt<00:01:04.979> abul<00:01:05.189> that's

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
for something I'll sculpt abul that's

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.030 
for something I'll sculpt abul that's
for<00:01:05.610> sure<00:01:05.790> because<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.780> these<00:01:07.020> these<00:01:07.799> edge

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
for sure because of these these edge

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.240 
for sure because of these these edge
loops<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:09.320> but<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.100> when

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
loops that go in here but you know when

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.580 
loops that go in here but you know when
I<00:01:11.310> smooth<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.700> out<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.970> three<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.479> kind<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.380> can

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
I smooth it out in three I kind of can

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.520 
I smooth it out in three I kind of can
use<00:01:13.710> my<00:01:13.860> imagination<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.729> see<00:01:14.880> some<00:01:15.119> kind<00:01:15.330> of

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
use my imagination and see some kind of

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.249 
use my imagination and see some kind of
head<00:01:16.530> shape<00:01:17.180> I'm<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> model<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.140> all

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
head shape I'm not going to model it all

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.600 
head shape I'm not going to model it all
the<00:01:19.380> way<00:01:19.470> through<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.100> want<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.340> show<00:01:20.520> you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the way through but I want to show you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.710 
the way through but I want to show you
some<00:01:20.880> tricks<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.799> rotated<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.490> ok<00:01:23.970> so

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
some tricks here one I rotated it ok so

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.310 
some tricks here one I rotated it ok so
now<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.530> Mirabal<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.159> X<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:27.320> rotated

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
now it's not Mirabal in X it's rotated

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.730 
now it's not Mirabal in X it's rotated
and<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> has<00:01:28.860> some<00:01:29.340> history<00:01:30.090> behind<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.710> what<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and it has some history behind it what I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.010 
and it has some history behind it what I
would<00:01:31.890> need<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.880> after<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> rotate

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
would need to do now is after I rotate

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.170 
would need to do now is after I rotate
it<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.500> Mirabal<00:01:35.009> max<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.460> need<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:36.000> now

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
it and have it Mirabal max I need to now

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.639 
it and have it Mirabal max I need to now
ah<00:01:39.110> edit<00:01:40.110> mesh<00:01:40.320> delete<00:01:40.680> by<00:01:41.009> type<00:01:41.040> history<00:01:41.250> and

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
ah edit mesh delete by type history and

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.830 
ah edit mesh delete by type history and
then<00:01:43.649> modify<00:01:44.399> freeze<00:01:44.790> transformations<00:01:45.180> if

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
then modify freeze transformations if

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.530 
then modify freeze transformations if
you<00:01:45.930> look<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.409> night<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.369> 90<00:01:48.149> degrees

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
you look on the night on this 90 degrees

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.210 
you look on the night on this 90 degrees
over<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:48.869> what<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.920> freeze

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
over here what this freeze

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.050 
over here what this freeze
transformation<00:01:51.090> does<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.570> zeros<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:53.060> so

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
transformation does is zeros that out so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.609 
transformation does is zeros that out so
now<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.509> part<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:56.210> perfectly<00:01:57.210> Mirabal<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.840> X

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.020 

ok<00:02:01.619> now<00:02:01.890> what<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.130> want<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.369> do<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.640> show<00:02:03.000> you

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
ok now what I want to do is show you

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.530 
ok now what I want to do is show you
some<00:02:03.149> selection<00:02:04.020> tricks<00:02:04.409> along<00:02:05.250> with<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.820> so

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
some selection tricks along with that so

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.020 
some selection tricks along with that so
handle<00:02:07.380> two<00:02:07.560> things<00:02:07.799> here's<00:02:08.459> what<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> see<00:02:08.849> all

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
handle two things here's what I see all

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.530 
handle two things here's what I see all
the<00:02:09.149> time<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.539> see<00:02:09.750> face<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:11.209> students<00:02:12.209> go<00:02:12.360> in

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the time I see face and students go in

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.980 
the time I see face and students go in
here<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:12.870> start<00:02:13.319> highlighting

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
here and start highlighting

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.410 
here and start highlighting
these<00:02:14.110> faces<00:02:14.680> face<00:02:15.100> face<00:02:15.340> face<00:02:15.370> face<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:18.520> I

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
these faces face face face face and I

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.330 
these faces face face face face and I
even<00:02:19.720> catch<00:02:19.870> myself<00:02:20.110> doing<00:02:20.320> that<00:02:20.590> most<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.250> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
even catch myself doing that most of the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.880 
even catch myself doing that most of the
time<00:02:21.580> it's<00:02:22.480> all<00:02:22.690> what<00:02:23.080> i<00:02:23.110> need<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.410> do<00:02:23.650> at<00:02:23.800> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
time it's all what i need to do at the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.400 
time it's all what i need to do at the
time<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.400> modeling<00:02:24.970> but<00:02:25.870> here's<00:02:26.350> another

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
time of modeling but here's another

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.650 
time of modeling but here's another
alternative<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:28.450> let's<00:02:29.080> look<00:02:29.410> at<00:02:29.560> this<00:02:30.660> side

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
alternative so let's look at this side

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.650 
alternative so let's look at this side
view<00:02:32.020> f<00:02:32.700> here's<00:02:33.700> my<00:02:33.910> side<00:02:34.180> view<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.650> here's<00:02:35.650> my

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
view f here's my side view and here's my

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.710 
view f here's my side view and here's my
perspective<00:02:37.660> view<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.860> here's<00:02:39.790> an<00:02:40.060> edge<00:02:40.390> ring

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
perspective view so here's an edge ring

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.740 
perspective view so here's an edge ring
so<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.230> will<00:02:41.920> take<00:02:41.950> an<00:02:42.250> edge<00:02:42.400> hold<00:02:43.060> ctrl<00:02:43.510> and

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
so it will take an edge hold ctrl and

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.090 
so it will take an edge hold ctrl and
right-click<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:45.700> will<00:02:45.940> give<00:02:46.090> me<00:02:46.120> my

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
right-click this will give me my

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.430 
right-click this will give me my
selection<00:02:48.100> properties<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:49.750> i<00:02:49.930> go<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.110> edge

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
selection properties if i go to edge

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.980 
selection properties if i go to edge
ring<00:02:50.800> utilities<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.670> go<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.850> edge<00:02:52.240> ring<00:02:52.600> it

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
ring utilities and go to edge ring it

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.410 
ring utilities and go to edge ring it
highlights<00:02:53.860> all<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.340> edges<00:02:54.820> going<00:02:55.090> around

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
highlights all the edges going around

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.420 
highlights all the edges going around
that<00:02:55.540> ring<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.590> it's<00:02:56.740> kind<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:56.950> like<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.100> loop

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
that ring so it's kind of like a loop

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.820 
that ring so it's kind of like a loop
but<00:02:57.820> in<00:02:58.030> reverse<00:02:58.630> of<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.020> thought<00:02:59.260> it's<00:02:59.590> at

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
but in reverse of the thought it's at

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.880 
but in reverse of the thought it's at
how<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.670> loop<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.120> goes<00:03:01.300> around<00:03:01.540> it's<00:03:01.900> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
how a loop that goes around it's the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.700 
how a loop that goes around it's the
vertical<00:03:03.280> edges<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.700> go<00:03:03.880> around<00:03:04.440> then<00:03:05.440> if<00:03:05.590> I

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
vertical edges that go around then if I

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.560 
vertical edges that go around then if I
hope<00:03:05.920> control<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.610> right<00:03:06.790> click<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.270> can<00:03:07.450> go

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
hope control and right click I can go

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.260 
hope control and right click I can go
two<00:03:07.630> phases<00:03:08.080> go<00:03:08.710> two<00:03:08.770> phases<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:10.120> will

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
two phases go two phases that will

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.520 
two phases go two phases that will
highlight<00:03:10.450> all<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.750> faces<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.200> go<00:03:11.440> around

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
highlight all the faces that go around

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.590 
highlight all the faces that go around
now<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.130> only<00:03:12.400> bad<00:03:12.610> thing<00:03:12.640> about<00:03:12.850> this<00:03:13.240> I<00:03:13.420> got

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
now the only bad thing about this I got

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.390 
now the only bad thing about this I got
an<00:03:13.690> extra<00:03:14.080> step<00:03:14.290> now<00:03:14.500> because<00:03:14.860> I<00:03:14.950> had<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.220> show

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
an extra step now because I had to show

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.420 
an extra step now because I had to show
you<00:03:15.460> deselection<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:17.320> let's<00:03:17.920> go<00:03:18.100> into<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
you deselection so let's go into the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.340 
you deselection so let's go into the
other<00:03:18.700> view<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.180> look<00:03:19.870> at<00:03:20.020> what<00:03:20.140> these

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
other view and look at what these

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.780 
other view and look at what these
election<00:03:20.830> means<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:22.000> if<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.210> go<00:03:22.240> to<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:23.140> and

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
election means so if I go to this and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:33.600 
election means so if I go to this and
hold<00:03:24.790> ctrl<00:03:26.370> +<00:03:28.920> left<00:03:29.920> click<00:03:30.070> around<00:03:30.700> here<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:32.610> can

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
hold ctrl + left click around here I can

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.540 
hold ctrl + left click around here I can
now<00:03:33.760> use<00:03:34.090> this<00:03:34.450> lasso<00:03:34.930> tool<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.920> deselect

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
now use this lasso tool to deselect

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.370 
now use this lasso tool to deselect
everything<00:03:38.430> ok<00:03:39.430> so<00:03:39.490> there's<00:03:39.820> a<00:03:40.090> few<00:03:40.780> thousand

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
everything ok so there's a few thousand

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.110 
everything ok so there's a few thousand
ways<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.680> do<00:03:41.800> things<00:03:42.010> so<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:42.370> can<00:03:42.490> highlight

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
ways to do things so you can highlight

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.300 
ways to do things so you can highlight
faces<00:03:43.900> all<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.110> way<00:03:44.200> around<00:03:44.320> you<00:03:45.010> can<00:03:45.130> go<00:03:45.250> to

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
faces all the way around you can go to

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.920 
faces all the way around you can go to
edge<00:03:45.550> ring<00:03:45.850> around<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.540> be<00:03:46.720> select<00:03:47.170> them<00:03:47.380> but

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
edge ring around and be select them but

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.330 
edge ring around and be select them but
what's<00:03:49.930> really<00:03:50.110> nice<00:03:50.320> about<00:03:50.380> this<00:03:50.860> is<00:03:51.070> i'm

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
what's really nice about this is i'm

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.790 
what's really nice about this is i'm
using<00:03:51.700> parts<00:03:52.120> from<00:03:52.210> one<00:03:52.660> complex<00:03:53.260> structure

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
using parts from one complex structure

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.870 
using parts from one complex structure
and<00:03:54.180> going<00:03:55.180> in<00:03:55.300> here<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:55.840> using<00:03:56.230> them<00:03:56.440> as<00:03:56.880> a

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
and going in here and using them as a

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.000 
and going in here and using them as a
duplicate<00:04:00.690> because<00:04:01.690> now<00:04:01.900> when<00:04:02.230> i<00:04:02.260> take<00:04:02.800> this

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
duplicate because now when i take this

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.940 
duplicate because now when i take this
blue<00:04:03.280> arrow<00:04:03.550> I<00:04:04.590> have<00:04:05.590> this<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:08.500> i<00:04:08.530> made<00:04:08.800> another

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
blue arrow I have this so i made another

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.400 
blue arrow I have this so i made another
complex<00:04:09.580> piece<00:04:09.820> of<00:04:09.850> geometry<00:04:10.180> off<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:11.230> other

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
complex piece of geometry off the other

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.820 
complex piece of geometry off the other
complex<00:04:11.950> piece<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:13.120> if<00:04:13.240> i<00:04:13.360> take<00:04:14.200> that<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:14.800> go

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
complex piece and if i take that and go

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.650 
complex piece and if i take that and go
into<00:04:15.280> object<00:04:15.760> mode<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.150> extrude<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.080> i<00:04:18.660> can

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
into object mode and extrude it i can

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.230 
into object mode and extrude it i can
add<00:04:19.810> some<00:04:20.020> thickness<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:20.440> it

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
add some thickness to it

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.400 
add some thickness to it
nice<00:04:25.030> so<00:04:26.030> that's<00:04:26.360> that's<00:04:26.660> a<00:04:26.840> very<00:04:27.050> good<00:04:27.230> way<00:04:27.350> to

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
nice so that's that's a very good way to

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.790 
nice so that's that's a very good way to
do<00:04:27.650> that<00:04:28.840> another<00:04:29.840> thing<00:04:30.050> is<00:04:30.290> there's<00:04:30.620> no

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
do that another thing is there's no

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.380 
do that another thing is there's no
selection<00:04:31.130> tricks<00:04:31.550> in<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.760> book<00:04:32.000> that<00:04:32.240> i<00:04:32.270> know

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
selection tricks in the book that i know

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.350 
selection tricks in the book that i know
of<00:04:32.540> that<00:04:33.260> i<00:04:33.290> can<00:04:33.710> make<00:04:34.040> this<00:04:34.250> any<00:04:34.550> less<00:04:34.820> painful

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
of that i can make this any less painful

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.360 
of that i can make this any less painful
so<00:04:35.810> i'm<00:04:36.050> highlighting<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.650> faces<00:04:37.040> here

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
so i'm highlighting the faces here

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.030 
so i'm highlighting the faces here
there's<00:04:38.060> no<00:04:38.240> edge<00:04:38.450> ring<00:04:38.690> or<00:04:38.840> edge<00:04:38.990> loop<00:04:39.380> trick

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
there's no edge ring or edge loop trick

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.010 
there's no edge ring or edge loop trick
that<00:04:40.490> in<00:04:40.700> that<00:04:40.850> area<00:04:41.090> this<00:04:41.300> is<00:04:41.360> just<00:04:41.690> a<00:04:41.780> patch

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
that in that area this is just a patch

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.970 
that in that area this is just a patch
geometry<00:04:42.950> but<00:04:43.760> again<00:04:44.290> it's<00:04:45.290> really<00:04:45.560> nice<00:04:45.680> is

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
geometry but again it's really nice is

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:56.770 
geometry but again it's really nice is
that<00:04:46.150> duplicate<00:04:48.520> face<00:04:49.520> command<00:04:55.780> and

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
that duplicate face command and

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:04.210 
that duplicate face command and
duplicate<00:04:57.410> that<00:04:57.590> off<00:04:58.900> all<00:04:59.900> right<00:05:02.470> now<00:05:03.470> one

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
duplicate that off all right now one

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.620 
duplicate that off all right now one
last<00:05:04.430> thing<00:05:04.580> before<00:05:04.700> I<00:05:05.060> show<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.390> next

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
last thing before I show you the next

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.070 
last thing before I show you the next
little<00:05:06.470> part<00:05:07.400> what<00:05:08.000> I<00:05:08.030> want<00:05:08.270> to<00:05:08.360> do<00:05:08.510> is<00:05:08.750> take

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
little part what I want to do is take

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.210 
little part what I want to do is take
this<00:05:09.470> face<00:05:09.830> right<00:05:10.160> here<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:11.110> just<00:05:12.110> extrude<00:05:13.070> it

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
this face right here and just extrude it

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:23.470 
this face right here and just extrude it
in<00:05:18.400> just<00:05:19.400> like<00:05:19.490> that<00:05:21.820> if<00:05:22.820> I<00:05:22.940> go<00:05:23.090> 3<00:05:23.360> on<00:05:23.450> the

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
in just like that if I go 3 on the

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.450 
in just like that if I go 3 on the
keyboard<00:05:23.990> got<00:05:24.620> something<00:05:25.070> that<00:05:25.190> looks<00:05:25.370> like

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
keyboard got something that looks like

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.060 
keyboard got something that looks like
that<00:05:25.820> maybe<00:05:26.690> I<00:05:26.840> want<00:05:27.140> to<00:05:27.230> harden<00:05:27.620> that<00:05:27.800> piece

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
that maybe I want to harden that piece

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.550 
that maybe I want to harden that piece
up<00:05:28.310> in<00:05:28.490> that<00:05:28.580> area<00:05:28.640> so<00:05:29.150> I<00:05:29.180> edit<00:05:29.540> mesh<00:05:29.750> insert

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
up in that area so I edit mesh insert

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.110 
up in that area so I edit mesh insert
edge<00:05:30.740> loop<00:05:30.820> and<00:05:31.820> I<00:05:31.880> insert<00:05:32.240> an<00:05:32.360> edge<00:05:32.480> loop<00:05:32.690> here

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
edge loop and I insert an edge loop here

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:41.710 
edge loop and I insert an edge loop here
here<00:05:37.510> good<00:05:38.510> looks<00:05:39.440> a<00:05:39.560> little<00:05:39.770> bit<00:05:40.010> better<00:05:40.720> it

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
here good looks a little bit better it

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.690 
here good looks a little bit better it
cleans<00:05:42.110> up<00:05:42.290> the<00:05:42.440> geometry<00:05:43.070> in<00:05:43.190> that<00:05:43.310> area<00:05:45.700> okay

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
cleans up the geometry in that area okay

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.430 
cleans up the geometry in that area okay
the<00:05:46.880> reason<00:05:47.000> I<00:05:47.240> did<00:05:47.420> that<00:05:47.450> because<00:05:47.960> in<00:05:48.350> the

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
the reason I did that because in the

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.740 
the reason I did that because in the
next<00:05:48.710> video<00:05:48.980> what<00:05:49.790> if<00:05:49.940> i<00:05:50.090> want<00:05:50.330> to<00:05:50.390> put<00:05:50.600> the

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
next video what if i want to put the

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.380 
next video what if i want to put the
exact<00:05:51.110> same<00:05:51.320> I<00:05:51.500> on<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.800> other<00:05:51.980> side<00:05:52.610> and<00:05:52.850> what

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
exact same I on the other side and what

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.390 
exact same I on the other side and what
if<00:05:53.480> I<00:05:53.600> wanted<00:05:53.870> to<00:05:53.960> put<00:05:54.170> all<00:05:54.410> these<00:05:54.650> other<00:05:54.860> forms

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
if I wanted to put all these other forms

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.880 
if I wanted to put all these other forms
on<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.480> other<00:05:56.630> side<00:05:56.930> so<00:05:57.200> I'll<00:05:57.290> make<00:05:57.470> a<00:05:57.500> small

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
on the other side so I'll make a small

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.860 
on the other side so I'll make a small
change<00:05:57.920> on<00:05:58.430> this<00:05:58.610> thing<00:05:58.910> to<00:06:01.210> extrude<00:06:02.210> this

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
change on this thing to extrude this

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:11.460 
change on this thing to extrude this
face<00:06:03.200> out<00:06:06.370> this<00:06:07.370> face<00:06:07.670> out

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.980 

and<00:06:11.950> this<00:06:12.460> face<00:06:12.640> out<00:06:12.910> so<00:06:13.450> what<00:06:13.600> I<00:06:13.630> want<00:06:13.840> to<00:06:13.870> do

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
and this face out so what I want to do

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.990 
and this face out so what I want to do
in<00:06:14.110> the<00:06:14.200> next<00:06:14.350> video<00:06:14.650> is<00:06:14.800> show<00:06:15.010> you<00:06:15.070> how<00:06:15.940> you

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
in the next video is show you how you

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.270 
in the next video is show you how you
can<00:06:16.210> make<00:06:16.510> it<00:06:16.720> so<00:06:17.020> all<00:06:17.380> these<00:06:17.530> changes<00:06:17.830> mirror

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
can make it so all these changes mirror

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.640 
can make it so all these changes mirror
over
