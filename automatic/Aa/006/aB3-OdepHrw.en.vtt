00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.939
 against Greece when this was seen in the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.269
 group cy and this was the first game 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:27.510
 and so the score was 3 to 0 wow and 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.550
 in our simulation the game was 2 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.790
 to 1 bourgeois so we do not hit him and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.390
 we do not have who who won but 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.950
 good 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.660
 those who scored goals were Pablo 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.829
 gunsmith at minute 5 that is beginning 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:48.040

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.180

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.659
 Colombia and Colombia gold clasp closes 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.670
 with a flourish but the player who 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.840
 get goal at minute 90 against the world of 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.190
 compensation is james rodrÃ­guez so is 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.910
 So Colombia won its first 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.970
 three points and so I put that 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.619
 I can say well done congratulations 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.880
 Colombian raffles test and this is 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.100
 a shared 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.690
 I'm sorry aggression you had to lose in 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.670
 this occasion although he also had his 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.670
 but good and moving to another situation 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.130
 we also had the coast match of 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:37.030
 ivory against japan also a group of 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.600
 group cy then it was to do this this 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.180
 day was not the last game and so 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.580
 was when the party the truth in 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.149
 be ivory coast that is for me to 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.159
 I was the one who dominated and after 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.470
 fell the goal of japan because the japan 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.420
 like he concentrated with that goal and said 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.100
 I do not move anymore and with that, I get a 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.730
 only goal or when that single score 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.540
 Well, it was was well but good 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:07.380
 this score of 22 to 1 winning the 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.850
 Ivory coast at minute 16 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.850
 keisuke honda 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.500
 open the Japan marker with a good 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.770
 score of the corner kick then 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.400
 oneworld the truth already for the second 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.040
 already after rethinking the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.490
 things and keep seeing how was the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.160
 situation and to put to occupy then already the 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:38.270
 ivory coast team and be more 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:42.440
 exceeded himself and at minute 64 with 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.290
 note from william bonney that the the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.680
 tie and then spend two minutes and 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.370
 that the wine gets the second goal and with 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.940
 that 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.490
 is that I advance to the advantage but 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.890
 but unfortunately, since you can 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.960
 finish marked with one with two adults 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.290
 in the vilest case and coast 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:08.220
 dry ivory adds three dots to that 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.260
 to that group and likewise then we're 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.390
 seeing that Colombia ends up as the first 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.210
 place by difference of goals and coast of 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.940
 ivory followed him and so this closes 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.220
 group is from this first round game
