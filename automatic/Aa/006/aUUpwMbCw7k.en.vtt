00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.520 
start hanging this up so let's start
with<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> our<00:01:09.990> straps

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
with one of our straps

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:26.570 
with one of our straps
tree<00:01:11.460> tree<00:01:12.360> nylon<00:01:12.689> straps<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:26.159> optimal

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
tree tree nylon straps the optimal

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.249 
tree tree nylon straps the optimal
height<00:01:28.640> about<00:01:30.229> taller<00:01:31.229> then<00:01:31.700> myself<00:01:32.900> I<00:01:33.900> don't

another<00:03:52.090> cool<00:03:52.359> thing<00:03:52.389> about<00:03:52.689> this<00:03:52.959> it's<00:03:53.409> the

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
another cool thing about this it's the

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.770 
another cool thing about this it's the
double<00:03:54.129> layer<00:03:54.249> so<00:03:55.090> we<00:03:55.510> have<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:56.409> place<00:03:56.919> for<00:03:57.189> your

double layer so we have a place for your

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.330 
double layer so we have a place for your
mattress<00:03:58.780> pad<00:03:58.959> assuming<00:03:59.769> you<00:03:59.859> like<00:04:00.099> to<00:04:00.219> use

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
mattress pad assuming you like to use

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.619 
mattress pad assuming you like to use
mattress<00:04:00.700> pad<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:02.769> really<00:04:03.669> like<00:04:03.849> this<00:04:04.060> this

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
mattress pad I really like this this

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.479 
mattress pad I really like this this
because<00:04:05.169> it's<00:04:05.379> a<00:04:05.439> asymmetric<00:04:06.010> design<00:04:06.280> so<00:04:06.459> you

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
because it's a asymmetric design so you

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.729 
because it's a asymmetric design so you
actually<00:04:06.730> end<00:04:07.000> up<00:04:07.120> laying<00:04:07.359> flat<00:04:07.689> versus<00:04:08.560> like

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
actually end up laying flat versus like

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.800 
actually end up laying flat versus like
a<00:04:08.769> traditional<00:04:09.310> Eno<00:04:09.609> where<00:04:10.419> you<00:04:10.629> would<00:04:10.780> just

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
a traditional Eno where you would just

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.520 
a traditional Eno where you would just
lay<00:04:11.230> at<00:04:12.099> an<00:04:12.250> arc<00:04:12.489> this<00:04:13.030> one<00:04:13.299> you<00:04:13.689> since<00:04:14.349> you

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
lay at an arc this one you since you

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.969 
lay at an arc this one you since you
have<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:15.329> counter<00:04:16.329> points<00:04:16.660> that<00:04:17.470> you're<00:04:17.620> tied

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
have to counter points that you're tied

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.400 
have to counter points that you're tied
to<00:04:18.009> you<00:04:18.519> end<00:04:18.699> up<00:04:18.820> laying<00:04:19.060> diagonally<00:04:20.019> across

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
to you end up laying diagonally across

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.779 
to you end up laying diagonally across
that<00:04:20.949> point

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789
