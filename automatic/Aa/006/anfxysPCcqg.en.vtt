okay and back here that was a short

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.290 
okay and back here that was a short
pause<00:00:06.990> in<00:00:07.319> Camtasia<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.189> allow<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.640> file<00:00:09.030> to

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
pause in Camtasia to allow the file to

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.280 
pause in Camtasia to allow the file to
save<00:00:09.600> before<00:00:10.050> nukes<00:00:10.950> my<00:00:11.100> PC<00:00:11.550> okay<00:00:12.270> so<00:00:12.330> I'm<00:00:13.050> back

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
save before nukes my PC okay so I'm back

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.279 
save before nukes my PC okay so I'm back
here<00:00:13.530> what<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:14.580> got<00:00:14.730> here<00:00:14.970> is<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.510> third<00:00:16.080> level

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
here what we got here is the third level

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.400 
here what we got here is the third level
detail<00:00:16.770> added<00:00:17.089> this<00:00:18.089> walking<00:00:18.839> mech

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
detail added this walking mech

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.120 
detail added this walking mech
robot<00:00:19.740> thing<00:00:19.949> okay<00:00:21.329> this<00:00:22.289> layer<00:00:22.560> there's

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
robot thing okay this layer there's

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.130 
robot thing okay this layer there's
another<00:00:23.400> value<00:00:24.300> balance<00:00:24.659> layer<00:00:24.869> I'm<00:00:25.019> gonna

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
another value balance layer I'm gonna

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.569 
another value balance layer I'm gonna
turn<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.349> black<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.679> white<00:00:25.800> layer<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.099> here

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
turn the black and white layer on here

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.489 
turn the black and white layer on here
you<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.759> see<00:00:27.029> what<00:00:27.390> I've<00:00:27.480> done<00:00:27.659> is<00:00:27.929> some<00:00:28.409> of

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
you can see what I've done is some of

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.890 
you can see what I've done is some of
the<00:00:28.560> values<00:00:28.890> are<00:00:29.039> still<00:00:29.279> mixing<00:00:29.669> up<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.119> these

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
the values are still mixing up in these

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.250 
the values are still mixing up in these
areas<00:00:31.439> okay<00:00:32.369> over<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:33.000> over<00:00:33.210> here<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.109> by

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
areas okay over here over here so by

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.930 
areas okay over here over here so by
adding<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.649> layer<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.129> could<00:00:35.399> extract<00:00:35.730> those

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
adding this layer I could extract those

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.160 
adding this layer I could extract those
out<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> little<00:00:36.239> bit<00:00:36.480> better<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
out a little bit better you can see the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.860 
out a little bit better you can see the
back<00:00:37.350> legs<00:00:37.620> start<00:00:37.859> to<00:00:37.980> read<00:00:38.190> these<00:00:39.180> front<00:00:39.570> area

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
back legs start to read these front area

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.479 
back legs start to read these front area
especially<00:00:40.199> this<00:00:40.379> area<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:41.039> you<00:00:41.370> know

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
especially this area here you know

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.819 
especially this area here you know
starting<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.269> pop<00:00:42.449> out<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> little<00:00:42.870> bit<00:00:43.050> more<00:00:43.260> so

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
starting to pop out a little bit more so

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.959 
starting to pop out a little bit more so
the<00:00:44.039> viewer<00:00:44.280> could<00:00:45.030> see<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.359> and<00:00:46.730> with<00:00:47.730> that

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
the viewer could see it and with that

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.479 
the viewer could see it and with that
value<00:00:48.570> balance<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.350> further<00:00:49.769> extract

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
value balance we can further extract

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.829 
value balance we can further extract
even<00:00:51.210> additional<00:00:53.149> values<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.480> some<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
even additional values to do some of

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.650 
even additional values to do some of
these<00:00:54.929> finer<00:00:55.500> details<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.190> front<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:57.449> this

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
these finer details in the front so this

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.579 
these finer details in the front so this
leg<00:00:57.929> these<00:00:58.410> legs<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:58.920> essentially<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.589> let

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
leg these legs are essentially the let

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.189 
leg these legs are essentially the let
me<00:01:01.679> see<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:01.949> layer<00:01:02.100> my<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.429> here<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.199> closest

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
me see what layer my on here the closest

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.469 
me see what layer my on here the closest
thing<00:01:04.410> to<00:01:04.440> the<00:01:04.559> camera<00:01:04.650> these<00:01:05.400> areas<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.210> so

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
thing to the camera these areas here so

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.460 
thing to the camera these areas here so
then<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.750> could<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.229> bit<00:01:07.320> more

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
then it could be a little bit more

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.280 
then it could be a little bit more
defined<00:01:07.759> along<00:01:08.759> with<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> face<00:01:09.210> whoops<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
defined along with the face whoops to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.160 
defined along with the face whoops to
zoom<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.710> here<00:01:11.180> so<00:01:12.180> what<00:01:12.570> I'm<00:01:12.659> doing<00:01:12.930> here<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
zoom in here so what I'm doing here is

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.950 
zoom in here so what I'm doing here is
just<00:01:13.439> focusing<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.310> general<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.329> area<00:01:15.840> okay

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
just focusing in general this area okay

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.359 
just focusing in general this area okay
there'll<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:18.990> more<00:01:19.259> balance<00:01:19.799> here<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.250> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
there'll be more balance here this is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
there'll be more balance here this is
again<00:01:20.640> another<00:01:20.850> value<00:01:21.420> balance<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.170> see

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
again another value balance you can see

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.120 
again another value balance you can see
here<00:01:22.740> if<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.950> turn<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.250> layer<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.880> off

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
here if I turn this layer on and off

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.499 
here if I turn this layer on and off
boom<00:01:26.130> boom<00:01:26.700> boom

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
boom boom boom

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.359 
boom boom boom
is<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.259> get<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> little<00:01:28.560> bit<00:01:28.710> lighter<00:01:28.890> values

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
is to get a little bit lighter values

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.679 
is to get a little bit lighter values
there's<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> lot<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.790> balance<00:01:30.000> light<00:01:30.329> coming

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
there's a lot of balance light coming

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.200 
there's a lot of balance light coming
from<00:01:30.719> a<00:01:31.649> scene<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.640> guy<00:01:32.850> is

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
from a scene like this this guy is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.770 
from a scene like this this guy is
relatively<00:01:34.140> close<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> ground<00:01:35.299> okay<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
relatively close to the ground okay so a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.840 
relatively close to the ground okay so a
light<00:01:37.140> from<00:01:37.770> over<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> place<00:01:38.430> where<00:01:38.610> I've<00:01:38.700> got

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
light from over the place where I've got

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.910 
light from over the place where I've got
a<00:01:38.880> main<00:01:39.180> light<00:01:39.509> coming<00:01:39.840> from<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.170> way<00:01:40.409> left

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
a main light coming from this way left

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.340 
a main light coming from this way left
hitting<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.969> guy<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.020> see<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> low

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
hitting this guy so you can see the low

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.499 
hitting this guy so you can see the low
highlights<00:01:43.770> hitting<00:01:44.399> these<00:01:44.549> areas<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
highlights hitting these areas so the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.609 
highlights hitting these areas so the
main<00:01:45.719> light<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:45.930> coming<00:01:46.200> from<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.560> direction

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
main light is coming from this direction

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.590 
main light is coming from this direction
however<00:01:47.280> there's<00:01:47.850> gonna<00:01:47.969> be<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> lot<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
however there's gonna be a lot of a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.090 
however there's gonna be a lot of a
balanced<00:01:49.200> light<00:01:49.350> coming<00:01:49.649> from<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.920> ground

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
balanced light coming from the ground

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.670 
balanced light coming from the ground
and<00:01:50.520> bounce<00:01:51.149> light<00:01:51.390> basically<00:01:52.020> all<00:01:52.380> over<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
and bounce light basically all over the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.560 
and bounce light basically all over the
place<00:01:52.860> right<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.490> these<00:01:54.119> things<00:01:54.329> are<00:01:54.450> gonna

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
place right and these things are gonna

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.529 
place right and these things are gonna
hit<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.049> guy<00:01:55.700> hit<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.789> ground<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.360> then

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
hit this guy hit the ground and then

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.959 
hit this guy hit the ground and then
bounce<00:01:57.780> into<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.439> underside<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.729> robot

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
bounce into the underside of this robot

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.380 
bounce into the underside of this robot
causing<00:02:00.600> these<00:02:00.750> areas<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.219> see<00:02:02.490> here<00:02:03.149> so

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
causing these areas that you see here so

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.719 
causing these areas that you see here so
if<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.539> turn<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:04.079> off<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:05.039> can<00:02:05.219> see<00:02:05.369> by

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
if I turn this on off you can see by

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.120 
if I turn this on off you can see by
doing<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.539> start<00:02:07.079> extracting<00:02:07.439> laying<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
doing this I start extracting laying the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.300 
doing this I start extracting laying the
balance<00:02:08.850> light<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:10.410> these<00:02:10.560> areas<00:02:10.769> here<00:02:11.280> a

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
balance light and all these areas here a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.550 
balance light and all these areas here a
lot<00:02:11.519> of<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.640> legs<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.300> bottom<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.750> his

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
lot of the legs the bottom of his

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.410 
lot of the legs the bottom of his
body<00:02:14.489> these<00:02:14.940> panels<00:02:15.360> over<00:02:15.599> here<00:02:16.340> over<00:02:17.340> here<00:02:17.819> so

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
body these panels over here over here so

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.370 
body these panels over here over here so
these<00:02:18.540> are<00:02:18.690> all<00:02:18.750> for<00:02:19.020> balance<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:21.380> this

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
these are all for balance like this

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.710 
these are all for balance like this
layer<00:02:22.560> adds<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:23.160> little<00:02:23.730> bit<00:02:23.849> high<00:02:24.360> definition

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
layer adds a little bit high definition

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.120 
layer adds a little bit high definition
this<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.080> actually<00:02:25.380> trying<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.590> show<00:02:25.709> students

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
this is actually trying to show students

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.530 
this is actually trying to show students
how<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.250> clean<00:02:26.520> stuff<00:02:26.730> out<00:02:26.940> because<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.450> don't

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
how to clean stuff out because we don't

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.690 
how to clean stuff out because we don't
have<00:02:27.630> too<00:02:27.810> much<00:02:27.900> time<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.230> do<00:02:28.319> these<00:02:28.440> demos<00:02:28.770> but

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
have too much time to do these demos but

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.520 
have too much time to do these demos but
I<00:02:29.760> do<00:02:29.880> want<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.180> show<00:02:30.420> them<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.870> it's<00:02:31.319> very

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
I do want to show them that it's very

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.280 
I do want to show them that it's very
possible<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:32.130> bring<00:02:32.400> these<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> very<00:02:33.290> clean

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
possible to bring these to a very clean

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.130 
possible to bring these to a very clean
and<00:02:34.650> organized<00:02:35.430> detailed<00:02:36.390> level<00:02:36.569> so<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.080> can

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
and organized detailed level so you can

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.360 
and organized detailed level so you can
see<00:02:37.380> over<00:02:38.010> here<00:02:38.120> let<00:02:39.120> me<00:02:39.150> try<00:02:39.360> layer<00:02:39.750> here

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
see over here let me try layer here

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.070 
see over here let me try layer here
right<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.550> quite<00:02:41.730> loose<00:02:41.940> but<00:02:42.300> if<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.900> just

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
right it's quite loose but if you just

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.830 
right it's quite loose but if you just
spend<00:02:43.470> time<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.130> zoom<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.550> or<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.450> makes<00:02:45.720> your

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
spend time and zoom in or it makes your

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.720 
spend time and zoom in or it makes your
image<00:02:46.080> much<00:02:46.410> higher<00:02:46.590> resolution<00:02:46.799> you<00:02:47.580> could

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
image much higher resolution you could

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.960 
image much higher resolution you could
clean<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.090> stuff<00:02:48.180> up<00:02:48.420> quite<00:02:49.140> nicely<00:02:49.970> same

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
clean this stuff up quite nicely same

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.390 
clean this stuff up quite nicely same
with<00:02:51.120> here<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.709> just<00:02:52.830> depends<00:02:53.100> on<00:02:53.160> how<00:02:53.250> much

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
with here so it just depends on how much

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.479 
with here so it just depends on how much
time<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.730> have<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.330> work<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.720> these<00:02:54.980> okay<00:02:55.980> so

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
time you have to work on these okay so

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.520 
time you have to work on these okay so
this<00:02:56.880> image<00:02:57.090> at<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.540> stage<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:58.019> actually<00:02:58.170> in

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
this image at this stage is actually in

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.830 
this image at this stage is actually in
almost<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.819> could<00:02:59.940> call<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.239> almost<00:03:00.390> complete

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
almost you could call it almost complete

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.110 
almost you could call it almost complete
it<00:03:00.959> for<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.230> fast<00:03:01.470> sketch<00:03:01.890> this<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.459> didn't<00:03:02.970> take

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
it for a fast sketch this is didn't take

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.120 
it for a fast sketch this is didn't take
that<00:03:03.239> long<00:03:03.690> at<00:03:03.870> all<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.260> if<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:04.830> turn<00:03:05.040> the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
that long at all and if I turn the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.289 
that long at all and if I turn the
layers<00:03:05.370> on<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.790> off<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.060> can<00:03:06.180> see<00:03:06.269> the

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
layers on and off you can see the

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.000 
layers on and off you can see the
background<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.290> foreground<00:03:07.319> really

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
background and the foreground really

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.120 
background and the foreground really
never<00:03:08.220> got<00:03:08.400> worked<00:03:08.670> on<00:03:09.349> see<00:03:10.349> where<00:03:10.560> we<00:03:10.709> started

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
never got worked on see where we started

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.559 
never got worked on see where we started
about<00:03:11.220> here<00:03:11.670> somewhere<00:03:12.000> right<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.299> this<00:03:12.420> is

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
about here somewhere right so this is

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.870 
about here somewhere right so this is
the<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.260> first<00:03:13.290> silhouette<00:03:14.190> where<00:03:14.760> we

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
the the first silhouette where we

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.140 
the the first silhouette where we
extracted<00:03:15.599> some<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:15.989> first<00:03:16.230> details<00:03:17.150> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
extracted some of the first details the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.449 
extracted some of the first details the
value<00:03:18.450> change<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:19.350> here<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.680> background<00:03:20.130> has

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
value change so here the background has

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.770 
value change so here the background has
some<00:03:20.670> detail<00:03:21.030> added<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.600> can<00:03:21.750> see

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
some detail added to it you can see

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.349 
some detail added to it you can see
there's<00:03:22.140> some<00:03:22.880> buildings<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.090> stuff<00:03:24.239> like

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
there's some buildings and stuff like

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.210 
there's some buildings and stuff like
that<00:03:24.540> but<00:03:24.690> not<00:03:24.840> really<00:03:24.900> much<00:03:25.380> add<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.070> these

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
that but not really much add it to these

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.300 
that but not really much add it to these
they're<00:03:26.489> very<00:03:26.940> very<00:03:27.120> subtle<00:03:27.829> ok<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:28.980> focal

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
they're very very subtle ok the focal

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.890 
they're very very subtle ok the focal
point<00:03:29.489> is<00:03:29.609> always<00:03:29.850> an<00:03:29.970> upon<00:03:30.269> this<00:03:30.420> vehicle

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
point is always an upon this vehicle

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.150 
point is always an upon this vehicle
here<00:03:31.079> in<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.739> front<00:03:31.980> areas<00:03:33.650> they<00:03:34.650> keep<00:03:34.890> adding

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
here in the front areas they keep adding

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.000 
here in the front areas they keep adding
keep<00:03:35.340> adding<00:03:35.609> so<00:03:36.329> this<00:03:36.870> way<00:03:37.049> like<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.590> mentioned

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
keep adding so this way like I mentioned

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.770 
keep adding so this way like I mentioned
earlier<00:03:38.190> if<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.970> have<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.180> rush<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:39.600> thing

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
earlier if you have to rush this thing

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.780 
earlier if you have to rush this thing
into<00:03:39.959> production<00:03:40.380> right<00:03:40.530> now<00:03:41.010> if<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:41.519> has<00:03:41.670> to

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
into production right now if this has to

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.509 
into production right now if this has to
go<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.299> know<00:03:42.480> at<00:03:42.630> this<00:03:42.810> point<00:03:43.139> you're<00:03:44.130> not<00:03:44.160> too

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
go you know at this point you're not too

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.420 
go you know at this point you're not too
worried<00:03:44.910> because<00:03:45.359> you<00:03:45.540> have<00:03:45.810> maturity<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.920> the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
worried because you have maturity of the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.879 
worried because you have maturity of the
design<00:03:47.880> defined<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:49.019> this<00:03:49.470> could<00:03:49.680> go<00:03:49.769> into

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
design defined and this could go into

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.680 
design defined and this could go into
production<00:03:50.220> either<00:03:50.519> as<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.819> some<00:03:51.450> kind<00:03:51.630> of

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
production either as a some kind of

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.750 
production either as a some kind of
inspirational<00:03:52.380> piece<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:53.069> could<00:03:53.190> be<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.370> design

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
inspirational piece it could be a design

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.460 
inspirational piece it could be a design
thing<00:03:54.180> for<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.450> 3d<00:03:54.690> modeler<00:03:55.079> it<00:03:55.230> could<00:03:55.350> be<00:03:55.440> a

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
thing for a 3d modeler it could be a

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.620 
thing for a 3d modeler it could be a
lighting<00:03:55.829> pass<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.340> could<00:03:56.459> be<00:03:56.609> a<00:03:56.639> storyboard

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
lighting pass it could be a storyboard

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.900 
lighting pass it could be a storyboard
for<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.900> shot<00:03:58.170> but<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.920> all<00:03:59.220> works<00:03:59.549> it<00:03:59.760> has

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
for a shot but it all works it has

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.030 
for a shot but it all works it has
enough<00:04:00.209> stuff<00:04:00.569> to<00:04:00.780> hold<00:04:01.350> it<00:04:01.620> can<00:04:01.709> even<00:04:01.920> be<00:04:02.010> a

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
enough stuff to hold it can even be a

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.460 
enough stuff to hold it can even be a
placeholder<00:04:02.310> for<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.600> cinematic<00:04:04.049> Department

placeholder for the cinematic Department
until<00:04:04.650> they<00:04:04.739> have<00:04:04.829> a<00:04:04.889> 3d<00:04:05.130> model<00:04:05.430> in<00:04:05.519> place<00:04:05.609> they

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
until they have a 3d model in place they

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.280 
until they have a 3d model in place they
can<00:04:05.970> use<00:04:06.090> this<00:04:06.269> or<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.480> think<00:04:06.569> I<00:04:06.690> edit<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.109> make

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
can use this or I think I edit and make

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.930 
can use this or I think I edit and make
it<00:04:07.410> go

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
it go

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.830 
it go
no<00:04:08.940> they<00:04:09.090> could<00:04:09.209> do<00:04:09.299> stuff<00:04:09.359> like<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.780> mean

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
no they could do stuff like that I mean

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.470 
no they could do stuff like that I mean
in<00:04:10.260> production<00:04:10.680> anything<00:04:11.010> goes<00:04:11.190> right<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:11.970> as

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
in production anything goes right and as

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.660 
in production anything goes right and as
a<00:04:12.540> concept<00:04:12.930> designer<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.650> more<00:04:14.069> useful<00:04:14.370> you

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
a concept designer the more useful you

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.310 
a concept designer the more useful you
are<00:04:14.700> which<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.359> you<00:04:15.660> could<00:04:15.810> cover<00:04:15.959> all<00:04:16.109> the

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
are which is you could cover all the

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.110 
are which is you could cover all the
bases<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.859> better<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.220> will<00:04:17.310> be<00:04:17.489> at<00:04:17.519> your<00:04:17.850> job

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
bases the better you will be at your job

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.210 
bases the better you will be at your job
because<00:04:18.720> they<00:04:18.930> look<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.440> you<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.709> do<00:04:19.799> all<00:04:19.979> sorts

more valuable you are inside a studio

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.360 
more valuable you are inside a studio
environment<00:04:36.270> so<00:04:36.539> this<00:04:37.409> is<00:04:37.620> basically<00:04:38.039> trying

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
environment so this is basically trying

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.630 
environment so this is basically trying
to<00:04:38.460> teach<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.330> guys<00:04:39.450> how<00:04:39.510> to<00:04:39.630> work<00:04:39.840> fast<00:04:40.169> and

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
to teach you guys how to work fast and

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.690 
to teach you guys how to work fast and
efficient<00:04:41.640> yeah<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:43.190> because<00:04:44.190> I've<00:04:44.310> ran<00:04:44.460> into

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
efficient yeah so because I've ran into

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.120 
efficient yeah so because I've ran into
situations<00:04:45.419> where<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.320> designer<00:04:46.530> spends<00:04:47.039> too

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
situations where a designer spends too

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.560 
situations where a designer spends too
much<00:04:47.190> time<00:04:47.490> on<00:04:47.610> things<00:04:47.820> that<00:04:47.880> are<00:04:48.000> not<00:04:48.060> that

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
much time on things that are not that

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.690 
much time on things that are not that
important<00:04:49.409> like<00:04:49.770> I<00:04:49.890> mentioned<00:04:50.310> earlier<00:04:50.610> you

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
important like I mentioned earlier you

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.339 
important like I mentioned earlier you
know<00:04:50.849> rendering<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.419> rock<00:04:51.630> over<00:04:51.930> here<00:04:52.110> making

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
know rendering a rock over here making

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.469 
know rendering a rock over here making
it<00:04:52.530> just<00:04:52.560> beautiful<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:53.430> perfect<00:04:54.000> but

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
it just beautiful and perfect but

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.750 
it just beautiful and perfect but
everything<00:04:55.260> over<00:04:55.500> here<00:04:55.530> is<00:04:55.890> completely<00:04:56.370> not

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
everything over here is completely not

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.420 
everything over here is completely not
done<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.270> they've<00:04:58.260> spent<00:04:58.590> say<00:04:58.979> you<00:04:59.340> know

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
done and they've spent say you know

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.250 
done and they've spent say you know
three<00:04:59.849> four<00:04:59.880> hours<00:05:00.180> making<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.780> background

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
three four hours making the background

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.050 
three four hours making the background
over<00:05:01.470> here<00:05:01.620> is<00:05:01.890> super<00:05:02.190> super<00:05:02.310> define<00:05:02.820> and

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
over here is super super define and

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.330 
over here is super super define and
super<00:05:03.300> nice<00:05:03.479> and<00:05:03.780> then<00:05:04.289> you<00:05:04.320> check<00:05:04.890> the<00:05:05.039> design

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
super nice and then you check the design

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.320 
super nice and then you check the design
go<00:05:05.550> hey<00:05:05.640> you<00:05:05.700> know<00:05:05.789> what

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
go hey you know what

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.880 
go hey you know what
this<00:05:06.539> design<00:05:06.840> is<00:05:06.930> not<00:05:07.080> working<00:05:07.440> let's<00:05:07.620> let's

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
this design is not working let's let's

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.140 
this design is not working let's let's
go<00:05:08.010> to<00:05:08.070> something<00:05:08.340> else<00:05:08.550> but<00:05:08.880> they<00:05:08.940> already

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
go to something else but they already

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.180 
go to something else but they already
burned<00:05:09.690> five<00:05:10.110> or<00:05:10.349> six<00:05:10.500> hours<00:05:10.740> of<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:10.950> day<00:05:11.130> you

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
burned five or six hours of the day you

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.680 
burned five or six hours of the day you
know<00:05:11.520> something<00:05:12.030> else<00:05:12.150> that's<00:05:12.390> not<00:05:12.450> even

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
know something else that's not even

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.480 
know something else that's not even
important<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:13.560> that<00:05:13.770> where<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.130> main<00:05:14.280> thing

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
important and that where the main thing

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.520 
important and that where the main thing
was<00:05:14.789> never<00:05:15.120> correct<00:05:15.719> in<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:15.930> first<00:05:16.140> place<00:05:16.349> and

the results so alright the next one here

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.940 
the results so alright the next one here
is<00:05:51.090> look<00:05:51.599> just<00:05:51.840> very<00:05:52.110> quick<00:05:52.380> showing<00:05:52.650> students

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
is look just very quick showing students

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.790 
is look just very quick showing students
how<00:05:52.979> to<00:05:53.099> put<00:05:53.400> in<00:05:53.490> some<00:05:53.700> texture<00:05:54.120> work<00:05:54.800> very

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
how to put in some texture work very

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.409 
how to put in some texture work very
basic<00:05:56.280> I<00:05:56.400> usually<00:05:56.909> do<00:05:56.969> a<00:05:57.000> little<00:05:57.180> bit<00:05:57.270> more

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
basic I usually do a little bit more

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.140 
basic I usually do a little bit more
than<00:05:57.539> this<00:05:57.659> we<00:05:57.870> can<00:05:58.020> see<00:05:58.169> here<00:05:58.409> this<00:05:58.650> is<00:05:58.710> a<00:05:59.150> some

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
than this we can see here this is a some

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.700 
than this we can see here this is a some
parts<00:06:00.539> from<00:06:00.690> probably<00:06:01.050> a<00:06:01.110> motorcycle

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
parts from probably a motorcycle

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.920 
parts from probably a motorcycle
somewhere<00:06:02.039> and<00:06:02.580> I<00:06:02.909> just<00:06:03.060> added<00:06:03.210> some<00:06:03.330> chunky

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
somewhere and I just added some chunky

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.570 
somewhere and I just added some chunky
parts<00:06:04.140> over<00:06:04.320> here<00:06:04.620> there's<00:06:05.010> no<00:06:05.130> time<00:06:05.340> to<00:06:05.460> clean

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
parts over here there's no time to clean

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.130 
parts over here there's no time to clean
these<00:06:05.789> up<00:06:05.849> but<00:06:06.240> what<00:06:06.390> it<00:06:06.479> does<00:06:06.659> is<00:06:06.870> he<00:06:06.960> asked

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
these up but what it does is he asked

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.620 
these up but what it does is he asked
this<00:06:07.469> very<00:06:07.890> intricate<00:06:08.430> level<00:06:08.969> of<00:06:09.060> details<00:06:09.450> to

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
this very intricate level of details to

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.270 
this very intricate level of details to
kind<00:06:09.840> of<00:06:09.900> balance<00:06:10.080> out<00:06:10.500> the<00:06:10.830> stuff<00:06:11.070> in<00:06:11.190> the

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
kind of balance out the stuff in the

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.339 
kind of balance out the stuff in the
front<00:06:11.580> over<00:06:11.789> here<00:06:11.820> because<00:06:12.630> this<00:06:12.810> is<00:06:13.140> quite

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
front over here because this is quite

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:14.870 
front over here because this is quite
defined<00:06:13.740> we<00:06:13.979> didn't<00:06:14.159> spend<00:06:14.370> time<00:06:14.610> here

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
defined we didn't spend time here

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.040 
defined we didn't spend time here
because<00:06:15.000> we<00:06:15.300> don't<00:06:15.479> have<00:06:15.510> that<00:06:15.630> much<00:06:15.810> time<00:06:15.990> to

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
because we don't have that much time to

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.230 
because we don't have that much time to
spend<00:06:16.380> so<00:06:16.950> by<00:06:17.610> putting<00:06:17.849> a<00:06:17.940> little<00:06:17.969> bit<00:06:18.180> of

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
spend so by putting a little bit of

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.119 
spend so by putting a little bit of
texture<00:06:18.479> working<00:06:18.810> here<00:06:18.990> you<00:06:19.050> can<00:06:19.200> see<00:06:19.380> boom

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:20.129 
texture working here you can see boom

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:23.239 
texture working here you can see boom
No<00:06:20.580> it<00:06:21.509> kind<00:06:21.749> of<00:06:21.779> gives<00:06:22.020> this<00:06:22.319> area<00:06:22.739> a<00:06:22.800> nice

00:06:23.239 --> 00:06:23.249 
No it kind of gives this area a nice

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:25.549 
No it kind of gives this area a nice
clean<00:06:23.610> focal<00:06:24.029> point<00:06:24.239> without<00:06:24.719> you<00:06:25.020> doing<00:06:25.289> too

00:06:25.549 --> 00:06:25.559 
clean focal point without you doing too

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:27.619 
clean focal point without you doing too
much<00:06:25.830> work<00:06:26.129> to<00:06:26.279> it<00:06:26.399> but<00:06:26.789> be<00:06:26.939> aware<00:06:27.029> to<00:06:27.479> make

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:27.629 
much work to it but be aware to make

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:29.119 
much work to it but be aware to make
sure<00:06:27.779> that<00:06:27.989> your<00:06:28.139> texture<00:06:28.529> work<00:06:28.679> do<00:06:28.889> match<00:06:29.099> the

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:29.129 
sure that your texture work do match the

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:30.709 
sure that your texture work do match the
perspective<00:06:29.849> the<00:06:29.999> worst<00:06:30.179> is<00:06:30.389> putting<00:06:30.659> a

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:30.719 
perspective the worst is putting a

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.329 
perspective the worst is putting a
texture<00:06:30.989> in<00:06:31.139> there<00:06:31.289> but<00:06:31.739> the<00:06:32.099> perspective

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:32.339 
texture in there but the perspective

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:34.129 
texture in there but the perspective
doesn't<00:06:32.789> match<00:06:32.969> and<00:06:33.360> it<00:06:33.629> looks<00:06:33.779> very<00:06:33.989> very

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
doesn't match and it looks very very

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.499 
doesn't match and it looks very very
photoshopped<00:06:34.860> like<00:06:35.039> a<00:06:35.069> bad<00:06:35.309> copy<00:06:36.089> and<00:06:36.300> paste

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:36.509 
photoshopped like a bad copy and paste

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.389 
photoshopped like a bad copy and paste
job<00:06:36.719> right<00:06:37.469> so<00:06:37.589> even<00:06:37.709> back<00:06:37.949> here<00:06:38.129> I<00:06:38.159> was<00:06:38.219> trying

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:38.399 
job right so even back here I was trying

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:39.769 
job right so even back here I was trying
to<00:06:38.429> show<00:06:38.550> students<00:06:38.909> that<00:06:39.149> you<00:06:39.269> can<00:06:39.389> even<00:06:39.539> put

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:39.779 
to show students that you can even put

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:41.389 
to show students that you can even put
some<00:06:39.899> stuff<00:06:40.110> into<00:06:40.319> the<00:06:40.589> whoops<00:06:40.919> into<00:06:41.279> the

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:41.399 
some stuff into the whoops into the

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:43.219 
some stuff into the whoops into the
background<00:06:41.789> there<00:06:41.969> you<00:06:42.089> can<00:06:42.239> see<00:06:42.389> all<00:06:43.169> right

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229 
background there you can see all right

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:45.709 
background there you can see all right
somebody<00:06:43.619> breathe<00:06:44.029> so<00:06:45.029> that's<00:06:45.239> the<00:06:45.389> texture

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:45.719 
somebody breathe so that's the texture

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:48.139 
somebody breathe so that's the texture
layer<00:06:46.969> okay

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:48.149 
layer okay
