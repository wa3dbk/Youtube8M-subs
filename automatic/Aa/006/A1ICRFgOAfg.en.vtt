00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hi to all friends so we get 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.190
 found for a little special video 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.090
 today I had decided on you 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.059
 present a fashion presentation on 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.670
 different tractor I did one on 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.109
 reapers so there they are not in 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.520
 the world according to the powers a 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.109
 meaning I do not care I'll start with 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.600
 there and then I'll go slowly 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.500
 and tell you what I think so we 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.510
 starts with the curriculum 16 14 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.590
 so you can see an old ring 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.149
 tractors that makes 150 horses that is 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.399
 well detailed well we see a 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.719
 shift and it's all 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.489
 a noise goes up to 30 1 inside it is 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.050
 well it is not bad and all that so 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.520
 I will not have fun at all and start 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.559
 a I mean it's really words 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.940
 that I recommend you this is 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.989
 really a very beautiful fashion I 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.350
 found found not long ago 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.320
 that one then we go on the de 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 it's at groton ttv 630 so that one 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.100
 it's a pack with the sam will go 190 and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.750
 the lamborghini tunes 690 duke this mode there 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.729
 I adore them too if he is 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.850
 rarely done well you can move 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.020
 flying and so on it's a very pretty 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.900
 tractor I mean without any 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.470
 hesitation I propose to you that is 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.250
 fashion and it really has been fashion and in 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.750
 all the details 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.610
 finally it is rarely really well done 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.710
 so it's also a tractor that I 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.290
 so I recommend it to you without 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.420
 no problem so at the site 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.079
 then sorry we go on fad the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.439
 favorite fox 818 so 180 horses 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.729
 so he is also nice by the way 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.460
 I do not know why this is 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.590
 plays upside down it's also a little 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.659
 nice tractor I love them 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.009
 well I do not use it too often 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.689
 but I also use it because it is 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.710
 to do well it works well and that's 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.979
 a nice tractor 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.200
 so I have nothing to say about it 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.649
 also recommend that afterwards we not 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.450
 on the biggest on fad 936 vario 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.110
 so 360 horses 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.539
 so it's a very nice fashion too 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.030
 we can have no function by 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.180
 against that it's a little pity apart 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.340
 opening doors and so on 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.780
 otherwise it's a pretty nice tractor alone 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.850
 little trick there you see the fires that 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.020
 flash there I already tried everything I 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.760
 can not stop them so if 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.090
 never know you do not hesitate to me 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.270
 to say it 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.470
 so it's also a small tractor a 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.510
 small is also a tractor 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.200
 friendly anyway which I 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.090
 therefore also recommend 1724 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.770
 vario so sunna frozen already presented two 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.390
 I will not dwell on it so I 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.250
 also recommend it's a very pretty 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.810
 tractor very well fashion and very well 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.090
 realized so there is really nothing to say 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.620
 on it so as I say I'll go 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.989
 on because good I already presented 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.770
 so the 6150 r is the same 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.270
 very very nice tractor I love them 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.510
 a lot I use it with the charger 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.570
 frontal for that there's no problem 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.190
 it's a very nice tractor 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.310
 versatile he goes everywhere he has the 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.810
 power finally he is really really 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.430
 well done as you can finally see 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.870
 by the way like all modes there that 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.340
 all the tractors that I started they 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.230
 are all really wonder I have nothing to 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.060
 say on it 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.160
 so I also recommend you to 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.190
 little info all the modes you 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.120
 see there except ursus to see that I say 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:31.170
 no bullshit other than the curriculum the 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.880
 6610 of 7800 and the 28 50 cd mode that 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.610
 you can download on mono steurs 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.420
 the other for sure it ls planet info 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.030
 seems so then we will continue with 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.160
 the john deere 6610 that I downloaded 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.319
 there is no long time possibility of 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.329
 put a front loader twinning 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.700
 he is well made of many teeth he 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.549
 is well done I like so small 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.069
 three points hydraulic 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.980
 personally I appreciate them 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.109
 so it's a nice tractor you can 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.739
 see he has some he still has to 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:09.200
 the equipment so I recommend 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.609
 it is really a little flat when 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.230
 you not put her weight before it 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.739
 is very very fast even with a plow 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.659
 three bodies 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.500
 so you have to put weight on him but otherwise 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:20.720
 it goes very well then we go on 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.889
 john deere 7810 so I want to 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.900
 to say that one is my favorite 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.789
 of all I have them especially this very good 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.449
 me it's my little crush I 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:32.240
 found at the same time as 6610 so I 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:35.660
 forgot to specify at 9150 air 150 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.030
 horses the fool 240 the one there he in 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.340
 does 125 am there I do not know exactly 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.130
 how much faye should do in the 160 180 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.759
 horses I think so it's also a 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.479
 nice tractor so this is the series 0 am 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.550
 there but it is not bad too 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:55.220
 possibility of twinning 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.110
 to open the lift at the front and so on 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.759
 I recommend it to you and you can 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.620
 add the fenders also shot I 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.570
 crowd road 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.370
 so I recommend it too it's 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.630
 also a very very nice tractor me 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:11.870
 I like then the 28 50 so 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.690
 maybe it's the smallest of 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.330
 all 95 horsepower 4 wheel drive 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.189
 it's a small 4 cylinders 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.610
 me personally it's a tractor 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:25.580
 I love because it is compact 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.189
 is extremely compact it goes everywhere 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.569
 it's not bad fashion and you see 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.789
 the lighting is nice 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:35.000
 good it's a bit dark in it but 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:36.740
 otherwise he's really nice for 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.539
 a small tractor not promise you a 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.020
 strawberry behind or a mixer 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.520
 it's just it's just what does it take 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.719
 so I also recommend a little 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.819
 downside I think he does not have any 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:49.159
 beacon that's the little one 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:52.460
 flat is then then we move on 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:56.930
 360 horses on the John Deere 8360 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:59.389
 look so then this one here I love them 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.960
 also a lot I prefer a fan 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:04.669
 but that's good my taste 360 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.120
 horses I could compare with 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:11.289
 the other 1936 the ba ba for me for me 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.289
 it's the one that binds a person 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:21.219
 then inside the interior so 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.229
 you have leem no other than 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:25.569
 you can see a lot of things small 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:28.389
 advantage twinning front back on 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:29.559
 so it's not bad either so it's 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.779
 really a tractor that I you 

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:32.349
 also recommend because it is 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.409
 awesome 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:37.119
 I love it then we finish on a 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:38.469
 mode that you can not download 

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:41.589
 on any site 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:44.409
 it's lamborghini and recipes 220 

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:47.080
 so that's the giant tractor they 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:49.240
 have offered in s and titanium 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.339
 so I also present it because it 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.249
 is pretty me I like them 

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:55.869
 aesthetically it is really pretty 

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:59.169
 looks like August 2nd without faux-pas must 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:07:02.559
 to admit it but it is really pretty to 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:06.099
 the interior is simple but he 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:07.379
 is well done anyway so 220 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:10.509
 horses 

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:12.999
 it's also my little tractor 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:15.009
 me as said all these words beyond I you 

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:16.449
 recommend them without hesitation I have not 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:18.969
 put all the modes that I thought because 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:21.459
 that otherwise we would not finish so I 

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:24.849
 do it again episode number two with 

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:26.769
 others so me I tell you I you 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:28.300
 recommend them download the I hope 

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:31.529
 that this video you liked go good 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.529
 evening everyone ciao everyone
