just<00:00:24.000> gonna<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.779> program<00:00:25.500> mode<00:00:25.740> so

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
just gonna have it on program mode so

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.580 
just gonna have it on program mode so
come<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.300> from<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.720> monitors<00:00:29.240> okay<00:00:30.590> good

has that car in the headlights look so

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.490 
has that car in the headlights look so
now<00:00:42.510> we're<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> do<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> lightsphere

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
now we're going to do the lightsphere

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.459 
now we're going to do the lightsphere
collapsible<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:45.030> mount<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.469> basically

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
collapsible and to mount it basically

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.160 
collapsible and to mount it basically
i'm<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.039> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.399> take<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.059> put<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:49.079> on

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
i'm just going to take it and put it on

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
i'm just going to take it and put it on
any<00:00:49.379> flat<00:00:49.590> surface<00:00:50.239> make<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.420> flat<00:00:52.550> put<00:00:53.550> wedge

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
any flat surface make it flat put wedge

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.000 
any flat surface make it flat put wedge
it<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> 45<00:00:54.780> degree<00:00:54.989> angle<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
it on a 45 degree angle like that and

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.260 
it on a 45 degree angle like that and
for<00:00:56.309> let's<00:00:56.489> straight<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:58.609> and<00:00:59.609> of<00:01:00.059> course

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
for let's straight up so and of course

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.029 
for let's straight up so and of course
we<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> head<00:01:00.809> perpendicular<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
we have the head perpendicular with the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.470 
we have the head perpendicular with the
button<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> back<00:01:02.670> cuz<00:01:02.910> imma<00:01:03.090> shoot<00:01:03.270> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
button in the back cuz imma shoot a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.340 
button in the back cuz imma shoot a
vertical<00:01:03.960> photo<00:01:04.170> now<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.180> your

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
vertical photo now just like on your

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.530 
vertical photo now just like on your
instructions<00:01:07.350> it'll<00:01:07.619> tell<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.070> put<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:08.970> ISO

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
instructions it'll tell you put your ISO

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.410 
instructions it'll tell you put your ISO
on<00:01:10.010> 800<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.580> instruction<00:01:12.000> card<00:01:12.270> we'll

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
on 800 on the instruction card we'll

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.510 
on 800 on the instruction card we'll
save<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> dry<00:01:12.900> ice<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.200> 800<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.860> indoors<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
save the dry ice on 800 for indoors and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.260 
save the dry ice on 800 for indoors and
then<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:16.220> don't<00:01:17.220> I'm<00:01:17.490> sorry<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.119> light

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
then the don't I'm sorry the light

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.940 
then the don't I'm sorry the light
sphere<00:01:18.420> straight<00:01:18.930> up<00:01:19.110> without<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> dome

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
sphere straight up without a dome

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.429 
sphere straight up without a dome
because<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.150> see<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:22.080> only<00:01:22.320> do

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
because as you can see here not only do

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.170 
because as you can see here not only do
we<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> high<00:01:22.979> ceiling<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.909> black

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
we have a high ceiling it's a black

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.270 
we have a high ceiling it's a black
ceiling<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.869> oftentimes<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.530> question<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.040> is

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
ceiling so oftentimes the question is is

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.700 
ceiling so oftentimes the question is is
how<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.790> life<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.360> look<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.810> you're<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> really

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
how to life in a look if you're a really

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.530 
how to life in a look if you're a really
high<00:01:28.860> ceiling<00:01:29.369> or<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> black<00:01:29.820> ceiling<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.420> this

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
high ceiling or a black ceiling and this

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.760 
high ceiling or a black ceiling and this
is<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.900> be<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> answer<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.409> question

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
is going to be the answer the question

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.649 
is going to be the answer the question
if<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.430> had<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> white<00:01:32.909> ceiling<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:33.509> there'd

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
if we had a white ceiling then there'd

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.560 
if we had a white ceiling then there'd
actually<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.170> more<00:01:34.439> fill<00:01:34.850> on<00:01:35.850> Emily's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
actually be more fill on Emily's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.760 
actually be more fill on Emily's
shoulders<00:01:36.900> because<00:01:37.140> she's<00:01:37.320> actually<00:01:37.500> wearing

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
shoulders because she's actually wearing

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
shoulders because she's actually wearing
a<00:01:37.979> dark<00:01:38.189> dark<00:01:38.640> top<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.360> will<00:01:39.509> still<00:01:39.750> be

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
a dark dark top but this will still be

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.170 
a dark dark top but this will still be
very<00:01:40.229> equally<00:01:40.710> pretty<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.250> all<00:01:41.820> I'm<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
very equally pretty so all I'm going to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.420 
very equally pretty so all I'm going to
do<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> instructions<00:01:43.799> set

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
do is just like on the instructions set

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.420 
do is just like on the instructions set
the<00:01:44.549> camera<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.180> TTL<00:01:45.630> I'm<00:01:45.990> going<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.710> put<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.220> on

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the camera to TTL I'm going to put it on

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.859 
the camera to TTL I'm going to put it on
ISO<00:01:47.909> 800<00:01:48.450> program<00:01:49.290> mode<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.540> that's<00:01:51.540> basic

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
ISO 800 program mode and that's basic

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
one of the features I think is best with

one of the features I think is best with
it<00:02:17.520> okay<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:19.550> here's<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.610> comparison<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.540> the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
it okay so here's the comparison of the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.100
