00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
downloaded right before recording this

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.410 
downloaded right before recording this
session<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.470> i<00:02:46.500> don't<00:02:46.680> know<00:02:46.800> if<00:02:47.150> what<00:02:48.150> they've

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
session so i don't know if what they've

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.309 
session so i don't know if what they've
patched<00:02:48.660> exactly<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:50.900> know<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.020> patch<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319

shotguns<00:02:52.709> pretty<00:02:52.980> recently<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:53.610> i<00:02:55.520> think

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
shotguns pretty recently but i think

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.559 
shotguns pretty recently but i think
that<00:02:56.610> was<00:02:56.700> actually<00:02:56.819> know<00:02:57.090> if<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.330> was<00:02:57.450> quite

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
that was actually know if that was quite

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.170 
that was actually know if that was quite
a<00:02:57.630> while<00:02:57.660> ago<00:02:57.810> because<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.230> was<00:02:58.610> before<00:02:59.610> my

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
a while ago because it was before my

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.710 
a while ago because it was before my
last<00:03:00.390> run<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.050> cross<00:03:01.140> live<00:03:01.410> session<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:03.660> i

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.460
