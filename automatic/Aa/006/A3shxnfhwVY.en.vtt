00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
that I wanted to bring to you guys today

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.050 
that I wanted to bring to you guys today
is<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.470> fact<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:31.860> there<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.220> new<00:02:32.580> driver

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
is the fact that there is a new driver

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
is the fact that there is a new driver

tasty project cars and Victor of ran I
don't<00:04:05.190> know<00:04:05.280> what<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.459> last<00:04:05.700> one<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.000> but

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
don't know what that last one is but

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.970 
don't know what that last one is but
project<00:04:06.630> cars<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:06.990> was<00:04:07.110> excited<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.650> see<00:04:07.830> them

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
project cars I was excited to see them

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.040 
project cars I was excited to see them
add<00:04:08.160> in<00:04:08.370> because<00:04:09.330> I've<00:04:09.480> been<00:04:09.630> playing<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:09.930> a

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
add in because I've been playing that a

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.540 
add in because I've been playing that a
fair<00:04:10.380> bit<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:10.830> does<00:04:11.010> need<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.250> little<00:04:11.400> bit

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
fair bit and it does need a little bit

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.310 
fair bit and it does need a little bit
of<00:04:11.610> work<00:04:11.850> as<00:04:12.000> far<00:04:12.180> as<00:04:12.270> SLI<00:04:12.750> is<00:04:12.810> concerned

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
of work as far as SLI is concerned

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.260 
of work as far as SLI is concerned
because<00:04:13.500> it's<00:04:13.800> not<00:04:13.950> scaling<00:04:14.489> tremendously

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
because it's not scaling tremendously

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.909 
because it's not scaling tremendously
well<00:04:15.540> it's<00:04:15.690> only<00:04:15.840> using<00:04:16.169> about<00:04:16.350> fifty<00:04:16.650> percent

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
well it's only using about fifty percent

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.250 
well it's only using about fifty percent
usage<00:04:17.100> on<00:04:17.370> each<00:04:17.520> card<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.720> tested<00:04:19.140> this

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
usage on each card and I tested this

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.930 
usage on each card and I tested this
driver<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.770> they<00:04:19.859> didn't<00:04:20.430> really<00:04:20.549> improve

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
driver and they didn't really improve

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.730 
driver and they didn't really improve
that<00:04:21.060> much<00:04:21.270> at<00:04:21.390> all<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:21.630> game<00:04:21.780> is<00:04:21.930> still<00:04:22.140> not

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
that much at all the game is still not

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.650 
that much at all the game is still not
excellent<00:04:23.280> for<00:04:23.400> SLI<00:04:23.729> but<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.030> performs<00:04:24.479> well

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
excellent for SLI but it performs well

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.060 
excellent for SLI but it performs well
enough<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:25.020> can<00:04:25.080> max<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.530> game<00:04:25.680> out<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:25.979> get

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
enough I can max the game out and get

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.379 
enough I can max the game out and get
over<00:04:26.250> 60<00:04:26.550> FPS<00:04:26.910> and

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
over 60 FPS and

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.570 
over 60 FPS and
Aereo<00:04:27.659> but<00:04:28.439> I'd<00:04:28.560> like<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.860> see<00:04:28.979> them<00:04:29.129> fix<00:04:29.370> that

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
Aereo but I'd like to see them fix that

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.040 
Aereo but I'd like to see them fix that
and<00:04:29.610> be<00:04:30.090> able<00:04:30.150> to<00:04:30.240> get<00:04:30.360> those<00:04:30.449> frames<00:04:30.719> up<00:04:30.870> just

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
and be able to get those frames up just

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.420 
and be able to get those frames up just
a<00:04:31.110> little<00:04:31.259> bit<00:04:31.379> higher<00:04:31.620> because<00:04:31.830> only<00:04:32.099> using

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
a little bit higher because only using

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.890 
a little bit higher because only using
fifty<00:04:32.699> percent<00:04:32.939> of<00:04:33.090> each<00:04:33.180> card<00:04:33.479> is<00:04:33.569> a<00:04:33.629> little

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
fifty percent of each card is a little

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.290 
fifty percent of each card is a little
