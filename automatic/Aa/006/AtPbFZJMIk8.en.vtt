00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 very good chivas is left behind and 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.970
 I hope I'm great perfectly 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.790
 welcome to a new video on my channel 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.400
 we are in a team duel the book 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.049
 barista green phosphorite camouflage 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.299
 delicate and I like but good at this 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.760
 to explain if I'm going to vary with 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.830
 a lot of weapons from one of those from 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.769
 those of those games of those gameplay 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.720
 that they improve because I'm using a 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.109
 bunch of weapons I actually have a class 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.550
 that with the ms mc and with the x pr 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.040
 obviously to try to do something with 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.320
 this weapon and in the middle of the game I 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.000
 I put on that and I spy on killing 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.219
 enough with that is that we're going to catch 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.530
 the laws emissions that's a manga 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.390
 are the times that I think it leaves the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.950
 command only consists of taking it 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.590
 immensely disarming and still and that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.750
 is moving forward only because that is 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.280
 very sat for certain hate when I 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.620
 champion without being aware that I believe that 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.500
 what has been said many times and is the thing that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.300
 most hate the whole call of duty when 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.949
 someone is changing my incision 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.539
 Tactics that I do not give me the same but 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.969
 that you have a north there waiting for me 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.659
 rat coag to make me fauna and I 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.560
 jacket and 600 and kill me 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:13.700
 the worst thing gives me a lot of courage in the end 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.700
 I'm watching this video on Thursday 17th 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.640
 I will be heading to Madrid towards the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.640
 society sprin land you already know that to a 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.359
 event because you are going to be biting the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.459
 eye eye, look, it is practiced and almost 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.829
 it reads it or an event that is going to 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.299
 perform the shopping center and buzz 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.810
 talking about him the whole roll would not have 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:39.739
 the description pim pam and I have many 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.140
 I want to go and see people again 

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:44.450
 that you have not seen today for a long time 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.860
 to meet people who have not yet 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.069
 I know and yes I have contrast with 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.979
 she I remember the showmatch we're going 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:55.399
 to do snipe sniper is 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.349
 here and I choosing the people of 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.709
 public can be quite interesting 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:01.310
 and we'll see how it comes out at the end 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.959
 things 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.060
 now he wins me if he wins me 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.219
 will win because he plays a lot more something 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.340
 although he does not play much golf but 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:13.640
 plays a lot more than me and in the beginning 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.970
 ghana because you're pretty much better at that 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.440
 game that I though I think with playing 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.569
 with the franc all series to which 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.879
 we make from one to one 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.610
 I won and won in one another what 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.620
 We made between 60 and 100 teams one and 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.709
 I think it was a hurry 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.379
 Transactions profiles does not matter 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.420
 I have also bought I hope to record 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.030
 all over there as much as I can I've 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.550
 bought a new camera 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.800
 and teaching to teach is something more 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.470
 forward from that camera I'm super 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.690
 contentment is in fact charging the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.160
 I just opened was going to do a boxing 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.250
 but in the end he started recording the camera 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.560
 for the rest because he did not record it and already 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.989
 I'll say something with that with that new camera 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.319
 in one of these girls that fits me in the 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.420
 palm of the hand and it's a last record 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.880
 1080p and let's go 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.640
 It's an authentic past and I hope to record 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.010
 everything that you can of the event is 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.110
 associated spring land is to program everything 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.630
 what I can and bring you what is good 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.730
 what goes in cártama not what I go 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.489
 appearing is also true that no 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.040
 just to see people that I know that 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.920
 I want to know but to be a while 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.980
 also with you because it is something that 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.510
 I always liked it and in that I 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.480
 I go very well and in fact I remember what 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.650
 in the last 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.870
 final cupcake schubert 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.459
 I remember what 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.510
 they made a surge to the 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.120
 subscribers and if that clip I what 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.099
 they sent and did not use it at all and 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.709
 I have to have to have the clip by 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:02.519
 here so I'll try to put it at the end 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.020
 of the video because I know there are times 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.150
 what 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.210
 is a little more cut when I 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.370
 meeting with people for example from 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:15.120
 New Year's Eve that was already we are already 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.590
 picking up and my friend and just me 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.549
 acknowledged the subscriber and how I have 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.350
 have a nail face and in fact 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.690
 they were compromised the photos or 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.280
 digestion I do not usually be that dull 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.650
 with you in the people any encounter 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.280
 but you have to go to sleep 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.650
 so yes, yes, I try good 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.210
 be like I do not change in fact yes that 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.220
 There are people here on YouTube because they have 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.250
 has his characters has has his 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.340
 paper but I actually am here such and 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.650
 which as I am in my day to day try 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.310
 well I do not know that this is a little bit 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.940
 mirror of what I do so always 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.100
 I have a great time when there are people 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.930
 how good you know me we are casting 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.370
 a triple time 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.080
 that did not come out and it always got me to put 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.890
 good feelings of this kind of 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.740
 events so I hope it continues to follow 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:15.150
 everything the same as I am seeing I have collected 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.530
 a guarantor of the soil and this is the class 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.840

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.790
 made today 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:29.180
 we use when we are playing this this 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.849
 departure does not lead to this class any longer 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.619
