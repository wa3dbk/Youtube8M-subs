one of the standard terms used in the
study<00:00:05.190> of<00:00:05.339> genetics<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.210> word<00:00:06.600> genotype

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
study of genetics is the word genotype

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.250 
study of genetics is the word genotype
it<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.700> combination<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.420> alleles<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:10.050> an

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
it is the combination of alleles that an

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.080 
it is the combination of alleles that an
organism<00:00:10.679> has<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:11.400> always<00:00:11.670> think<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.030> as

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
organism has I always think of it as

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.570 
organism has I always think of it as
simply<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.630> type<00:00:13.080> oh<00:00:13.230> gee<00:00:13.679> pnes<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:14.219> possess

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
simply the type oh gee pnes you possess

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.300 
simply the type oh gee pnes you possess
and<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.780> your<00:00:15.990> genotype<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.830> determines

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
and it's your genotype that determines

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.710 
and it's your genotype that determines
your<00:00:17.460> phenotype<00:00:17.820> what<00:00:18.240> you're<00:00:18.359> showing<00:00:18.480> on

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
your phenotype what you're showing on

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.230 
your phenotype what you're showing on
the<00:00:18.900> outside<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.619> your<00:00:19.650> body<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.580> there's

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the outside of your body so there's

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.420 
the outside of your body so there's
several<00:00:21.539> different<00:00:21.890> combinations<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.130> genes

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
several different combinations of genes

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.099 
several different combinations of genes
that<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.910> use<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.630> could<00:00:24.810> describe

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
that you can use so you could describe

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.720 
that you can use so you could describe
somebody<00:00:25.529> as<00:00:25.650> being<00:00:25.830> homozygous<00:00:26.340> dominant

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
somebody as being homozygous dominant

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.660 
somebody as being homozygous dominant
the<00:00:27.420> root<00:00:27.630> word<00:00:27.810> haaa<00:00:28.080> means<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.650> same<00:00:28.920> zag

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the root word haaa means the same zag

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.279 
the root word haaa means the same zag
refers<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.359> zygote<00:00:30.810> where<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> two

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
refers to the zygote where the two

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.560 
refers to the zygote where the two
different<00:00:31.920> versions<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.430> an<00:00:32.579> allele<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.270> you

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
different versions of an allele that you

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.229 
different versions of an allele that you
have<00:00:33.809> came<00:00:34.350> together<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.430> homozygous

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
have came together and so homozygous

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.420 
have came together and so homozygous
dominant<00:00:36.450> means<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.170> two<00:00:37.410> alleles<00:00:38.250> that

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
dominant means that the two alleles that

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.190 
dominant means that the two alleles that
came<00:00:38.700> together<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.510> are<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.960> same

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
came together in you are the same

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200 
came together in you are the same
dominant<00:00:40.950> means<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.820> they're<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> dominant

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
dominant means that they're the dominant

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.930 
dominant means that they're the dominant
one<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.350> use<00:00:43.559> big<00:00:43.920> R<00:00:44.100> say<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:44.579> example

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
one so if we use big R say for example

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.000 
one so if we use big R say for example
the<00:00:45.030> tongue<00:00:45.329> rolling<00:00:45.570> allele<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.680> would<00:00:46.829> write

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the tongue rolling allele we would write

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.930 
the tongue rolling allele we would write
big<00:00:47.370> R<00:00:47.579> big<00:00:47.820> R<00:00:48.270> remember<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.710> genotypes<00:00:50.640> when

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
big R big R remember with genotypes when

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.639 
big R big R remember with genotypes when
you're<00:00:51.059> writing<00:00:51.390> them<00:00:51.480> out<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:52.199> use<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
you're writing them out you use the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.189 
you're writing them out you use the
first<00:00:53.070> letter<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> dominant<00:00:54.180> trait<00:00:54.420> like

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
first letter of the dominant trait like

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.450 
first letter of the dominant trait like

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
roller versus a non roller you'd use the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.360 
roller versus a non roller you'd use the
letter<00:00:59.940> R<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.480> use<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.199> capital<00:01:01.559> letter<00:01:01.829> for

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
letter R and use the capital letter for

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.160 
letter R and use the capital letter for
the<00:01:02.489> dominant<00:01:02.910> version<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.809> lowercase

the dominant version and the lowercase
version<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.549> recessive<00:01:05.939> somebody's

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
version for the recessive somebody's

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.590

homozygous recessive again homo means
the<00:01:09.810> same<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.500> two<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> same<00:01:11.369> recessives<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
the same so two of the same recessives a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
hetero means other are different so you

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.560 
hetero means other are different so you
have<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.670> two<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.150> different<00:01:24.420> that's

have to have two of the different that's

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.910 
have to have two of the different that's
why<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.750> don't<00:01:24.900> say<00:01:25.080> heterozygous<00:01:25.650> dominant

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
why you don't say heterozygous dominant

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.670 
why you don't say heterozygous dominant
or<00:01:26.280> heterozygous<00:01:26.700> recessive<00:01:27.659> because<00:01:28.200> you

sex<00:01:54.869> chromosome<00:01:55.500> itself<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> woman<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.689> be

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
sex chromosome itself so a woman can be

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.069 
sex chromosome itself so a woman can be
woman<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:00.899> big<00:02:01.200> h<00:02:01.380> big<00:02:01.890> h<00:02:02.100> x<00:02:02.729> big<00:02:03.119> h<00:02:03.270> x<00:02:03.570> big<00:02:03.899> h

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
woman can be big h big h x big h x big h

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.840 
woman can be big h big h x big h x big h
this<00:02:04.469> would<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.770> some<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.070> woman<00:02:05.520> who's

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
this would be some a woman who's

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.680 
this would be some a woman who's
homozygous<00:02:06.450> dominant<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:08.060> hemophilia<00:02:09.060> say

for<00:02:09.989> example<00:02:10.410> or<00:02:10.860> actually<00:02:11.310> she'd<00:02:11.459> have

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
for example or actually she'd have

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.730 
for example or actually she'd have

hemizygous Hayami meaning half so only

hemizygous Hayami meaning half so only
half<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.310> chromosomes<00:02:39.300> came<00:02:39.450> together<00:02:39.630> in

half of the chromosomes came together in

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.260 
half of the chromosomes came together in
that<00:02:40.260> case<00:02:40.500> what<00:02:41.460> if<00:02:41.580> you're<00:02:41.790> talking<00:02:42.060> about

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
that case what if you're talking about

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.750 
that case what if you're talking about
the<00:02:42.420> genotype<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.990> something<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.470> is

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
the genotype of something that is

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.150 
the genotype of something that is
looking<00:02:44.760> at<00:02:44.880> if<00:02:45.270> someone<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.900> has<00:02:46.020> got<00:02:47.010> many

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
looking at if someone that has got many

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.070 
looking at if someone that has got many
traits<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.730> you're<00:02:47.910> looking<00:02:48.210> at<00:02:48.270> say<00:02:48.510> not<00:02:49.050> just

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
traits so you're looking at say not just

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.020 
traits so you're looking at say not just
tongue<00:02:49.560> rolling<00:02:49.830> but<00:02:50.460> whether<00:02:50.730> or<00:02:50.790> not<00:02:50.850> you

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
tongue rolling but whether or not you

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.220 
tongue rolling but whether or not you
have<00:02:51.240> free<00:02:52.050> earlobes<00:02:52.590> are<00:02:52.890> attached<00:02:53.250> earlobes

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
have free earlobes are attached earlobes

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.840 
have free earlobes are attached earlobes
in<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.500> case<00:02:55.740> you<00:02:56.010> just<00:02:56.190> simply<00:02:56.550> write<00:02:56.730> out

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
in that case you just simply write out

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.510 
in that case you just simply write out
all<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.060> letters<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.870> all<00:02:58.620> right<00:02:58.980> big<00:02:59.340> R

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
all the letters so all right big R

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.220 
all the letters so all right big R
little<00:02:59.550> R<00:02:59.880> let's<00:03:00.300> say<00:03:00.450> for<00:03:00.600> example<00:03:00.630> we're

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
little R let's say for example we're

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.130 
little R let's say for example we're
talking<00:03:01.500> about<00:03:01.620> me<00:03:01.830> I'm<00:03:02.150> heterozygous<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.900> can

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
talking about me I'm heterozygous I can

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.930 
talking about me I'm heterozygous I can
roll<00:03:04.290> my<00:03:04.410> tongue<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:05.040> my<00:03:05.190> mom<00:03:05.370> can't<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:05.880> she

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
roll my tongue but my mom can't so she

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.690 
roll my tongue but my mom can't so she
gave<00:03:06.150> me<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.450> little<00:03:06.600> R<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:07.020> have<00:03:07.770> free

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
gave me the little R I have free

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.080 
gave me the little R I have free
earlobes<00:03:09.300> which<00:03:09.570> means<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:10.050> they<00:03:10.320> are<00:03:10.530> not

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
earlobes which means that they are not

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.700 
earlobes which means that they are not
stuck<00:03:12.090> into<00:03:12.270> my<00:03:12.390> jawline<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:12.960> this<00:03:13.230> they're

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
stuck into my jawline like this they're

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.370 
stuck into my jawline like this they're
free<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:14.850> I've<00:03:15.150> got<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.420> big<00:03:15.750> E<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:16.170> let's

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
free so I've got a big E but let's

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.730 
free so I've got a big E but let's
suppose<00:03:16.590> my<00:03:16.800> dad<00:03:17.040> gave<00:03:17.760> me<00:03:17.790> his<00:03:18.740> attached

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
suppose my dad gave me his attached

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.080 
suppose my dad gave me his attached
earlobe<00:03:20.220> gene<00:03:20.490> but<00:03:21.380> I<00:03:22.460> am<00:03:23.460> NOT<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> hemophiliac

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
earlobe gene but I am NOT a hemophiliac

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.520 
earlobe gene but I am NOT a hemophiliac
so<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.330> is<00:03:27.450> how<00:03:27.570> you<00:03:27.630> write<00:03:27.930> out<00:03:27.960> somebody's

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
so this is how you write out somebody's

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.740 
so this is how you write out somebody's
genotype<00:03:29.100> would<00:03:29.610> you<00:03:29.760> then<00:03:29.910> say<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.330> person

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
genotype would you then say this person

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.120 
genotype would you then say this person
is<00:03:30.840> homozygous<00:03:31.260> dominant<00:03:31.620> for<00:03:31.920> all<00:03:31.980> those

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
is homozygous dominant for all those

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.940 
is homozygous dominant for all those
other<00:03:32.310> things<00:03:32.520> or<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:33.300> heterozygous<00:03:33.950> usually

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
other things or a heterozygous usually

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.860 
other things or a heterozygous usually
not<00:03:35.100> if<00:03:35.670> you're<00:03:35.880> going<00:03:36.150> into<00:03:36.390> more<00:03:36.540> than<00:03:36.720> one

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
not if you're going into more than one

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.410 
not if you're going into more than one
gene<00:03:37.230> people<00:03:37.590> just<00:03:37.860> say<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.250> I'll<00:03:38.880> use<00:03:39.270> the

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
gene people just say and I'll use the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.420 
gene people just say and I'll use the
letters<00:03:39.750> because<00:03:40.350> that's<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.680> easy<00:03:40.860> way<00:03:41.160> and

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
letters because that's the easy way and

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.230 
letters because that's the easy way and
I<00:03:41.790> like<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.900> way

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
I like it that way

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.600 
I like it that way
you

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610
