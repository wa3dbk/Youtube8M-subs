00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
enduro type conditions it's not just

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.999

gentle<00:01:57.659> rides<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.350> road<00:01:58.560> even<00:01:58.799> though<00:01:58.950> I

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
gentle rides on the road even though I

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.969 
gentle rides on the road even though I

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
check it out one more thing is the

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.350 
check it out one more thing is the
sizing<00:05:02.680> on<00:05:02.740> these<00:05:02.920> does<00:05:03.190> run<00:05:03.520> a<00:05:03.700> little<00:05:04.060> bit

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
sizing on these does run a little bit

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.780 
sizing on these does run a little bit
small<00:05:04.870> so<00:05:05.260> if<00:05:05.500> you<00:05:05.800> are<00:05:05.980> if<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.310> wear<00:05:06.520> like<00:05:06.730> a

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
small so if you are if you wear like a

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.600 
small so if you are if you wear like a
large<00:05:07.360> t-shirt<00:05:07.780> buy<00:05:08.740> yourself<00:05:09.130> an<00:05:09.220> extra

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
large t-shirt buy yourself an extra

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.150 
large t-shirt buy yourself an extra
large<00:05:09.790> set<00:05:10.060> of<00:05:10.090> armor<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:11.260> bad<00:05:11.860> thing<00:05:12.130> is

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
large set of armor and the bad thing is

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.910 
large set of armor and the bad thing is
is<00:05:12.430> they<00:05:12.550> don't<00:05:12.730> they<00:05:13.360> got<00:05:13.510> a<00:05:13.540> mosquito<00:05:13.920> they

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
is they don't they got a mosquito they

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.790 
is they don't they got a mosquito they
don't<00:05:15.130> go<00:05:15.340> to<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.640> very<00:05:16.180> big<00:05:16.480> size<00:05:16.750> on<00:05:17.140> the

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
don't go to a very big size on the

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.950 
don't go to a very big size on the
Amazon<00:05:18.160> website<00:05:18.370> or<00:05:18.790> on<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.090> TMS<00:05:19.510> website<00:05:19.930> I

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
Amazon website or on the TMS website I

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.330 
Amazon website or on the TMS website I
think<00:05:20.200> they<00:05:20.290> go<00:05:20.410> to<00:05:20.470> like<00:05:20.650> triple<00:05:21.010> extra-large

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
think they go to like triple extra-large

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.280 
think they go to like triple extra-large
but<00:05:22.000> even<00:05:22.240> then<00:05:22.360> that's<00:05:22.510> probably<00:05:22.930> like<00:05:23.080> an

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
but even then that's probably like an

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.760 
but even then that's probably like an
you<00:05:23.980> know<00:05:24.070> an<00:05:24.100> extra-large<00:05:24.850> in<00:05:25.770> American
