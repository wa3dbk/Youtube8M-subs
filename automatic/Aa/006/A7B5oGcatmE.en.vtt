you're about to do so for instance what

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.750 
you're about to do so for instance what
I'm<00:01:09.960> saying<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.710> if<00:01:10.830> they're<00:01:11.010> high-profile

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760

and<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.180> know<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:12.630> professional<00:01:13.170> work

and they know what professional work

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.800 
and they know what professional work
looks<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.710> my<00:01:14.610> concern<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.330> they<00:01:15.600> don't

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
looks like my concern is that they don't

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.630 
looks like my concern is that they don't
take<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.320> particular<00:01:16.710> project<00:01:17.220> very

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
somebody they're doing a favor for

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.310 
somebody they're doing a favor for
because<00:01:27.150> you're<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.630> starting<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
because you're just starting out and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.539 
because you're just starting out and
you'll<00:01:28.439> probably<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.189> exposure

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
you'll probably do it for the exposure

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.580 
you'll probably do it for the exposure
even<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.509> these<00:01:30.750> words<00:01:30.990> come<00:01:31.200> out<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.380> my<00:01:31.439> mouth

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590

it's<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.130> little<00:01:32.369> bit<00:01:32.579> annoying<00:01:33.030> because<00:01:33.390> you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
it's a little bit annoying because you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.620 
it's a little bit annoying because you
would<00:01:34.320> never<00:01:34.470> ask<00:01:34.860> your<00:01:35.420> accountant<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.450> do

and<00:02:24.020> you<00:02:24.500> know<00:02:24.620> we<00:02:24.770> used<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:25.010> use<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:25.280> fancy

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
and you know we used to use this fancy

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.730 
and you know we used to use this fancy
word<00:02:25.940> for<00:02:26.240> it<00:02:26.330> called<00:02:26.540> pro<00:02:26.870> bono<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:27.590> guess

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
word for it called pro bono and I guess

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.740 
word for it called pro bono and I guess
because<00:02:27.920> pro<00:02:28.280> bono<00:02:28.610> sounds<00:02:29.000> really<00:02:29.270> Latin<00:02:29.630> or

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
because pro bono sounds really Latin or

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.540 
because pro bono sounds really Latin or
something<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:30.470> really<00:02:30.830> because<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.280> applied

something it really because it applied
to<00:02:31.600> nonprofits<00:02:32.600> organizations<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:34.610> I've

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
to nonprofits organizations and I've

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.030 
to nonprofits organizations and I've
always<00:02:35.720> had<00:02:35.870> trouble<00:02:36.110> getting<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.620> respect

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
always had trouble getting the respect

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.620 
always had trouble getting the respect
from<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.310> client<00:02:37.610> let's<00:02:37.790> say<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:37.970> do<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.390> job

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
from the client let's say you do the job

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.180 
from the client let's say you do the job
and<00:02:38.990> they're<00:02:39.200> not<00:02:39.290> really<00:02:39.470> even<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.770> client<00:02:40.100> cuz

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
and they're not really even a client cuz

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.250 
and they're not really even a client cuz
they're<00:02:40.310> not<00:02:40.430> paying<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.910> you<00:02:41.420> still<00:02:41.720> have<00:02:41.750> to

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
they're not paying you you still have to

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.860 
they're not paying you you still have to
behave<00:02:42.530> like<00:02:42.770> their<00:02:43.250> employee<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.030> they<00:02:44.690> have

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
behave like their employee and they have

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.960 
behave like their employee and they have
expectations<00:02:45.260> that<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:45.950> client<00:02:46.430> will<00:02:46.550> have<00:02:46.790> on

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
expectations that a client will have on

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.790 
expectations that a client will have on
you<00:02:47.090> during<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.570> course<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.260> job<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.740> I

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
you during the course of the job and I

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.230 
you during the course of the job and I
think<00:02:48.980> that's<00:02:49.160> where<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.490> gets<00:02:49.580> really<00:02:49.880> tough

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
think that's where it gets really tough

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.730 
think that's where it gets really tough
and<00:02:50.390> then<00:02:50.540> when<00:02:50.660> you're<00:02:50.810> done<00:02:51.020> with<00:02:51.320> this<00:02:51.470> real

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
and then when you're done with this real

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.530 
and then when you're done with this real
high-profile<00:02:52.459> thing<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:53.000> got<00:02:53.120> your<00:02:53.300> foot<00:02:53.510> in

high-profile thing that got your foot in

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.290 
high-profile thing that got your foot in
the<00:02:53.690> door<00:02:53.720> then<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:54.890> up<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.940> do<00:02:56.060> all

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
the door then it's up to you to do all

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.360 
the door then it's up to you to do all
the<00:02:56.720> footwork<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.350> try<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.620> promote<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.190> work

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
the footwork to try to promote the work

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.000 
the footwork to try to promote the work
that<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:58.730> did<00:02:58.940> for<00:02:59.000> this<00:02:59.780> client<00:03:00.290> pro<00:03:00.770> bono

fixed<00:06:15.110> so<00:06:15.260> you<00:06:15.320> might<00:06:15.650> trade<00:06:16.070> some<00:06:16.640> of<00:06:16.670> your

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
fixed so you might trade some of your

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.580 
fixed so you might trade some of your
beef<00:06:17.090> jerky<00:06:17.480> for<00:06:17.510> a<00:06:17.810> new<00:06:18.050> roof<00:06:18.260> and<00:06:18.410> I<00:06:18.530> know

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
beef jerky for a new roof and I know

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.200 
beef jerky for a new roof and I know
this<00:06:18.740> is<00:06:18.860> a<00:06:18.890> ridiculous<00:06:19.460> comparison<00:06:20.030> but<00:06:20.180> I

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
this is a ridiculous comparison but I

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.600 
this is a ridiculous comparison but I
hope<00:06:20.750> you<00:06:20.840> get<00:06:20.990> my<00:06:21.080> point<00:06:21.350> my<00:06:22.040> point<00:06:22.070> is<00:06:22.430> is

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
hope you get my point my point is is

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.940 
hope you get my point my point is is
that<00:06:22.820> doing<00:06:23.570> a<00:06:23.660> trade<00:06:24.020> out<00:06:24.050> can<00:06:24.410> be<00:06:24.530> different

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
that doing a trade out can be different

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.980 
that doing a trade out can be different
and<00:06:25.160> so<00:06:25.550> for<00:06:25.760> instance<00:06:26.180> this<00:06:26.390> works<00:06:26.630> really

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
and so for instance this works really

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.600 
and so for instance this works really
well<00:06:27.290> with<00:06:27.470> people<00:06:27.770> in<00:06:27.860> our<00:06:27.920> business<00:06:28.310> so<00:06:28.490> if
