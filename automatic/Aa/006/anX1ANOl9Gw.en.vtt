00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 people what is going on like a new episode 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.290
 built by animals blogs and up there 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.360
 my main channel videos often I hardly 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.160
 have time over private things or 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.440
 I use personal things to speak 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.820
 just my block channel around mine 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.279
 to get rid of thoughts 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.050
 and yes today there are two days past 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.279
 who would like to talk to you 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.350
 and I have lately 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.519
 many asked where reza is and that 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.650
 of course because he is in the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.910
 last videos was no longer there and 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.800
 Of course many asked themselves what 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.890
 there los reza why he does not anymore 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.969
 with and I try one now 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.250
 to give an explanation what exactly 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.890
 has happened 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.129
 it's right that 2013 reese a very 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.360
 has played many videos with me 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.489
 Unfortunately, this has developed so 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.039
 I realized that we both too 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.170
 different are therefore on private 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.030
 level and also what the video thing 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.670
 there were more often concerns 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.180
 discrepancies how simple how should i 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.370
 say different views 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.530
 You can say that about life and life 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.899
 also as we imagine the videos 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.400
 and I say so if so private 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.080
 does not fit then it is a better 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.400
 not getting more videos together 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.110
 I try to explain it this way 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.320
 if you make video with someone then 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.119
 This is often very helpful when you look at yourself 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.100
 understands well and if you have a certain 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.320
 confidence day because you already there 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.759
 works closer together and if this 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.400
 Trust is simply not there anymore 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.509
 then it's just not cool if you are 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.950
 working together 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.540
 ok myself a bit awkward 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.549
 but I hope you understand 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.990
 what i say i want to be honest 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.030
 Also, do not say so 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.590
 discrepancies more precisely because 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.330
 I do not talk about it publicly 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.340
 any person bad 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.930
 In any case, I am very grateful 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.520
 for being me like that last year 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.930
 supports but you know that 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.670
 maybe also from her private life 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.890
 you are friends with someone and 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.510
 then develop into things or it 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.070
 happen things where you say in the end 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.170
 okay maybe it's better if we do 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.910
 go separate ways and so it was 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.170
 also with me in the reeser I can still 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.710
 follow if many of you him 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.050
 Do not miss a question but ultimately 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.270
 that is the main channel even if it is now 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.740
 sounds stupid and I have to go to the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.300
 thing so well I hope so yes 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.890
 somehow understanding that and the 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.479
 second thing I talk to you about 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.880
 want is the matter with detective 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.590
 conan and there is reza included 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.270
 First of all, many still ask 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.620
 were once the second part come out and 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.270
 in my opinion , I had the belief 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.560
 I answered twice already once in 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.600
 a video and even on 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.500
 facebook i answer that now 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.240
 last truth 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.060
 I can not keep this up 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.550
 answer new ones because that is 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.170
 exhausting i hope you see that now 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.820
 Somehow it is so in every case 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.740
 this video so many people played with 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.020
 and that I have all the people 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.130
 getting together is really difficult me 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.170
 would have thought of that before too 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.430
 because so many people are in a day 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.230
 getting together is just fucking 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.760
 hard because the one with school 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.560
 are busy work or a 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.090
 other private I have from it 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.550
 I never learned a big one again 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.930
 split video into two parts yes it will 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.610
 I'm so sorry I do not know if 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.590
 that eventually realizable it the 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.269
 second part of them was now reeser 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.320
 no longer so involved in this channel 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.900
 is as it once was 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.780
 So let's have a look at the future 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.760
 bring and yes and that has it all 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.739
 good to clear my soul 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.140
 Otherwise I will not be able to come to the 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.209
 videos and just switch in the 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.860
 comments on the whole thing thinks 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.910
 I would be interested because I 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.470
 think that's pretty cool when we are 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.580
 with each other like that 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.290
 make music even if it is not really 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.970
 personally is over the internet though 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.860
 I think that's cool that we already have one 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.570
 small communities are and you often 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.850
 commented under my videos and 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.920
 so try many times as it's just too 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.870
 answer or at least read and 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.940
 that have the video now in a video too 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.490
 I thank you for that 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.490
 watch and especially
