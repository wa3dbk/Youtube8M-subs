00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:03.910 
essentially so if you shoot at the
radiator<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.200> bullets<00:02:03.469> get<00:02:03.560> deflected

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
radiator the bullets get deflected

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.169 
radiator the bullets get deflected
downward<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.579> it's<00:02:04.670> not<00:02:04.789> going<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:04.969> cause<00:02:05.149> a

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
downward and it's not going to cause a

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.240 
downward and it's not going to cause a
big<00:02:05.299> impact<00:02:05.719> so<00:02:06.020> we're<00:02:06.709> able<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:06.950> keep<00:02:07.130> the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
big impact so we're able to keep the

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.460 
big impact so we're able to keep the
