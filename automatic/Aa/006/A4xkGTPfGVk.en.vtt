was in chaos we had 800,000 jobs lost in

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.130 
was in chaos we had 800,000 jobs lost in
that<00:00:32.820> first<00:00:33.149> month<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> Obama

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
that first month of the Obama

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.590 
that first month of the Obama
administration<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.329> unemployment<00:00:36.329> would

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
administration and unemployment would

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.020 
administration and unemployment would
peak<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.050> few<00:00:37.260> months<00:00:37.380> later<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.950> ten<00:00:38.579> percent

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
peak a few months later at ten percent

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.880 
peak a few months later at ten percent
so<00:00:39.600> we're<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.809> real<00:00:39.989> trouble<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.739> auto

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
so we're in real trouble the auto

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040 
so we're in real trouble the auto
industry<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:41.460> collapsing<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.629> housing

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
industry was collapsing the housing

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.990 
industry was collapsing the housing
industry<00:00:43.170> was<00:00:43.649> starting<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.100> collapse<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.670> we

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
industry was starting to collapse and we

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.540 
industry was starting to collapse and we
were<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.210> very<00:00:45.360> difficult<00:00:45.780> straits<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:47.280> saw

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
were in very difficult straits and I saw

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.299 
were in very difficult straits and I saw
over<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> next<00:00:48.270> several<00:00:48.480> years

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
over the next several years

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.560 
over the next several years
stabilization<00:00:50.309> come<00:00:50.520> back<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> financial

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
stabilization come back in the financial

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.930 
stabilization come back in the financial
community<00:00:51.980> housing<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.370> starting<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
community housing is now starting to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.880 
community housing is now starting to
pick<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.149> after<00:00:54.600> four<00:00:55.020> years<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.559> starting

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
pick up after four years it's starting

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.490 
pick up after four years it's starting
to<00:00:55.980> pick<00:00:56.160> up<00:00:56.360> consumer<00:00:57.360> confidence<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:58.050> rising

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
to pick up consumer confidence is rising

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.920 
to pick up consumer confidence is rising
and<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> think<00:00:59.390> generally<00:01:00.390> we've<00:01:00.539> come<00:01:00.809> out

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and so I think generally we've come out

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.330 
and so I think generally we've come out
of<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> dive<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.649> we're<00:01:01.770> starting<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.219> gain

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
of the dive and we're starting to gain

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.320 
of the dive and we're starting to gain
altitude<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:03.480> doesn't<00:01:03.840> mean<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.199> are<00:01:05.330> problem

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
altitude it doesn't mean we are problem

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.060 
altitude it doesn't mean we are problem
solved<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:06.990> are<00:01:07.080> lots<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.409> problems<00:01:07.710> still

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
solved there are lots of problems still

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.100 
solved there are lots of problems still
out<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.060> unemployment<00:01:09.270> rate<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.900> too

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
out there the unemployment rate is too

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.080 
out there the unemployment rate is too
high<00:01:10.140> people<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.100> hurting<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.670> housing

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
high people are so hurting and housing

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.870 
high people are so hurting and housing
but<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> see<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.710> are<00:01:13.920> starting<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.400> rise

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
but I see that we are starting to rise

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.780 
but I see that we are starting to rise
up<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.360> also<00:01:16.020> saw<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.650> president<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.490> us<00:01:17.610> out

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
up I also saw the president get us out

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.820 
up I also saw the president get us out
of<00:01:17.820> one<00:01:18.119> war<00:01:18.330> start<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.290> get<00:01:19.409> us<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.710> a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
of one war start to get us out of a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.859 
of one war start to get us out of a
second<00:01:20.220> war<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.670> did<00:01:20.970> not<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.299> us<00:01:21.450> into<00:01:21.750> any

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
second war and did not get us into any

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.679 
second war and did not get us into any
new<00:01:22.110> Wars<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.790> finally<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> think<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
new Wars and finally I think that the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.420 
new Wars and finally I think that the
actions<00:01:25.110> he<00:01:25.170> has<00:01:25.350> taken<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:25.920> respect<00:01:26.070> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
actions he has taken with respect to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.039 
actions he has taken with respect to
protecting<00:01:26.939> us<00:01:27.060> from<00:01:27.090> terrorism<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.900> been

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
protecting us from terrorism have been

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.039 
protecting us from terrorism have been
very<00:01:28.259> very<00:01:28.439> solid<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.329> think<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.869> ought

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
very very solid and so I think we ought

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.440 
very very solid and so I think we ought
to<00:01:31.170> keep<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> track<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.549> with

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
to keep on the track that we are on with

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.149 
to keep on the track that we are on with
respect<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> Governor<00:01:34.409> Romney<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:34.979> the
