the<00:04:10.400> full<00:04:10.730> heart<00:04:10.940> punch<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.390> couldn't<00:04:11.660> do

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
the full heart punch you couldn't do

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.470 
the full heart punch you couldn't do
that<00:04:11.750> because<00:04:12.280> with<00:04:13.280> it<00:04:13.310> being<00:04:14.000> full<00:04:14.330> the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
that because with it being full the

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.120 
that because with it being full the
chair<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.840> punch<00:04:15.140> through<00:04:15.380> both<00:04:15.560> layers<00:04:15.770> so

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
chair you punch through both layers so

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.520 
chair you punch through both layers so
that's<00:04:16.310> why<00:04:16.459> we<00:04:16.580> needed<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.850> big<00:04:17.090> shot<00:04:17.530> okay

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.900 
that's why we needed the big shot okay
