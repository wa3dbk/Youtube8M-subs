00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
you know maybe a 15-second finish which

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.530 
you know maybe a 15-second finish which
is<00:02:20.540> ok<00:02:21.160> but<00:02:22.160> it's<00:02:22.370> very<00:02:22.550> pure<00:02:23.120> which<00:02:23.420> is

the<00:02:28.820> better<00:02:28.940> ones<00:02:29.030> but<00:02:30.040> not<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.070> cocktail<00:02:31.940> wine

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240
