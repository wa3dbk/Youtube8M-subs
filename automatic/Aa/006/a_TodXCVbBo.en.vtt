Malley we are taking a look at a couple

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.539 
Malley we are taking a look at a couple
of<00:00:12.300> speakers<00:00:12.450> from<00:00:12.660> eminence<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:14.099> two

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
of speakers from eminence the two

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.849 
of speakers from eminence the two
speakers<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:14.969> make<00:00:15.120> up<00:00:15.269> their<00:00:15.509> FDM<00:00:16.109> line<00:00:16.410> F<00:00:16.710> D

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
speakers that make up their FDM line F D

M<00:00:16.980> stands<00:00:17.279> for<00:00:17.369> flux<00:00:17.850> density<00:00:18.449> modulation<00:00:19.020> so

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
M stands for flux density modulation so

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.359 
M stands for flux density modulation so
what<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.039> that

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
what is that

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.210 
what is that
well<00:00:20.939> it's<00:00:21.600> sort<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.900> complicated<00:00:22.109> term<00:00:22.680> for

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
well it's sort of a complicated term for

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.420 
well it's sort of a complicated term for
a<00:00:23.430> very<00:00:23.850> simple<00:00:24.630> electromagnetic<00:00:25.430> function

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
a very simple electromagnetic function

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.939 
a very simple electromagnetic function
this<00:00:27.300> dial<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.410> back<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.769> speaker

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
this dial on the back of the speaker

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.370 
this dial on the back of the speaker
here<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.730> attached<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.240> screw<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.929> when<00:00:31.260> you

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
here is attached to a screw and when you

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.920 
here is attached to a screw and when you
turn<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.189> moves<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.969> magnet<00:00:33.390> back<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
turn it it moves the magnet back and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.080 
turn it it moves the magnet back and
forth<00:00:34.340> relative<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> position<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
forth relative to the position of the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.260 
forth relative to the position of the
voice<00:00:36.329> coil<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.129> moves<00:00:38.430> back<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
voice coil and as it moves back and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.540 
voice coil and as it moves back and
forth<00:00:39.510> through<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.170> electromagnetic<00:00:41.010> field

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
forth through that electromagnetic field

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
forth through that electromagnetic field
it<00:00:41.969> changes<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.690> voicing<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.860> speaker

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
it changes the voicing of the speaker

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.150 
it changes the voicing of the speaker
this<00:00:45.570> sort<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.840> response<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> speaker<00:00:46.829> but

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
this sort of response of the speaker but

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.069 
this sort of response of the speaker but
it<00:00:47.280> also<00:00:47.460> offers<00:00:47.850> up<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.239> nine<00:00:48.480> decibels<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
it also offers up to nine decibels of

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.260 
it also offers up to nine decibels of
attenuation<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.969> sort<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.149> an

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
attenuation so this is sort of an

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.229 
attenuation so this is sort of an
alternate<00:00:51.750> way<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.260> achieving<00:00:53.239> more

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
alternate way of achieving more

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.080 
alternate way of achieving more
reasonable<00:00:55.020> recording<00:00:55.590> volumes<00:00:56.010> sort<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.030> an

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
reasonable recording volumes sort of an

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.029 
reasonable recording volumes sort of an
alternative<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> hotplate<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
alternative to like the hotplate and

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.040 
alternative to like the hotplate and
other<00:00:59.219> sort<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.820> master<00:01:00.359> volume<00:01:00.629> ish

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
other sort of master volume ish

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.080 
other sort of master volume ish
attenuators<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.160> basically<00:01:02.489> lets<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> run

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
attenuators it basically lets you run

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.750 
attenuators it basically lets you run
your<00:01:03.329> tube<00:01:03.600> amplifier<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.189> saturation

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
your tube amplifier at the saturation

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.109 
your tube amplifier at the saturation
level<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.540> yields<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> best<00:01:07.650> tone<00:01:07.979> but<00:01:08.909> at

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
level that yields the best tone but at

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.340 
level that yields the best tone but at
nine<00:01:10.020> decibels<00:01:10.710> lower<00:01:11.180> so<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
nine decibels lower so this is the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.770 
nine decibels lower so this is the
British<00:01:13.830> voiced<00:01:14.280> version<00:01:15.000> there's<00:01:15.180> also<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
British voiced version there's also the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.870 
British voiced version there's also the
Patriot<00:01:16.770> maverick<00:01:17.159> which<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.549> u.s.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
Patriot maverick which is the u.s.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.940 
Patriot maverick which is the u.s.
voiced<00:01:18.210> speaker<00:01:18.930> we're<00:01:19.290> gonna<00:01:19.409> load<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.740> guy

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
voiced speaker we're gonna load this guy

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.580 
voiced speaker we're gonna load this guy
into<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> blackstar<00:01:21.299> HT<00:01:21.420> studio<00:01:21.990> 20<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.409> hear

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
into a blackstar HT studio 20 and hear

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:49.180 
into a blackstar HT studio 20 and hear
how<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.799> sounds

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.490 

so<00:01:50.190> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.370> hear<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:51.150> really<00:01:51.660> an<00:01:52.200> excellent

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
so you can hear it's really an excellent

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.600 
so you can hear it's really an excellent
choice<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:53.010> same<00:01:53.960> punchy<00:01:54.960> focused<00:01:55.610> mall

a<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.360> bit<00:02:00.480> right<00:02:01.260> now<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
a little bit right now we have the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.510 
a little bit right now we have the
speaker<00:02:02.730> on<00:02:02.910> max<00:02:03.630> volume<00:02:04.310> now<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:07.490> turn<00:02:08.490> our

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
speaker on max volume now if we turn our

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.010 
speaker on max volume now if we turn our
dial<00:02:09.300> here

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020

first<00:02:13.860> off<00:02:14.010> you'll<00:02:14.160> notice<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.520> big<00:02:14.760> drop<00:02:14.970> in

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
first off you'll notice a big drop in
