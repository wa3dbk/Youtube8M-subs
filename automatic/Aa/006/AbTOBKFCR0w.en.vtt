00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.760
 well I feel very happy here 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.320
 when coming to Mexico since my coach 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.199
 is the professor rodolfo gómez 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.710
 which came planning from the 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.560
 January we were not 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.440

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.240
 marathon 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:35.230
 well the route was very excellent for 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:39.820
 me because we have been training a 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.650
 height of 3200 which is higher from here than 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.960
 Mexico City 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.329
 also the weather was lent because it made 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.929
 a little cold not some parts where 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.910
 I felt more confident more comfortable that I 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.570
 I think it was 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.910
 what in this opportunity to win the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.880

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:35.180
 this year the training was not very 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.460
 hard since we live to 3200 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.050

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.870

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.210
