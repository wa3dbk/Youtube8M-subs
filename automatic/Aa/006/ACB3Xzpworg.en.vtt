00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 good evening mister good evening 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.350
 I would like to say to the public 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.080
 Italian who is not only Victor Hugo 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.769
 Morales and Victor Hugo Morales wrote 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.289
 a barron book eats cries in the desert 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.699
 he is some things I know 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.490
 some things I read some things about her 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.100
 I heard some things I imagine he is 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.680
 carlo sole's heir the most beautiful voice 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.859
 of Russian football and he and immediately after 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.689
 at the beginning to the 80's and I imagine 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.460
 that this voice is fantastic because it has one 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.620
 fantastic voice that allows him to 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.110
 things that high commentators don't 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.480
 are allowed to be born in a montevideo 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.760
 where long nights were spent 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.649
 montevideo is suitable for long notes I 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.940
 I envy you so much because in one 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.260
 previous life I tried too 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.840
 do the commentator even if in a 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.640
 another context and then I wanted to say that 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.379
 I've heard it 100,000 times in yours 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.820
 commentary but there are some that I do 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.860
 they hit more than others 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.059
 the cosmic ram obviously puts it 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.210
 in the history of the literature of the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.600
 sport, however, Argentina's goal against 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.309
 the greece in the united states in my opinion 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.820
 in some ways he enjoyed it more 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.780
 because training has been done 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.490
 of the silver lady cÃ©leste that evening 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.960
 he appointed them to everyone and every time he 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.080
 touched does not mean that he enjoyed himself 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.479
 more was heard crying at goal than 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.280
 their trouble has taken ago Denmark ie 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.500
 as if he suffered emotionally from her 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.850
 matches even if it is not directly 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.670
 involved because she suffers humanly for 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.780
 teams and for me this is worth more than 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.640
 anything that a commentator 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.049
 face in another context I don't have it 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.880
 I only ask a question 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:40.259
 myth lake what can I say 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.439
 and the most incredible moment before 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.159
 a room a room a room 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.070
 I have lived I believe you are the words 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.970
 more beautiful than I have skull pathos up on 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.460
 my career 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.030

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.439

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.250
 this a prize a distinction that 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.710
 We try 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.630

 distance from where you for a fillet of

 fish so you can continue after I find it 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.960
 it would be too much even for federico buffa 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.790

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.410
