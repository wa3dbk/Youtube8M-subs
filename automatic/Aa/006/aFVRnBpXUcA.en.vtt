video I'll be covering a review of the T

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.280 
video I'll be covering a review of the T
and<00:00:08.189> 31<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.760> actual<00:00:09.090> use<00:00:09.300> during<00:00:09.660> camping

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
and 31 in actual use during camping

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.620 
and 31 in actual use during camping
conditions<00:00:10.740> so<00:00:11.000> currently<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.059> actually<00:00:12.269> have

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
conditions so currently I actually have

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.340 
conditions so currently I actually have
a<00:00:12.840> wetland<00:00:13.469> sir<00:00:13.710> h7<00:00:14.219> all<00:00:14.519> my<00:00:14.730> head<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.389> full

spa mode and on the lowest mode as

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.429 
spa mode and on the lowest mode as
anyone<00:00:19.590> who's<00:00:19.830> ever<00:00:20.010> been<00:00:20.279> camping<00:00:20.460> before

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
anyone who's ever been camping before

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.870 
anyone who's ever been camping before
those<00:00:22.439> headlamps<00:00:23.220> are<00:00:23.340> completely

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
those headlamps are completely

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.580 
those headlamps are completely
indispensable<00:00:24.300> but<00:00:24.779> again<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.080> wanted<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> give

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
indispensable but again I wanted to give

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.070 
indispensable but again I wanted to give
actual<00:00:26.340> reward<00:00:26.730> usage<00:00:27.510> or<00:00:27.660> at<00:00:27.750> least

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
actual reward usage or at least

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.769 
actual reward usage or at least
simulated<00:00:28.849> of<00:00:29.849> how<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.210> would<00:00:30.330> feel<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.539> to

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
simulated of how it would feel like to

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.060 
simulated of how it would feel like to
use<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> flashlight<00:00:31.500> versus<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:33.660> LM<00:00:34.020> now<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.920> we

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
use a flashlight versus the LM now as we

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.310 
use a flashlight versus the LM now as we
know<00:00:35.100> obviously<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.969> know<00:00:36.000> these<00:00:36.360> lights

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
know obviously you know these lights

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.200 
know obviously you know these lights
that<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.800> will<00:00:37.980> be<00:00:38.100> covering<00:00:38.399> are<00:00:38.640> all<00:00:38.969> capable

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
that I will be covering are all capable

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.500 
that I will be covering are all capable
of<00:00:39.540> pretty<00:00:39.840> high<00:00:40.430> lumens<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.520> actual<00:00:42.090> camping

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
of pretty high lumens for actual camping

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.810 
of pretty high lumens for actual camping
conditions<00:00:42.930> right<00:00:43.170> most<00:00:43.350> probably<00:00:44.340> overkill

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
conditions right most probably overkill

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.900 
conditions right most probably overkill
but<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.649> that's<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.010> wanted<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.340> focus<00:00:47.489> on

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
but so that's what I wanted to focus on

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.330 
but so that's what I wanted to focus on
what<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.930> would<00:00:49.050> feel<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.710> use<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
what it would feel like to use the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.360 
what it would feel like to use the
lowermost<00:00:50.850> or<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> lower<00:00:51.480> settings<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.370> put

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
lowermost or the lower settings and put

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.340 
lowermost or the lower settings and put
it<00:00:53.460> after<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.180> without<00:00:54.539> further<00:00:54.809> ado<00:00:55.110> let

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
it after you so without further ado let

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.490 
it after you so without further ado let
me<00:00:55.410> get<00:00:55.590> my<00:00:55.739> hand<00:00:56.039> lamp<00:00:56.219> shut<00:00:56.370> off<00:00:57.440> I'm<00:00:58.440> sure

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
me get my hand lamp shut off I'm sure

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.270 
me get my hand lamp shut off I'm sure
that<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> T<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.550> 31<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.690> low<00:01:00.809> setting<00:01:01.280> flip

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
that the T and 31 is on low setting flip

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.130 
that the T and 31 is on low setting flip
it<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:03.799> okay<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.610> as<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.510> see<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.960> is

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
it on okay so as you can see this is

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.170 
it on okay so as you can see this is
extremely<00:01:07.770> typing<00:01:08.250> right<00:01:08.460> nothing<00:01:08.939> at<00:01:09.030> all

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
extremely typing right nothing at all

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.550 
extremely typing right nothing at all
like<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.950> Y<00:01:10.950> floody<00:01:11.520> profile<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.750> lab<00:01:13.200> but

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
like the Y floody profile of the lab but

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.950 
like the Y floody profile of the lab but
again<00:01:13.939> well<00:01:14.939> let's<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.330> say<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.810> is

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
again well let's just say that this is

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.899 
again well let's just say that this is
the<00:01:16.110> only<00:01:16.259> light<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.549> needed

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the only light you have and you needed

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.330 
the only light you have and you needed
to<00:01:18.060> look<00:01:18.360> around<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:18.720> something<00:01:19.020> now<00:01:20.009> there

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
to look around for something now there

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.609 
to look around for something now there
is<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.640> thing<00:01:20.810> given<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.840> extremely<00:01:22.470> low

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
is one thing given the extremely low

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.390 
is one thing given the extremely low
light<00:01:22.830> conditions<00:01:23.310> involved<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.030> am<00:01:24.540> at<00:01:24.750> ISO

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
light conditions involved I am at ISO

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.210 
light conditions involved I am at ISO
6400<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.540> these<00:01:27.869> films<00:01:28.259> will<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.920> grainy

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
6400 so these films will be very grainy

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.490 
6400 so these films will be very grainy
despite<00:01:29.820> being<00:01:30.000> recording<00:01:30.689> HD<00:01:30.950> also<00:01:31.950> um<00:01:33.500> there

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
despite being recording HD also um there

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.440 
despite being recording HD also um there
actually<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> spill<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.909> visible<00:01:36.390> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
actually is a spill that is visible to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.690 
actually is a spill that is visible to
my<00:01:36.750> dark-adapted<00:01:37.200> eyes<00:01:37.619> that's<00:01:38.189> not<00:01:38.460> showing

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
my dark-adapted eyes that's not showing

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.330 
my dark-adapted eyes that's not showing
up<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.150> video<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.920> but<00:01:40.920> anyway<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.310> that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
up in this video so but anyway with that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.580 
up in this video so but anyway with that
a<00:01:41.490> healthy<00:01:41.790> way<00:01:41.970> let's<00:01:42.600> go<00:01:42.810> ahead<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.200> get<00:01:43.470> out

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
a healthy way let's go ahead and get out

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.620 
a healthy way let's go ahead and get out
into<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> real<00:01:44.040> world

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.429 

going<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.770> welcome<00:01:52.219> this<00:01:52.369> trailer<00:01:52.640> here

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.990 

pencil<00:02:00.439> path<00:02:00.649> now<00:02:00.950> just<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.340> give<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.579> idea<00:02:01.880> of

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
pencil path now just to give the idea of

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.359 
pencil path now just to give the idea of
what<00:02:02.210> this<00:02:02.390> path<00:02:02.600> looks<00:02:02.899> like<00:02:03.220> going<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.280> your

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
what this path looks like going to your

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.389 
what this path looks like going to your
shrine<00:02:04.700> bump<00:02:05.090> this<00:02:05.240> up<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.509> little<00:02:05.600> bit<00:02:06.399> okay

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
shrine bump this up a little bit okay

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.370 
shrine bump this up a little bit okay
there's<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.820> very<00:02:08.090> little<00:02:08.360> narrow<00:02:08.720> passageway

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
there's a very little narrow passageway

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.100 
there's a very little narrow passageway
that<00:02:09.560> goes<00:02:09.800> through<00:02:10.039> there<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.729> then<00:02:11.360> uh<00:02:11.480> step

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
that goes through there and then uh step

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.530 
that goes through there and then uh step
up<00:02:12.260> into<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.650> clearing<00:02:12.950> over<00:02:13.250> there<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:14.480> know

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
up into a clearing over there you know

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.020 
up into a clearing over there you know
kick<00:02:15.410> this<00:02:15.560> down<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.830> little<00:02:16.010> bit<00:02:16.250> just<00:02:16.790> enough

kick this down a little bit just enough

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.729 
kick this down a little bit just enough

real-world use okay so currently we're

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
at this clearing where I actually took

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.900 
at this clearing where I actually took
the<00:02:41.599> beam<00:02:42.260> shots<00:02:42.500> earlier<00:02:42.890> unfortunately<00:02:43.849> it

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
the beam shots earlier unfortunately it

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.650 
the beam shots earlier unfortunately it
was<00:02:44.000> missing<00:02:44.390> heavily<00:02:44.840> at<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.110> time<00:02:45.319> but

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
was missing heavily at the time but

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.280 
was missing heavily at the time but
hopefully<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.810> can<00:02:47.959> see<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.410> this<00:02:48.650> tree<00:02:48.920> is

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
hopefully you can see that this tree is

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.930 
hopefully you can see that this tree is
roughly<00:02:51.290> 40<00:02:51.560> feet<00:02:51.739> away<00:02:51.860> from<00:02:52.250> where<00:02:52.579> I<00:02:52.610> took

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
roughly 40 feet away from where I took

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.090 
roughly 40 feet away from where I took
the<00:02:53.030> shots<00:02:53.380> those<00:02:54.380> trees<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.890> background

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
the shots those trees in the background

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.860 
the shots those trees in the background
is<00:02:55.370> roughly<00:02:55.700> about<00:02:55.850> eighty<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.329> ninety<00:02:56.720> feet

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
is roughly about eighty to ninety feet

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.680 
is roughly about eighty to ninety feet
and<00:02:57.109> that<00:02:57.500> tip<00:02:57.829> right<00:02:58.069> there<00:02:58.489> is<00:02:58.790> roughly

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
and that tip right there is roughly

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.050 
and that tip right there is roughly
about<00:02:59.810> 100<00:03:00.049> feet<00:03:00.410> away<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:00.829> with<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:01.850> said

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
about 100 feet away so with that said

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.520 
about 100 feet away so with that said
I'm<00:03:02.269> actually<00:03:02.450> going<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.870> go<00:03:03.049> ahead<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.380> bump

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
I'm actually going to go ahead and bump

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.379 
I'm actually going to go ahead and bump
it<00:03:03.680> up<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.799> four<00:03:04.069> outfit<00:03:04.459> now<00:03:04.900> level<00:03:05.900> six<00:03:07.389> this

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
it up to four outfit now level six this

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.610 
it up to four outfit now level six this
is<00:03:08.450> probably<00:03:09.139> a<00:03:09.230> little<00:03:09.709> bit<00:03:09.920> brighter<00:03:10.160> than

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
is probably a little bit brighter than

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.440 
is probably a little bit brighter than
what<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.829> am<00:03:13.100> actually<00:03:13.370> seeing<00:03:13.880> meaning<00:03:14.269> on<00:03:14.420> the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
what I am actually seeing meaning on the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.020 
what I am actually seeing meaning on the
LCD<00:03:14.930> screen<00:03:15.079> so<00:03:15.739> in<00:03:15.889> real<00:03:16.069> life<00:03:16.400> that's

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
LCD screen so in real life that's

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.879 
LCD screen so in real life that's
probably<00:03:17.299> just<00:03:17.480> slightly<00:03:17.989> duller<00:03:18.410> than<00:03:18.530> this

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
probably just slightly duller than this

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.370 
probably just slightly duller than this
but<00:03:19.359> again<00:03:20.359> this<00:03:20.750> should<00:03:20.900> give<00:03:21.049> you<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.200> good

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
but again this should give you a good

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:29.800 
but again this should give you a good
idea<00:03:21.410> of<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:25.730> actual<00:03:26.060> use

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.110 

okay<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:32.310> now<00:03:32.550> I'm<00:03:32.610> going<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.820> bump<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.090> down

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
okay so now I'm going to bump it down

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.220 
okay so now I'm going to bump it down
the<00:03:33.360> notch<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.690> continue<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.170> navigate<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:37.200> a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
the notch and continue to navigate to a

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.080 
the notch and continue to navigate to a
level<00:03:37.440> where<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.680> feel<00:03:37.920> comfortable<00:03:38.100> assuming

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
level where I feel comfortable assuming

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.170 
level where I feel comfortable assuming
this<00:03:39.240> level<00:03:39.570> 2<00:03:39.810> level<00:03:40.280> 3<00:03:41.280> go<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.380> level<00:03:43.380> 3<00:03:44.180> so

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
this level 2 level 3 go to level 3 so

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.310 
this level 2 level 3 go to level 3 so
probably<00:03:45.450> see<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.660> little<00:03:45.810> bright<00:03:46.290> for

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
probably see a little bright for

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.500 
probably see a little bright for
dark-adapted<00:03:47.010> ice<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.700> bump<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.180> back<00:03:48.300> down

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
dark-adapted ice and bump it back down

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.640 
dark-adapted ice and bump it back down
to<00:03:48.540> level<00:03:48.900> 2<00:03:49.940> becae<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.420> with<00:03:52.020> a<00:03:52.050> very<00:03:52.170> tight

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
to level 2 becae so with a very tight

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.850 
to level 2 becae so with a very tight
probe<00:03:52.920> being<00:03:53.250> profile<00:03:53.640> like<00:03:53.760> this<00:03:53.820> right<00:03:54.860> even

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
probe being profile like this right even

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.700 
probe being profile like this right even
level<00:03:56.160> 2<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.640> sufficient<00:03:57.630> at<00:03:57.810> least<00:03:58.080> in<00:03:58.350> the

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
level 2 is sufficient at least in the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.670 
level 2 is sufficient at least in the
hot<00:03:58.920> spot<00:03:59.220> but<00:03:59.640> the<00:04:00.300> spill<00:04:00.630> could<00:04:01.290> probably<00:04:01.470> be

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
hot spot but the spill could probably be

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.380 
hot spot but the spill could probably be
a<00:04:01.710> little<00:04:01.830> bit<00:04:02.070> brighter<00:04:02.220> right<00:04:02.700> thus<00:04:03.150> that's

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
a little bit brighter right thus that's

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.450 
a little bit brighter right thus that's
why<00:04:03.600> I<00:04:03.900> think<00:04:04.350> level<00:04:04.710> 3<00:04:04.920> would<00:04:05.040> have<00:04:05.190> actually

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
why I think level 3 would have actually

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.190 
why I think level 3 would have actually
been<00:04:05.580> preferable<00:04:05.910> but<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.630> only<00:04:06.750> problem<00:04:06.990> is

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
been preferable but the only problem is

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.530 
been preferable but the only problem is
that<00:04:07.470> then<00:04:08.130> that<00:04:08.280> hot<00:04:08.490> spot<00:04:08.760> becomes<00:04:09.120> really

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
that then that hot spot becomes really

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.050 
that then that hot spot becomes really
really<00:04:09.690> intense<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.430> does<00:04:11.610> affect<00:04:11.760> your

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
really intense and that does affect your

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.480 
really intense and that does affect your
dark<00:04:12.330> adaptive<00:04:12.840> vision<00:04:12.930> so<00:04:13.320> well<00:04:14.100> that's<00:04:14.280> it

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
dark adaptive vision so well that's it

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.479 
dark adaptive vision so well that's it
I'll<00:04:14.670> just<00:04:14.880> keep<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.150> at<00:04:15.270> level<00:04:15.510> 2<00:04:16.280> I'm<00:04:17.280> going

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
I'll just keep it at level 2 I'm going

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:26.360 
I'll just keep it at level 2 I'm going
to<00:04:17.580> continue<00:04:17.850> navigate<00:04:19.880> path<00:04:20.880> around
