00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.970
 but there are also some bambera sevillanas lyrics that we can call 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.069
 there were bands because of their origin 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:13.159
 of the patios of the old houses of neighbors or corrals 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.930
 just from one of these corrals the corral of the sixt charros there is a 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.800
 clarify reference in the story that Father Coloma made in 1867 in his work 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.329
 pictures of popular customs 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.250
 there tells us a whole party in which flags were sung and curiously 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.769
 accompanied by guitar, that is, when singing is 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.860
 enlarged and converted into the usual flamenco formula 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.640
 some of these letters we can or remember jocular type letters like 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.440
 what do they say 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.390
 little boy who is in the door between you and brewer 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.400
 that those who wear defend have eaten pulley or also the other that says 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.310
 pull the strings well and go up to the roof 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.990
 that you are like a shoemaker sitting on his bench 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
 nothing 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.950
 the girl 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.950

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.110

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.660
 for it 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.660
 warned 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.970
 the adopted measure 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.750
 I was born 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.829

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.829
 to work 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.569

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.829
 t 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:06.740
 both 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.259
 They fired me 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:11.259
 each 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:17.539
 next to 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.669
 to Ivan 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:20.899
 next to 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.899
 do not think 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.189
 sling 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.869
 and now released 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:37.869
 now 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.749
 do not 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:52.749
 now what 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.719
 in my life 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.719
 niang the trip 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:10.989
 the markets 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.989
 ain 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.120
 as we said at the beginning the fireman over time has been suffering 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.870
 a coping teacher 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.670
 but those who dedicated themselves to andoain been the most important and at what time 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.669
 who have contributed to this process 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.270
 if we talk about the Sevillian flag 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.559
 which was the one 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:43.479
 he made himself known 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.210
 he was a shepherdess peacock the girl with the combs 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.210
 that makes a recording with melchor de marchena's guitar is 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.830
 at the end of the 30s 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.559
 the flag of Cadiz on the flag of Arcos 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:00.959
 the first recording is around the seventies 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.120
 by the group arcense los paletos 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.420
 and the first artists that flamenco recording zhou manolo santana 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.100
 with the guitar of manolo sanlÃºcar and the paterna dog with the guitar of 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.779
 enrique albistur 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:18.099
 Once converted into flamenco cante la lavan conserve y su nombre 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.080
 original since in folklore 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.529
 but he was called 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.110
 or swing perel 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.969
 habitual and popular, that's what I defined it 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.740
 but that moment, which the pastor succeeded in when she is left with this name 

00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:34.389
 final bambera 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.860
 is the author of the recording of the girl with the combs 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.900
 because in folklore they were considered as swing cantes 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.460
 with songs of mcd of euros dismissed 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:47.800
 today decide when 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.870
 but p a tequila change in the towns of lower Andalusia 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:57.099
 to the word for now the swing that is worth alhambra and the oldest and most 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.710
 at the origin 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.870
 it was said blanket that is that its initial origin would be extremely serious 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.520
 pastor in which the lawyer of the cante originally called the name of 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.520
 titan will see flamenco as we know it today 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.999
 slim and it's a shame 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:24.469
 after we have done this tour we have that feeling 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:27.889
 leader of the Socialists that today children do not 

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:31.559
 there are also the swings 

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:36.709
 in the holidays although there are still some cases in certain pilgrimages 

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:41.709
 of very few Andalusian towns but of course it is not done as in the past 

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:49.509
 so he listens to the frequency and with that the song something that exclaims the 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:50.649
 poet 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:54.099
 In the squares of my town, flags are no longer heard 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:59.439
 that now sings the little rhythms and little songs from outside 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.649
 to god swing and solitas
