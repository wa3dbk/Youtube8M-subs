00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
we actually had a couple instances with

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.319 
we actually had a couple instances with
it<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:49.860> way<00:00:49.980> too<00:00:50.010> many<00:00:50.280> tornadoes<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.059> people

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
it was way too many tornadoes and people

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.959 
it was way too many tornadoes and people
weren't<00:00:51.539> close<00:00:52.170> enough<00:00:52.440> together<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.460> ends<00:00:53.850> up

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
weren't close enough together so ends up

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.819 
weren't close enough together so ends up
once<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> mark<00:00:54.719> came<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.079> they<00:00:55.230> got<00:00:55.350> instantly

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
once the mark came on they got instantly

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.220 
once the mark came on they got instantly
killed<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> way<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.360> avoid<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.930> back

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
killed now the way to avoid that is back

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.410 
killed now the way to avoid that is back
together<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> boss<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.309> another<00:00:59.609> ability

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
together but the boss is another ability

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.910 
together but the boss is another ability
i<00:01:00.629> think<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:00.899> called<00:01:00.960> when<00:01:01.350> strike<00:01:01.739> or

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
i think it's called when strike or

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.799 
i think it's called when strike or
something<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.340> where<00:01:03.090> he'll<00:01:03.449> attack<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
something like that where he'll attack a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.840 
something like that where he'll attack a
random<00:01:04.260> randomly<00:01:04.799> attack<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> player<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.610> put

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
random randomly attack a player and put

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.359 
random randomly attack a player and put
a<00:01:05.880> deep<00:01:06.119> up<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.510> them<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.170> anybody<00:01:07.590> within

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
a deep up on them and anybody within

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.920 
a deep up on them and anybody within
eight<00:01:08.760> yards<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.360> that's<00:01:09.510> why<00:01:09.630> i<00:01:09.659> don't<00:01:09.810> want

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
eight yards so that's why i don't want

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.230 
eight yards so that's why i don't want
to<00:01:10.020> really<00:01:10.560> stack<00:01:10.920> together<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.939> since<00:01:12.090> it's

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
to really stack together but since it's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.850 
to really stack together but since it's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
some AOE damage now it starts to become

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.130

a<00:02:57.160> DPS<00:02:57.700> race<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.209> he<00:02:58.299> starts<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.690> game<00:02:58.720> stacks

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
a DPS race and he starts the game stacks

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.770 
a DPS race and he starts the game stacks
of<00:02:59.350> hate<00:02:59.560> five<00:03:00.160> percent<00:03:00.579> haste<00:03:00.880> and<00:03:01.090> five

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
of hate five percent haste and five

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.050 
of hate five percent haste and five
percent<00:03:02.170> damage<00:03:02.320> done<00:03:02.739> over<00:03:03.070> time<00:03:03.340> so<00:03:03.880> this<00:03:04.000> is

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
percent damage done over time so this is

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.150 
percent damage done over time so this is
where<00:03:04.269> it's<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.450> big<00:03:04.660> dps<00:03:05.140> race<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:05.980> want

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
where it's a big dps race and you want

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.039 
where it's a big dps race and you want
to<00:03:06.250> basically<00:03:06.910> bone<00:03:07.359> down<00:03:07.660> as<00:03:07.810> soon<00:03:07.930> as

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
to basically bone down as soon as

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.470 
to basically bone down as soon as
possible<00:03:08.530> he's<00:03:09.070> gonna<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.579> once<00:03:10.209> he<00:03:10.299> gets

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
possible he's gonna and once he gets

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.090 
possible he's gonna and once he gets
that<00:03:10.570> I<00:03:10.630> think<00:03:10.840> about<00:03:11.049> ten<00:03:11.320> percent<00:03:11.470> he<00:03:11.920> does

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
that I think about ten percent he does

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.309 
that I think about ten percent he does
the<00:03:12.310> whole<00:03:12.609> process<00:03:12.970> again<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:14.019> he's<00:03:14.140> gonna

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
the whole process again so he's gonna

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.990 
the whole process again so he's gonna
jump<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.799> other<00:03:14.859> side<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.489> some<00:03:15.850> of<00:03:15.940> the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
jump to the other side and some of the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.190 
jump to the other side and some of the
tornadoes<00:03:16.390> in<00:03:16.420> every<00:03:16.750> one<00:03:16.840> over<00:03:17.079> there

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
tornadoes in every one over there

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.680 
tornadoes in every one over there
otherwise<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.040> pretty<00:03:18.310> simple<00:03:18.519> one<00:03:18.670> fight<00:03:19.150> so<00:03:19.660> I
