00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.590
 the seven tips to gain mass 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.149
 muscle 1 focus on the exercises 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.820
 complexes instead of the monkey 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.280
 joint for those who follow the 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.679
 This channel is not a new topic if 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.170
 we want to gain muscle mass we need 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.789
 a metabolic response where it increases 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.130
 the secretion of hormones such as 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.230
 testosterone and growth hormone 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.210
 since they are this kind of hormones 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.070
 anabolic ones that have the 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.920
 ability to increase synthesis 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.440
 protect this we get it with 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.620
 complex exercises where it is implied 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.639
 a lot of muscle mass 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.399
 exercises like the bench press 

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:43.010
 squat squat or deadlift would be 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.049
 the key is a mistake thinking that by 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.949
 do more biceps courses these are going to 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:51.949
 grow more quickly 2 do not abuse 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.049
 the weight machines I do not know who 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.059
 I would name these machines 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:59.179
 but of course we had a lot 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.699
 physiology if we want to involve the greatest 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.040
 amount of muscle mass possible is a 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.920
 mistake using those machines that 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.869
 stabilize the exercise for us 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.150
 in a bench press work a great 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.340
 number of muscles in charge of 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.229
 stabilize the plane of movement that 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.210
 they are not working when we make a 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.850
 press on machine so that the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.290
 hormonal response will be lower by not 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.539
 talk about that nobody has both 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.759
 symmetric hemispheres when it seems to be 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.509
 whoever designs these machines thinks 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.420
 that's how three forget about the myth of 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.520
 volume phase and definition phase 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.500
 volume phases where the individual takes 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.380
 all the body weight that can be a 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.300
 aberration a nonsense that far from 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.700
 get us to gain more muscle mass 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.490
 yes that can seriously affect 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.220
 to our health the organism needs 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.080
 a series of nutrients to potentiate 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.679
 the recovery of energy consumed 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.539
 and regenerate damaged tissues consume 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.549
 more amount of the strictly 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.280
 necessary to meet this demand 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:05.060
 it will not make us gain more muscle mass but 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.750
 Fat 4 do not confuse training 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.850
 hypertrophy force are not equal is 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.220
 very usual to find who considers 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.100
 that to gain muscle mass there 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.810
 the maximum weight that can be this is a 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.490
 error because nothing has to do with a 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.190
 strength training with one 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.530
 oriented to gain muscle mass for 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.380
 this you need to work at a high range 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.900
 of repetitions from eight being 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.640
 more important the time under tension the 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.890
 training volume and the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.830
 partial recovery between series that the 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.990
 charge you are wrong if you think that the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.930
 most muscular sportsmen are the most 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.690
 strong a rugby or hockey player 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.360
 on ice the nhl can well move 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.320
 up to 50% more weight than a 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.230
 professional bodybuilder 5 beware of 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.940
 stimulants like caffeine although it is 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.490
 true that can help us improve 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.740
 our performance also have a 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.600
 cortisol enhancing effect a 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.850
 catabolic hormone that can ruin 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.420
 our training and avoid that 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.340
 get the desired results 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.440
 remember this rule the stimulants 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.530
 always before training never after 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.600
 The lack of sleep sleeps enough 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.580
 It can affect the recovery process 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.160
 and regeneration of damaged tissues 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.260
 during training by lengthening the 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.410
 Recovery time needed to 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.420
 a total recovery this can do 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.580
 that Retrain Before I 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.190
 recovered or else you have to wait 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.520
 more days before returning to train a 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.780
 same exercise at the end everything is translated 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.570
 in lower results 7 the protein is 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.790
 important but not the king of the diet is 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.070
 incredible how many people consider that 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.280
 you can only maximize results if 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.260
 he resorts to the supplements friends of that 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.050
 you think the shakes are made 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.870
 proteins then of extracted nutrients 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.000
 of the food itself not for that 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.910
 it has to be more effective but everything 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.010
 contrary to today if we give a 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.080
 laboratory rat all the nutrients 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.480
 who know each other in isolation 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.820
 move this is like that because still 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.100
 we continue discovering new nutrients 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.049
 substances that until now we did not know 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.829
 or that we did not know to what extent 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.120
 result 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.639
 crucial for the right 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.430
 functioning of the organism 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.469
 protein is important, of course 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.960
 Yes, but we must not forget that 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:34.479
 we need hydrates to increase their 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.580
 penetration in the muscle cell due 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.860
 to the tropic insulin effect of the mixture 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.500
 as well as many other nutrients that 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.750
 they help protein synthesis and the rest 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.099
 of metabolic processes and that is not 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.099
 found in the supplements
