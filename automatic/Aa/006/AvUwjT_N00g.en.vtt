 sailed for more than a decade with the 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.020
 mission to become the series of 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.020
 anime and most famous manga of all japan 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.180
 and in fact he has achieved it because of it 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.460
 we must be surprised that the Japanese have 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.799
 built around the saga several 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.259
 titles that unfortunately have remained 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.970
 in his homeland however 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.820
 good pieces come to our 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.789
 continent as an antispyware warriors 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.460
 2 loft and the rest of the sailors 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.649
 Their mission is to finish dozens of 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.380
 enemies that do not blink anal throw them 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.080
 heap to annihilate them to avoid 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.880
 sinking into this commission the corsairs 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.979
 they must make use of everything their 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.920
 training and the fruits of the devil 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.049
 they have left them like this we have a game in 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.360
 what ridiculous situations typical of 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.270
 the series merge into an action out 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.979
 of the common the types of blows come 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.319
 Accompanied by a powerful attack 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.630
 special as well as a mechanics of 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.950
 evasion this makes the combat quite 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.440
 fluid 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.750
 that gives a certain strategy to give 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.790
 the face to enemies that come over and over 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.180
 time to finish on the floor so 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.280
 fun and this does not prevent you from seeing yourself in 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.530
 repetitive situations while 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.750
 to defeat bosses do not usually 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.770
 need more than identify certain 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.930
 light patterns of attacking and dodging 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.030
 does not represent this that is a game 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.640
 easy but for fans of the genre 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.530
 it will surely seem less motivating 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.020
 that other titles that are taken more in 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.990
 serious the mechanics of the beat 'em up and the 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.900
 hack and slash the game as well as the play 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.540
 de Quiroga has just that charm 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.730
 of not being taken seriously outside of these 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.190
 details and the absence of a story 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.130
 elaborate the game screams fun at 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.560
 every scene if you do not need a story 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.840
 that pretends to be deep or if you're a fan 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.910
