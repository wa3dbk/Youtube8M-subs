00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.470
 I greet you dear viewers in 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.480
 this traditional release I would like 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.119
 you open to small secrets in terms of 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.880
 create a short film in get 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.040
 to life the idea of ​​inspiration has long been 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.869
 in the bud but I didn't know how to 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.540
 realize ice and clear view 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.150
 about what I want to see I did not have 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.530
 on plotting me pushed 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.840
 film 8 mile 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.200
 where the main character gradually rises 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.820
 Overcoming various life barriers 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.280
 similar to this line I wrote 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.310
 pretty similar plot where the main 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.540
 hero overcoming various difficulties 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.030
 a certain period becomes a legend 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.460
 among his people 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.310
 This project started in early 2015. 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.130
 years a distinctive feature of this project is 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.360
 thorough preparation 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.700
 the preparatory process began the cathedral 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.979
 composition for the film crew at the very 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.659
 it was easier than it seems to me 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.909
 it was enough to create a theme 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.009
 with casting on each forum and wait 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.549
 application of all who wish to participate in 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.770
 filming in two days I selected 165 people 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.560
 after which he recorded the entire composition and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.600
 gathered in skype conference first 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.580
 same time most predictable problem 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.770
 there was chaos in this conference 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.229
 after a while I found a way 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.090
 drown out standing in the morning in short i 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.920
 instructed in people explained everything 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.900
 nuances to the smallest details 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.120
 when everything was ready we started 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.100
 Filming 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.500
 filmed movies on our server 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.930
 film studios where the whole world and and equipment 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.060
 were already built by shooting fast 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.220
 access to the creation of transport facilities and 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.430
 other buns provided us a huge 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.930
 time saving which is important composition 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.540
 people were constantly normal 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.880
 online exceeded the average rate of 30-40 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.950
 man during filming of course everything 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.530
 those who filed the application and vice did not 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.390
 could someone have recorded the radio directions 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.119
 in the credits and someone in order to 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.520
 really help anyway i 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.590
 it is all provided and discharged whiskey 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.930
 names that were listed to connect to 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.360
 server, that is, those who went there and 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.030
 helped and but in general the composition of the problems 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.220
 almost was but there were problems other such 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.470
 as functions of the same composition some 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.750
 scenes require too high accuracy and 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.090
 concentration of attention in order to work 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.670
 everything is beautiful but with great desire and 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.710
 perseverance we have achieved the result of shooting 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.200
 passed even faster than the delta series 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.550
 namely, in 8 days, given the stagnation and 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.020
 half day break 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.070
 Delta same starred about two weeks 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.780
 The first days of filming were very 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.760
 atmospheric because it was interesting 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.780
 rehearse and feel one of 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.630
 these characters 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.000
 I think many liked it given the volume 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.890
 film work was abundant therefore 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.380
 Some days I shot fragments 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.989
 at night in time to finish the whole time 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.239
 the process of pre- shooting were 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.730
 prepared locations that are in advance of 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.709
 long before they had already been created they needed 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.260
 it was only retool and all 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.450
 looked very atmospheric such take 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.340
 same prison alcatraz she 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.140
 spread across the internet yet 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.110
 long before filming this movie 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.019
 some interiors and other locations already 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.220
 Were built into their mod we, too 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.560
 retooled would like for this 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.660
 thank those who helped in this 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.090
 I remember with a special smile as we 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.190
 settled the black market and location 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.140
 rap battles we had to stay 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.270
 stay up late in order to arrange everything and on 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.340
 the next day was already shooting there 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.560
 cases when the slightest mistake forced 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.290
 us restart the server and start 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.830
 to equip all new to all of this 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.290
 enraged 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.920
 but despite all these difficulties we 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.200
 coped 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.120
 last day we all got together well 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.239
 shone in one of the following takes 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.430
 so that was the memory after the shooting remained 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.530
 only one mount it all in one 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.630
 the film was very difficult and long 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.819
 work process for almost two months i 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.280
 mounted the film I want to note that 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.230
 particular emphasis is placed on voice acting very 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.360
 atmospheric tracks that me too 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.700
 threw a film crew and very 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.890
 worked out and the sound effects seemed 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.049
 everything would look so easy but I want you 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.419
 say what's behind every take and scene 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.109
 lurk huge effort and long hours 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.270
 work 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.700
 so that everything looked great and not through 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.350
 ass this whole process you can 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.720
 see the next small slide 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.720
 from the very beginning to the very end 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.879
 Well, in the end I would like to note that 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:28.770
 as in any movie so in this 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.360
 kinolyaps that were in the majority 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.180
 cases already noticed during installation 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.259
 works and which is already easy to fix 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.749
 it was not possible 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:39.330
 but as there are still many projects ahead 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:40.770
 I think it is excusably nice 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.180
 it was work pleasant for you 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.180
 views and see you soon
