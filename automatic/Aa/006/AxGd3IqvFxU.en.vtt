00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
through the whole map at the very

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.709 
through the whole map at the very
beginning<00:00:53.370> you're<00:00:54.059> stuck<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.539> little

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719

room and told the doors open which i

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.380 
room and told the doors open which i
think<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.770> about<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> hundred<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.879> twenty

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
think is about a hundred and twenty

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.950 
think is about a hundred and twenty
seconds<00:01:00.840> i<00:01:00.960> believe<00:01:01.260> not<00:01:02.160> sure<00:01:02.480> but<00:01:03.480> yeah<00:01:03.719> he

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
seconds i believe not sure but yeah he

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.329 
seconds i believe not sure but yeah he
got<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.140> couple<00:01:04.320> windows<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.890> shoot<00:01:05.100> from

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
got a couple windows to shoot from

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.039 
got a couple windows to shoot from
there's<00:01:05.970> no<00:01:06.119> barriers<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> windows

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
there's no barriers on the windows

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:07.880 
there's no barriers on the windows
because<00:01:07.200> i<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.409> thought<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.710> was

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
because i just thought that was

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.289 
because i just thought that was
completely<00:01:08.040> pointless<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.880> don't<00:01:09.030> know<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.150> just

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
completely pointless I don't know I just

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.910 
completely pointless I don't know I just
don't<00:01:09.689> think<00:01:09.840> Nazis<00:01:10.110> almond<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.560> should<00:01:10.770> have

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
don't think Nazis almond up should have

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.060 
don't think Nazis almond up should have
those<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.750> way<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.560> can't<00:01:13.830> get<00:01:13.979> out

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
those and the way that you can't get out

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.399 
those and the way that you can't get out
of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.220> map<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.270> humans<00:01:15.630> cannot<00:01:15.840> jump<00:01:16.170> at

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
of the map is the humans cannot jump at

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.960 
of the map is the humans cannot jump at
all<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.920> they<00:01:17.070> literally<00:01:17.400> cannot<00:01:17.700> jump

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
all like they literally cannot jump

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.870 
all like they literally cannot jump
there's<00:01:18.479> no<00:01:18.630> jumping<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.020> all<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.759> they

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
there's no jumping at all so but they

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.859 
there's no jumping at all so but they
can't<00:01:21.090> gather<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> map<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.430> um<00:01:23.689> right<00:01:24.689> now<00:01:24.720> I'm

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
can't gather the map so um right now I'm

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:25.880 
can't gather the map so um right now I'm
just<00:01:25.110> kind<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.259> waiting<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> doors<00:01:25.770> to
