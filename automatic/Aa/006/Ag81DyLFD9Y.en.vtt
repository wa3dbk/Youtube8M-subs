strong so I didn't need to buy a new one

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.790 
strong so I didn't need to buy a new one
but<00:00:39.910> yeah<00:00:40.060> you<00:00:40.360> just<00:00:40.540> pop<00:00:40.960> your<00:00:41.110> marker<00:00:41.470> into

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
but yeah you just pop your marker into

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.710 
but yeah you just pop your marker into
it<00:00:41.920> and<00:00:42.160> you<00:00:42.730> can<00:00:42.880> use<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:43.030> with<00:00:43.270> the<00:00:43.300> distress

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
it and you can use it with the distress

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.810 
it and you can use it with the distress
markers<00:00:44.140> you<00:00:44.470> can<00:00:44.590> use<00:00:44.739> it<00:00:44.920> with<00:00:45.160> pretty<00:00:45.610> much

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
markers you can use it with pretty much

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.729 
markers you can use it with pretty much
any<00:00:46.090> type<00:00:46.989> of<00:00:47.200> marker<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:47.920> I<00:00:48.760> always<00:00:48.940> hold<00:00:49.360> it

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
any type of marker and I always hold it

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.380 
any type of marker and I always hold it
the<00:00:50.739> way<00:00:50.890> I<00:00:50.920> do<00:00:51.070> so<00:00:51.640> that<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.880> marker<00:00:52.239> is

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
the way I do so that the marker is

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.959 
the way I do so that the marker is
against<00:00:52.870> my<00:00:53.050> wrist<00:00:53.350> I<00:00:53.770> just<00:00:54.399> find<00:00:54.550> I<00:00:54.640> have<00:00:54.790> more

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
against my wrist I just find I have more

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.389 
against my wrist I just find I have more
control<00:00:55.270> that<00:00:55.390> way<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:56.290> it's<00:00:56.980> not<00:00:57.040> kind<00:00:57.309> of

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
control that way and it's not kind of

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.010 
control that way and it's not kind of
bouncing<00:00:57.820> around<00:00:57.940> everywhere<00:00:58.270> and<00:00:58.930> I<00:00:58.989> just

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
bouncing around everywhere and I just

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.430 
bouncing around everywhere and I just
find<00:00:59.410> it<00:00:59.530> easier<00:00:59.770> to<00:01:00.340> use<00:01:00.460> it<00:01:00.670> that<00:01:00.760> way<00:01:00.820> so<00:01:01.750> I'm

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
find it easier to use it that way so I'm

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.490 
find it easier to use it that way so I'm
using<00:01:02.800> three<00:01:03.370> different<00:01:03.989> distress<00:01:04.989> markers

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
using three different distress markers

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.709 
using three different distress markers
for<00:01:05.740> this<00:01:05.950> I'm<00:01:06.219> using<00:01:06.250> I<00:01:06.880> started<00:01:07.210> with<00:01:07.329> shaded

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
for this I'm using I started with shaded

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.899 
for this I'm using I started with shaded
lilac<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:08.649> then<00:01:08.799> I<00:01:08.829> went<00:01:09.009> in<00:01:09.130> with<00:01:09.249> ice<00:01:09.429> spruce

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
lilac and then I went in with ice spruce

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.849 
lilac and then I went in with ice spruce
and<00:01:10.209> I'm<00:01:10.420> adding<00:01:10.689> some<00:01:10.990> peacock<00:01:11.499> feathers

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:11.859 
and I'm adding some peacock feathers

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:14.370 
and I'm adding some peacock feathers
just<00:01:12.759> kind<00:01:12.969> of<00:01:13.030> randomly<00:01:13.450> spritzing<00:01:14.049> it<00:01:14.109> here

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
just kind of randomly spritzing it here

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.260 
just kind of randomly spritzing it here
and<00:01:14.469> there<00:01:14.619> until<00:01:14.770> I'm<00:01:15.069> happy<00:01:15.399> with<00:01:15.520> it<00:01:15.579> so<00:01:16.030> I

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
did the first three colors and then I

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.340 
did the first three colors and then I
went<00:01:17.950> back<00:01:18.219> with<00:01:18.249> of<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.029> shaded<00:01:19.630> lilac<00:01:19.990> again

the<00:01:43.539> funnest<00:01:43.749> part<00:01:44.229> and<00:01:44.529> since<00:01:45.099> I<00:01:45.189> use<00:01:45.219> the

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
the funnest part and since I use the

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.039 
the funnest part and since I use the
distress<00:01:45.729> markers<00:01:46.149> this<00:01:46.299> was<00:01:46.479> really<00:01:46.779> easy<00:01:46.929> to

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
distress markers this was really easy to

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.389

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
could run it under the sink as well and

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.859 
could run it under the sink as well and
it<00:01:50.740> just<00:01:50.919> comes<00:01:51.099> right<00:01:51.369> off<00:01:51.399> so<00:01:52.270> wipe<00:01:52.689> that

it up on the stencil paper to see where

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.780 
it up on the stencil paper to see where
I<00:02:29.640> wanted<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.270> then<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.540> decided<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.110> trim

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
I wanted it and then I decided to trim

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.030 
I wanted it and then I decided to trim
the<00:02:32.790> stenciled<00:02:33.270> cardstock<00:02:34.020> down<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> bit<00:02:34.530> it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
the stenciled cardstock down a bit it

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.290 
the stenciled cardstock down a bit it
was<00:02:35.190> originally<00:02:35.670> four<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> quarter<00:02:36.150> by

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
was originally four and a quarter by

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.050 
was originally four and a quarter by
five<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.750> half<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:37.050> was<00:02:37.140> going<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.350> do<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> full

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
five and a half I was going to do a full

card<00:02:39.060> front<00:02:39.270> with<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.750> decided<00:02:40.020> I

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
card front with it but I decided I

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.750 
card front with it but I decided I
didn't<00:02:40.410> want<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.620> do<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.250> trimmed<00:02:41.610> it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
didn't want to do that so I trimmed it

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.090 
didn't want to do that so I trimmed it
down<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.270> then<00:02:42.750> I'm<00:02:42.990> gonna<00:02:43.080> trim<00:02:43.470> down<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
down and then I'm gonna trim down the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.250 
down and then I'm gonna trim down the
circle<00:02:44.610> here<00:02:44.970> just<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.870> it's<00:02:45.990> got<00:02:46.110> the

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
circle here just so that it's got the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.200 
circle here just so that it's got the
nice<00:02:46.410> straight<00:02:46.770> edge<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.250> could<00:02:47.760> adhere<00:02:47.940> it

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
nice straight edge you could adhere it

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.540 
nice straight edge you could adhere it
first<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.600> then<00:02:48.690> trim<00:02:48.960> it<00:02:48.990> down<00:02:49.310> but<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.370> just

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
first and then trim it down but I just

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.490 
first and then trim it down but I just
used<00:02:50.730> my<00:02:50.790> paper<00:02:51.060> trimmer<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.660> then<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.320> was

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
used my paper trimmer and then I was

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.260 
used my paper trimmer and then I was
going<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:52.920> adhere<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.220> flat<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:53.760> piece

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
going to adhere it flat to this piece

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.850 
going to adhere it flat to this piece
here<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.780> then<00:02:54.930> change<00:02:55.200> my<00:02:55.260> mind<00:02:55.560> at<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.830> last

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
here and then change my mind at the last

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.110 
here and then change my mind at the last
minute<00:02:56.130> which<00:02:56.460> is<00:02:56.580> good<00:02:56.730> because<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.060> would

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
minute which is good because it would

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.580 
minute which is good because it would
have<00:02:57.210> been<00:02:57.270> almost<00:02:57.510> impossible<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:58.260> pull<00:02:58.440> up

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
have been almost impossible to pull up

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.680 
have been almost impossible to pull up
and<00:02:58.830> just<00:02:59.490> grab<00:02:59.670> some<00:02:59.910> of<00:03:00.000> my<00:03:00.090> dimensionals

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
and just grab some of my dimensionals

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.330 
and just grab some of my dimensionals
and<00:03:00.870> pop<00:03:01.200> those<00:03:01.440> onto<00:03:01.740> there<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.070> I've<00:03:02.160> got<00:03:02.310> a

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
and pop those onto there so I've got a

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.460 
and pop those onto there so I've got a
little<00:03:02.670> bit<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.090> dimension<00:03:03.270> I<00:03:03.810> didn't<00:03:04.230> want<00:03:04.350> to

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
little bit of dimension I didn't want to

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.410 
little bit of dimension I didn't want to
put<00:03:04.620> too<00:03:04.860> much<00:03:05.010> onto<00:03:05.460> this<00:03:05.610> piece<00:03:06.030> of<00:03:06.240> card

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
put too much onto this piece of card

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.460 
put too much onto this piece of card
stock<00:03:06.450> because<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.870> go<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:06.990> all<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.200> work<00:03:07.350> of

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
stock because you go to all the work of

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.780 
stock because you go to all the work of
stenciling<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.130> want<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.460> to<00:03:08.610> stand

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
stenciling it and you want it to stand

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.410 
stenciling it and you want it to stand
out<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.930> just<00:03:10.260> added<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.710> circle<00:03:11.270> and<00:03:12.270> then

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
out so I just added the circle and then

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.820 
out so I just added the circle and then
I'm<00:03:12.540> going<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.810> adhere<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.410> butterfly<00:03:13.800> I
