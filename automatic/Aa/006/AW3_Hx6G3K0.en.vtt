it<00:00:42.090> all<00:00:42.239> begins<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.140> classroom<00:00:43.649> project<00:00:44.070> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
it all begins with a classroom project I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
it all begins with a classroom project I
found<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.090> students<00:00:45.450> really<00:00:45.629> began<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
found that students really began to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.920 
found that students really began to
think<00:00:46.440> about<00:00:46.800> how<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.760> building<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.420> conceived

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
think about how a building is conceived

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.529 
think about how a building is conceived
that<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> say<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:50.160> example<00:00:50.219> how<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
that is to say for example how do the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.500 
that is to say for example how do the
shafts<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.350> these<00:00:52.649> piers<00:00:53.129> connect<00:00:53.910> up<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
shafts on these piers connect up to the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.380 
shafts on these piers connect up to the
ribs<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.140> how<00:00:55.860> does<00:00:55.920> each<00:00:56.550> part<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
ribs and how does each part have to

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.029 
ribs and how does each part have to
relate<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.690> every<00:00:58.020> other<00:00:58.050> part<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.680> they

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
relate to every other part and they

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.439 
relate to every other part and they
don't<00:00:59.160> think<00:00:59.520> about<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.879> unless<00:01:00.149> they<00:01:00.300> have

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
don't think about that unless they have

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.000 
don't think about that unless they have
to<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.780> themselves<00:01:00.930> my<00:01:01.410> involvement<00:01:01.680> with

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
to do it themselves my involvement with

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.729 
to do it themselves my involvement with
Charles<00:01:02.520> was<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.910> educate<00:01:03.030> him<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.739> these

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
Charles was to educate him on these

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.950 
Charles was to educate him on these
technical<00:01:05.189> specifications<00:01:06.180> teach<00:01:06.510> him<00:01:06.750> how

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
technical specifications teach him how

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.670 
technical specifications teach him how
he<00:01:07.020> might<00:01:07.500> modify<00:01:08.310> things<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.990> teach<00:01:10.409> him<00:01:10.530> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
he might modify things and teach him of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.859 
he might modify things and teach him of
course<00:01:10.890> how<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.000> entire<00:01:12.090> model<00:01:12.510> here

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
course how to get the entire model here

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.170 
course how to get the entire model here
into<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> dive<00:01:13.320> which<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.040> room<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
into the dive which the room that you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.910 
into the dive which the room that you
can<00:01:15.360> go<00:01:15.540> into<00:01:15.750> very<00:01:16.140> much<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> racquetball

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
can go into very much like a racquetball

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.660 
can go into very much like a racquetball
court<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.790> has<00:01:17.939> very<00:01:18.299> rectangular<00:01:18.869> cubic

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
court so it has very rectangular cubic

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.670 
court so it has very rectangular cubic
aspect<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:22.170> thing<00:01:22.320> that's<00:01:22.500> cool<00:01:22.560> about

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
aspect and the thing that's cool about

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.760 
aspect and the thing that's cool about
it<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.490> walls<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.509> rear<00:01:24.780> projected<00:01:25.439> with

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it is the walls are rear projected with

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.440 
it is the walls are rear projected with
computer<00:01:26.220> graphics<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.150> change

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
computer graphics so we can change

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.359 
computer graphics so we can change
essentially<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> wallpaper<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.070> walls

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
essentially the wallpaper on the walls

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.850 
essentially the wallpaper on the walls
in<00:01:29.729> real<00:01:30.060> time<00:01:30.329> meaning<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.990> update<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> image

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
in real time meaning we update the image

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.710 
in real time meaning we update the image
at<00:01:32.610> 60<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.270> 120<00:01:33.720> times<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.500> second<00:01:35.210> we<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.450> make

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
at 60 to 120 times a second we can make

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.810 
at 60 to 120 times a second we can make
the<00:01:37.020> image<00:01:37.530> change<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> function<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.640> where

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the image change as a function of where

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.640 
the image change as a function of where
you<00:01:38.970> are<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> space<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
you are in the space so that the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.710 
you are in the space so that the
perspective<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.700> correct<00:01:42.060> no<00:01:42.329> matter<00:01:42.509> where

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
perspective is correct no matter where

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.090 
perspective is correct no matter where
you<00:01:42.840> are<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:42.990> what<00:01:43.259> direction<00:01:43.409> you're<00:01:43.770> looking

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
you are in what direction you're looking

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.160 
you are in what direction you're looking
and<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.790> gives<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.329> sensation<00:01:45.990> of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and that gives you this sensation of

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.069 
and that gives you this sensation of
being<00:01:46.280> immersed<00:01:47.280> into<00:01:47.640> whatever<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.630> virtual

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
being immersed into whatever the virtual

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.350 
being immersed into whatever the virtual
environment<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.460> think<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.210> most

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
environment is I think the most

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.240 
environment is I think the most
rewarding<00:01:51.450> thing<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.110> any<00:01:52.290> project<00:01:53.009> that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
rewarding thing with any project that

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.670 
rewarding thing with any project that
you<00:01:53.430> craft<00:01:53.820> or<00:01:54.240> build<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:55.020> actually<00:01:55.409> seeing

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
you craft or build is actually seeing

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.319 
you craft or build is actually seeing
its<00:01:55.860> finished<00:01:56.159> product<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.850> being<00:01:57.030> able<00:01:57.119> to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
its finished product and being able to

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.920 
its finished product and being able to
experience<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> think<00:01:59.520> this<00:02:00.420> right<00:02:00.750> now

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
experience it so I think this right now

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.240 
experience it so I think this right now
is<00:02:01.140> probably<00:02:01.350> one<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> most<00:02:02.009> rewarding

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
is probably one of the most rewarding
