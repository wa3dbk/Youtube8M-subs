00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.430
 your credit card account she is the 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.550
 keystone of your tranquility in 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.530
 our comfort and your security you 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.910
 connecting to the digital world in which 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.950
 we are evolving today 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.570
 so why places and your 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.670
 government and are they in the process 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.080
 to try to introduce a harmful law 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.330
 for you and your card 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.610
 the new bill imposes a 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.860
 capping of interchange fees and 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.140
 create an unfair playground by 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.580
 favor expensive cards meant for the most 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.690
 rich 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.970
 the major card companies of 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.260
 payment as mastercard and visa and 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.180
 have not even tried to explain 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.810
 the body impact and its capping of 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.070
 charge on your life and your card 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.600
 the interchange is the fees paid 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.820
 by a trader when he decides 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.440
 to accept bank cards this 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.150
 making them profit in return 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.160
 more and can offer you a 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.079
 more fluid payment experience and 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.640
 more secure 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.680
 these expenses cover several assets 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.810
 important things that make the cards 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.230
 payment so convenient as access to 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.930
 credit 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.090
 security and protection against 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.070
 fraud and non-payment insurance 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.960
 this new law would cap its 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.580
 costs and even if a ceiling of 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.490
 fresh may seem like a good idea 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.500
 in the end you will pay a fee 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.420
 higher bank would have access 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.400
 more limited to credit and would be less 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.049
 financially protected 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.970
 cost caps are already in 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.430
 force in several countries and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.470
 consumers already pay the price by 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.060
 example since the introduction of 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.340
 cap on fees in Spain 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.020
 this measure has already cost 2.3 billion 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.149
 more euros to the consumer 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.520
 in australia and consumers pay 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.579
 up to 50 % more to use their 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.350
 credit card and usa the majority 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.009
 cheap banking options or 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.030
 totally gone but there is worse 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.130
 some of the eu member countries 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.530
 try to impose an agreement without 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.270
 consultation aimed at exonerating 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.880
 cards used by the richest of 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.679
 these capping two brothers exonerated 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.810
 cards like american express and 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.640
 would create a two-tier system in 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.240
 your disadvantage 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.549
 unlike bank cards 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.590
 normal these cards charge a fee 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.420
 high annual and are only slightly 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.959
 accepted because it is very expensive for 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.599
 tradespeople 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.799
 if these more expensive cards are not 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.569
 included in the new law 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.760
 they will eventually replace the cards 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.319
 normal used today because they 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.720
 will become more profitable for 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.670
 companies that issue them a law that 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.530
 limits your cards normal but protects 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.870
 the cards of the richest ni 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.470
 fairness nor coherence it's a 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.599
 bad idea 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.340
 so while we go out the red carpet 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.739
 for the rich, you get your pockets 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.090
 to pay the bill 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.870
 happily this bill can 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.769
 still be reformed but time is running out 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.420
 do not let the fight of 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.160
 governments against mastercard and visa 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.990
 have consequences on your cards 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.110
 act to protect your safety 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.390
 financial and your savings place is 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.820
 already acting then reacted it's 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.400
 now we are all concerned and 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.110
 we need your help 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.550
 sign the petition is said to take place and to 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.260
 your government to stop their 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.740
 Interference because your credit card 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.740
 account
