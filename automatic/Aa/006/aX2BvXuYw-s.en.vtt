00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
you know it brought it into a different

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.560 
you know it brought it into a different
class<00:01:20.080> of<00:01:20.410> guitar<00:01:20.770> I<00:01:20.979> mean<00:01:21.190> as<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.880> standard

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
class of guitar I mean as a standard

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.779 
class of guitar I mean as a standard
guitar<00:01:22.800> it's<00:01:23.800> a<00:01:23.890> great<00:01:24.160> guitar<00:01:24.550> for<00:01:24.759> a

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
guitar it's a great guitar for a

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.999 
guitar it's a great guitar for a
beginner<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:28.240> know<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.899> woods<00:01:29.380> good<00:01:29.740> the

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
beginner you know the woods good the

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.520 
beginner you know the woods good the
sounds<00:01:30.490> good<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:31.420> electrics<00:01:31.960> work<00:01:32.170> really

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
sounds good the electrics work really

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.810 
sounds good the electrics work really
well<00:01:32.890> I<00:01:33.280> think<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.899> only<00:01:35.250> single<00:01:36.250> factor<00:01:36.640> that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
well I think the only single factor that

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.690 
well I think the only single factor that
perhaps<00:01:37.479> let<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:38.020> down<00:01:38.259> a<00:01:38.590> tiny<00:01:39.039> bit<00:01:39.220> is<00:01:39.550> the

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
perhaps let it down a tiny bit is the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.410 
perhaps let it down a tiny bit is the
machine<00:01:40.060> head's<00:01:40.330> but<00:01:40.600> as<00:01:40.720> I<00:01:41.170> say<00:01:41.380> for<00:01:41.830> a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
machine head's but as I say for a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.810 
machine head's but as I say for a
beginner<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:44.110> machine<00:01:44.500> heads<00:01:44.800> are<00:01:45.550> what

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
beginner the machine heads are what

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.790 
beginner the machine heads are what
you'd<00:01:45.970> expect<00:01:46.450> for<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.690> price<00:01:46.990> for<00:01:47.349> a<00:01:47.410> guitar

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
you'd expect for a price for a guitar

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.480 
you'd expect for a price for a guitar
cost<00:01:48.099> in<00:01:48.340> 99<00:01:49.030> pounds<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.690> know<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:50.490> have

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
because I have trouble seeing the dots

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.990 
because I have trouble seeing the dots
but<00:02:05.110> other<00:02:05.319> than<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:05.590> it's<00:02:06.069> a<00:02:06.250> fantastic

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
but other than that it's a fantastic

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.999 
but other than that it's a fantastic
guitar<00:02:07.300> in<00:02:07.420> fact<00:02:07.660> by<00:02:07.959> doing<00:02:08.020> that<00:02:08.500> simple

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
guitar in fact by doing that simple

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.120 
guitar in fact by doing that simple

for<00:02:43.480> 99<00:02:44.020> pounds

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.910 

quite<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.489> nice<00:02:47.819> slim<00:02:48.209> taper<00:02:48.569> neck<00:02:48.959> or<00:02:49.319> two<00:02:49.590> not

quite a nice slim taper neck or two not

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.449 
quite a nice slim taper neck or two not
too<00:02:50.160> bad<00:02:50.880> at<00:02:51.060> all<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.840> it's<00:02:52.050> quite<00:02:52.349> a

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
too bad at all and and it's quite a

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.229 
too bad at all and and it's quite a
reasonably<00:02:53.459> light<00:02:54.390> construction<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:57.030> not

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
reasonably light construction it's not

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.410 
reasonably light construction it's not
too<00:02:57.450> heavy<00:02:57.830> as<00:02:58.830> far<00:02:59.400> as<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.610> sang<00:02:59.880> is

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
too heavy as far as the sang is

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.750 
too heavy as far as the sang is
concerned<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:03.769> it's<00:03:04.769> quite<00:03:05.010> trembling<00:03:05.580> it

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
concerned it's it's quite trembling it

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:38.660 
concerned it's it's quite trembling it
is<00:03:06.150> great<00:03:06.540> for<00:03:35.569> because<00:03:36.830> just<00:03:37.830> how<00:03:37.980> trebly<00:03:38.459> is

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
is great for because just how trebly is

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.789 
is great for because just how trebly is
depends<00:03:39.360> where<00:03:39.569> you've<00:03:40.019> got<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.380> settings

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
depends where you've got the settings

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.940 
depends where you've got the settings
you<00:03:41.370> know<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:42.780> can<00:03:42.959> go<00:03:43.110> from<00:03:43.349> a<00:03:43.470> very<00:03:43.650> high

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
you know you can go from a very high

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.180 
you know you can go from a very high
trebly<00:03:44.489> obviously<00:03:45.080> to<00:03:46.080> quite<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.349> muted<00:03:46.860> sound

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
trebly obviously to quite a muted sound

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.000 
trebly obviously to quite a muted sound
you<00:03:47.640> know<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.360> it<00:03:48.690> obviously<00:03:49.319> it<00:03:49.470> depends<00:03:49.830> on

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
you know and it obviously it depends on

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.039 
you know and it obviously it depends on
how<00:03:50.099> you've<00:03:50.310> got<00:03:50.489> your<00:03:50.640> amp<00:03:50.850> set<00:03:51.150> it<00:03:51.329> set<00:03:51.840> up

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
how you've got your amp set it set up

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.490 
how you've got your amp set it set up
but<00:03:52.320> I<00:03:52.790> mean<00:03:53.790> it's<00:03:54.359> made<00:03:54.570> in<00:03:54.840> China<00:03:57.500> even

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
but I mean it's made in China even
