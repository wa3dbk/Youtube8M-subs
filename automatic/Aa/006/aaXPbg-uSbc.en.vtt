00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.800
 found today for a whole 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.349
 new video on my secondary channel 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.699
 yes yes of course the secondary channel 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.140
 simply because it's all 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.090
 first 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.440
 how tahri jedir faith commented ray 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.030
 but no it's not a fake this koh 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.739
 lanta ray not for the moment I think 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.840
 that the next video should be a 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.940
 faith how tahri I hesitated from the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.469
 do in fact but I have no I have 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.050
 not too much time I just have you 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.629
 propose a comment is simple for 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.149
 once so we end up like you 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.230
 can see on call of duty black ops 2 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.300
 so I bought him there 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.430
 a week and a half I think something 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.530
 in the genre and I played a little bit 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.989
 so I thought it was a game that 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.390
 is not bad at all so here we are 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.460
 found in search and destruction on 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.440
 the cargo map as you can see at 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.830
 the screen I play with the mpc is 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.030
 silent and of course I also 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.979
 the asset end there everything comes rather 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.110
 the fast charging accessory is a 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.830
 little pity they did not deliver 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.690
 for example not happening they do not have 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.020
 omis pass pass it's a big point 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.420
 negative of this call of duty everything 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.119
 just because the mapa is happening 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.649
 I loved this set to everyone and they have it 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.539
 removed her disgusts me a little bit but 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.119
 good listen it does not matter we have to 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.680
 fast charging on weapons in 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.280
 accessories we have to wait a little 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.020
 little, but we have it at the level of 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.509
 this secondary chain it's true that 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.000
 I did not talk about it a lot 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.630
 of this secondary channel I will do 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.149
 a lot of jets doing call of duty 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.789

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.840
 mind croft i want to do a little bit of everything

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.039
 will also offer you some kinds of 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.140
 clips of the week that I do not propose 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.270
 on my main channel because my 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.120
 main chain remains and will remain 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.650
 always fifa at the beginning I was doing a 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.940
 little bit like to the secondary chain 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.400
 I'm going to do a little bit of all the games 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.080
 and I saw that the legs were not following 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.239
 more and more for fifa so I 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.780
 proposed fifa is now I am 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.640
 specialized in fifa and now 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.580

 any good game games where there is 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.170
 some pretty amazing stuff 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.530
 if you send me something on minecraft 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.460
 where you created I do not have a house 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.950

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.310
 but if you send me here are some kills 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.470
 nice on halo claude duty or even 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.570
 fifa or even ps for players of 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.430
 pes even if we do not have many 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.300
 ps players they can send me 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.000
 clips 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.430
 it will actually be the clip of the week and 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.840
 that is, I would choose mostly 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.910
 his clips at the end of the week handle 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.890
 on the email address in question that I 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.870
 will put in the next video and I 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.140
 will look at all the youtube links that 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.610
 you see to send or not 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.650
 about the clips and I will watch 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.910
 so at the end of the week every 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.590
 clips that were sent to me 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.140
 different games so I'll watch from 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.570
 call of duty halot dalein is actually 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.460
 what I will do is that among all these 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.260
 stuff I would take the one that made me the most 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.970
 impressed especially the games so I 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.460
 play to call of duty I played water I 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.930
 play fifa i played pes so 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.600
 any game of tricks 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.310
 extraordinary one good stuff and 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.620
 then this will be the clip of the week 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.080
 is the one who wins will be in my only 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.220
 so secondary box is also main 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.640
 because it's the one where there is the most 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.320
 subscribers 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.740
 so it serves a little bit to nothing and in 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.540
 my this secondary box I have not 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.130
 a lot of good subscribers I have a little 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.630
 but I do not have many 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.990
 so it does not serve much as 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.100
 water but in any case that's the winner 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.710
 will be during 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.410
 a week in the second chain 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.180
 main thing here so anyway 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.950
 I hope you enjoy this concept 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.380
 have bitten the people I think 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.120
 it does not exist on youtube I have 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.650
 wanted to make clips of the day before 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.360
 as I did as I did before 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.750
 and I was told this is he explains the 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.980
 week 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.600
 you have to do them what actually 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.390
 I was doing one a week clips from 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.350
 day it was not interesting so the 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.930
 blow I'm going to do the clips of the 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.340
 week and especially the games so here 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.600
 anyway do not worry if you 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.400
 do not necessarily understand I think 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.970
 that you understood but even if you 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.880
 did not understand 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.670
 a video arrives in a very short time 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.770
 so if not for this channel on 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.180
 is soon to 200 subscribers while I 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.350
 posted a video and I put a 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.360
 background make a video 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.430
 if we can call it a video because 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.980
 that I put a video where it's a 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.950
 introduction of clips on halo 4 a 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.290
 music and then finishes so I soon 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.750
 200 school subscribers practically 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.520
 can say it no video I posted 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.290
 that's because it's true that since 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.680
 it is created I have not come out and 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:53.140
 video but on average the number of 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.870
 videos that will have it will be pretty much a 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.000
 video a week one video a week 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.620
 if I can make some fresh jeans from this 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.410
 will not be very long videos that will be 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.610
 deviated to the maximum of ten 10 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.140
 minutes a quarter of an hour but it will only be 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.180
 not videos as long as on my 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.130
 main chain what about my channel 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.130
 main and video is between 20 and 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.750
 half an hour is between 20 and 30 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.400
 about minutes on my channel 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.870
 main and it takes me a lot of 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.520
 time so a main chain that 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.170
 will always stay at two to three 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.760
 videos a week and I have my channel 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:25.690
 secondary school where I will propose other 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.490

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.710

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.610
 what clips of the week makes 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:57.670
 Top 10 is of the top 5 of this fact fifa 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:00.520
 tops 5 makes top 5 I do not know to 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.320
 Water call of duty any rest in 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.370
 comment of this video the stuff that 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.080
 you want on this channel 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.550
 and that's according to this video and 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.040
 it's based on those comments 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.540
 that my video is going to develop because 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.760
 that for the moment brrr I have some 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.580
 ideas the clips of the week here I have 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.990
 do a few things but it's a bit 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.510
 rough draft 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.770
 so we just finished this part on 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.320
 a score of 4 1 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:27.010
 and for information the score is not 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.630
 scored but I made a ratio of 11 1 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.620
 in search and destruction including a
