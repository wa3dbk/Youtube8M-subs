00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.109 
to take this blowtorch that you can hear
right<00:00:27.800> now<00:00:27.829> and<00:00:28.369> I'm<00:00:28.489> going<00:00:28.640> to<00:00:28.699> melt<00:00:29.029> down

right now and I'm going to melt down

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.109 
right now and I'm going to melt down
this<00:00:29.660> supposedly<00:00:30.289> fire<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:31.279> waterproof<00:00:31.880> hard

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
this supposedly fire and waterproof hard

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.450 
this supposedly fire and waterproof hard
drive<00:00:32.390> here<00:00:32.870> we<00:00:32.930> go<00:00:33.050> step<00:00:33.650> away<00:00:33.770> from<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.190> hard

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
drive here we go step away from the hard

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.650 
drive here we go step away from the hard
drive<00:00:34.640> AJ<00:00:35.180> step<00:00:35.480> away<00:00:35.600> from<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:36.050> hard<00:00:36.320> drive

drive AJ step away from the hard drive

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.759 
drive AJ step away from the hard drive
wasn't<00:00:38.660> expecting<00:00:38.750> that<00:00:39.140> I<00:00:39.290> our<00:00:39.440> chief<00:00:39.620> has

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769

actually<00:00:42.019> going<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.589> burn<00:00:42.920> it<00:00:43.100> down<00:00:43.129> because

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
actually going to burn it down because

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.130 
actually going to burn it down because
we<00:00:43.790> didn't<00:00:44.059> get<00:00:44.150> the<00:00:44.269> proper<00:00:44.600> permits<00:00:44.780> and

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
we didn't get the proper permits and

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.960 
we didn't get the proper permits and
everything<00:00:45.470> but<00:00:45.860> we<00:00:45.980> are<00:00:46.100> taking<00:00:46.339> a<00:00:46.579> look<00:00:46.760> at

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
everything but we are taking a look at

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.660 
everything but we are taking a look at
Anna<00:00:47.239> cased<00:00:47.629> hard<00:00:48.379> drive<00:00:48.710> that<00:00:49.190> is<00:00:49.220> supposedly

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
Anna cased hard drive that is supposedly

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.240 
Anna cased hard drive that is supposedly
fire<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:50.629> water<00:00:50.930> proof<00:00:53.979> this<00:00:54.979> particular

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
fire and water proof this particular

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.310 
fire and water proof this particular
device<00:00:55.640> that's<00:00:55.909> made<00:00:56.059> by<00:00:56.089> century<00:00:56.690> safe<00:00:57.049> and

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
device that's made by century safe and

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.229 
device that's made by century safe and
like<00:00:57.409> aj<00:00:57.710> said<00:00:57.920> it's<00:00:58.070> fire<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:58.489> waterproof<00:00:59.030> it

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
like aj said it's fire and waterproof it

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.420 
like aj said it's fire and waterproof it
can<00:00:59.390> last<00:00:59.629> it<00:01:00.170> basically<00:01:00.379> with<00:01:00.830> stands<00:01:01.100> heat

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
can last it basically with stands heat

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.509 
can last it basically with stands heat
up<00:01:01.580> to<00:01:01.760> fifteen<00:01:02.360> hundred<00:01:02.689> and<00:01:02.839> fifty

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
up to fifteen hundred and fifty

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.649 
up to fifteen hundred and fifty
fahrenheit<00:01:04.519> which<00:01:04.790> is<00:01:04.909> pretty<00:01:05.089> substantial

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
fahrenheit which is pretty substantial

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.929 
fahrenheit which is pretty substantial
the<00:01:05.750> average<00:01:06.020> fire<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:07.220> know<00:01:07.340> in<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.670> really

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
the average fire you know in a really

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.210 
the average fire you know in a really
heated<00:01:08.119> room<00:01:08.420> is<00:01:08.570> about<00:01:08.750> 1100<00:01:09.439> Fahrenheit<00:01:09.890> Wow

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
heated room is about 1100 Fahrenheit Wow

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.490 
heated room is about 1100 Fahrenheit Wow
so<00:01:10.640> it's<00:01:11.390> it's<00:01:11.630> pretty<00:01:11.840> safe<00:01:11.990> burn<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:12.470> down

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
so it's it's pretty safe burn it down

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.380 
so it's it's pretty safe burn it down
but<00:01:13.100> it<00:01:13.189> will<00:01:13.310> only<00:01:13.400> last<00:01:13.700> for<00:01:13.850> about<00:01:13.939> 30

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
but it will only last for about 30

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.600 
but it will only last for about 30
minutes<00:01:14.659> so<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:15.500> got<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:15.950> go<00:01:16.040> in<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.430> same

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
minutes so you got to go in and the same

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.460 
minutes so you got to go in and the same
it<00:01:16.759> really<00:01:16.970> quick<00:01:17.180> yeah<00:01:17.720> not<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.110> fire

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
it really quick yeah not the fire

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.810 
it really quick yeah not the fire
department<00:01:18.830> gets<00:01:18.890> their<00:01:19.100> cookie<00:01:19.430> and<00:01:19.640> the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
department gets their cookie and the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.999 
department gets their cookie and the
idea<00:01:19.909> is<00:01:20.119> waterproof<00:01:20.810> as<00:01:21.140> well<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:21.680> the

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
idea is waterproof as well so that the

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.940 
idea is waterproof as well so that the
whole<00:01:22.780> concept<00:01:23.780> behind<00:01:23.869> this<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.350> protecting

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
whole concept behind this is protecting

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.560 
whole concept behind this is protecting
your<00:01:25.070> data<00:01:25.219> we<00:01:25.429> talk<00:01:25.640> about<00:01:25.789> that<00:01:26.090> all<00:01:26.359> the

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
your data we talk about that all the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.239 
your data we talk about that all the
time<00:01:26.719> in<00:01:27.049> terms<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.320> making<00:01:27.469> backups<00:01:28.100> and

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
time in terms of making backups and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:29.560 
time in terms of making backups and
things<00:01:28.490> like<00:01:28.609> that<00:01:28.670> but<00:01:28.939> if<00:01:29.060> you're<00:01:29.179> backing

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
things like that but if you're backing

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.539 
things like that but if you're backing
up<00:01:29.719> in<00:01:29.899> your<00:01:30.350> office<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.009> your<00:01:31.189> office

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
up in your office and your office

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.459 
up in your office and your office
catches<00:01:31.909> on<00:01:32.030> fire<00:01:32.240> well<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:33.140> don't<00:01:33.229> have<00:01:33.350> a

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
catches on fire well you don't have a

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.080 
catches on fire well you don't have a
backup<00:01:33.649> anymore<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.399> idea<00:01:34.490> here<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:34.969> that

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
backup anymore so the idea here is that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.489 
backup anymore so the idea here is that
you<00:01:35.299> can<00:01:35.420> actually<00:01:35.569> protect<00:01:35.840> all<00:01:36.229> of<00:01:36.259> your

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:36.499 
you can actually protect all of your

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:39.520 
you can actually protect all of your
data<00:01:36.710> with<00:01:37.280> this<00:01:37.460> rather<00:01:38.090> large<00:01:38.350> not<00:01:39.350> too

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
data with this rather large not too

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.760 
data with this rather large not too
heavy<00:01:39.819> fire<00:01:40.819> and<00:01:41.060> water<00:01:41.240> pants<00:01:41.569> dirty<00:01:41.990> yeah<00:01:42.499> so

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
heavy fire and water pants dirty yeah so

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.630 
heavy fire and water pants dirty yeah so
how<00:01:42.890> do<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.009> connect<00:01:43.310> it<00:01:43.399> to<00:01:43.490> your<00:01:43.520> computer

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
how do you connect it to your computer

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.749 
how do you connect it to your computer
pretty<00:01:44.149> straightforward<00:01:44.719> connects<00:01:45.409> via<00:01:45.679> USB

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
pretty straightforward connects via USB

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.340 
pretty straightforward connects via USB
it<00:01:46.759> actually<00:01:46.939> gets<00:01:47.149> its<00:01:47.359> power<00:01:47.569> from<00:01:47.719> USB<00:01:48.020> as

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
it actually gets its power from USB as

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.840 
it actually gets its power from USB as
well<00:01:48.530> which<00:01:48.679> is<00:01:48.799> pretty<00:01:48.950> normal<00:01:49.280> for<00:01:49.579> a

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
well which is pretty normal for a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.219 
well which is pretty normal for a
portable<00:01:50.270> hard<00:01:50.569> drive<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:50.869> just<00:01:51.049> wouldn't

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
portable hard drive you just wouldn't

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.359 
portable hard drive you just wouldn't
expect<00:01:51.319> to<00:01:51.590> see<00:01:51.740> something<00:01:52.039> that's<00:01:52.130> big

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
expect to see something that's big

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.819 
expect to see something that's big
getting<00:01:52.639> power<00:01:52.819> from<00:01:52.939> USB<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:54.409> other<00:01:54.530> thing<00:01:54.740> I

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
getting power from USB the other thing I

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.080 
getting power from USB the other thing I
was<00:01:54.979> thinking<00:01:55.009> is<00:01:55.399> that<00:01:55.429> could<00:01:55.789> be<00:01:55.939> the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
was thinking is that could be the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.969 
was thinking is that could be the
Achilles<00:01:56.479> heel<00:01:56.689> just<00:01:56.899> in<00:01:57.109> that<00:01:57.319> it<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.829> one

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
Achilles heel just in that it is the one

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.169 
Achilles heel just in that it is the one
entry<00:01:58.310> point<00:01:58.520> but<00:01:58.670> that's<00:01:58.819> why<00:01:58.969> they<00:01:59.090> don't

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
entry point but that's why they don't

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.120 
entry point but that's why they don't
have<00:01:59.389> a<00:01:59.420> lot<00:01:59.689> of<00:01:59.719> different<00:02:00.409> power<00:02:00.590> connectors

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
have a lot of different power connectors

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.949 
have a lot of different power connectors
one<00:02:01.340> point<00:02:01.609> to<00:02:01.700> get<00:02:01.789> your<00:02:01.939> information<00:02:02.119> in<00:02:02.569> one

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
one point to get your information in one

point to get your information out so

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.599 
point to get your information out so
this<00:02:04.939> one<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:05.270> 160<00:02:06.079> gigabyte<00:02:06.499> hard<00:02:06.799> drive<00:02:06.950> if

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
this one is 160 gigabyte hard drive if

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.809 
this one is 160 gigabyte hard drive if
it<00:02:07.969> actually<00:02:08.179> if<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:09.050> gets<00:02:09.440> into<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.709> fire<00:02:10.009> or<00:02:10.340> if

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
it actually if it gets into a fire or if

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.970 
it actually if it gets into a fire or if
you<00:02:11.090> find<00:02:11.390> yourself<00:02:11.990> dropping<00:02:12.680> in<00:02:12.770> at<00:02:12.890> the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
you find yourself dropping in at the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.280 
you find yourself dropping in at the
bottom<00:02:13.220> of<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.400> pool<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.819> guess<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:14.720> flood<00:02:15.140> would

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
bottom of a pool I guess a flood would

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.650 
bottom of a pool I guess a flood would
be<00:02:15.350> more<00:02:15.590> likely<00:02:15.770> what<00:02:16.700> happens<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.300> sometimes

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
be more likely what happens is sometimes

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.690 
be more likely what happens is sometimes
the<00:02:18.020> outer<00:02:18.170> casing<00:02:18.620> can<00:02:18.830> be<00:02:19.010> damaged<00:02:19.430> what<00:02:19.610> you

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
the outer casing can be damaged what you

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.390 
the outer casing can be damaged what you
do<00:02:19.819> is<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.030> take<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.740> program<00:02:22.160> has

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
do is you take that the the program has

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.800 
do is you take that the the program has
there's<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.819> support<00:02:23.209> program<00:02:23.360> basically

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
there's a support program basically

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.630 
there's a support program basically
where<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.530> ship<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:25.010> back<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.580> they

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
where you ship that back and they

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.369 
where you ship that back and they
basically<00:02:25.790> take<00:02:26.360> your<00:02:26.540> hard<00:02:26.720> drive<00:02:26.930> out<00:02:27.140> put

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
basically take your hard drive out put

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.160 
basically take your hard drive out put
it<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.980> new<00:02:28.220> solid<00:02:28.909> casing<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.689> then<00:02:29.989> ship

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
it in a new solid casing and then ship

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.539 
it in a new solid casing and then ship
it<00:02:30.200> back<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.650> like<00:02:30.739> it's<00:02:30.890> brand-new<00:02:31.250> so

submerge<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.459> in<00:02:46.519> water<00:02:46.549> so<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.299> they're

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
submerge it in water so that they're

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.569

saying yes this baby works and your
price<00:02:49.760> point<00:02:49.790> you're<00:02:50.180> about<00:02:50.299> four<00:02:50.569> hundred

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
price point you're about four hundred

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.660 
price point you're about four hundred
dollars<00:02:50.900> for<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:51.439> and<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.709> think<00:02:51.769> that<00:02:52.099> you

dollars for this and I think that you
know<00:02:52.760> regular<00:02:52.969> 160<00:02:53.689> gig<00:02:53.870> hard<00:02:54.079> drive<00:02:54.109> would<00:02:54.379> be

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
know regular 160 gig hard drive would be

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.009 
know regular 160 gig hard drive would be
probably<00:02:54.950> market<00:02:55.519> about<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:56.269> know<00:02:56.329> 150<00:02:56.689> bucks
