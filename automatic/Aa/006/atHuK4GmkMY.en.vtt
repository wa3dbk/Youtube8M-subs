00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.160
 good to all my name is my born of 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.860
 channel two wrestlers hello all I am 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.110
 dark hero amv surely as you 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.299
 will remember for a while we have 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.070
 started to analyze a debate that still 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.079
 despite the time it keeps giving what 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.970
 talk about who would be more powerful 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:24.310
 between goku and superman I for my part 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.320
 I say that Goku wins and I say that 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.359
 superman wins so once and for all 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.519
 we're all going to solve this in a way 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.920
 summary tc of the first part two 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.200
 fighters very well then let's start with 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.000
 this I think goku wins because then 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.980
 to do research on this 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.080
 character makes the numbers have 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.300
 little relevance since your training 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.520
 daily even in death makes your 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.620
 power is constantly increasing 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.020
 that the bases he received from different 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.360
 martial arts masters give him some 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.370
 unbeatable weapons in the melee and 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.830
 it's not just something physical but also 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.870
 spiritual is called a genius of 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.970
 combat and has faced enemies 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.310
 brutal, capable of flying several 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.409
 planets without effort besides owning 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.200
 very convenient techniques for any 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.200
 situation that would be the summary of goku 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.750
 your turn dark good I think superman 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.880
 because of its enormous power and even more 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.829
 even the latent power that is within 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.110
 he who makes him completely unstoppable 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.880
 in front of anything being able to 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.340
 carry the weight of the world during 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.500
 several days resist explosions of 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.899
 powerful supernovas go at speeds 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.000
 incomprehensible to anyone, 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.250
 all this without knowing the limit of 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.140
 its strength that when receiving energy from the sun 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.299
 makes it virtually infinite 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.939
 also that I think his deeds have 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.899
 been older because of the colossal 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.240
 difficulties you have had to face 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.520
 how to keep a black hole in your 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.720
 hand or avoid the collision of two worlds 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.720
 standing in the middle 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.360
 and well that's all x d so that's really 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.810
 we have nothing more to say about 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.270
 they 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.610
 I think goku wins and dark ciro thinks 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.679
 what superman wins is that simple 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.719
 what we want to tell you with all this 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.819
 is that it is impossible to put everyone in a 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.370
 only some will be in favor of 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.470
 goku and others of superman that is the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.300
 main point and the meaning of this 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.519
 video since many fans from both sides 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.739
 they fight and argue and I bet that they 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.959
 they would take out their eyes if they could because of 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.120
 this debate but they have to understand that 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.519
 it does not matter that this should not be something of 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.920
 such importance no matter what kind of 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.019
 calculations and equations let's take people out 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.180
 it will always be divided which is not 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.700
 bad everyone has to support their hero 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.010
 favorite but that does not mean that they should 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.260
 discredit the other both goku and 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.000
 superman are great heroes and the fact 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.160
 to think that one wins over another does not 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.650
 makes it necessary that there are so many fights 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.810
 among his fans many think that I am a 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.819
 goku fanboy because I say that goku wins 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.799
 in this fight but if it were like that it would be 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.079
 fan of all the victors of my 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.209
 Combat videos even in a video 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.260
 what I did won superman I just do 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.200
 videos and under me 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.299
 a certain character gains nothing like that and I 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.519
 in my videos I have always remarked that 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.590
 although I say that superman wins does not want 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.450
 to say that I do not like goku is just that 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.459
 I do not think I can beat it, you have to 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.860
 admit that we have also 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.290
 let take a little for this matter x 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.269
 that can happen to anyone but 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.670
 you have to know how to act and reconsider 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.680
 I have both shown enough of our 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.690
 point of view so I think that only 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.209
 is to accept and respect the opinion of 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.579
 the others maybe the conflict of goku and 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.129
 superman never has a concrete ending 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.870
 but what is we are sure 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.120
 that none of that will affect us like 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.459
 to make us fight xd I know that 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.200
 It sounds like something corny but I think it's 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.299
 well that we end this debate as 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.519
 good what in euros than in the 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.709
 that we seek to entertain people and not 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.049
 with absurd garden fights what we 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.940
 leads to a final point we are aware 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.129
 that there are people who enjoy throwing 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.170
 firewood but beforehand I say 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.909
 that's not going to work and I hope that 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.670
 no what swayed integer 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.400
 for those people I think that would be 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.620
 all we have to talk about is not like that 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.190
 I think good then with nothing more than 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.050
 tell 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.590
 a hurray for coconut and a hurray for 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.590
 superman
