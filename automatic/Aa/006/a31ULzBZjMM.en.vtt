eagle and guess what it is my birthday

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.330 
eagle and guess what it is my birthday
today<00:00:04.799> i<00:00:05.100> am<00:00:05.759> now<00:00:05.970> 16<00:00:06.779> but<00:00:07.740> that's<00:00:08.040> not<00:00:08.189> what<00:00:08.309> I

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
today i am now 16 but that's not what I

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.360 
today i am now 16 but that's not what I
made<00:00:08.519> this<00:00:08.670> tutorial<00:00:09.510> about<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:10.280> wanted<00:00:11.280> to

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
made this tutorial about I wanted to

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.820 
made this tutorial about I wanted to
make<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.670> about<00:00:12.110> moving<00:00:13.110> platforms

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
make it about moving platforms

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.029 
make it about moving platforms
specifically<00:00:14.639> horizontally<00:00:15.599> moving

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
specifically horizontally moving

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.800 
specifically horizontally moving
platforms<00:00:17.090> so<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.270> first<00:00:18.390> thing<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.630> we're

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
platforms so the first thing that we're

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.519 
platforms so the first thing that we're
going<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.960> do<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.380> add<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.460> new<00:00:20.670> object<00:00:20.880> and

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
going to do is add in a new object and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.810 
going to do is add in a new object and
I'm<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.680> going<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.859> use<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.070> regular<00:00:23.550> grown

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
I'm just going to use the regular grown

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.019 
I'm just going to use the regular grown
Sprott<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.449> name<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.519> Oh<00:00:26.519> BGA<00:00:27.380> underscore<00:00:28.380> H

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
Sprott and name it Oh BGA underscore H

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.930 
Sprott and name it Oh BGA underscore H
platform<00:00:31.189> now<00:00:32.189> add<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:33.540> create<00:00:34.050> event<00:00:34.940> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
platform now add in a create event and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.369 
platform now add in a create event and
add<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> code<00:00:37.260> h<00:00:37.739> speed<00:00:38.719> equals<00:00:39.719> 2<00:00:41.899> now<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.960> h

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
add the code h speed equals 2 now the h

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.680 
add the code h speed equals 2 now the h
speed<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.920> kind<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.460> v<00:00:44.730> speed<00:00:45.030> except<00:00:45.480> its

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
speed is kind of like v speed except its

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.529 
speed is kind of like v speed except its
horizontal<00:00:46.079> instead<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.860> vertical<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.940> this

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
horizontal instead of vertical so this

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.270 
horizontal instead of vertical so this
is<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.140> allow<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.379> platform<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
is just going to allow the platform to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.060 
is just going to allow the platform to
move<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.840> too<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.800> set<00:00:53.039> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
move and this too it can be set to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.029 
move and this too it can be set to
anything<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.789> want<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.590> best<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
anything that you want but it's best to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.840 
anything that you want but it's best to
keep<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.340> at<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:57.170> slightly<00:00:58.170> slow<00:00:58.710> speed<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.820> it

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
keep it at a slightly slow speed so it

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.340 
keep it at a slightly slow speed so it
won't<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.270> very<00:01:00.300> hard<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.109> player<00:01:01.320> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
won't be very hard for the player to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.579 
won't be very hard for the player to
just<00:01:01.680> jump<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> rod<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:03.290> but<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
just jump on a rod you know but I you

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.010 
just jump on a rod you know but I you
can<00:01:04.860> set<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.309> whatever<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.700> want<00:01:06.020> now

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
can set that to whatever you want now

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.230 
can set that to whatever you want now
add<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.380> another<00:01:07.799> event<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.640> collision<00:01:09.090> with

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
add in another event for collision with

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.140 
add in another event for collision with
object<00:01:09.810> ground<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.799> can<00:01:11.040> use<00:01:11.369> object<00:01:11.850> blocker

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
object ground you can use object blocker

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.090 
object ground you can use object blocker
if<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.630> would<00:01:12.810> prefer<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.680> i'm<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:13.799> going

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
if you would prefer but i'm just going

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.149 
if you would prefer but i'm just going
to<00:01:14.130> use<00:01:14.189> grow<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:16.040> add<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.479> if<00:01:18.479> H<00:01:19.350> speed<00:01:19.920> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to use grow and add in if H speed is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.740 
to use grow and add in if H speed is
over<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.450> greater<00:01:21.869> than<00:01:22.170> 0<00:01:24.470> h<00:01:25.470> speed<00:01:26.750> equals

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
over or greater than 0 h speed equals

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.780 
over or greater than 0 h speed equals
minus<00:01:28.200> 2<00:01:30.200> else

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
minus 2 else

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.420 
minus 2 else
h<00:01:33.790> speed<00:01:34.210> equals<00:01:34.930> 2<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:38.100> when<00:01:39.100> it's<00:01:39.280> going<00:01:39.370> to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
h speed equals 2 so when it's going to

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.710 
h speed equals 2 so when it's going to
be<00:01:39.550> doing<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:39.910> when<00:01:40.120> you<00:01:40.210> collision<00:01:40.570> with<00:01:40.690> the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
be doing is when you collision with the

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.990 
be doing is when you collision with the
ground<00:01:41.020> is<00:01:41.229> going<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.440> check<00:01:41.830> what<00:01:42.670> your<00:01:42.820> h

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
ground is going to check what your h

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.870 
ground is going to check what your h
speed<00:01:43.360> is<00:01:43.600> set<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.229> if<00:01:44.440> it's<00:01:45.430> greater<00:01:45.760> than

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
speed is set to if it's greater than

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.250 
speed is set to if it's greater than
zero<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.660> going<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.020> set<00:01:47.200> your<00:01:47.320> h<00:01:47.470> speed<00:01:48.420> 2-2<00:01:49.420> so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
zero is going to set your h speed 2-2 so

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.630 
zero is going to set your h speed 2-2 so
you'll<00:01:50.560> be<00:01:50.710> moving<00:01:50.890> in<00:01:51.160> the<00:01:51.250> opposite

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
you'll be moving in the opposite

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.100 
you'll be moving in the opposite
direction<00:01:51.790> and<00:01:54.330> basically<00:01:55.330> this<00:01:55.570> is<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.900> same

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
direction and basically this is the same

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.680 
direction and basically this is the same
thing<00:01:56.140> that<00:01:56.380> if<00:01:56.740> it's<00:01:57.280> not<00:01:57.729> greater<00:01:58.119> than<00:01:58.210> zero

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
thing that if it's not greater than zero

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.210 
thing that if it's not greater than zero
then<00:01:59.160> obviously<00:02:00.160> your<00:02:00.910> h<00:02:01.030> speed<00:02:01.300> must<00:02:01.660> be

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
then obviously your h speed must be

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.430 
then obviously your h speed must be
minus<00:02:03.220> two<00:02:03.580> so<00:02:03.850> it<00:02:04.000> just<00:02:04.330> sets<00:02:04.509> it<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:05.110> say

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
minus two so it just sets it to to say

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.310 
minus two so it just sets it to to say
you'll<00:02:05.619> go<00:02:05.770> in<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.040> other<00:02:06.190> direction<00:02:06.430> again

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
you'll go in the other direction again

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.930 
you'll go in the other direction again
so<00:02:08.640> let's<00:02:09.640> get<00:02:09.790> out<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:09.970> this<00:02:10.209> and<00:02:11.190> also<00:02:12.190> make

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
so let's get out of this and also make

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.760 
so let's get out of this and also make
sure<00:02:12.970> it's<00:02:13.239> solid<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.750> forgot<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.320> mention<00:02:14.350> that

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
sure it's solid I forgot to mention that

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.550 
sure it's solid I forgot to mention that
and<00:02:15.330> go<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.630> player<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:18.060> duplicate

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
and go to the player and duplicate

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.920 
and go to the player and duplicate
collision<00:02:20.560> with<00:02:20.770> object<00:02:21.340> ground<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.850> add<00:02:22.720> in

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
collision with object ground and add in

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.330 
collision with object ground and add in
collision<00:02:23.440> with<00:02:23.700> object<00:02:24.700> H<00:02:24.880> platform<00:02:26.100> now<00:02:27.100> go

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
collision with object H platform now go

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.400 
collision with object H platform now go
to<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.459> step<00:02:27.730> event<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.209> go<00:02:28.989> all<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.380> way

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
to the step event and go all the way

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:58.500 
to the step event and go all the way
down<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:30.010> add<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> few<00:02:30.790> lines

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.580 

okay<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:01.330> it's<00:03:02.330> going<00:03:02.569> to<00:03:02.660> check<00:03:02.959> if<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.560> are

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
okay so it's going to check if you are

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.350 
okay so it's going to check if you are
collision<00:03:04.250> with<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.550> object<00:03:05.209> H<00:03:05.989> platform<00:03:06.890> at

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
collision with the object H platform at

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.050 
collision with the object H platform at
the<00:03:08.360> characters<00:03:09.349> of<00:03:09.500> y<00:03:09.650> plus<00:03:09.680> 32<00:03:10.459> position

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
the characters of y plus 32 position

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.400 
the characters of y plus 32 position
which<00:03:11.239> would<00:03:11.420> be<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.660> very<00:03:11.840> bottom<00:03:12.080> of<00:03:12.319> the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
which would be the very bottom of the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.870 
which would be the very bottom of the
character<00:03:13.690> then<00:03:14.690> if<00:03:15.260> your<00:03:16.220> collision<00:03:16.550> with

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
character then if your collision with

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.110 
character then if your collision with
the<00:03:16.910> object<00:03:17.569> then<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.800> players<00:03:19.099> H<00:03:19.459> speed<00:03:19.910> is

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
the object then the players H speed is

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.589 
the object then the players H speed is
set<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.750> object<00:03:21.290> H<00:03:21.440> platforms<00:03:22.310> H<00:03:22.580> speed<00:03:23.060> so

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
set to the object H platforms H speed so

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.059 
set to the object H platforms H speed so
that<00:03:23.630> just<00:03:23.959> allows<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.380> character<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.890> move

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
that just allows the character to move

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.759 
that just allows the character to move
with<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.670> object<00:03:26.090> but<00:03:27.049> when<00:03:27.410> you're<00:03:27.560> not

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
with the object but when you're not

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.930 
with the object but when you're not
collision<00:03:28.099> with<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:30.310> object<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.730> H

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
collision with the object of the H

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.380 
collision with the object of the H
platform<00:03:32.540> object<00:03:32.900> if<00:03:33.489> it's<00:03:34.489> executed<00:03:35.299> this

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
platform object if it's executed this

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.860 
platform object if it's executed this
code<00:03:35.660> already<00:03:35.930> then<00:03:36.680> your<00:03:36.829> H<00:03:36.980> speed<00:03:37.340> will

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
code already then your H speed will

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.559 
code already then your H speed will
always<00:03:38.870> be<00:03:39.110> set<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.860> object<00:03:40.730> H<00:03:40.849> platforms

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
always be set to the object H platforms

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.559 
always be set to the object H platforms
H<00:03:41.780> speed<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:43.250> we<00:03:43.280> need<00:03:43.579> to<00:03:43.700> set<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:44.000> back<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.329> 0

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
H speed so we need to set it back to 0

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.860 
H speed so we need to set it back to 0
with<00:03:44.840> an<00:03:44.989> else<00:03:46.720> ok<00:03:47.720> now<00:03:48.590> let's<00:03:49.060> just<00:03:50.060> on<00:03:50.269> copy

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
with an else ok now let's just on copy

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.610 
with an else ok now let's just on copy
this<00:03:51.500> here<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:53.890> delete<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.400> plus<00:03:55.760> 32<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:57.140> go

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
this here and delete the plus 32 and go

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:13.090 
this here and delete the plus 32 and go
over<00:03:57.920> to<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.220> X<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.849> add<00:03:59.299> in<00:03:59.450> plus<00:03:59.870> 4

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.180 

okay<00:04:13.910> so<00:04:13.970> what<00:04:14.960> this<00:04:15.320> is<00:04:15.530> going<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:15.740> do<00:04:15.950> is<00:04:16.160> it's

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
okay so what this is going to do is it's

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.240 
okay so what this is going to do is it's
going<00:04:16.490> to<00:04:16.580> check<00:04:16.850> if<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.240> are<00:04:18.020> collision<00:04:18.920> with

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
going to check if you are collision with

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.640 
going to check if you are collision with
the<00:04:20.770> each<00:04:21.770> platform<00:04:22.310> at<00:04:22.730> the<00:04:22.760> players<00:04:23.650> right

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
the each platform at the players right

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.410 
the each platform at the players right
side<00:04:25.040> then<00:04:25.460> it's<00:04:25.610> going<00:04:25.700> to<00:04:25.790> move<00:04:25.970> you<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.360> the

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
side then it's going to move you to the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.870 
side then it's going to move you to the
left<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.650> that<00:04:28.100> keeps<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.520> from<00:04:28.730> getting

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
left so that keeps you from getting

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.630 
left so that keeps you from getting
stuck<00:04:29.330> on<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.930> platform<00:04:30.500> so<00:04:31.070> let's<00:04:31.250> just<00:04:31.340> copy

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
stuck on the platform so let's just copy

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.780 
stuck on the platform so let's just copy
and<00:04:31.850> paste<00:04:32.090> this<00:04:32.570> and<00:04:32.810> change<00:04:33.160> this<00:04:34.160> plus<00:04:34.550> to<00:04:34.760> a

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
and paste this and change this plus to a

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.440 
and paste this and change this plus to a
minus<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.450> this<00:04:36.320> minus<00:04:37.100> well<00:04:37.880> let's<00:04:38.270> just

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
minus and this minus well let's just

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.550 
minus and this minus well let's just
remove<00:04:38.720> that<00:04:38.930> modest<00:04:40.450> all<00:04:41.450> right<00:04:41.750> now<00:04:42.290> let's

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
remove that modest all right now let's

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.030 
remove that modest all right now let's
just<00:04:42.740> copy<00:04:43.010> all<00:04:43.460> of<00:04:43.520> this<00:04:44.320> dealing<00:04:45.320> with<00:04:45.530> the

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
just copy all of this dealing with the

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.580 
just copy all of this dealing with the
moving<00:04:46.790> platform<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:49.540> go<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:51.080> Pusha

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
moving platform and go to the Pusha

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.450 
moving platform and go to the Pusha
bilac<00:04:52.120> go<00:04:53.120> into<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.510> step<00:04:53.750> event<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.460> paste

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
bilac go into the step event and paste

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.610 
bilac go into the step event and paste
it<00:04:56.890> all<00:04:57.890> right<00:04:58.220> now<00:04:58.610> duplicate<00:04:59.330> this<00:05:00.110> just

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
it all right now duplicate this just

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.860 
it all right now duplicate this just
like<00:05:00.770> we<00:05:00.890> did<00:05:01.010> with<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.190> player<00:05:01.870> collision

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
like we did with the player collision

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.750 
like we did with the player collision
with<00:05:03.080> object<00:05:03.860> H<00:05:04.040> platform<00:05:05.410> now<00:05:06.430> let's<00:05:07.430> modify

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
with object H platform now let's modify

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.810 
with object H platform now let's modify
the<00:05:07.940> room<00:05:08.240> a<00:05:08.360> little<00:05:08.480> bit<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:12.550> add<00:05:13.550> in<00:05:13.730> the

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
the room a little bit and add in the

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:27.760 
the room a little bit and add in the
platform<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:16.780> test

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:34.710 

all<00:05:28.370> right<00:05:28.990> player<00:05:29.990> moves<00:05:30.319> with<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.770> platform

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.600 

he<00:05:35.720> is<00:05:35.900> pushed<00:05:36.229> out<00:05:36.349> of<00:05:36.409> the<00:05:36.590> way<00:05:36.740> if<00:05:36.979> he's<00:05:37.430> on

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
he is pushed out of the way if he's on

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.640 
he is pushed out of the way if he's on
the<00:05:37.729> side<00:05:40.240> now<00:05:41.240> let's<00:05:41.569> go<00:05:41.750> back<00:05:41.780> up<00:05:42.110> here<00:05:42.349> and

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
the side now let's go back up here and

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:52.749 
the side now let's go back up here and
push<00:05:45.650> this<00:05:46.009> block<00:05:46.370> over<00:05:46.879> onto<00:05:47.270> it<00:05:50.470> and<00:05:51.759> it

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
push this block over onto it and it

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.670 
push this block over onto it and it
works<00:05:53.000> yay<00:05:55.360> all<00:05:56.360> right<00:05:56.569> so<00:05:56.810> that's<00:05:57.199> pretty

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
works yay all right so that's pretty

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.249 
works yay all right so that's pretty
much<00:05:57.830> it<00:05:57.889> for<00:05:58.099> this<00:05:58.310> tutorial<00:05:58.610> I<00:05:59.120> hope<00:05:59.750> that
