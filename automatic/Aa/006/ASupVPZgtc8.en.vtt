00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.450 

here's<00:00:00.750> my<00:00:00.960> first<00:00:01.230> attempt<00:00:01.650> at<00:00:01.770> making<00:00:01.829> a

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
here's my first attempt at making a

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.230 
here's my first attempt at making a
leaner<00:00:02.820> servo<00:00:03.360> out<00:00:03.600> of<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:04.080> normal<00:00:04.500> HS<00:00:05.240> 55

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
leaner servo out of a normal HS 55

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.280 
leaner servo out of a normal HS 55
high-tech<00:00:06.779> servo<00:00:08.179> so<00:00:09.179> I've<00:00:09.389> just<00:00:09.420> used<00:00:09.990> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
high-tech servo so I've just used the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.459 
high-tech servo so I've just used the
number<00:00:10.889> 8<00:00:10.980> bolt<00:00:11.280> with<00:00:11.519> robertson<00:00:12.210> head<00:00:12.389> it's<00:00:13.349> a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
number 8 bolt with robertson head it's a

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.870 
number 8 bolt with robertson head it's a
new<00:00:13.650> channel<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.460> bent<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.880> shape<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
new channel that I bent to shape and

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.679 
new channel that I bent to shape and
here's<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.090> linear<00:00:18.449> servo<00:00:20.210> I've<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.480> AB

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
here's the linear servo I've just AB

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.170 
here's the linear servo I've just AB
strapped<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.769> piece<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.160> there<00:00:26.000> there's<00:00:27.000> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
strapped that piece on there there's the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.299 
strapped that piece on there there's the
bolt<00:00:28.099> threaded<00:00:29.099> plunger<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.449> two<00:00:30.630> stops

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
bolt threaded plunger and the two stops

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.250 
bolt threaded plunger and the two stops
there's<00:00:32.309> some<00:00:32.489> fishing<00:00:32.820> line<00:00:32.850> dangling<00:00:33.630> about

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
there's some fishing line dangling about

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.680 
there's some fishing line dangling about
a<00:00:34.320> liter<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.710> water<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:36.149> kilogram<00:00:36.480> of

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
a liter of water so one kilogram of

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.619 
a liter of water so one kilogram of
water<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:38.010> I'm<00:00:38.520> gonna<00:00:38.670> show<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.879> how<00:00:39.540> it

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
water and I'm gonna show you how it

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.950 
water and I'm gonna show you how it
works<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.469> very<00:00:40.680> fast<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
works it's not very fast what is the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.869 
works it's not very fast what is the
trick<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:44.450> right<00:00:45.450> now<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.809> lifting<00:00:46.230> up<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
trick so right now it's lifting up the

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:53.830 
trick so right now it's lifting up the
bottle<00:00:48.920> not<00:00:49.920> very<00:00:50.250> quickly<00:00:51.170> what's<00:00:52.170> doing<00:00:52.559> it

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
bottle not very quickly what's doing it

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.479 
bottle not very quickly what's doing it
mr.<00:00:54.840> voules<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.230> little<00:00:55.530> underpowered<00:00:56.010> it's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
mr. voules a little underpowered it's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.310 
mr. voules a little underpowered it's
pretty<00:00:56.760> much<00:00:56.910> maxing<00:00:57.539> out<00:00:57.660> its<00:00:57.870> abilities

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
pretty much maxing out its abilities

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.779 
pretty much maxing out its abilities
please<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.489> lifting<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.359> kilogram<00:01:01.260> so

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
please it is lifting a kilogram so

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.160 
please it is lifting a kilogram so
that's<00:01:02.789> not<00:01:03.000> bad<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> HS<00:01:03.930> 55<00:01:04.559> servo<00:01:06.170> it's

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that's not bad for a HS 55 servo it's

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.649 
that's not bad for a HS 55 servo it's
just<00:01:07.409> clicking<00:01:07.619> because<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.820> top<00:01:09.180> gear<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
just clicking because the top gear is a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.500 
just clicking because the top gear is a
little<00:01:09.869> crooked<00:01:10.020> SS<00:01:11.010> expect<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.330> not<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
little crooked SS expect but it's not a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.910 
little crooked SS expect but it's not a
big<00:01:12.689> deal

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.760 

so<00:01:15.790> it's<00:01:15.909> lifted<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.390> about<00:01:17.729> 15<00:01:18.729> millimeters

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
so it's lifted it about 15 millimeters

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.870 
so it's lifted it about 15 millimeters
took<00:01:20.770> a<00:01:20.890> while<00:01:21.040> but<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:21.670> can<00:01:21.850> do<00:01:21.970> it<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:23.880> if

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
took a while but you can do it so if

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.990 
took a while but you can do it so if
your<00:01:25.060> application<00:01:25.180> calls<00:01:25.930> for<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.970> lot<00:01:27.970> of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
your application calls for a lot of

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.690 
your application calls for a lot of
torque<00:01:28.330> or<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:29.020> lot<00:01:29.229> of<00:01:29.350> force<00:01:29.560> but<00:01:30.100> very<00:01:30.369> little

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
torque or a lot of force but very little

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.030 
torque or a lot of force but very little
movement<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:32.110> probably<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.590> way<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:32.740> do<00:01:32.920> it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
movement it's probably the way to do it

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.730 
movement it's probably the way to do it
and<00:01:33.330> with<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.420> potentiometer<00:01:35.080> disconnected

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
and with the potentiometer disconnected

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.820 
and with the potentiometer disconnected
it's<00:01:35.890> just<00:01:36.070> rate<00:01:36.280> dependent<00:01:36.790> pushy<00:01:37.830> let's

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
it's just rate dependent pushy let's

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.219 
it's just rate dependent pushy let's
turn<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.340> stick<00:01:39.580> a<00:01:39.610> little<00:01:39.909> bit<00:01:40.060> it'll<00:01:41.020> just

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
turn the stick a little bit it'll just

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.160 
turn the stick a little bit it'll just
go<00:01:41.380> slowly<00:01:41.680> then<00:01:42.640> just<00:01:42.820> stick<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.450> lot<00:01:43.690> goes

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
go slowly then just stick a lot goes

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.190 
go slowly then just stick a lot goes
quickly<00:01:46.050> so<00:01:47.050> I've<00:01:47.470> actually<00:01:47.680> made<00:01:48.009> this

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
quickly so I've actually made this

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.270 
quickly so I've actually made this
little<00:01:50.200> wiener<00:01:50.440> servo<00:01:51.009> for<00:01:51.369> an<00:01:52.030> RC<00:01:52.539> excavator

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
little wiener servo for an RC excavator

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.359 
little wiener servo for an RC excavator
and<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.960> want<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.259> sticks<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.680> be<00:01:56.770> great

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
and you want the sticks to be great

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.130 
and you want the sticks to be great
defendant<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.000> that<00:01:58.149> just<00:01:58.869> like<00:01:59.020> the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
defendant in that just like the

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.070 
defendant in that just like the
hydraulics<00:01:59.649> and<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.130> control<00:02:00.429> so<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.869> will

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
hydraulics and the control so this will

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.490 
hydraulics and the control so this will
work<00:02:02.200> quite<00:02:02.440> well<00:02:02.530> for<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:04.110> I'm<00:02:05.110> gonna<00:02:05.259> fix

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
work quite well for that I'm gonna fix

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.960 
work quite well for that I'm gonna fix
the<00:02:05.649> clicking<00:02:06.039> and<00:02:06.250> then<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:06.520> can<00:02:06.700> use<00:02:06.820> the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
the clicking and then I can use the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.249 
the clicking and then I can use the
servo<00:02:07.330> as<00:02:07.450> such<00:02:07.630> my<00:02:07.810> RC

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
servo as such my RC

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.469 
servo as such my RC
