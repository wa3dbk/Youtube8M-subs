and<00:00:05.160> into<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.399> bit<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.640> trouble<00:00:05.729> here<00:00:06.319> as<00:00:07.319> you

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
and into a bit of trouble here as you

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.000 
and into a bit of trouble here as you
can<00:00:07.589> see<00:00:07.680> it's<00:00:08.040> big<00:00:08.360> what<00:00:09.360> I'll<00:00:09.510> do<00:00:10.010> the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
can see it's big what I'll do the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.560 
can see it's big what I'll do the
problem<00:00:11.459> is<00:00:11.639> I've<00:00:12.240> mounted<00:00:12.510> the<00:00:12.779> pump<00:00:13.080> dead<00:00:14.570> so

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
problem is I've mounted the pump dead so

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.849 
problem is I've mounted the pump dead so
I<00:00:15.600> don't<00:00:15.959> know<00:00:16.020> if<00:00:16.139> I've<00:00:16.230> got<00:00:16.350> enough<00:00:16.590> space

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
I don't know if I've got enough space

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.070 
I don't know if I've got enough space
but<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.250> look<00:00:17.400> like<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.820> let's<00:00:18.480> just<00:00:18.689> compare<00:00:18.990> it

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
but I look like it let's just compare it

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.790 
but I look like it let's just compare it
to<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.260> old<00:00:19.410> 750<00:00:20.130> thermaltake<00:00:20.669> oh<00:00:25.220> my<00:00:26.220> god

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
to the old 750 thermaltake oh my god

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.769 
to the old 750 thermaltake oh my god
that<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.279> massive<00:00:29.669> difference<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.480> pumps

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that is a massive difference that pumps

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.889 
that is a massive difference that pumps
got<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.019> move<00:00:31.169> I'm<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.650> trouble<00:00:32.750> anyway<00:00:33.750> I'll

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
got to move I'm in trouble anyway I'll

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.690 
got to move I'm in trouble anyway I'll
figure<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.230> out<00:00:34.410> that's<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> power<00:00:35.460> supply

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
figure it out that's the power supply

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.570 
figure it out that's the power supply
anyway<00:00:40.520> really<00:00:41.520> nice<00:00:41.670> power<00:00:42.240> supply<00:00:42.660> yes

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
anyway really nice power supply yes

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.380 
anyway really nice power supply yes
inside<00:00:44.580> is<00:00:44.790> awesome<00:00:46.970> nice

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
inside is awesome nice

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.200 
inside is awesome nice
it's<00:00:49.960> really<00:00:50.380> heavy<00:00:50.649> this<00:00:51.489> actually<00:00:51.790> just

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
it's really heavy this actually just

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.780 
it's really heavy this actually just
feels<00:00:52.390> like<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.600> twat<00:00:52.899> now<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:54.309> feels<00:00:54.489> like<00:00:54.670> a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
feels like a twat now this feels like a

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.830 
feels like a twat now this feels like a
toy<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:57.610> is<00:00:57.730> how<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.910> computers<00:00:58.390> looking<00:00:58.629> so

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
toy this is how the computers looking so

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.119 
toy this is how the computers looking so
far<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:01.180> remount<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.720> pump<00:01:02.050> because<00:01:02.860> of<00:01:03.070> the

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
far the remount the pump because of the

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.660 
far the remount the pump because of the
size<00:01:03.370> of<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.659> size<00:01:04.659> of<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:05.160> power<00:01:06.160> supplied

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
size of the size of the power supplied

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.180 
size of the size of the power supplied
nearly<00:01:06.970> touches<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.540> hard<00:01:07.960> drive<00:01:08.170> had<00:01:09.070> it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
nearly touches the hard drive had it

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.320 
nearly touches the hard drive had it
sitting<00:01:09.340> there<00:01:09.610> before<00:01:09.880> so<00:01:10.000> I've<00:01:10.090> got<00:01:10.240> it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
sitting there before so I've got it

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.910 
sitting there before so I've got it
sitting<00:01:10.509> here<00:01:10.720> at<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.170> drain<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.800> system

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
sitting here at the drain the system

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.719 
sitting here at the drain the system
again<00:01:12.630> after<00:01:13.630> bleeding<00:01:13.810> out<00:01:14.020> all<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.259> bubbles

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
again after bleeding out all the bubbles

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.870 
again after bleeding out all the bubbles
that<00:01:15.729> was<00:01:15.850> a<00:01:15.880> bit<00:01:16.060> messy<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.830> these<00:01:18.460> tubes<00:01:18.790> are

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
that was a bit messy the these tubes are

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.719 
that was a bit messy the these tubes are
so<00:01:19.030> hard<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.270> get<00:01:19.450> on<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:20.860> it's<00:01:20.979> all<00:01:21.100> right<00:01:21.280> so

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
so hard to get on but it's all right so

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:22.830 
so hard to get on but it's all right so
there<00:01:21.970> are<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.090> lot<00:01:22.240> shorter<00:01:22.450> I've<00:01:22.630> kept

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
there are a lot shorter I've kept

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.040 
there are a lot shorter I've kept
everything<00:01:23.080> short<00:01:23.470> as<00:01:23.590> possible<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.840> only

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
everything short as possible the only

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.590 
everything short as possible the only
part<00:01:26.229> i<00:01:26.320> put<00:01:26.470> this<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:27.070> coil<00:01:27.700> on<00:01:27.910> is<00:01:28.090> just<00:01:28.390> here

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
part i put this the coil on is just here

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.730 
part i put this the coil on is just here
because<00:01:28.720> there's<00:01:28.840> a<00:01:28.960> bit<00:01:29.110> of<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.259> bend<00:01:29.440> so

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
because there's a bit of a bend so

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.770 
because there's a bit of a bend so
that's<00:01:29.860> kept<00:01:30.070> that<00:01:30.250> pretty<00:01:30.460> good<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:31.420> rest<00:01:31.630> is

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
that's kept that pretty good the rest is

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.859 
that's kept that pretty good the rest is
just<00:01:31.810> pretty<00:01:32.140> much<00:01:32.460> standard<00:01:33.600> cable<00:01:34.600> tied<00:01:34.750> it

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
just pretty much standard cable tied it

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.130 
just pretty much standard cable tied it
a<00:01:34.929> little<00:01:35.080> bit<00:01:35.259> no<00:01:35.500> kinks<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.810> reservoir

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
a little bit no kinks and the reservoir

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.930 
a little bit no kinks and the reservoir
sitting<00:01:38.440> all<00:01:38.590> right<00:01:38.740> I'll<00:01:39.310> top<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:39.640> up<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:39.910> bit

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
sitting all right I'll top it up a bit

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.090 
sitting all right I'll top it up a bit
later<00:01:40.270> I've<00:01:40.509> run<00:01:41.229> it<00:01:41.350> for<00:01:41.470> about<00:01:41.560> 20<00:01:41.920> minutes

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
later I've run it for about 20 minutes

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.340 
later I've run it for about 20 minutes
but<00:01:42.490> what<00:01:43.479> can<00:01:43.600> I<00:01:43.690> do<00:01:43.750> I'm<00:01:43.990> in<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.140> rush<00:01:44.350> now<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
but what can I do I'm in a rush now the

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.960 
but what can I do I'm in a rush now the
cables<00:01:47.890> are<00:01:48.039> pretty<00:01:48.280> neat<00:01:48.460> it<00:01:48.670> doesn't<00:01:48.910> look

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
cables are pretty neat it doesn't look

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.540 
cables are pretty neat it doesn't look
like<00:01:49.060> I<00:01:49.240> have<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.450> use<00:01:49.570> any<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.550> connectors
