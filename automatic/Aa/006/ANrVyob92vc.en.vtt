00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.470
 corrals 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.910

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.159
 unpredictable 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.269

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.269
 fixed there they go to real 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.780
 be careful there because everything is already 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.610
 he is already locked up and then begins to 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.070
 get angry and two then he is already deceived 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.170
 he raises his face a little and attacks 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.450
 against the burladero is already angry the 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.450
 everything is already quite dangerous 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.940
 it causes me hours of good antonio 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.980
 burladero but stays by the cowboy 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.030
 and it's not wrong or miraculously jumped 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.480
 quickly that wall and there he got 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.480
 save yourself 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.150
 which is started or not 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.850
 ripped out and has never done it but today 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.280
 is booted to this website by starting in 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.920
 the staff has given enough that 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.450
 be careful is very noble but let's 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.050
 It also carries inside what is in a 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.050
 Program 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.380
 that's the bank that we're going to use to 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.569
 climb the stallion but it's not a bank 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.970
 anyone is adapted to the bull 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.670
 possibly one of the few bank 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.190
 that exist adapted to the bull recorded but 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.860
 its inventor will not apply it better 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.900
 Sancho rancher good to be very good 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.410
 wide of this one a special bathroom because 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.110
 because we are the brunette from jaén who 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.390
 It is very abrupt to move the bull 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.860
 and sometimes cows and calves for what 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.750
 we carry in the boom because with the 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.180
 horses go downhill 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.250
 in order to control the animals in 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.310
 modistilla a ban where you have the 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.750
 forged the sea floor 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.750
 will hold the weight in the turn 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.240
 on the walls so that all the arts 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.270
 the walls and the floor 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.499
 but there is decent because one more day 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.039
 prevent it 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.409
 let's see sancho the door that also 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.409
 is the most important for back 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:14.469
 the door looks like a normal door 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:17.620
 the normal door is this one that the ones 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:19.990
 horses and horses jump inside or 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.689
 outside but apart from that this door 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.729
 has a sliding door like that of 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.729
 the trucks from next to inside 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.680
 actually and it pulls now on how 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.150
 it feels 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.150
 of a bull truck 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.840
 interviewing people and knowing everything 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.840
 perfectly 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.340
 there you have to place perfectly 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.260
 that so the bull does not offer go there 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.310
 the stud but 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:11.070
 because we were about to show 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.680
 to ivana to try to be told 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:17.780
 direct to where the bar is accumulated 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.780
 so that it occurs in him 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.789
 this young woman then tries to stick her head 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:29.160
 try to try your head at 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.200
 push it 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.650
 can escape and there we ran danger 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:37.100
 quite got stuck by the head 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:42.730
 I try to escape 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.730
 I'm all about dealing with alba fortunately
