Paul Benson was there to the opportunity

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.790 
Paul Benson was there to the opportunity
but<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.690> could<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.049> see<00:00:16.199> swimming<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.830> I

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
thought it was a very very imperfect in

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.269 
thought it was a very very imperfect in
their<00:00:21.630> promotion<00:00:22.170> season<00:00:22.619> he<00:00:22.680> played<00:00:22.800> most<00:00:23.100> of

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
their promotion season he played most of

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.609 
their promotion season he played most of
the<00:00:23.340> game<00:00:23.400> scored<00:00:24.180> again<00:00:24.330> stagnant<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.470> got

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
the game scored again stagnant it's got

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.200 
the game scored again stagnant it's got
a<00:00:25.650> good<00:00:25.800> goal<00:00:26.039> gets<00:00:26.279> them<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.910> fair<00:00:27.470> I<00:00:28.470> think

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
a good goal gets them to be fair I think

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.550 
a good goal gets them to be fair I think
they'll<00:00:30.210> fall<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:30.720> with<00:00:30.869> powdered<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.349> can

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
they'll fall out with powdered you can

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.720 
they'll fall out with powdered you can
yell<00:00:31.740> when<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.040> got<00:00:32.130> promoted<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:34.610> you<00:00:35.610> know

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
yell when it got promoted and you know

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.270 
yell when it got promoted and you know
he's<00:00:36.500> thinking<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.770> level<00:00:37.980> for

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
he's thinking for that level for

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.580 
he's thinking for that level for
graphing<00:00:38.879> become<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> bit<00:00:39.600> disillusioned<00:00:39.930> but

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
graphing become a bit disillusioned but

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.250
