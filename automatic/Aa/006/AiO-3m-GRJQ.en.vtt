00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
they just simply didn't have a shortcut

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.490 
they just simply didn't have a shortcut
for<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.879> that<00:02:45.420> was<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.660> only<00:02:45.810> thing<00:02:46.140> missing

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
for it that was the only thing missing

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.809

and<00:02:46.620> preventing<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.099> camera<00:02:47.340> from<00:02:47.489> working

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
and preventing the camera from working

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.440 
and preventing the camera from working
so<00:02:48.390> once<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.840> once<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.380> install<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.739> app

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
so once that once you install that app

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.330 
so once that once you install that app
is<00:02:51.450> gonna<00:02:51.660> be<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.049> camera<00:02:52.410> app<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:53.040> looks<00:02:53.190> like

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
is gonna be the camera app it looks like

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.979 
is gonna be the camera app it looks like
the<00:02:53.430> stock<00:02:53.700> camera<00:02:54.060> app<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.480> would<00:02:54.569> find<00:02:54.840> in

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
the stock camera app you would find in

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.420 
the stock camera app you would find in
any<00:02:55.110> other<00:02:55.400> cell<00:02:56.400> phone<00:02:56.579> device<00:02:56.900> just<00:02:57.900> tap<00:02:58.079> it

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
any other cell phone device just tap it

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.819 
any other cell phone device just tap it
and<00:02:59.430> that's<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.790> simple<00:03:00.629> as<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:00.930> or<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.709> can

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
and that's it simple as that or you can

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.250 
and that's it simple as that or you can
make<00:03:01.980> videos<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.489> will<00:03:02.879> forewarn<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.360> it's

make videos I will forewarn you it's
extremely<00:03:05.069> laggy<00:03:06.019> see<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.410> frames<00:03:07.650> per

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
extremely laggy see the frames per

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.100 
extremely laggy see the frames per
second<00:03:08.340> my<00:03:08.970> estimate<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.720> frames<00:03:09.900> per

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
second my estimate that the frames per

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.710 
second my estimate that the frames per
second<00:03:10.410> on<00:03:10.500> this<00:03:10.620> thing<00:03:10.769> is<00:03:10.860> about<00:03:11.040> 15

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
second on this thing is about 15

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.860 
second on this thing is about 15
probably<00:03:12.720> 10<00:03:12.989> even<00:03:13.349> I<00:03:13.530> would<00:03:13.950> say<00:03:14.010> 15<00:03:14.780> but<00:03:15.780> it

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
probably 10 even I would say 15 but it

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.890 
probably 10 even I would say 15 but it
is<00:03:15.989> really<00:03:16.769> grainy<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.700> really<00:03:18.060> bad<00:03:18.239> the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
is really grainy it's really bad the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.830 
is really grainy it's really bad the
cameras<00:03:19.290> only<00:03:19.380> 1<00:03:19.590> point<00:03:19.799> 2<00:03:19.889> megapixels<00:03:20.459> um<00:03:20.850> but

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
cameras only 1 point 2 megapixels um but

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.920 
cameras only 1 point 2 megapixels um but
even<00:03:22.049> with<00:03:22.319> that<00:03:22.560> said<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:23.130> believe<00:03:23.850> the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
even with that said I believe the
