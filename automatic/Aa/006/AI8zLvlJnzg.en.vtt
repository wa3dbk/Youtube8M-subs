couple things that you're going to need
I<00:00:34.980> use<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.820> feeler<00:00:36.210> gauge<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.660> got<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.930> at<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
I use a feeler gauge I got this at the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.290 
I use a feeler gauge I got this at the
local<00:00:37.380> hardware<00:00:37.710> store<00:00:38.219> Home<00:00:38.760> Depot<00:00:39.180> would

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
local hardware store Home Depot would

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.360 
local hardware store Home Depot would
have<00:00:39.510> them<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.930> basically<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.160> use

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
have them and basically what you use

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.400 
have them and basically what you use
this<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:42.750> sort<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.930> measure<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
this for is to just sort of measure the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.529 
this for is to just sort of measure the
gap<00:00:43.649> using<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> piece<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.910> paper<00:00:45.030> could<00:00:45.360> also

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
gap using a piece of paper could also

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.000 
gap using a piece of paper could also
work<00:00:45.809> too<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.410> don't<00:00:46.530> want<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.800> one<00:00:46.980> of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
work too if you don't want to get one of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.360 
work too if you don't want to get one of
these<00:00:47.250> also<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> capo<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.260> capo<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
these also this is a capo or a capo and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.529 
these also this is a capo or a capo and
I'll<00:00:50.520> show<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.700> how<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.969> use<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
I'll show you how to use this in a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.689 
I'll show you how to use this in a
second<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.110> then<00:00:52.710> also<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.100> need<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.430> very

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
second and then also you need a very

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.470 
second and then also you need a very
accurate<00:00:54.000> ruler<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> 64th<00:00:56.489> ruler

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
accurate ruler and this is a 64th ruler

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.080 
accurate ruler and this is a 64th ruler
so<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.960> very<00:00:58.199> very<00:00:58.590> accurate<00:00:59.460> you're<00:00:59.969> going

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
so it's very very accurate you're going

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.750 
so it's very very accurate you're going
to<00:01:00.149> use<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.510> for<00:01:00.809> measurements<00:01:01.520> ok<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
to use this for measurements ok so the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.219 
to use this for measurements ok so the
first<00:01:02.910> thing<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.180> want<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.989> once

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
first thing you want to do is once

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.570 
first thing you want to do is once
you've<00:01:04.350> got<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> strings<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.309> you've<00:01:05.430> got

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you've got the strings on and you've got

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.399 
you've got the strings on and you've got
it<00:01:05.700> tuned<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.659> basically<00:01:06.960> you'll<00:01:07.170> want<00:01:07.350> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
it tuned so basically you'll want to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.050 
it tuned so basically you'll want to
tune<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.890> whatever<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.880> like

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
what the distance is between the string

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.359 
what the distance is between the string
and<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:38.340> 15th<00:01:38.820> fret<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:40.320> should<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.740> around

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
and my 15th fret and it should be around

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.999 
and my 15th fret and it should be around
five<00:01:41.820> sixty<00:01:42.540> fourths<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> low<00:01:43.439> E<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.890> I'm

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
five sixty fourths on the low E so I'm

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.670 
five sixty fourths on the low E so I'm
on<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> 15th<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.020> I've<00:01:46.020> got<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> wrong<00:01:46.439> side

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
on the 15th and I've got the wrong side

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.819 
on the 15th and I've got the wrong side
of<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> ruler<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.100> can't<00:01:47.399> even<00:01:47.579> see<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.939> but

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
of the ruler you can't even see it but

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.530 
of the ruler you can't even see it but
and<00:01:51.530> yeah<00:01:52.530> I'm<00:01:52.710> exactly<00:01:53.189> five<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.420> it's

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
and yeah I'm exactly five and then it's

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.840 
and yeah I'm exactly five and then it's
a<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:54.840> different<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.470> high<00:01:55.680> E<00:01:55.850> it's

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
a little different on the high E it's

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.620 
a little different on the high E it's
about<00:01:57.500> three<00:01:58.500> sixty<00:01:59.040> fourths<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.090> let<00:02:00.210> me<00:02:00.299> set

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
about three sixty fourths so let me set

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.950 
about three sixty fourths so let me set
it<00:02:00.659> again<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.880> 5/64<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> low<00:02:03.329> E<00:02:03.360> at<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
it again it's 5/64 for the low E at the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.280 
it again it's 5/64 for the low E at the
15th<00:02:04.409> fret<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.070> three<00:02:05.909> sixty<00:02:06.329> fourths<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
15th fret and three sixty fourths the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.609 
15th fret and three sixty fourths the
high<00:02:07.530> E<00:02:07.940> so<00:02:08.940> once<00:02:09.149> you've<00:02:09.330> had<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.619> that's

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
high E so once you've had that that's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.559 
high E so once you've had that that's
cool<00:02:10.920> that's<00:02:11.250> what<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.580> want<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.390> it's

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
cool that's what you want but if it's

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.850 
cool that's what you want but if it's
not<00:02:12.750> where<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.080> want<00:02:13.349> it

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
not where you want it

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.070 
not where you want it
you<00:02:14.280> would<00:02:14.430> adjust<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:15.270> piece<00:02:15.720> right<00:02:16.020> here

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
you would adjust this piece right here

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.130 
you would adjust this piece right here
so<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.570> basically<00:02:18.570> where<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.870> put<00:02:19.050> your

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
so this is basically where you put your

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.210 
so this is basically where you put your
strengths<00:02:19.500> or<00:02:19.650> here<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:20.070> this<00:02:20.160> is

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
strengths or here and then this is

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.160 
strengths or here and then this is
adjustable<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.360> would<00:02:21.510> adjust<00:02:21.600> this<00:02:21.960> up

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
adjustable so you would adjust this up

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.430 
adjustable so you would adjust this up
or<00:02:22.500> down<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.670> get<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:23.910> measurement<00:02:24.330> in<00:02:24.780> now

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
or down to get that measurement in now

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.900 
or down to get that measurement in now
the<00:02:25.500> next<00:02:25.800> measurement<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.190> want<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.430> do<00:02:26.640> is

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
the next measurement you want to do is

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.240 
the next measurement you want to do is
you<00:02:27.360> want<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.630> check<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.990> seat<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.830> bow<00:02:29.010> or

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
you want to check the seat the bow or

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.450 
you want to check the seat the bow or
the<00:02:29.370> relief<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.300> neck<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:31.190> let<00:02:32.190> me<00:02:32.250> just

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
the relief of the neck and let me just

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.310 
the relief of the neck and let me just
say<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.850> I'm<00:02:32.970> not<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.240> luthier<00:02:33.630> or<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.050> don't

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
say that I'm not a luthier or I don't

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.500 
say that I'm not a luthier or I don't
work<00:02:34.500> with<00:02:34.710> Gibson<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.400> that's<00:02:36.210> my<00:02:36.330> little

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
work with Gibson so that's my little

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.720 
work with Gibson so that's my little
disclaimer<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:37.380> take<00:02:38.100> these<00:02:38.310> with<00:02:38.460> a<00:02:38.550> grain

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
disclaimer just take these with a grain

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.040 
disclaimer just take these with a grain
of<00:02:38.760> salt<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:39.270> this<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.510> what<00:02:39.720> I've<00:02:39.810> been<00:02:39.840> doing

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
of salt but this is what I've been doing

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.590 
of salt but this is what I've been doing
for<00:02:40.200> years<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.280> works<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.180> if<00:02:42.450> you're

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
for years and it works so if you're

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.480 
for years and it works so if you're
really<00:02:42.780> feeling<00:02:43.050> unsure<00:02:43.380> about<00:02:44.010> doing<00:02:44.280> some

really feeling unsure about doing some
neck<00:02:44.730> adjustments<00:02:45.330> then<00:02:45.480> maybe<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.780> want<00:02:45.900> to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
take you to a guitar technician but if

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.580 
take you to a guitar technician but if
you're<00:02:48.570> gonna<00:02:48.660> do<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.900> yourself<00:02:48.990> just<00:02:49.470> make

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
you're gonna do it yourself just make

let's<00:02:52.140> say<00:02:52.320> I<00:02:52.350> was<00:02:52.470> going<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.709> change

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
let's say I was going to change

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.310 
let's say I was going to change
something<00:02:53.640> with<00:02:53.820> my<00:02:53.970> truss<00:02:54.239> rod<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.750> would<00:02:55.110> just

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
something with my truss rod I would just

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.530 
something with my truss rod I would just
tweak<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:55.980> here's<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.489> truss<00:02:56.730> rod<00:02:56.970> tool<00:02:57.209> for

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
tweak it here's a truss rod tool for

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.449 
tweak it here's a truss rod tool for
Gibson's<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.800> what<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.040> looks<00:02:59.220> like

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
Gibson's and this is what it looks like

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.820 
Gibson's and this is what it looks like
I<00:02:59.670> would<00:03:00.180> just<00:03:00.209> put<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.630> on<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.560> would<00:03:01.709> just

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
I would just put it on and I would just

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.680 
I would just put it on and I would just
give<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.160> tiny<00:03:02.370> little<00:03:02.640> turn<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.150> then<00:03:03.660> I

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
give it a tiny little turn and then I

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.240 
give it a tiny little turn and then I
would<00:03:03.870> measure<00:03:04.080> things<00:03:04.410> again<00:03:04.739> after<00:03:05.070> about

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
would measure things again after about

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.550 
would measure things again after about
10<00:03:05.489> minutes<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.030> then<00:03:06.600> if<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.959> was<00:03:07.080> still<00:03:07.320> too

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
10 minutes and then if it was still too

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.180 
10 minutes and then if it was still too
much<00:03:07.680> bow<00:03:08.120> either<00:03:09.120> if<00:03:10.050> you<00:03:10.260> put<00:03:10.440> on<00:03:10.530> too<00:03:10.860> tight

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
much bow either if you put on too tight

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.680 
much bow either if you put on too tight
a<00:03:11.220> string<00:03:11.640> you'll<00:03:12.000> find<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.360> your<00:03:12.510> neck

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
a string you'll find that your neck

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.840 
a string you'll find that your neck
warps<00:03:13.080> this<00:03:13.290> way<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.739> if<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.340> find<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.670> you

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
warps this way and if you find that you

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.820 
warps this way and if you find that you
don't<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.150> enough<00:03:15.470> tension<00:03:16.470> if<00:03:16.739> your

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
don't have enough tension if your

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.140 
don't have enough tension if your
strings<00:03:17.040> are<00:03:17.130> too<00:03:17.280> light<00:03:17.489> then<00:03:17.880> you're<00:03:18.000> gonna

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
strings are too light then you're gonna

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.270 
strings are too light then you're gonna
find<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.600> you'll<00:03:18.750> have<00:03:18.930> some<00:03:18.989> buzzing<00:03:19.950> here

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
find that you'll have some buzzing here

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.100 
find that you'll have some buzzing here
so<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:20.580> really<00:03:20.910> want<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.150> do<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.840> properly

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
so you really want to do that properly

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.780 
so you really want to do that properly
and<00:03:22.440> make<00:03:22.620> small<00:03:22.890> adjustments<00:03:23.040> when<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.640> do

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and make small adjustments when you do

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.509 
and make small adjustments when you do
do<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.320> so<00:03:25.320> what<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.560> want<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.769> do<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.340> you

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
do that so what you want to do is you

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.160 
do that so what you want to do is you
want<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.730> fret<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.060> at<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.299> first<00:03:27.510> fret<00:03:27.900> and

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
want to fret it at the first fret and

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.800 
want to fret it at the first fret and
you<00:03:28.950> want<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.190> fret<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.489> at<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.910> 15th<00:03:30.330> fret<00:03:30.570> so

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
you want to fret it at the 15th fret so

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.740 
you want to fret it at the 15th fret so
I've<00:03:30.900> got<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.110> capo<00:03:31.739> on<00:03:31.920> this<00:03:32.239> fret<00:03:33.239> here<00:03:33.480> and

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
I've got a capo on this fret here and

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.570 
I've got a capo on this fret here and
I'm<00:03:33.840> holding<00:03:34.080> it<00:03:34.350> down<00:03:34.530> with<00:03:34.950> my<00:03:35.070> finger<00:03:35.400> on

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
I'm holding it down with my finger on

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.490 
I'm holding it down with my finger on
the<00:03:35.730> 15th<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.420> then<00:03:36.900> what<00:03:37.019> I'm<00:03:37.110> going<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.260> do

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
the 15th and then what I'm going to do

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.410 
the 15th and then what I'm going to do
so<00:03:38.010> I'm<00:03:38.070> going<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.220> use<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.370> feeler<00:03:38.700> gauge<00:03:39.060> and

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
so I'm going to use a feeler gauge and

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.570 
so I'm going to use a feeler gauge and
what<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.350> really<00:03:40.500> want<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.830> do<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.190> just<00:03:41.430> sort

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
what you really want to do is just sort

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.890 
what you really want to do is just sort
of<00:03:41.670> see<00:03:41.880> if<00:03:42.060> there's<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.269> little<00:03:42.390> bit<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.720> gap

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
of see if there's a little bit of a gap

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.890 
of see if there's a little bit of a gap
now<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:43.440> piece<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.430> paper<00:03:44.640> if<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.299> fits<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.690> there

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
now a piece of paper if it fits in there

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.990 
now a piece of paper if it fits in there
that's<00:03:46.230> fine<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.920> like<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.519> little<00:03:47.760> bit

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
that's fine I like it a little bit

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.500 
that's fine I like it a little bit
higher<00:03:48.239> myself<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:49.890> I've<00:03:49.980> got<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.400> 5<00:03:50.820> bow

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
higher myself and so I've got a 5 bow

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.360 
higher myself and so I've got a 5 bow
gauge<00:03:52.140> on<00:03:52.350> my<00:03:52.470> feeler<00:03:52.680> gauge<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.220> that's

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
gauge on my feeler gauge and that's

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.250 
gauge on my feeler gauge and that's
pretty<00:03:53.549> good<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:54.120> usually<00:03:54.660> like<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.840> make<00:03:55.110> it

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
pretty good I usually like to make it

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.800 
pretty good I usually like to make it
about<00:03:55.440> 8<00:03:55.680> let's<00:03:56.670> go<00:03:56.820> for<00:03:59.420> 8,000<00:04:00.420> my<00:04:00.540> feeler

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
about 8 let's go for 8,000 my feeler

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.410 
about 8 let's go for 8,000 my feeler
gauge<00:04:01.110> that's<00:04:01.440> 0.0<00:04:04.549> 0.1<00:04:05.549> at<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.940> 1st<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.360> the

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
gauge that's 0.0 0.1 at the 1st and the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.630 
gauge that's 0.0 0.1 at the 1st and the
15th<00:04:06.600> and<00:04:07.019> at<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.739> 7th<00:04:08.100> fret

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
15th and at the 7th fret

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.430 
15th and at the 7th fret
I'm<00:04:09.150> checking<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.980> 8<00:04:11.690> goes<00:04:12.690> pretty<00:04:13.230> good

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
I'm checking and the 8 goes pretty good

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.650 
I'm checking and the 8 goes pretty good
so<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.650> could<00:04:13.799> actually<00:04:14.220> tighten<00:04:15.000> this<00:04:15.120> neck<00:04:15.420> up

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
so I could actually tighten this neck up

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.349 
so I could actually tighten this neck up
and<00:04:16.130> then<00:04:17.130> what<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:17.760> want<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:17.970> do<00:04:18.090> if<00:04:18.239> you're

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
and then what you want to do if you're

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.509 
and then what you want to do if you're
really<00:04:18.540> not<00:04:18.750> sure<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:19.560> just<00:04:19.890> turn<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.160> one<00:04:20.340> way

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
really not sure is just turn it one way

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.460 
really not sure is just turn it one way
see<00:04:21.030> how<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.269> goes<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:21.750> if<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.169> realize<00:04:22.440> you

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
see how it goes and if you realize you

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.770 
see how it goes and if you realize you
went<00:04:22.860> too<00:04:23.190> far<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.520> wrong<00:04:23.700> way<00:04:23.880> turn<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.599> back

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
went too far the wrong way turn it back

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.060 
went too far the wrong way turn it back
because<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.410> don't<00:04:25.530> want<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.710> quote<00:04:25.860> which

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
because I don't want to quote which

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.530 
because I don't want to quote which
direction<00:04:26.460> because<00:04:26.760> the

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
direction because the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.240 
direction because the
if<00:04:27.780> you're<00:04:28.080> playing<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.560> different<00:04:28.650> guitar<00:04:28.860> it

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
if you're playing a different guitar it

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.190 
if you're playing a different guitar it
may<00:04:29.400> be<00:04:29.460> different<00:04:29.790> for<00:04:29.850> your<00:04:29.970> guitar<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:30.720> make

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
may be different for your guitar so make

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.810 
may be different for your guitar so make
sure<00:04:31.350> you<00:04:31.470> do<00:04:31.620> some<00:04:31.800> experimentation<00:04:32.400> if<00:04:32.640> they

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
sure you do some experimentation if they

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.130 
sure you do some experimentation if they
have<00:04:32.970> some<00:04:33.150> instructions<00:04:33.600> with<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.780> guitar

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
have some instructions with the guitar

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.770 
have some instructions with the guitar
then<00:04:34.740> refer<00:04:35.040> to<00:04:35.160> those<00:04:35.370> but<00:04:36.150> like<00:04:36.270> I<00:04:36.330> said<00:04:36.540> make

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
then refer to those but like I said make

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.720 
then refer to those but like I said make
those<00:04:37.050> truss<00:04:37.650> rod<00:04:37.860> adjustments<00:04:38.400> make<00:04:38.580> them

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
those truss rod adjustments make them

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.850 
those truss rod adjustments make them
very<00:04:39.030> tiny<00:04:39.510> because<00:04:40.410> you<00:04:40.500> don't<00:04:40.620> want<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.800> go

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
very tiny because you don't want to go

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.060 
very tiny because you don't want to go
too<00:04:40.920> far<00:04:41.190> with<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:41.690> so<00:04:42.690> let's<00:04:42.840> just<00:04:42.990> recap<00:04:43.350> so

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
too far with that so let's just recap so

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.560 
too far with that so let's just recap so
you<00:04:44.130> put<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.460> strings<00:04:44.700> on<00:04:44.910> you've<00:04:45.120> got<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.330> tune

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
you put the strings on you've got a tune

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.940 
you put the strings on you've got a tune
the<00:04:45.720> way<00:04:45.810> you<00:04:45.870> want<00:04:46.140> it<00:04:46.260> you<00:04:46.290> check<00:04:46.680> it<00:04:46.800> at<00:04:46.920> the

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
the way you want it you check it at the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.180 
the way you want it you check it at the
15th<00:04:47.430> fret<00:04:47.730> and<00:04:48.080> it's<00:04:49.080> five<00:04:49.320> sixty<00:04:49.680> four<00:04:49.890> and

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
15th fret and it's five sixty four and

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.320 
15th fret and it's five sixty four and
three<00:04:50.490> sixty<00:04:50.880> fourths

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
three sixty fourths

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.540 
three sixty fourths
you<00:04:51.630> thread<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:51.870> at<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.350> first<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:52.980> fifteenth

zero zero eight or you can use a piece

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.780 
zero zero eight or you can use a piece
of<00:05:00.930> paper<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.500> if<00:05:01.650> it<00:05:01.800> fits<00:05:02.010> in<00:05:02.130> there<00:05:02.340> that's

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
of paper and if it fits in there that's

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.640 
of paper and if it fits in there that's
fine<00:05:03.180> so<00:05:03.990> once<00:05:04.200> you've<00:05:04.320> got<00:05:04.500> those

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
fine so once you've got those

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.350 
fine so once you've got those
measurements<00:05:04.920> to<00:05:05.430> you're<00:05:05.880> also<00:05:06.060> gonna<00:05:06.270> want

to measure your pickup height now this
is<00:05:09.270> going<00:05:09.420> to<00:05:09.480> vary<00:05:09.510> slightly<00:05:10.110> there<00:05:10.560> are<00:05:10.680> some

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
is going to vary slightly there are some

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.540 
is going to vary slightly there are some
standards<00:05:11.460> that<00:05:11.880> come<00:05:12.090> from<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.360> factory<00:05:12.810> but

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
standards that come from the factory but

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.920 
standards that come from the factory but
as<00:05:14.550> long<00:05:14.820> as<00:05:14.850> your<00:05:15.150> strings<00:05:15.450> aren't<00:05:15.780> hitting

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
as long as your strings aren't hitting

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.810 
as long as your strings aren't hitting
these<00:05:16.200> pickups<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:16.950> could<00:05:17.130> always<00:05:17.400> raise<00:05:17.640> it

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
these pickups you could always raise it

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.640 
these pickups you could always raise it
a<00:05:17.910> little<00:05:17.940> bit<00:05:18.420> in<00:05:18.900> order<00:05:19.080> to<00:05:19.230> get<00:05:19.410> a<00:05:19.440> little

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
a little bit in order to get a little

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.910 
a little bit in order to get a little
more<00:05:19.860> volume<00:05:20.360> so<00:05:21.360> that's<00:05:21.750> something<00:05:22.020> that<00:05:22.470> is

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
more volume so that's something that is

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.560 
more volume so that's something that is
kind<00:05:23.190> of<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.340> personal<00:05:23.790> preference<00:05:24.120> and<00:05:24.510> I

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
kind of a personal preference and I

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.400 
don't really use my neck up pickup that
much<00:05:26.340> but<00:05:27.000> anyway<00:05:27.150> that<00:05:27.300> should<00:05:27.450> get<00:05:27.570> you<00:05:27.840> sort

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410
