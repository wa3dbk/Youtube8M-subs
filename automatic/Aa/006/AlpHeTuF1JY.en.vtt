00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
over again so I'm loading my game just

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:11.630 
over again so I'm loading my game just
to<00:03:51.870> let<00:03:52.050> you<00:03:52.230> see<00:03:52.260> what<00:03:52.680> happens

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.360 

almost<00:04:12.420> there<00:04:13.130> and<00:04:14.130> here<00:04:15.000> we<00:04:15.090> are<00:04:16.100> not<00:04:17.100> at<00:04:17.280> the

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
almost there and here we are not at the

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.000 
almost there and here we are not at the
beginning<00:04:17.519> of<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:17.940> level<00:04:18.299> but<00:04:18.860> somewhere<00:04:19.860> in

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
beginning of the level but somewhere in

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.220 
beginning of the level but somewhere in
between<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.670> beginning<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.209> in<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.260> end<00:04:22.730> so

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
between the beginning and in the end so

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.500 
between the beginning and in the end so
that's<00:04:25.230> pretty<00:04:25.470> cool<00:04:25.880> so<00:04:26.880> bear<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:27.240> in<00:04:27.480> mind

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.540 
that's pretty cool so bear that in mind
keep<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.080> in<00:04:28.200> mind<00:04:28.410> when<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.800> when<00:04:29.430> you've

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
keep it in mind when you when you've

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.640
