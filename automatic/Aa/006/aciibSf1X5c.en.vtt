00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.799
 we will start procreating nunoa in the morning from a mesh 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.080
 high density to use on a much smaller mesh 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.419
 we will start with a sphere 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.029
 to which we added a 10 country modifier on level 4 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.699
 to use the skate mode 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.269
 in this case, we used here a procedural texture 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.029
 to deform power 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.029
 the wedding 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.930
 once we have done these deformations are carved we go into 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.140
 edition 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.130
 and we will create seams to properly challenge our sister 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.590
 we select early 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.590
 we press lugano 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.210
 then we'll go to the art rank tab 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.440
 at the bottom there is the belgian leather menu 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.440
 we will select normal default tangent and selected we will 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.310
 change we will put it on goals 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.310
 and we will click on belgium 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.770
 here we have 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.770
 the moment the news market 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 now we're going to do the same thing, that is, unfolding 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.680
 with the second would be an unconditional fight in which she was asking 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.550
 same region 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.550
 we select early then finally Danish 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.710
 if we notice that the mesh leader 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.330
 does not fit very well but does not fit very well 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.040
 with the picture 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.070
 then to use another type of black 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.070
 we will redo amano took 6 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.330
 no longer to our expectations 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.240
 the needs of the cause 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 we select bad comfort 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.540
 we redone a basic 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.880
 when we changed the unfolding 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.880
 and we will do the same thing here 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.490
 QuÃ©bec in shape 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.649
 so if we have a few strange rotations will have to apply precisely 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.649
 controls at rotations and skate 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.459
 but this time it should work 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.590
 and here we have a little texture of the traps v of the sphere in low 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.590
 resolution that fits properly 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.969
 then we will create him 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.969
 a material 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.049
 we will create a new image texture of course 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.359
 so the best thing is to export this texture in png 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.249
 tudela reimport here 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.979
 there we will use it directly because the teeth in the picture and guitar 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.169
 so we'll put here to see what's going to give the gsl 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.599
 the mode of action 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.599
 so we have a texture a light 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.149
 it would be good of the precession issued for the state site 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:12.029
 then texture level 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:15.029
 he may have to activate collard 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:19.489
 we activate the normal 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.769
 the next day 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.400
 and it is said at the coordinates of the mapping to use the coordinates 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.400
 boos 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.209
 so when we did the job 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.799
 we did what we used the hateful normative acts if we go 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.089
 having to rehabilitate it in textures 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.089
 instead from time to time we will choose a goal 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.889
 now we have a 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.279
 Too bad 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.669
 which is correctly a sign 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.669
 another sphere 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.889
 it is a very practical technique to avoid loading 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.259
 it looks long
