okay<00:00:00.750> today<00:00:01.050> we'll<00:00:01.199> be<00:00:01.380> doing<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.920> compression

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
okay today we'll be doing a compression

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.240 
okay today we'll be doing a compression
test<00:00:02.669> on<00:00:03.090> my<00:00:03.330> 91<00:00:04.580> rx-7<00:00:05.580> turbo<00:00:05.970> -<00:00:07.099> just<00:00:08.099> do<00:00:08.220> a

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
test on my 91 rx-7 turbo - just do a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.980 
test on my 91 rx-7 turbo - just do a
basic<00:00:08.429> rundown<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:08.970> what<00:00:09.330> you<00:00:09.450> should<00:00:09.630> do<00:00:09.780> when

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
basic rundown of what you should do when

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.240 
basic rundown of what you should do when
you're<00:00:10.110> doing<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.440> compression<00:00:10.740> test<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.190> a

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
you're doing a compression test on a

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.509 
you're doing a compression test on a
rotary<00:00:11.940> vehicle

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
rotary vehicle

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.519

step<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.849> want<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.089> do<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.480> get<00:00:16.320> a

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
step one you want to do is get a

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.130 
step one you want to do is get a
compression<00:00:17.250> tester<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.670> course<00:00:17.910> just<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:19.080> a

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
compression tester of course just just a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.390 
compression tester of course just just a
normal<00:00:19.380> compression<00:00:19.710> tester<00:00:19.949> will<00:00:20.130> work

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
normal compression tester will work

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.609 
normal compression tester will work
there<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.270> an<00:00:21.390> actual<00:00:21.570> factory<00:00:22.109> one<00:00:22.260> out<00:00:22.380> there

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
there is an actual factory one out there

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.790 
there is an actual factory one out there
but<00:00:22.650> if<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.609> can<00:00:23.760> find<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.180> power<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.140> but

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
but if you can find it power to you but

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920 
but if you can find it power to you but
most<00:00:26.369> most<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:27.029> us<00:00:27.119> guys<00:00:27.240> do<00:00:27.449> see<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.720> normal

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
most most of us guys do see is a normal

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.830 
most most of us guys do see is a normal
compression<00:00:28.289> tester<00:00:29.150> step<00:00:30.150> one<00:00:30.359> would<00:00:30.539> be<00:00:30.660> to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
compression tester step one would be to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.610 
compression tester step one would be to
take<00:00:31.260> out<00:00:31.820> if<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.360> see<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.660> sorry<00:00:34.530> about

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
take out if you can see it sorry about

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.400 
take out if you can see it sorry about
the<00:00:34.829> focusing<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:36.090> there<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> valve<00:00:37.110> core

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the focusing is there is a valve core

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.470 
the focusing is there is a valve core
there<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.010> valve<00:00:38.309> core<00:00:38.550> inside<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> end<00:00:39.270> of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
there this valve core inside the end of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.270 
there this valve core inside the end of
my<00:00:39.719> compression<00:00:40.020> tester<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.860> will<00:00:41.010> need<00:00:41.160> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
my compression tester you will need to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310 
my compression tester you will need to
remove<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.940> you're<00:00:42.629> going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> want<00:00:43.200> to

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
remove that you're going to want to

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.020 
remove that you're going to want to
actually<00:00:44.210> get<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> pulsing<00:00:45.870> pulsing

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
actually get a pulsing pulsing

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.029 
actually get a pulsing pulsing
compression<00:00:48.030> test<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.230> first<00:00:52.620> steps<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.860> want

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
compression test so first steps you want

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.040 
compression test so first steps you want
to<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.520> remove<00:00:54.059> either<00:00:54.570> either<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
to do is remove either either the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350 
to do is remove either either the
leading<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> trailing<00:00:55.829> plugs<00:00:56.820> from<00:00:57.000> one

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
leading or the trailing plugs from one

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.200 
leading or the trailing plugs from one
of<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.539> from<00:00:58.140> eat<00:00:58.920> both<00:00:59.219> rotors<00:00:59.489> doesn't

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
of the from eat both rotors doesn't

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.950 
of the from eat both rotors doesn't
matter<00:01:00.329> which<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:00.719> top<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:01.079> bottom<00:01:02.420> also<00:01:03.420> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
matter which one top or bottom also you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.920 
matter which one top or bottom also you
will<00:01:04.290> want<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.619> prop<00:01:05.519> open<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.000> throttle<00:01:06.840> body

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
will want to prop open the throttle body

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.350 
will want to prop open the throttle body
to<00:01:07.350> wide<00:01:07.590> open<00:01:08.030> so

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.810 

once<00:01:11.960> that's<00:01:12.110> all<00:01:12.230> done<00:01:12.370> we'll<00:01:13.370> screw<00:01:13.610> it<00:01:13.700> in

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
once that's all done we'll screw it in

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.470 
once that's all done we'll screw it in
we'll<00:01:14.000> get<00:01:14.150> started<00:01:14.330> okay<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:17.150> before<00:01:17.450> I

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
we'll get started okay and before I

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.750 
we'll get started okay and before I
actually<00:01:17.840> start<00:01:18.530> doing<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:19.160> compression<00:01:19.610> test

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
actually start doing a compression test

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.490 
actually start doing a compression test
I<00:01:20.120> really<00:01:20.510> like<00:01:20.690> to<00:01:20.840> listen<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.350> engine

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
I really like to listen to the engine

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.410 
I really like to listen to the engine
beforehand<00:01:22.100> just<00:01:22.220> to<00:01:22.370> see<00:01:22.580> if<00:01:22.730> I<00:01:22.850> have<00:01:23.180> any

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
beforehand just to see if I have any

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.340 
beforehand just to see if I have any
well<00:01:23.780> ten<00:01:24.530> actual<00:01:24.860> compression<00:01:25.160> so<00:01:26.140> I'm<00:01:27.140> just

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
well ten actual compression so I'm just

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.100 
well ten actual compression so I'm just
jumping<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.860> actual<00:01:28.730> signal<00:01:29.720> wire<00:01:29.870> as<00:01:30.080> you

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
jumping the actual signal wire as you

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.630 
jumping the actual signal wire as you
can<00:01:30.290> see<00:01:30.410> I<00:01:30.440> have<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.650> spade<00:01:30.950> pin<00:01:31.190> in<00:01:31.310> there<00:01:31.490> and

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
can see I have a spade pin in there and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.610 
can see I have a spade pin in there and
it's<00:01:31.730> just<00:01:31.940> a<00:01:32.090> alligator<00:01:33.050> clip<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.470> touched

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
it's just a alligator clip and touched

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.920 
it's just a alligator clip and touched
in<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.800> power<00:01:33.980> so<00:01:34.400> car<00:01:35.330> doesn't<00:01:35.570> even<00:01:35.690> have<00:01:35.840> to

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
in the power so car doesn't even have to

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:44.190 
in the power so car doesn't even have to
be<00:01:36.020> on<00:01:36.250> but<00:01:41.710> all<00:01:42.710> right<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.160> would<00:01:43.340> be<00:01:43.400> a

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
be on but all right that would be a

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.250 
be on but all right that would be a
decently<00:01:45.200> sounding<00:01:45.680> engine<00:01:46.930> all<00:01:47.930> right<00:01:48.110> let's

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
decently sounding engine all right let's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:58.010 
decently sounding engine all right let's
move<00:01:48.320> on<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.680> brushing<00:01:48.950> tests<00:01:54.220> all<00:01:55.220> right

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:15.550 

front<00:01:58.740> rotor<00:01:59.539> Russian<00:02:00.539> test<00:02:08.810> about<00:02:09.810> 90<00:02:10.379> 95<00:02:11.190> ish

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.479 

this<00:02:16.560> would<00:02:16.739> be<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.280> rear<00:02:17.790> rotor<00:02:19.489> compression

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
this would be the rear rotor compression

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:36.410 
this would be the rear rotor compression
test

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.040 

all<00:02:37.420> right<00:02:37.570> also<00:02:37.750> about<00:02:38.110> 90<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.740> seems<00:02:39.040> okay

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
all right also about 90 it seems okay

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.540 
all right also about 90 it seems okay
alright<00:02:41.050> okay<00:02:43.350> this<00:02:44.350> is<00:02:44.500> going<00:02:44.710> to<00:02:45.040> be<00:02:45.160> front

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
alright okay this is going to be front

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.170 
alright okay this is going to be front
rotor<00:02:45.790> overall<00:02:46.420> compression<00:02:47.970> sorry<00:02:48.970> for<00:02:49.120> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
rotor overall compression sorry for the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.090 
rotor overall compression sorry for the
glare<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.720> focus<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.350> terrible<00:02:50.890> would

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
glare and the focus is terrible would
