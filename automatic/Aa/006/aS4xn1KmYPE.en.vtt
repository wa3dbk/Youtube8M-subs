our<00:00:27.689> bike<00:00:27.840> rack<00:00:28.050> should<00:00:28.199> be<00:00:28.320> yet<00:00:28.500> we'll<00:00:28.980> go

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
our bike rack should be yet we'll go

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.279 
our bike rack should be yet we'll go
ahead<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.340> refer<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.789> fit<00:00:29.970> guide<00:00:30.230> now<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
ahead and refer to the fit guide now the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.680 
ahead and refer to the fit guide now the
notches<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.830> not<00:00:31.980> labeled<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:33.180> not<00:00:33.329> number

notches are not labeled but not number

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.740 
notches are not labeled but not number
one<00:00:33.930> starts<00:00:34.620> at<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.950> bottom<00:00:35.450> so<00:00:36.450> we'll<00:00:36.570> count

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
one starts at the bottom so we'll count

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.049 
one starts at the bottom so we'll count
up<00:00:36.989> 12<00:00:37.290> notches<00:00:43.309> you<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.460> see<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.789> black

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
up 12 notches you can see this black

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.150 
up 12 notches you can see this black
handle<00:00:48.320> will<00:00:49.320> pull<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.559> down<00:00:49.739> which<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.070> going

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
handle will pull it down which is going

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.799 
handle will pull it down which is going
to<00:00:50.250> free<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.640> up<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.910> allow<00:00:51.120> us<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.420> maneuver

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
to free it up and allow us to maneuver

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.560 
to free it up and allow us to maneuver
it<00:00:51.899> up<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.199> down<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.469> arm<00:00:53.000> so<00:00:54.000> again<00:00:54.329> we'll

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
it up and down this arm so again we'll

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.959 
it up and down this arm so again we'll
count<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.960> notch<00:00:55.110> number<00:00:55.410> 12<00:00:58.460> get<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.699> place

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
count to notch number 12 get it in place

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.700 
count to notch number 12 get it in place
and<00:01:01.340> then<00:01:02.340> clamp<00:01:02.550> down<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:02.910> black<00:01:03.120> lever

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.510 

they<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.799> go<00:01:07.890> ahead<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.159> give<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.400> good

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
they can go ahead and give it a good

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.010 
they can go ahead and give it a good
shake<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.180> make<00:01:09.330> sure<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> locking

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
shake just to make sure that the locking

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.620 
shake just to make sure that the locking
mechanism<00:01:10.680> has<00:01:10.830> engaged<00:01:11.189> correctly<00:01:11.760> well

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
mechanism has engaged correctly well

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.880 
mechanism has engaged correctly well
then<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.869> repeat<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> same<00:01:13.380> process<00:01:13.619> for

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
then just repeat the same process for

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.120 
then just repeat the same process for
the<00:01:14.100> other<00:01:14.220> side<00:01:15.140> now<00:01:16.140> our<00:01:16.439> fit<00:01:16.619> settings<00:01:16.979> in

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
the other side now our fit settings in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.539 
the other side now our fit settings in
place<00:01:17.869> according<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> website<00:01:19.460> we'll<00:01:20.460> go

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
place according to the website we'll go

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.280 
place according to the website we'll go
ahead<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.850> place<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> bike<00:01:21.210> rack<00:01:21.360> up<00:01:21.600> onto

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
ahead and place the bike rack up onto

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.120 
ahead and place the bike rack up onto
the<00:01:22.530> upper<00:01:22.830> tier<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.250> rear<00:01:23.280> bumper

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
the upper tier of the rear bumper

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.200 
the upper tier of the rear bumper
now<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.189> clips<00:01:26.520> are<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> little

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
now the clips are going to be a little

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.030 
now the clips are going to be a little
difficult<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.020> place<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.829> we're<00:01:28.950> going

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
difficult to get in place so we're going

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980 
difficult to get in place so we're going
to<00:01:29.100> open<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> rear<00:01:29.820> hatch<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.450> get<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
to open up the rear hatch and get the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.670 
to open up the rear hatch and get the
bottom<00:01:31.290> clips<00:01:31.880> underneath<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.240> lip<00:01:36.560> what<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
bottom clips underneath the lip what the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.190 
bottom clips underneath the lip what the
bottom<00:01:37.979> clips<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.400> position<00:01:38.960> we'll<00:01:39.960> go<00:01:40.079> ahead

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
bottom clips in position we'll go ahead

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.280 
bottom clips in position we'll go ahead
and<00:01:40.439> rotate<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.340> top<00:01:41.579> two<00:01:41.850> pads<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.990> fit<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
and rotate the top two pads to fit the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:52.430 
and rotate the top two pads to fit the
curvature<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.950> rear<00:01:44.130> hatch

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440

now<00:01:53.440> with<00:01:53.650> that<00:01:53.800> in<00:01:53.860> position<00:01:55.470> we'll<00:01:56.470> go<00:01:56.500> ahead

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
now with that in position we'll go ahead

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.590 
now with that in position we'll go ahead
and<00:01:56.830> keep<00:01:57.040> pressure<00:01:57.340> on<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.700> bike<00:01:57.880> because

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
and keep pressure on the bike because

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.910 
and keep pressure on the bike because
you<00:01:58.690> want<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.870> make<00:01:59.020> sure<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.500> lip<00:01:59.740> of

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
you want to make sure that the lip of

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.530 
you want to make sure that the lip of
the<00:02:00.100> rear<00:02:00.250> hatch<00:02:00.460> is<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:00.910> the<00:02:01.000> center<00:02:01.330> of<00:02:01.360> the
