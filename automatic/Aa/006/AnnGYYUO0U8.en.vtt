 such is given to us and that and good to tell you that 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.570

 competitive because your channel is the key 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.019
 this convinced turned to see erring 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.230
 the good call typical garay splashed that 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.840
 carries 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.850
 you'll see it and you'll see it surprise 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.390
 played with a team the truth quite 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.390
 much 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.360
 we go 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.790
 this sticks twice you can paste 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.790
 coolest 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.820
 it's calm 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.790
 so 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.610
 he was very successful in special defense 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.800
 that in all the fucking game 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.800
 seriously but what the fuck 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.670
 shit lÃ¼ jia 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.409
 blessed who want to be with me football 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.250
 Like I like to see what we can 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.500
 do 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.600
 to this chin chin so that for 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.600
 go to the center pokemon past 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.170
 is what I do not like about the showman 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.730
 Sometimes there are failures of these that for example 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.680
 it is an attack that does not have to change 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.070
 pokemon and you change pokemon port 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.280
 of the face if yes that is not done has 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.410
 some software glitches to see now 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.660
 well tell you what is a thousand times better 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.060
 that I and that saw do not have hypothetical 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.509
 if I win is because random and here 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.770
 Well, he wins the one that is not the one with the most 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.720
 the team does not need to be very 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.140
 smart to win by entering a lot 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.140
 to know a lot 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:25.170
 I say it just in case my mother 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:31.730
 I carried the fence that holds 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.730
 that is kind to fight but here not 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.270
 ah 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.230
 is that they give me against vargas llosa 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:48.430
 traps right now that what happened 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.430
 for pimp patients wants digestion 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.970
 to see 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.319
 now the rain 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.790
 I think I think I think I believe and I only think good 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.500
 I'm going to say it because you change me 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:18.269
 pokemon but one is going to go well 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.730
 because I had a young fence goodbye no 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.049
 I thought that site I highly go to the fence 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.049
 but this is the whole world 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.909
 what happens if you close the window 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.730
 no way 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.790
 there will be no problems 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:53.010
 Now I do not think I'll kill you but let's go 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.010
 decision see that an uncle goes 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.560
 zas 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.840
 come I'm looking for any type of attack 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.840
 dragon 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.470
 the pokemon themselves do not have attacks 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.030
 for example you can touch a little 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.340
 more since its kind and says I hope that 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.260
 this is clear, there are times that neither 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.260
 so bad but there are other times that mother 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.700

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.700

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.540
