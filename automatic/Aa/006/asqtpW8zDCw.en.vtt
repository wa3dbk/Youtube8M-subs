hi everyone Connie Chung NASA so a few
weeks<00:00:02.850> ago<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.120> lovely<00:00:03.480> subscriber<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:04.110> journey

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
weeks ago a lovely subscriber a journey

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.470 
weeks ago a lovely subscriber a journey
Scott<00:00:04.830> requests<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:05.790> make<00:00:06.000> jelly<00:00:06.240> beans

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
Scott requests that I make jelly beans

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.120 
Scott requests that I make jelly beans
and<00:00:06.750> so<00:00:07.109> it<00:00:07.259> can<00:00:07.379> be<00:00:07.440> tricky<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.770> make<00:00:07.950> jelly

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
and so it can be tricky to make jelly

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.709 
and so it can be tricky to make jelly
beans<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.550> taste<00:00:08.730> exactly<00:00:08.970> like<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.570> ones

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
beans that taste exactly like the ones

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.600 
beans that taste exactly like the ones
in<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.929> stores<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:10.830> thought<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.340> put<00:00:11.519> my

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
in the stores so I thought that I put my

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.160 
in the stores so I thought that I put my
own<00:00:11.639> spin<00:00:12.000> on<00:00:12.150> them<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.599> make<00:00:12.809> chocolate

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
own spin on them and make chocolate

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.410 
own spin on them and make chocolate
coated<00:00:13.440> ones<00:00:13.730> these<00:00:14.730> actually<00:00:15.089> turned<00:00:15.330> out

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
coated ones these actually turned out

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.660 
coated ones these actually turned out
way<00:00:15.719> younger<00:00:16.170> than<00:00:16.350> I'd<00:00:16.440> expected<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
way younger than I'd expected and the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.890 
way younger than I'd expected and the
chocolate<00:00:18.000> coating<00:00:18.270> allows<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.720> decorate

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
chocolate coating allows you to decorate

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.290 
chocolate coating allows you to decorate
them<00:00:19.230> any<00:00:19.470> way<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.859> like<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.820> let's<00:00:21.210> get

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
them any way that you like so let's get

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.570 
them any way that you like so let's get
started

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580

so what you want to do is pour the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.900 
so what you want to do is pour the
