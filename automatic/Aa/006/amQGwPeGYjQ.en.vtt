00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.000
 and a few days ago in high rotation 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.790
 is the new single from renato zero dal 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 title asks about me which is the first song 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.520
 extracted from the last album I love the chapter 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.560
 first they will publish soon 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.349
 two years after the harvest 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.830
 pure spirit is at 4 from the last record of 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.619
 unpublished from the present title ask for me 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.619
 it's a very lively song with which 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.239
 renato zero takes a little distance 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.540
 from his latest productions that are 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.930
 very intimist approaching instead a 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.590
 po to what is the pop dance style 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.920
 legendary songs for example mi 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.500
 I sell or the triangle the merit is 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.750
 also of the work done by trevor horn 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.450
 who also creates some great ones 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.860
 Successes of Paul McCartney of Robbie 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:01.860
 williams simple minds and other singers 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.949
 the co-producer of this and of 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.759
 other pieces of this album together with 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.429
 danilo madonia and celso valleys 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.840
 also the text of this song asks 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:17.640
 it is quite interesting about me 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.120
 in short, with the Roman artist who invites 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.520
 very explicitly his fans ad 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.860
 be yourself and not change for 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.580
 no one even offering himself 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.020
 I personally help the title 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.540
 of the song room ask for me 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.150
 it is precisely the maximum expression with 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.740
 the opportunity we talked about 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.829
 I should mention that this song the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.560
 besides being illegal or downloading the 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.320
 Pirate music is also a detriment to the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.420
 artists do not make it marine buy them 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.549
 tracks if you like an artist 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.740
 how this song asks of me of 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.590
 renato zero unload it in a manner 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.960
 legal precisely because in this way 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.590
 you can support your artists 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.110
 support them in their work and therefore 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.099
 do so that they can still 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.280
 more to produce good music 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:18.890
 I recommend you do this because it's like 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.200
 if you go to work without it then 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.090
 nobody pays you 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.890
 many will not agree this I know 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.040
 because I say it very often in mine 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.799
 videos that talk about music because 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.860
 they think the artists are overflowing 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.600
 but it could also be true many 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.950
 artists 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.690
 they are very rich, some are fine 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.770
 too much and we read it every day 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.330
 on the pages of the newspapers what are the 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.190
 their quirks 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.980
 however this is not must not be a 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.740
 alibi for downloading music 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.870
 pirate bought you do it especially 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.270
 maybe in digital stores where it costs 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.380
 less a track generally costs 1 euro e 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.940
 20 1 euro 30 and do it especially for 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.090
 this song is really very very 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.450
 nice good renato zero who succeeds 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.180
 once again to change face and ea 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.650
 make this song that really a 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.650
 beautiful song
