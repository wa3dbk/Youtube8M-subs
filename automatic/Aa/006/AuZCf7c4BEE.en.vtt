about<00:00:20.670> three<00:00:20.939> differences<00:00:21.240> first<00:00:22.880> um<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
about three differences first um the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.620 
about three differences first um the
applicator<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.910> albanese<00:00:26.910> those<00:00:27.119> I've<00:00:27.240> had<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
applicator and albanese those I've had a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.009 
applicator and albanese those I've had a
lot<00:00:27.900> left<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.769> applicator<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.580> blue<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.689> don't

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
lot left the applicator is blue I don't

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.549 
lot left the applicator is blue I don't
know<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.500> tell

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.530 

and<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> active<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.059> white<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:41.540> it's

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and for the active it's white and it's

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.910 
and for the active it's white and it's
not<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:45.300> second<00:00:45.690> thing<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:48.920> Tampax

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920

pearl<00:00:50.539> or<00:00:51.539> regular<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.739> guess<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.610> these<00:00:53.699> are

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
pearl or regular I guess what these are

both<00:00:54.030> regular<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.510> pharmacies<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
both regular in pharmacies but the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.639 
both regular in pharmacies but the
actual<00:00:56.039> Tampax<00:00:56.550> pearl<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.989> actually<00:00:58.440> has<00:00:58.620> a

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
actual Tampax pearl it actually has a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.759 
actual Tampax pearl it actually has a
bigger<00:00:59.070> tampon<00:00:59.879> itself<00:01:01.160> like<00:01:02.160> there's<00:01:02.969> no<00:01:03.769> at

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
bigger tampon itself like there's no at

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.620 
bigger tampon itself like there's no at
the<00:01:04.949> top<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> package<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.820> can't<00:01:06.180> bend<00:01:06.479> it

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the top of the package you can't bend it

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.219 
the top of the package you can't bend it
down<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.610> where<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.850> tampon<00:01:09.750> comes<00:01:10.049> out

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
down really where the tampon comes out

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.260 
down really where the tampon comes out
but<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.100> Tampax<00:01:11.640> pearl<00:01:13.820> active<00:01:14.820> there's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
but for the Tampax pearl active there's

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.440 
but for the Tampax pearl active there's
like<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.799> don't<00:01:16.799> they<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.130> hear<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:17.549> you

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
like I don't they can hear that but you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.890 
like I don't they can hear that but you
can<00:01:18.689> bend<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> flaps<00:01:19.560> down<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.860> little<00:01:20.159> bit

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
can bend the flaps down a little bit

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.330 
can bend the flaps down a little bit
every<00:01:21.900> moment<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.170> makes<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.500> difference<00:01:23.070> I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
every moment that makes a difference I

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.640 
every moment that makes a difference I
haven't<00:01:23.670> used<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.450> Tampax<00:01:24.869> pearl<00:01:25.170> actives

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
haven't used the Tampax pearl actives

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.580 
haven't used the Tampax pearl actives
yet<00:01:26.509> my<00:01:27.509> last<00:01:27.720> period<00:01:27.960> wasn't<00:01:28.320> heavy<00:01:28.439> enough

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
yet my last period wasn't heavy enough

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.460 
yet my last period wasn't heavy enough
to<00:01:28.799> try<00:01:29.220> them<00:01:29.570> but<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.689> coming<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
to try them but it's coming in like a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.880 
to try them but it's coming in like a
week<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.720> I'll<00:01:33.720> try<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.960> I'm<00:01:34.079> expecting<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.680> to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
week so I'll try it I'm expecting it to

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.090 
week so I'll try it I'm expecting it to
be<00:01:34.920> heavy<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:35.430> my<00:01:35.579> last<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:35.970> also<00:01:36.329> light

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
be heavy because my last one also light

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.359 
be heavy because my last one also light
okay

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
okay

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.840 
okay
the<00:01:38.810> last<00:01:39.810> comparison<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:41.430> all<00:01:43.850> like

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the last comparison is that's all like

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.080 
the last comparison is that's all like
the<00:01:45.710> applicator<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.860> guess<00:01:47.130> our<00:01:48.030> little

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the applicator I guess our little

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.660 
the applicator I guess our little
different<00:01:48.810> sizes<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:54.020> guess<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.290> because

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
different sizes I guess that's because

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.569 
different sizes I guess that's because
like<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.939> one's<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.299> little<00:01:57.540> taller<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:59.369> I

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
like this one's a little taller and I

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.730 
like this one's a little taller and I
guess<00:01:59.790> that's<00:02:00.030> because<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.960> active<00:02:01.850> no<00:02:03.740> this

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
guess that's because the active no this

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.649 
guess that's because the active no this
one's<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.070> little<00:02:05.310> taller<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.030> at<00:02:06.240> FX

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
one's a little taller this is at FX

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.510 
one's a little taller this is at FX
pearl<00:02:07.129> and<00:02:08.129> I'm<00:02:08.429> guessing<00:02:08.759> it's

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
pearl and I'm guessing it's

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.440 
pearl and I'm guessing it's
bigger<00:02:10.390> because<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:13.150> bigger<00:02:14.140> tampon

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
bigger because it's a bigger tampon

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.140 
bigger because it's a bigger tampon
well<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.750> grips<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.260> same<00:02:17.820> pretty<00:02:18.820> sure<00:02:19.030> the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
well the grips the same pretty sure the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.280 
well the grips the same pretty sure the
plumbers<00:02:19.600> are<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.900> same<00:02:20.110> size

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
plumbers are the same size

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.870 
plumbers are the same size
yeah<00:02:23.620> our<00:02:23.770> plungers<00:02:24.130> are<00:02:24.280> definitely<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
yeah our plungers are definitely the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.690 
yeah our plungers are definitely the
same<00:02:25.090> size<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.580> yeah<00:02:27.790> um<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:29.310> will<00:02:30.310> do<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.520> review
