00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.169 

well<00:00:01.350> I'm<00:00:01.500> just<00:00:01.709> mounted<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.639> junction<00:00:02.970> block

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
well I'm just mounted a junction block

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.519 
well I'm just mounted a junction block
on<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.419> wall<00:00:03.570> now<00:00:03.720> this<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:04.080> where<00:00:04.259> basically

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
on the wall now this is where basically

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.700 
on the wall now this is where basically
the<00:00:04.859> two<00:00:05.040> load<00:00:05.279> cells<00:00:05.609> come<00:00:06.270> in<00:00:06.529> so<00:00:07.529> you've<00:00:07.620> got

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
the two load cells come in so you've got

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.049 
the two load cells come in so you've got
the<00:00:07.799> two<00:00:07.919> cables<00:00:08.130> coming<00:00:08.460> out<00:00:08.610> I'm<00:00:08.790> trying<00:00:09.000> to

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
the two cables coming out I'm trying to

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.370 
the two cables coming out I'm trying to
keep<00:00:09.150> these<00:00:09.269> carriers<00:00:09.599> away<00:00:09.809> from<00:00:10.050> any<00:00:10.200> other

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
keep these carriers away from any other

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.990 
keep these carriers away from any other
electrics<00:00:10.860> because<00:00:11.460> they<00:00:11.580> are<00:00:11.700> susceptible

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
electrics because they are susceptible

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.780 
electrics because they are susceptible
to<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.389> bit<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.570> interference<00:00:13.400> so<00:00:14.400> this

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
to a bit of interference so this

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.340 
to a bit of interference so this
property<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.210> basically<00:00:15.509> take<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.839> two<00:00:15.990> inputs

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
property I basically take the two inputs

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.470 
property I basically take the two inputs
from<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> load<00:00:16.710> cells<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:18.000> combine<00:00:18.330> them

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
from the load cells and combine them

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.810 
from the load cells and combine them
into<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.720> one<00:00:18.900> output<00:00:19.460> for<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.520> amplifier

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
into a one output for the amplifier

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.179 
into a one output for the amplifier
which<00:00:21.210> will<00:00:21.359> then<00:00:21.449> go<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.779> computer<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
which will then go to the computer the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.040 
which will then go to the computer the
idea<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.240> basically<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> software

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
idea of that is basically the software

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.779 
idea of that is basically the software
only<00:00:25.199> accept<00:00:25.740> software<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.279> I'm<00:00:26.340> using<00:00:26.550> only

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
only accept software that I'm using only

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.900 
only accept software that I'm using only
accepts<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> single<00:00:27.619> load<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.830> input<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.429> most<00:00:29.730> I

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
accepts a single load so input as most I

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.209 
accepts a single load so input as most I
knows<00:00:30.119> these<00:00:30.359> days<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:30.960> your<00:00:31.439> one<00:00:31.590> one

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
knows these days have just your one one

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.400 
knows these days have just your one one
break<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.730> them<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.870> was<00:00:34.079> obvious<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.350> got

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
break on them this was obvious you got

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.190 
break on them this was obvious you got
two<00:00:34.760> so<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.940> idea<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.390> box<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.050> to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
two so the idea of this box is that to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.979 
two so the idea of this box is that to
combine<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> two<00:00:37.860> resistive<00:00:38.719> load<00:00:39.719> cells

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
combine the two resistive load cells

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.049 
combine the two resistive load cells
into<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.260> output<00:00:40.590> i'm<00:00:41.280> your<00:00:41.520> notice<00:00:41.790> there<00:00:42.000> is

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
into one output i'm your notice there is

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.100 
into one output i'm your notice there is
also<00:00:42.180> trimpots

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
also trimpots

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.110 
also trimpots
on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> four<00:00:44.640> input<00:00:44.789> one

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
on the it's actually a four input one

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.639 
on the it's actually a four input one
Bob<00:00:45.300> still<00:00:45.510> only<00:00:45.660> be<00:00:45.840> using<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> two<00:00:46.350> that

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
Bob still only be using the two that

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.990 
Bob still only be using the two that
will<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:46.920> keep<00:00:47.160> your<00:00:47.340> weight<00:00:47.460> enclosed<00:00:47.820> in

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
will then keep your weight enclosed in

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.709 
will then keep your weight enclosed in
there<00:00:48.210> with<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> hill<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> top<00:00:49.140> just<00:00:50.719> sort

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
there with the hill on the top just sort

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.260 
there with the hill on the top just sort
of<00:00:51.750> sits<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> top<00:00:52.469> there's<00:00:52.710> got<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> nice

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
of sits on the top there's got a nice

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.180 
of sits on the top there's got a nice
rubber<00:00:54.270> seal<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.960> keep<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> elements

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
rubber seal in it to keep the elements

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.880 
rubber seal in it to keep the elements
out<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.460> they're<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:57.059> proper<00:00:57.420> glands<00:00:57.890> so

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
out and they're all of proper glands so

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.979 
out and they're all of proper glands so
that<00:00:59.039> will<00:00:59.160> sit<00:00:59.309> there<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> output

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that will sit there and then the output

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.779 
that will sit there and then the output
will<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:01.320> go<00:01:01.469> off<00:01:01.559> into<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> main<00:01:02.219> sort<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
will then go off into the main sort of

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.050 
will then go off into the main sort of
electrical<00:01:03.239> box<00:01:03.500> where<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.369> amplifier<00:01:05.850> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
electrical box where the amplifier and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.539 
electrical box where the amplifier and
then<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> software<00:01:06.960> interface<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:08.310> box

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
then the software interface it out box

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.590 
then the software interface it out box
will<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:10.729> weight<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:11.909> I'm<00:01:12.000> working<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.390> some

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
will be weight so I'm working on some

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.170 
will be weight so I'm working on some
wiring<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.020> evening<00:01:13.580> as<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.760> know<00:01:14.909> I've<00:01:15.030> got

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
wiring this evening as you know I've got

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.520 
wiring this evening as you know I've got
the<00:01:15.299> two<00:01:15.450> loads<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.869> was<00:01:15.990> mounted<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the two loads I was mounted in the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.600 
the two loads I was mounted in the
frames<00:01:18.080> speed<00:01:19.080> sensor<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.770> ready<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.369> UM

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
frames speed sensor here ready to UM

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.719 
frames speed sensor here ready to UM
mount<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:22.560> sensor<00:01:23.369> I'll<00:01:23.460> enough<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
mount up this sensor I'll enough to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.800 
mount up this sensor I'll enough to
mount<00:01:23.850> I'm<00:01:24.030> probably<00:01:24.240> gonna<00:01:24.420> mount<00:01:24.600> it

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
mount I'm probably gonna mount it

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.120 
mount I'm probably gonna mount it
somewhere<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> edge<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:25.830> put

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
somewhere on the edge here and then put

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.999 
somewhere on the edge here and then put
the<00:01:26.250> put<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.820> magnet<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> side<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.009> in

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the put the magnet in the side of the in

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.490 
the put the magnet in the side of the in
the<00:01:29.189> roller<00:01:29.430> although<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.720> might<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.320> better

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the roller although it might be better

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.630 
the roller although it might be better
to<00:01:31.619> try<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.890> mount<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> shaft

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
to try and mount it in the shaft

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.370 
to try and mount it in the shaft
actually<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> centrifugal<00:01:33.960> forces

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
actually just so the centrifugal forces

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.340 
actually just so the centrifugal forces
are<00:01:34.650> kind<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.890> lower<00:01:35.659> it<00:01:36.659> obviously<00:01:37.049> when<00:01:37.229> it's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
are kind of lower it obviously when it's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.450 
are kind of lower it obviously when it's
in<00:01:37.439> there<00:01:37.650> compared<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.100> others<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.430> there

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
in there compared to others out there

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.550 
in there compared to others out there
it's<00:01:39.360> spinning<00:01:40.079> kind<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:41.000> small<00:01:42.000> distance

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
it's spinning kind of a small distance

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.960 
it's spinning kind of a small distance
so<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> ran<00:01:43.770> our<00:01:43.860> cables<00:01:44.280> up<00:01:44.399> for<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.670> I've<00:01:44.790> cut

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
so I ran our cables up for you I've cut

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.480 
so I ran our cables up for you I've cut
the<00:01:45.090> load<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.540> cables<00:01:45.960> isolated<00:01:46.560> because

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the load so cables isolated because

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.999 
the load so cables isolated because
they're<00:01:47.700> very<00:01:48.119> very<00:01:48.420> low<00:01:48.570> resistance<00:01:49.009> signals

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
they're very very low resistance signals

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.580 
they're very very low resistance signals
and<00:01:50.189> very<00:01:50.430> susceptible<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.000> interference<00:01:51.590> so

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
and very susceptible to interference so

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.749 
and very susceptible to interference so
they<00:01:52.710> come<00:01:52.920> up<00:01:52.950> through<00:01:53.040> I've<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.610> wired

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
they come up through I've just wired

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.310 
they come up through I've just wired
that<00:01:53.970> into<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> summer<00:01:54.420> box<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.049> you've<00:01:55.229> got

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
that into the summer box so you've got

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200 
that into the summer box so you've got
two<00:01:55.470> inputs<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> two<00:01:56.579> trimpots<00:01:56.820> which

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
two inputs with the two trimpots which

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.539 
two inputs with the two trimpots which
will<00:01:57.329> need<00:01:57.450> adjusting<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:58.020> later<00:01:58.350> point<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
will need adjusting a later point and

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.899 
will need adjusting a later point and
then<00:01:59.700> start<00:01:59.939> putting<00:02:00.119> up<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> main<00:02:01.770> box<00:02:02.729> up

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
then start putting up to the main box up

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.510 
then start putting up to the main box up
the<00:02:03.000> top<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:03.740> into<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> load<00:02:05.009> amp

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
the top here into the load amp

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.699 
the top here into the load amp
so<00:02:07.180> that<00:02:07.299> amplifies<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.020> not<00:02:08.170> not<00:02:08.380> five

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
so that amplifies it to a not not five

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.130 
so that amplifies it to a not not five

to<00:02:20.230> reduce<00:02:20.470> interference<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.970> start<00:02:22.239> with

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
to reduce interference and to start with

to reduce interference and to start with
and<00:02:22.660> then<00:02:22.780> go<00:02:22.989> over<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.500> 12<00:02:23.800> volt<00:02:23.950> supply<00:02:24.040> but

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
and then go over to a 12 volt supply but

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.550 
and then go over to a 12 volt supply but
I'm<00:02:24.700> just<00:02:25.150> gonna<00:02:25.300> try<00:02:25.420> as<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.959> is<00:02:26.110> if<00:02:26.319> we<00:02:26.410> get

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
I'm just gonna try as it is if we get

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.930 
I'm just gonna try as it is if we get
any<00:02:26.709> problems<00:02:27.040> I'll<00:02:27.130> put<00:02:27.250> on<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.519> battery

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
any problems I'll put on to a battery

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.990 
any problems I'll put on to a battery
just<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.269> make<00:02:28.720> sure<00:02:28.840> that's<00:02:28.959> not<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.260> problem

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
just to make sure that's not the problem

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
now on that terminal strip just so it's

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.479

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
once so I've kind of made it so we've

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.670 
once so I've kind of made it so we've
got<00:02:51.790> these<00:02:52.000> are<00:02:52.150> all<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.420> auxiliary<00:02:53.290> inputs

got these are all the auxiliary inputs

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.830 
got these are all the auxiliary inputs
here<00:02:53.890> so<00:02:54.730> we'll<00:02:54.850> be<00:02:54.970> able<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.150> input<00:02:55.330> sort<00:02:55.750> of

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
the diner shoe box on the left here I'm

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.120 
the diner shoe box on the left here I'm
hoping<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.239> use<00:03:16.390> one<00:03:16.690> our<00:03:17.290> date<00:03:17.530> ones<00:03:17.799> really

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
hoping to use one our date ones really

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.560 
hoping to use one our date ones really
meant<00:03:18.310> for<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.579> air<00:03:18.850> brakes<00:03:19.090> but<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.359> don't

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
meant for the air brakes but I don't

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.599 
meant for the air brakes but I don't
think<00:03:19.780> I'm<00:03:19.870> actually<00:03:19.989> going<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.290> use<00:03:20.440> that

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
think I'm actually going to use that

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.360 
think I'm actually going to use that
just<00:03:21.609> because<00:03:21.880> we<00:03:22.570> kind<00:03:22.989> of<00:03:23.220> have<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.280> problem

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
just because we kind of have a problem

is the actual dyno software and hardware
package<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.630> we're<00:04:01.750> going<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:01.930> be<00:04:01.989> using<00:04:02.350> and

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
package that we're going to be using and

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.400 
package that we're going to be using and
that<00:04:03.069> comes<00:04:03.250> from<00:04:03.340> Australia<00:04:04.209> really<00:04:05.019> helpful

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
that comes from Australia really helpful

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.920 
that comes from Australia really helpful
guy<00:04:05.530> called<00:04:05.769> Aaron<00:04:06.130> ironically<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:07.000> spoke<00:04:07.840> to

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
guy called Aaron ironically I spoke to

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.539 
guy called Aaron ironically I spoke to
him<00:04:08.019> about<00:04:08.139> it<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:08.650> we<00:04:08.920> kind<00:04:09.100> of<00:04:09.160> got<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.340> kit

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
him about it and we kind of got the kit

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.759 
him about it and we kind of got the kit
together<00:04:10.170> really<00:04:11.170> really<00:04:11.319> cost-effective

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
together really really cost-effective

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.440 
together really really cost-effective
compared<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.519> most<00:04:12.670> other<00:04:12.880> professional

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
compared to most other professional

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.270 
compared to most other professional
solutions<00:04:13.900> so<00:04:14.680> that's<00:04:14.859> what<00:04:14.979> we're<00:04:15.100> going<00:04:15.220> to

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
solutions so that's what we're going to

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.729 
solutions so that's what we're going to
be<00:04:15.340> using<00:04:15.699> their<00:04:16.660> helper<00:04:17.019> interface<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:17.620> also

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
be using their helper interface and also

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:18.930 
be using their helper interface and also
the<00:04:17.919> software

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
the software

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.449 
the software
computer<00:04:19.330> which<00:04:19.450> I<00:04:19.540> haven't<00:04:19.690> mounted<00:04:20.019> yet<00:04:20.459> so

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
computer which I haven't mounted yet so

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.710 
computer which I haven't mounted yet so
we'll<00:04:21.700> see<00:04:21.850> how<00:04:21.940> that<00:04:22.000> goes<00:04:22.120> once<00:04:22.510> we're<00:04:22.660> up

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
we'll see how that goes once we're up

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.720 
we'll see how that goes once we're up
and<00:04:22.840> running<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:24.070> I<00:04:24.100> just<00:04:24.220> got<00:04:24.370> some<00:04:24.460> more<00:04:24.550> wine

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
and running so I just got some more wine

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.520 
and running so I just got some more wine
to<00:04:25.000> tidy<00:04:25.360> up<00:04:25.390> and<00:04:25.660> then<00:04:25.930> we're<00:04:26.050> going<00:04:26.170> to<00:04:26.230> start

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
to tidy up and then we're going to start

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.930 
to tidy up and then we're going to start
putting<00:04:26.740> some<00:04:26.890> blows<00:04:27.130> on<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.370> sails<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.790> see

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
putting some blows on the sails to see

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.470 
putting some blows on the sails to see
if<00:04:28.030> we<00:04:28.120> get<00:04:28.240> any<00:04:28.420> voltage<00:04:28.600> out<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.200> amplifier

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
if we get any voltage out the amplifier

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.550 
if we get any voltage out the amplifier
right<00:04:31.480> as<00:04:31.660> you<00:04:31.810> can<00:04:31.960> see<00:04:32.110> I've<00:04:32.320> got<00:04:32.440> the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
right as you can see I've got the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.140 
right as you can see I've got the
computer<00:04:32.830> down<00:04:33.130> here<00:04:33.340> now

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
computer down here now

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.300 
computer down here now
so<00:04:34.720> just<00:04:34.930> turned<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:35.830> on<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:36.040> make<00:04:36.160> sure

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
so just turned it on to make sure

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.010 
so just turned it on to make sure
everything's<00:04:36.580> working<00:04:37.000> that's<00:04:37.720> sort<00:04:37.900> of<00:04:37.960> the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
everything's working that's sort of the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.540 
everything's working that's sort of the

you're<00:05:22.810> probably<00:05:22.960> wondering<00:05:23.350> what<00:05:23.440> we're

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
you're probably wondering what we're

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.100 
you're probably wondering what we're
doing<00:05:23.740> up<00:05:23.860> here<00:05:24.419> so<00:05:25.419> I've<00:05:25.690> got<00:05:25.810> the<00:05:25.900> Dino

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
doing up here so I've got the Dino

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.630 
doing up here so I've got the Dino
connected<00:05:26.620> up<00:05:26.740> now<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:27.370> we're<00:05:27.550> getting

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
connected up now and we're getting

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.159 
connected up now and we're getting
readings<00:05:28.210> from<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.510> amplifier<00:05:28.810> into<00:05:28.990> the

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
readings from the amplifier into the

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.159 
readings from the amplifier into the
computer<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:31.090> it<00:05:31.210> is<00:05:31.300> calibrate<00:05:31.750> basically

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
computer so it is calibrate basically

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.020 
computer so it is calibrate basically
now<00:05:32.320> so<00:05:32.590> that<00:05:32.710> computer<00:05:33.070> knows<00:05:33.310> what<00:05:33.820> voltage

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
now so that computer knows what voltage

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.450 
now so that computer knows what voltage
sort<00:05:34.960> of<00:05:35.020> means<00:05:35.260> what<00:05:35.530> weight<00:05:35.740> or<00:05:36.250> what

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
sort of means what weight or what

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.420 
sort of means what weight or what
tension<00:05:36.669> however<00:05:37.120> you<00:05:37.180> want<00:05:37.330> to<00:05:37.419> look<00:05:37.540> at<00:05:37.660> it

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
tension however you want to look at it

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.770 
tension however you want to look at it
obviously<00:05:39.430> we<00:05:39.520> can<00:05:39.610> get<00:05:39.730> a<00:05:39.760> zero<00:05:40.090> voltage<00:05:40.300> just

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
obviously we can get a zero voltage just

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.690 
obviously we can get a zero voltage just
by<00:05:40.960> leaving<00:05:41.110> everything<00:05:41.470> rest<00:05:41.800> that's<00:05:42.520> the

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
by leaving everything rest that's the

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.070 
by leaving everything rest that's the
zero<00:05:42.910> voltage<00:05:43.360> we<00:05:43.540> can<00:05:43.570> calibrate<00:05:43.870> that

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
zero voltage we can calibrate that

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.810 
zero voltage we can calibrate that
Napalm<00:05:44.470> at<00:05:44.590> all<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:45.130> now<00:05:45.280> we<00:05:45.340> need<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.580> put<00:05:45.790> a

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
Napalm at all so now we need to put a

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.600 
Napalm at all so now we need to put a
known<00:05:46.030> weight<00:05:46.300> on<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:47.740> see<00:05:47.860> the<00:05:47.980> output<00:05:48.310> from

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
known weight on to see the output from

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.550 
known weight on to see the output from
the<00:05:48.790> load<00:05:49.150> so<00:05:49.330> amp<00:05:49.510> and<00:05:49.720> then<00:05:49.780> tell<00:05:50.020> would<00:05:50.140> tell

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
the load so amp and then tell would tell

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.490 
the load so amp and then tell would tell
the<00:05:50.710> software<00:05:50.830> what<00:05:51.700> weight<00:05:51.940> that<00:05:52.500> that

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
the software what weight that that

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.390 
the software what weight that that
voltage<00:05:53.710> means<00:05:54.130> so<00:05:55.590> being<00:05:56.590> being<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:57.070> farmers

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
voltage means so being being the farmers

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.950 
voltage means so being being the farmers
we<00:05:57.520> are<00:05:57.669> we<00:05:57.970> have<00:05:58.120> a<00:05:58.150> nice<00:05:58.360> collection<00:05:58.570> of<00:05:58.810> John

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
we are we have a nice collection of John

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.360 
we are we have a nice collection of John
Deere<00:05:59.110> weights<00:05:59.290> lying<00:05:59.560> around<00:05:59.650> some<00:06:00.100> spare

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
Deere weights lying around some spare

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.820 
Deere weights lying around some spare
ones<00:06:00.550> here<00:06:00.760> so<00:06:01.390> John<00:06:02.020> Deere<00:06:02.200> claim<00:06:02.410> it's<00:06:02.560> 50

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
ones here so John Deere claim it's 50

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.490 
ones here so John Deere claim it's 50
kilo<00:06:03.160> it<00:06:03.669> says<00:06:03.880> 50<00:06:04.180> kilo<00:06:04.450> on<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:04.720> side<00:06:04.900> I<00:06:05.110> don't

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
kilo it says 50 kilo on the side I don't

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.200 
kilo it says 50 kilo on the side I don't
know<00:06:05.680> how<00:06:05.740> accurate<00:06:05.890> that<00:06:06.190> is<00:06:06.430> so<00:06:06.970> what<00:06:07.090> we're

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
know how accurate that is so what we're

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.310 
know how accurate that is so what we're
going<00:06:07.300> to<00:06:07.360> do<00:06:07.510> is<00:06:07.630> we're<00:06:07.750> going<00:06:07.780> to<00:06:07.900> drop<00:06:08.050> it<00:06:08.200> in

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
going to do is we're going to drop it in

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.010 
going to do is we're going to drop it in
the<00:06:08.440> chute<00:06:08.980> scale<00:06:09.250> is<00:06:09.370> here<00:06:09.550> so<00:06:10.240> where<00:06:10.810> these

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
the chute scale is here so where these

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.510 
the chute scale is here so where these
are<00:06:11.140> really<00:06:11.290> accurate<00:06:11.410> so<00:06:11.770> we<00:06:11.890> will<00:06:12.190> know<00:06:12.340> now

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
are really accurate so we will know now

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.460 
are really accurate so we will know now
or<00:06:13.270> if<00:06:13.570> they're<00:06:13.810> accurate<00:06:13.990> and<00:06:14.290> if<00:06:14.350> they're

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
or if they're accurate and if they're

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.110 
or if they're accurate and if they're
not<00:06:14.500> what<00:06:14.800> weight<00:06:14.950> it<00:06:15.100> actually<00:06:15.370> is<00:06:15.490> and<00:06:15.970> then

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
not what weight it actually is and then

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.640 
not what weight it actually is and then
we<00:06:16.240> can<00:06:16.270> make<00:06:16.630> a<00:06:16.660> frame<00:06:16.930> to<00:06:17.080> hold<00:06:17.230> this<00:06:17.380> above

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
we can make a frame to hold this above

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.820 
we can make a frame to hold this above
the<00:06:17.740> load<00:06:17.919> cell<00:06:18.160> to<00:06:19.110> calibrate<00:06:20.110> so<00:06:20.410> if<00:06:20.560> Chris

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
the load cell to calibrate so if Chris

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.430 
the load cell to calibrate so if Chris
sticks<00:06:21.130> it<00:06:21.250> in<00:06:21.370> here<00:06:21.810> we're<00:06:22.810> zeroed<00:06:23.110> out<00:06:23.230> here

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
sticks it in here we're zeroed out here

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.810 
sticks it in here we're zeroed out here
at<00:06:23.500> the<00:06:23.560> minute<00:06:23.800> so<00:06:24.010> we'll<00:06:24.130> just<00:06:24.310> see<00:06:24.610> what

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
at the minute so we'll just see what

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.900 
at the minute so we'll just see what
these<00:06:25.000> actually<00:06:25.360> weigh<00:06:25.510> I<00:06:26.700> said<00:06:27.700> they're

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
these actually weigh I said they're

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.080 
these actually weigh I said they're
they're<00:06:28.570> labelled<00:06:28.930> assist<00:06:29.200> each<00:06:29.320> kilo<00:06:30.090> and

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
they're labelled assist each kilo and

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.679 
they're labelled assist each kilo and
they<00:06:32.020> are<00:06:32.169> actually

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:32.689 
they are actually

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.919 
they are actually
Tilo<00:06:33.489> okay<00:06:34.489> so<00:06:34.549> they<00:06:34.789> are<00:06:34.819> exactly<00:06:35.269> 50<00:06:35.659> kilo

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:35.929 
Tilo okay so they are exactly 50 kilo

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:38.289 
Tilo okay so they are exactly 50 kilo
that's<00:06:36.229> good<00:06:36.699> right<00:06:37.699> so<00:06:37.879> now<00:06:38.059> that<00:06:38.089> we<00:06:38.269> know

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:38.299 
that's good right so now that we know

00:06:38.299 --> 00:06:39.729 
that's good right so now that we know
what<00:06:38.539> that<00:06:38.689> is<00:06:38.809> we<00:06:38.989> can<00:06:39.110> go<00:06:39.199> down<00:06:39.379> and<00:06:39.469> somehow

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:39.739 
what that is we can go down and somehow

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:43.059 
what that is we can go down and somehow
mount<00:06:40.099> it<00:06:40.309> right<00:06:41.229> what<00:06:42.229> you<00:06:42.349> can<00:06:42.499> see<00:06:42.649> here<00:06:42.679> is

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:43.069 
mount it right what you can see here is

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.879 
mount it right what you can see here is
the<00:06:43.219> homemade<00:06:44.289> calibration<00:06:45.289> bar<00:06:45.469> I've<00:06:45.739> just

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:45.889 
the homemade calibration bar I've just

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.119 
the homemade calibration bar I've just
made<00:06:46.039> so<00:06:47.139> the<00:06:48.139> top<00:06:48.349> there<00:06:48.559> is<00:06:48.649> putting<00:06:48.979> in<00:06:49.069> the

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:49.129 
made so the top there is putting in the

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.719 
made so the top there is putting in the
weight<00:06:49.309> on

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:49.729 
weight on

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:51.429 
weight on
I'm<00:06:50.059> just<00:06:50.389> enough<00:06:50.629> to<00:06:50.809> tighten<00:06:51.110> up<00:06:51.139> against

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:51.439 
I'm just enough to tighten up against

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:54.129 
I'm just enough to tighten up against
they<00:06:51.589> can't<00:06:51.769> fall<00:06:51.919> off<00:06:52.269> I've<00:06:53.269> cut<00:06:53.629> a<00:06:53.659> couple

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 
they can't fall off I've cut a couple

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.949 
they can't fall off I've cut a couple
angles<00:06:54.529> into<00:06:54.769> it<00:06:54.860> and<00:06:55.099> then<00:06:55.759> they<00:06:55.909> see<00:06:56.239> it<00:06:56.719> just

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:56.959 
angles into it and then they see it just

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:59.469 
angles into it and then they see it just
basically<00:06:57.259> slots<00:06:57.799> on<00:06:58.099> to<00:06:59.059> the<00:06:59.179> end<00:06:59.299> of<00:06:59.419> the

00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 
basically slots on to the end of the

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:02.829 
basically slots on to the end of the
torque<00:06:59.719> on<00:07:00.819> so<00:07:01.819> you<00:07:01.879> drop<00:07:02.299> it<00:07:02.449> into<00:07:02.599> position

00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:02.839 
torque on so you drop it into position

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:07.629 
torque on so you drop it into position
and<00:07:03.759> that<00:07:04.759> slides<00:07:05.539> on<00:07:05.919> there<00:07:06.919> like<00:07:07.129> that<00:07:07.159> and

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 
and that slides on there like that and

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.139 
and that slides on there like that and
then<00:07:08.179> you<00:07:08.269> put<00:07:08.449> the<00:07:08.539> bolt<00:07:09.939> straight<00:07:10.939> through

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:11.149 
then you put the bolt straight through

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:15.909 
then you put the bolt straight through
the<00:07:11.239> holding<00:07:11.419> hole<00:07:14.289> and<00:07:15.289> I'll<00:07:15.439> see<00:07:15.589> the<00:07:15.679> nut<00:07:15.829> on

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
the holding hole and I'll see the nut on

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.239 
the holding hole and I'll see the nut on
the<00:07:15.979> bat<00:07:16.159> and<00:07:16.819> that<00:07:16.849> basically<00:07:17.300> sits<00:07:17.629> like<00:07:17.869> so

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:18.249 
the bat and that basically sits like so

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:20.439 
the bat and that basically sits like so
and<00:07:19.249> then<00:07:19.399> that<00:07:19.519> allows<00:07:19.610> me<00:07:19.969> to<00:07:19.999> hang<00:07:20.269> the

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:20.449 
and then that allows me to hang the

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.199 
and then that allows me to hang the
weight<00:07:21.610> right<00:07:22.610> so<00:07:22.849> I've<00:07:22.939> just<00:07:22.969> finished

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:23.209 
weight right so I've just finished

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:25.179 
weight right so I've just finished
calibrating<00:07:23.659> the<00:07:24.019> second<00:07:24.349> side<00:07:24.529> so<00:07:25.009> you<00:07:25.069> can

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:25.189 
calibrating the second side so you can

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:27.069 
calibrating the second side so you can
see<00:07:25.309> I've<00:07:25.399> got<00:07:25.519> the<00:07:25.669> arm<00:07:25.839> mounted<00:07:26.839> on<00:07:26.959> the

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:27.079 
see I've got the arm mounted on the

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:28.989 
see I've got the arm mounted on the
torque<00:07:27.259> arm<00:07:27.469> with<00:07:28.099> the<00:07:28.249> tractor<00:07:28.759> weight

00:07:28.989 --> 00:07:28.999 
torque arm with the tractor weight

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:31.119 
torque arm with the tractor weight
hanging<00:07:29.179> off<00:07:29.389> it<00:07:29.569> so<00:07:30.559> you<00:07:30.619> can<00:07:30.799> see<00:07:30.889> I've<00:07:31.009> got

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:31.129 
hanging off it so you can see I've got

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:34.419 
hanging off it so you can see I've got
that<00:07:31.389> hanging<00:07:32.389> directly<00:07:33.379> above<00:07:34.099> the<00:07:34.279> load

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:34.429 
that hanging directly above the load

00:07:34.429 --> 00:07:38.409 
that hanging directly above the load
cell<00:07:35.229> I've<00:07:36.229> now<00:07:36.769> calibrated<00:07:37.369> and<00:07:37.459> trimmed<00:07:37.759> the

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:38.419 
cell I've now calibrated and trimmed the

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:41.469 
cell I've now calibrated and trimmed the
second<00:07:38.869> input<00:07:39.829> so<00:07:40.219> they<00:07:40.369> both<00:07:40.579> output<00:07:40.999> exactly

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479 
second input so they both output exactly

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:43.659 
second input so they both output exactly
the<00:07:41.599> same<00:07:41.809> with<00:07:42.379> 50<00:07:42.800> kilograms<00:07:43.189> on<00:07:43.369> them<00:07:43.519> and

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:43.669 
the same with 50 kilograms on them and

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:45.459 
the same with 50 kilograms on them and
I've<00:07:44.209> just<00:07:44.300> made<00:07:44.479> a<00:07:44.539> note<00:07:44.749> of<00:07:44.779> the<00:07:44.989> readings<00:07:45.319> on

00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:45.469 
I've just made a note of the readings on

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:47.379 
I've just made a note of the readings on
the<00:07:45.529> computer<00:07:45.949> so<00:07:46.610> I'm<00:07:46.669> now<00:07:46.789> gonna<00:07:46.939> input<00:07:47.300> that

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:47.389 
the computer so I'm now gonna input that

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:50.619 
the computer so I'm now gonna input that
data<00:07:47.659> into<00:07:48.229> a<00:07:48.259> linear<00:07:49.360> input<00:07:50.360> because<00:07:50.509> these

00:07:50.619 --> 00:07:50.629 
data into a linear input because these

00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:52.029 
data into a linear input because these
loads<00:07:50.959> of<00:07:51.289> linear<00:07:51.499> so<00:07:51.649> as<00:07:51.739> long<00:07:51.800> as<00:07:51.860> you've<00:07:52.009> got

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:52.039 
loads of linear so as long as you've got

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:54.969 
loads of linear so as long as you've got
two<00:07:52.279> points<00:07:52.959> that<00:07:53.959> will<00:07:54.050> give<00:07:54.199> you<00:07:54.319> a<00:07:54.589> fairly

00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:54.979 
two points that will give you a fairly

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:57.219 
two points that will give you a fairly
good<00:07:55.099> reading<00:07:55.659> so<00:07:56.659> I'm<00:07:56.749> gonna<00:07:56.899> get<00:07:57.050> that<00:07:57.110> in

00:07:57.219 --> 00:07:57.229 
good reading so I'm gonna get that in

00:07:57.229 --> 00:07:58.689 
good reading so I'm gonna get that in
person<00:07:57.529> now<00:07:57.679> and<00:07:57.889> we'll<00:07:58.009> get<00:07:58.129> a<00:07:58.189> car<00:07:58.339> on<00:07:58.519> here

00:07:58.689 --> 00:07:58.699 
person now and we'll get a car on here

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:01.569 
person now and we'll get a car on here
and<00:07:58.849> see<00:07:59.119> what<00:07:59.539> happens
