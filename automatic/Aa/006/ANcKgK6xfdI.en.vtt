00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
 then the new series 1 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:11.350
 yeah that 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:12.940
 we are not important is that like 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.400
 you can see we wanted 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.810
 put the new it's a really 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.640
 as the first vehicle in the range 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.560
 citroen so far often do not 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.150
 did not necessarily link the style 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.500
 did not allow him to be identified at 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.539
 first look like a real 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.820
 citroën result in particular in the 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.160
 amount of black feet that also allows 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.349
 to have continuity with the surface 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.720
 glazed and who gives it when we see it 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.210
 on the side 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.290
 even 1 3 a little floating continuity a 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.210
 certain dynamism 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.910
 and that's a technique we find 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 on the c4 and then then there are the fans 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.720
 double floor it really gives him a 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.040
 look at a real personality 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.270
 so we almost feel like going 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.400
 we wink she has 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.980
 really a ball frimousse on it 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.810
 wanted rather mischievous side rossa 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.230
 gives sweetness that reassures 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.030
 actually triggers a crush 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.890
 so that's a version we call 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.470
 their skateboard so here with the idea 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.309
 of escape this canvas roof so opens 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.110
 electrically 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.090
 one can there maneuvered while driving 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.510
 up to 120 km time there is no 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.729
 worry 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.280
 it's among the three colors of you 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.119
 available so this one the hue 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.400
 specific 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.590
 here we see the black hue a 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.410
 third gray hues too which will 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.040
 used we wanted to create so at 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.410
 interior 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.880
 when we already look at the design has 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.290
 completely changed in relation to this 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.090
 we had during previous 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.979
 versions did not want to make a toy 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.830
 but we still wanted to bring 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.149
 touches of cheerful colors through 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.200
 of these decor elements inside 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.080
 it's also bringing a lot of 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.180
 technologies so there is this screen 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.590
 touch that brings the mirror function 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.570
 screen which is really an innovation 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.640
 and news for citroën and for the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.300
 psa group so we have an air conditioning 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.570
 automatic 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.399
 we have the keyless start we also have 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.229
 so introduces steering wheel controls 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.300
 because it's still useful when 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.020
 we want to use his phone 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.729
 that can be connected to the screen 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.409
 and then bluetooth functions change 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.939
 the radio it is better to have the hands 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.830
 on the steering wheel and be able to continue to 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.050
 look at the road so we also had 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.120
 a security element for the car 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.709
 the interior design has been 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.300
 mainly done by psa style 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.330
 unlike the first generation 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.370
 it was a toyota style so there we are 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.440
 have a color pack that is specific to 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.870
 her breasts that we integrated in fact with 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.459
 a headband that is very well worked 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.680
 or at the grain level we wanted 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.379
 keep the return of the body color 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.849
 inside which allows to have 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.360
 the color too 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.000
 without necessarily going through pieces of 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.290
 decor of the color packs then learned 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.510
 in the little tips what we have 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.390
 brought precisely this is for example these 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.700
 two layers of window lifts 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.079
 there was one on the previous one 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.690
 version and so it had to be the 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.040
 templeuvois m closure so we said 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.519
 that's quite the things he 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.079
 must be erased 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.299
 that is to say, it is necessary to facilitate 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.010
 the used it was really the watchword 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.110
 it was easier to use 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.780
 Then there is the famous trapdoor 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.460
 fuel 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.380
 we solved the problem the trap 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.410
 now opens now 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.240
 from inside then the seats then 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.660
 aulas you can admire the seats 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.470
 leather 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.850
 so that was a developed by psa and 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.710
 so we're going to rework all the maintenance 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.660
 the whole thing just for a 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.910
 better comfort but a better 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.830
 support what is important also by 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.390
 relation to the driving position he did 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.940
 integrated with heated seat sites 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.010
 it's a car that can be chic that 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.900
 see it there is smaller by its size 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.280
 yes but she is very clever and 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.780
 very equipped watch is equipped 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.400
 that's what he's going to do really the 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.350
 difference with the outer face which 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.690
 goes to her own breasts and we recognize 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.430
 whole class and then so we 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.770
 all the front part that is specific 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.800
 to citroen and back we will have the 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.580
 shape of the bumper and fires 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.770
 inside the lights too is 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.320
 specific that is specific to citroen 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.250
 c1 reminds a little cactus and then the ds3 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.770
 really launch in the line of the 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.190
 of the citroën brand and that stands out 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.330
 really from his cousins 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.060
 it is very very nice it is a very 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.220
 beautiful bet succeeded thank you good day 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.670
 thank you and good show thank you to you too 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.670
 thank you
