00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
this color in the crease we're getting

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.380 
this color in the crease we're getting
the<00:03:52.209> most<00:03:52.390> on<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.989> corner<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:53.680> then<00:03:54.549> do<00:03:54.940> kind

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
the most on the corner and then do kind

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.759 
the most on the corner and then do kind
of<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.540> windshield<00:03:55.840> wiper<00:03:55.989> motion<00:04:01.769> the

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
of a windshield wiper motion the

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.229 
of a windshield wiper motion the
lighting<00:04:03.130> is<00:04:03.250> kind<00:04:03.430> of<00:04:03.489> washing<00:04:03.819> it<00:04:03.910> out<00:04:04.000> but

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
lighting is kind of washing it out but

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.270 
lighting is kind of washing it out but
it<00:04:04.359> looks<00:04:04.390> darker<00:04:04.989> in<00:04:05.049> real<00:04:05.200> life<00:04:05.410> I<00:04:05.530> guess<00:04:05.709> so

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
it looks darker in real life I guess so

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.500 
it looks darker in real life I guess so
what<00:04:06.609> you<00:04:06.790> should<00:04:07.000> have<00:04:07.209> now<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:08.319> a<00:04:09.090> gold<00:04:10.090> lid

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
what you should have now is a gold lid

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.140 
what you should have now is a gold lid
with<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.840> dark<00:04:11.200> brown<00:04:11.470> crease<00:04:12.040> you're<00:04:12.850> going<00:04:13.030> to

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
with a dark brown crease you're going to

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.800 
with a dark brown crease you're going to
create<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.480> very<00:04:14.019> dramatic<00:04:15.150> winged<00:04:16.150> eyeliner

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
create a very dramatic winged eyeliner

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.500 
create a very dramatic winged eyeliner
with<00:04:17.289> your<00:04:17.440> black<00:04:17.650> liner

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.980 

so<00:04:22.080> you<00:04:22.140> couldn't<00:04:22.710> draw<00:04:22.860> all<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.010> lines<00:04:23.220> on

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
so you couldn't draw all the lines on

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.190 
so you couldn't draw all the lines on
thicker<00:04:24.990> than<00:04:25.940> usual<00:04:26.940> just<00:04:27.240> do<00:04:28.050> little

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
thicker than usual just do little

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:42.330 
thicker than usual just do little
strokes<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.310> go<00:04:29.580> slow

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.560 

and<00:04:42.850> then<00:04:43.470> really<00:04:44.470> create<00:04:44.980> a<00:04:45.010> thick<00:04:45.580> wing

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:56.130 

connect

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.880 

so<00:04:56.830> you<00:04:56.920> have<00:04:57.250> a<00:04:57.550> very<00:04:57.970> dramatic<00:04:58.210> wing<00:04:59.080> look

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
so you have a very dramatic wing look

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.310 
so you have a very dramatic wing look
I'm<00:05:00.820> gonna<00:05:00.940> take<00:05:01.150> your<00:05:01.360> silver<00:05:02.110> or<00:05:04.320> whatever

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
color I guess glare put this underneath

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.490 
color I guess glare put this underneath
