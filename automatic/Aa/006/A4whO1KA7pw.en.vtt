but was it hard to put together it's a
little<00:02:41.579> bit<00:02:41.760> complicated<00:02:42.120> wasn't<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.870> in

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
little bit complicated wasn't it in

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.199 
little bit complicated wasn't it in
others<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.680> was<00:02:43.769> quite<00:02:44.069> tricky<00:02:44.610> getting<00:02:44.879> some

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
others it was quite tricky getting some

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.399 
others it was quite tricky getting some

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.819 
of the studs at that time wasn't it but
it<00:02:49.409> probably<00:02:49.590> took<00:02:49.829> us<00:02:50.040> up<00:02:50.390> two<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.599> half

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
it probably took us up two and a half

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.380 
it probably took us up two and a half
hours<00:02:52.829> to<00:02:52.860> get<00:02:53.129> it<00:02:53.220> all<00:02:53.400> put<00:02:53.640> together<00:02:53.790> over

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
hours to get it all put together over
