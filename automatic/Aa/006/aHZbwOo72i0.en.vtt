stuff that's in this box what really

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.250 
stuff that's in this box what really
caught<00:00:53.640> my<00:00:53.820> eye<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.059> looking<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.840> cutaway

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
caught my eye is looking at this cutaway

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.319 
caught my eye is looking at this cutaway
of<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:56.309> etx<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.620> gap<00:00:59.190> here<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.850> this

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
of the etx is is this gap here this this

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.920 
of the etx is is this gap here this this
unique<00:01:00.690> spacing<00:01:01.469> between<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.980> woofer<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
unique spacing between the woofer and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.780 
unique spacing between the woofer and
the<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.260> high-frequency<00:01:04.650> section<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.519> know<00:01:05.580> we

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the the high-frequency section I know we

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.740 
the the high-frequency section I know we
call<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.119> SST<00:01:06.960> signal<00:01:07.920> synchronized

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
call that SST signal synchronized

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.810 
call that SST signal synchronized
transducers<00:01:09.750> yep<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.860> mouthful<00:01:11.369> what

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
transducers yep that's a mouthful what

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.149 
transducers yep that's a mouthful what
does<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> mean<00:01:12.180> well<00:01:12.689> there's<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.740> lot<00:01:14.010> of

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
does it mean well there's a lot of

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.980 
does it mean well there's a lot of
really<00:01:14.520> interesting<00:01:14.549> things<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.570> are<00:01:15.810> going

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
really interesting things that are going

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.920 
really interesting things that are going
on<00:01:16.229> with<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.650> technology<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:18.330> type<00:01:18.900> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
on with this technology and this type of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.830 
on with this technology and this type of
design<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.700> implementation<00:01:21.390> actually

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
design and this implementation actually

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.350 
design and this implementation actually
makes<00:01:22.350> several<00:01:23.040> different<00:01:23.549> things<00:01:23.759> possible

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
makes several different things possible

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.410 
makes several different things possible
through<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.770> basic<00:01:26.250> positioning<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
through just basic positioning of the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.499 
through just basic positioning of the
loudspeakers<00:01:28.049> itself<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.520> begin<00:01:29.700> let's

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
loudspeakers itself so to begin let's

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.679 
loudspeakers itself so to begin let's
take<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.840> look<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.290> how<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.970> actual<00:01:32.970> components

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
take a look at how the actual components

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.960 
take a look at how the actual components
are<00:01:33.810> oriented<00:01:34.350> within<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.400> loudspeaker

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
are oriented within the loudspeaker

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.899 
are oriented within the loudspeaker
itself<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.310> acoustic

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
itself as you can see the acoustic

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.380 
itself as you can see the acoustic
centers<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.600> both<00:01:40.320> my<00:01:40.530> woofer<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.159> well<00:01:41.759> as<00:01:42.030> my

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
centers of both my woofer as well as my

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.630 
centers of both my woofer as well as my
compression<00:01:42.930> driver<00:01:43.020> are<00:01:43.409> aligned<00:01:44.009> this

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
compression driver are aligned this

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.810 
compression driver are aligned this
means<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.360> signal<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:46.430> synchronized<00:01:47.430> as

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
means that the signal is synchronized as

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.960 
means that the signal is synchronized as
it<00:01:48.450> begins<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.020> leave<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.740> loudspeakers<00:01:50.430> so

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
it begins to leave the loudspeakers so

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.179 
it begins to leave the loudspeakers so
this<00:01:51.450> eliminates<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.320> need<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.590> additional

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
this eliminates the need for additional

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.160 
this eliminates the need for additional
correction<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.570> would<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.049> do

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
correction that we would have to do

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.319 
correction that we would have to do
inside<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> box<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.729> generally

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
inside of the box and it just generally

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.889 
inside of the box and it just generally
makes<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> much<00:01:58.259> much<00:01:58.649> more<00:01:59.040> optimized

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
makes for a much much more optimized

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.120 
makes for a much much more optimized
loudspeaker<00:02:00.899> configuration<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.920> what's

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
loudspeaker configuration so what's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.590 
loudspeaker configuration so what's
coming<00:02:02.280> from<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.729> woofer<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
coming from the woofer and the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.630 
coming from the woofer and the
high-frequency<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.469> basically<00:02:04.979> physically

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
high-frequency is basically physically

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.850 
high-frequency is basically physically
time-aligned<00:02:06.479> correct<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.170> arriving<00:02:07.590> at<00:02:07.710> our

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
time-aligned correct and arriving at our

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.999 
time-aligned correct and arriving at our
ears<00:02:08.479> at<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.720> same<00:02:09.929> time<00:02:10.200> without<00:02:10.379> having<00:02:10.770> to

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
ears at the same time without having to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.380 
ears at the same time without having to
do<00:02:11.459> any

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
do any

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.050 
do any
ESP<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:13.350> correct<00:02:13.710> that<00:02:13.860> correct<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.910> that

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
ESP to correct that correct and and that

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.300 
ESP to correct that correct and and that
begins<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.630> have<00:02:15.810> impacts<00:02:16.350> on<00:02:16.709> phase

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
begins to have impacts on phase

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.600 
begins to have impacts on phase
correlation<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.750> lot<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.020> other

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
correlation and a lot of other

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.010 
correlation and a lot of other
fundamental<00:02:20.610> interactions<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.690> wind

fundamental interactions that you wind

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.690 
fundamental interactions that you wind
up<00:02:22.140> having<00:02:22.350> between<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.100> compression<00:02:23.580> driver

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.150 
up having between the compression driver
and<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.569> lover<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.319> there's<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.560> lot<00:02:25.800> more

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
and the lover but there's a lot more

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.390 
and the lover but there's a lot more
that<00:02:26.550> goes<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:27.030> beyond<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.380> aligning<00:02:28.980> those

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
that goes on beyond just aligning those

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.660 
that goes on beyond just aligning those
signals<00:02:29.880> what<00:02:30.630> you'll<00:02:30.810> notice<00:02:31.080> here<00:02:31.320> is<00:02:31.860> this

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
signals what you'll notice here is this

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.910 
signals what you'll notice here is this
actually<00:02:33.450> enables<00:02:33.930> us<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.110> do<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.410> couple<00:02:34.860> of

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
actually enables us to do a couple of

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.290 
actually enables us to do a couple of
different<00:02:34.980> things<00:02:35.610> with<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.090> Box

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
different things with the Box

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.680 
different things with the Box
construction<00:02:37.140> we're<00:02:37.709> able<00:02:37.890> to

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
construction we're able to

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.510 
construction we're able to
simultaneously<00:02:39.690> use<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> larger<00:02:41.160> horn<00:02:42.290> law

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
simultaneously use a larger horn law

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.830 
simultaneously use a larger horn law
reducing<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.910> vertical<00:02:45.390> height<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.630> the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
reducing the vertical height of the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.420 
reducing the vertical height of the
loudspeaker<00:02:46.380> because<00:02:46.620> as<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:46.980> can<00:02:47.130> see

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
loudspeaker because as you can see

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.760 
loudspeaker because as you can see
they're<00:02:48.090> actually<00:02:48.600> overlapped<00:02:49.230> here<00:02:49.590> and

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
they're actually overlapped here and

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.009 
they're actually overlapped here and
this<00:02:50.280> provides<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.910> really<00:02:51.420> really<00:02:51.690> unique

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
this provides a really really unique

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.590 
this provides a really really unique
opportunity<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.709> not<00:02:53.130> only<00:02:53.430> be<00:02:53.760> able<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:54.000> use<00:02:54.120> a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
opportunity to not only be able to use a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.660 
opportunity to not only be able to use a
larger<00:02:55.380> horn<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:55.920> better<00:02:56.130> high-frequency

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
larger horn for better high-frequency

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.600 
larger horn for better high-frequency
pattern<00:02:57.390> control<00:02:57.810> while<00:02:58.680> reducing<00:02:59.070> the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
pattern control while reducing the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.259 
pattern control while reducing the
overall<00:02:59.880> box<00:03:00.239> height<00:03:00.570> but<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.470> produces<00:03:02.070> a

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
overall box height but this produces a

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.690 
overall box height but this produces a
really<00:03:03.269> unique<00:03:03.570> port<00:03:04.019> design<00:03:04.470> which<00:03:05.160> is<00:03:05.400> able

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
really unique port design which is able

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.490 
really unique port design which is able
to<00:03:05.820> reduce<00:03:06.090> port<00:03:06.480> noise<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.080> get<00:03:07.260> better

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
to reduce port noise and get better

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.740 
to reduce port noise and get better
efficiency<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.430> performance<00:03:08.730> out<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.360> the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
efficiency and performance out of the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.550 
efficiency and performance out of the
loudspeaker

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
loudspeaker

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.460

so<00:03:11.030> SST<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.300> actually<00:03:12.810> more<00:03:13.110> than<00:03:13.410> just

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
so SST is actually more than just

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.280 
so SST is actually more than just
aligning<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.670> components<00:03:15.300> it's<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.989> overall

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
aligning the components it's the overall

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.770 
aligning the components it's the overall
box<00:03:16.650> construction<00:03:17.340> how<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.820> high<00:03:18.150> frequency

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
box construction how the high frequency

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.170 
box construction how the high frequency
and<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.650> low<00:03:19.680> frequency<00:03:20.370> interact<00:03:20.820> with<00:03:21.060> each

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
and the low frequency interact with each

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.360 
and the low frequency interact with each
other<00:03:21.420> how<00:03:22.079> we're<00:03:22.440> able<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.769> deal<00:03:23.070> with<00:03:23.280> the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
other how we're able to deal with the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.280 
other how we're able to deal with the
physical<00:03:23.790> dimensions<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.510> Box<00:03:24.780> how<00:03:25.110> we're

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
physical dimensions of the Box how we're

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.350 
physical dimensions of the Box how we're
able<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.680> get<00:03:25.860> better<00:03:26.519> high<00:03:26.790> frequency
