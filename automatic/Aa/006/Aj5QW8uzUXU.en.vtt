secret playlist for a few months now and

secret playlist for a few months now and
I've<00:00:22.410> kind<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.890> told<00:00:23.070> myself<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.670> when<00:00:24.150> my

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
I've kind of told myself that when my

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.670 
I've kind of told myself that when my
hair<00:00:24.449> gets<00:00:24.570> longer<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
hair gets longer this is one of the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.070 
hair gets longer this is one of the
first<00:00:25.890> ones<00:00:26.220> i'll<00:00:26.400> try<00:00:26.640> out<00:00:26.789> but<00:00:27.539> i<00:00:27.599> was

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
first ones i'll try out but i was

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.900 
first ones i'll try out but i was
looking<00:00:28.349> at<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.680> other<00:00:28.710> night<00:00:29.070> again<00:00:29.580> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
looking at it the other night again and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.990 
looking at it the other night again and
i<00:00:30.390> think<00:00:30.689> i<00:00:30.779> found<00:00:30.810> out<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.260> way<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:32.160> shorter

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
i think i found out a way that shorter

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.389 
i think i found out a way that shorter
to<00:00:33.239> medium<00:00:33.630> length<00:00:33.870> hair<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.739> work<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.219> it's

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
to medium length hair can work with it's

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.370 
to medium length hair can work with it's
just<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.910> French<00:00:36.210> braid<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:36.930> pinned<00:00:37.200> up

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
just a French braid and it's pinned up

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.010 
just a French braid and it's pinned up
in<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.680> sort<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.160> specific<00:00:38.760> way<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.809> I'm

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
in a sort of specific way but I'm

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.869 
in a sort of specific way but I'm
thinking<00:00:40.770> about<00:00:40.800> braids<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.610> they<00:00:41.700> eat

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
thinking about braids is that they eat

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.959 
thinking about braids is that they eat
up<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.180> lot<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.480> length<00:00:43.010> but<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.340> figured<00:00:44.760> out

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
up a lot of length but I figured out

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.970 
up a lot of length but I figured out
that<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.360> put<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> braids<00:00:46.289> lower<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
that if you put the braids lower on the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.220 
that if you put the braids lower on the
neck<00:00:47.219> less<00:00:47.910> hair<00:00:48.180> gets<00:00:48.450> eaten<00:00:48.690> up<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
neck less hair gets eaten up in the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.500 
neck less hair gets eaten up in the
braid<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.520> more<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.000> pin<00:00:51.239> up

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
braid and then you have more to pin up

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.779 
braid and then you have more to pin up
so<00:00:52.050> i'll<00:00:52.110> show<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.350> what<00:00:52.530> i<00:00:52.590> mean<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.399> um<00:00:53.579> you

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
hair up off of your neck if you're

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.250 
hair up off of your neck if you're

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
a blessed length now when you add

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.039 
a blessed length now when you add
sections<00:01:29.430> into<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> normal<00:01:30.090> french<00:01:30.570> braid<00:01:30.869> you

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
sections into a normal french braid you

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.200 
sections into a normal french braid you
usually<00:01:31.229> take<00:01:31.590> smaller<00:01:31.979> sections<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
usually take smaller sections and the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.999 
usually take smaller sections and the
smaller<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.750> sections<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> more<00:01:34.590> detail

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
smaller the sections the more detail

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.130 
smaller the sections the more detail
there<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> actual<00:01:35.939> braid<00:01:36.299> right<00:01:36.570> well

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
there is in the actual braid right well

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.810 
there is in the actual braid right well
for<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.799> you're<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.250> only<00:01:38.460> take

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
for this one you're going to only take

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.690 
for this one you're going to only take
like<00:01:39.079> maybe<00:01:40.079> three<00:01:40.439> or<00:01:40.470> four<00:01:40.979> sections<00:01:41.460> at

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
like maybe three or four sections at

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.120 
like maybe three or four sections at
most<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:42.990> really<00:01:43.290> big<00:01:43.500> because

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
most they have to be really big because

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.590 
most they have to be really big because
you're<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.430> really<00:01:44.549> focusing<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> French

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
you're not really focusing on the French

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.080 
you're not really focusing on the French
braid<00:01:45.899> part<00:01:46.290> kind<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.340> creating<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.850> base

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
braid part kind of just creating a base

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.270 
braid part kind of just creating a base
for<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.540> next<00:01:48.810> step<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.590> I'll<00:01:49.950> show<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.189> what

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
for the next step so I'll show you what

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:04.470 
for the next step so I'll show you what
I<00:01:50.369> mean<00:01:50.399> got<00:01:51.030> my<00:01:51.119> three<00:01:51.299> sections

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.480 

so<00:02:04.960> now<00:02:05.170> I'm<00:02:05.290> going<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.500> add<00:02:05.620> a<00:02:05.650> pretty<00:02:06.130> big

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
so now I'm going to add a pretty big

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:33.110 
so now I'm going to add a pretty big
chunk

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.330 

so<00:02:33.629> that's<00:02:33.840> been<00:02:33.989> two<00:02:34.230> passes<00:02:34.769> i<00:02:34.890> think<00:02:35.099> i'm<00:02:35.250> a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
so that's been two passes i think i'm a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.330 
so that's been two passes i think i'm a
little<00:02:35.909> hair<00:02:36.239> left<00:02:36.450> for<00:02:36.840> three<00:02:37.170> Heather<00:02:38.040> did

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
for add-ins I only did three but

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.000 
for add-ins I only did three but

Heather<00:02:57.780> did<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.170> unfortunately<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.010> just<00:02:59.340> my

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
Heather did it unfortunately I just my

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.580 
Heather did it unfortunately I just my
hands<00:03:00.000> make<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.510> braid<00:03:00.690> really<00:03:01.019> super<00:03:01.349> tight

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
hands make the braid really super tight

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.399 
hands make the braid really super tight
so<00:03:02.280> at<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.549> end<00:03:02.579> you<00:03:03.030> can<00:03:03.209> loosen<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.629> but<00:03:03.810> you

so at the end you can loosen it but you
need<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.739> grain<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.099> be<00:03:05.250> somewhat<00:03:05.640> loose<00:03:05.819> so

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
need the grain to be somewhat loose so

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.580 
need the grain to be somewhat loose so
it's<00:03:06.090> up<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.569> could<00:03:06.720> bring<00:03:06.930> loosely<00:03:07.440> where
