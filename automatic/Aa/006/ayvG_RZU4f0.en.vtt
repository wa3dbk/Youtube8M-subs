back this way to go out to the tip and

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.500 
back this way to go out to the tip and
you<00:01:15.550> can<00:01:15.670> see<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.910> catalytic<00:01:16.420> converter

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
you can see the catalytic converter

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.780 
you can see the catalytic converter
there<00:01:17.050> and<00:01:17.320> there<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.310> there's<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.610> first

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
there and there and there's the first

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.780 
there and there and there's the first
cat<00:01:19.120> and<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:20.170> second<00:01:20.590> cat<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:20.920> it's<00:01:21.070> almost<00:01:21.400> a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
cat and the second cat so it's almost a

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.780 
cat and the second cat so it's almost a
full<00:01:22.420> 12<00:01:23.320> inches<00:01:23.620> long<00:01:23.680> as<00:01:23.980> of<00:01:24.100> cats<00:01:24.340> it<00:01:24.580> looks

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
full 12 inches long as of cats it looks

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.520 
full 12 inches long as of cats it looks
like<00:01:24.970> Ben<00:01:25.210> Hur<00:01:25.420> his<00:01:25.540> helmet<00:01:25.930> in<00:01:26.020> there<00:01:26.170> and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
like Ben Hur his helmet in there and

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.440 
like Ben Hur his helmet in there and
that's<00:01:27.040> very<00:01:27.250> difficult<00:01:27.460> for<00:01:27.790> exhaust<00:01:28.210> flow

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
that's very difficult for exhaust flow

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.680 
that's very difficult for exhaust flow

unbalanced breathing through the dual
mass<00:01:50.890> airflow<00:01:51.220> sensors<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:54.520> that's

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
mass airflow sensors and but that's

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.820 
mass airflow sensors and but that's
factory<00:01:55.180> so<00:01:55.360> they<00:01:55.390> get<00:01:55.960> made<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.260> good<00:01:56.440> product

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.920 

for<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.890> twin<00:02:00.760> turbos<00:02:01.119> from<00:02:02.080> faff<00:02:02.290> speed<00:02:02.909> as

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
for the twin turbos from faff speed as

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.870 
for the twin turbos from faff speed as
you<00:02:04.930> can<00:02:05.260> see<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:06.010> almost<00:02:06.130> looks<00:02:06.490> like<00:02:06.580> a

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
you can see it almost looks like a

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.509 
you can see it almost looks like a
factory<00:02:07.420> racecar<00:02:08.049> back<00:02:08.229> in<00:02:08.409> the<00:02:08.530> 80s<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.310> is

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
factory racecar back in the 80s this is

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.880 
factory racecar back in the 80s this is
dual<00:02:09.869> cone<00:02:10.869> filters<00:02:11.319> but<00:02:11.560> they<00:02:11.680> have<00:02:11.860> a

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
dual cone filters but they have a

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.530 
dual cone filters but they have a
velocity<00:02:12.489> stack<00:02:12.760> in<00:02:12.969> here<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.329> it<00:02:13.389> hooks

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
velocity stack in here and it hooks

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.839 
velocity stack in here and it hooks
right<00:02:13.659> up<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.109> mass<00:02:14.260> airflow<00:02:14.529> sensors<00:02:15.129> we

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
right up to the mass airflow sensors we

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.610 
right up to the mass airflow sensors we
did<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.090> lot<00:02:16.329> of<00:02:16.510> testing

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
did a lot of testing

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.830 
did a lot of testing
with<00:02:17.860> air<00:02:18.250> intake<00:02:18.640> tents<00:02:18.910> before<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.510> after

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
with air intake tents before and after

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.170 
with air intake tents before and after
and<00:02:20.230> this<00:02:20.349> absolutely<00:02:20.590> keeps<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.760> air<00:02:21.879> cold

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
and this absolutely keeps the air cold

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.660 
and this absolutely keeps the air cold
and<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.480> reason<00:02:22.810> why<00:02:22.930> does<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.319> is<00:02:23.739> these

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
and the reason why does that is these

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.040 
and the reason why does that is these
two<00:02:24.940> air<00:02:25.209> inlet<00:02:25.569> ducts

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
two air inlet ducts

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.800 
two air inlet ducts
sit<00:02:26.709> burt<00:02:27.250> right<00:02:27.580> on<00:02:27.760> top<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.030> those<00:02:28.269> mufflers

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
sit burt right on top of those mufflers

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.990 
sit burt right on top of those mufflers
so<00:02:29.440> when<00:02:29.590> this<00:02:29.680> thing<00:02:29.739> goes<00:02:30.010> up<00:02:30.069> at<00:02:30.400> all<00:02:30.550> cold

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
so when this thing goes up at all cold

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.119 
so when this thing goes up at all cold
air<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.390> hitting<00:02:31.599> right<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.650> top<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:33.040> those

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
air is hitting right to the top of those

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.539 
air is hitting right to the top of those
muffled<00:02:33.580> but<00:02:33.819> to<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.870> cone<00:02:35.080> filters<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.950> when

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
muffled but to the cone filters and when

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.520 
muffled but to the cone filters and when
you're<00:02:36.670> stuck<00:02:36.879> in<00:02:37.030> traffic<00:02:37.060> or<00:02:37.599> whatever<00:02:37.720> this

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
you're stuck in traffic or whatever this

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.979 
you're stuck in traffic or whatever this
fan<00:02:38.860> blows<00:02:39.250> air<00:02:39.519> down<00:02:40.060> in<00:02:40.330> here<00:02:40.569> so<00:02:40.840> it

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
fan blows air down in here so it

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.869 
fan blows air down in here so it
completely<00:02:41.530> fills<00:02:41.950> this<00:02:42.129> compartment<00:02:42.580> with

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
completely fills this compartment with

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.570 
completely fills this compartment with
cold<00:02:43.180> air<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.709> carbon<00:02:45.190> fiber<00:02:45.430> a

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
cold air and this is a carbon fiber a

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.460 
cold air and this is a carbon fiber a

real carbon fiber heat shield it also

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.020 
real carbon fiber heat shield it also
makes<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:47.920> look<00:02:48.069> pretty<00:02:48.099> but<00:02:48.489> it's<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.910> air

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
makes it look pretty but it's the air

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.870 
makes it look pretty but it's the air
stays<00:02:49.360> cold<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:50.310> true<00:02:51.310> under<00:02:51.610> all<00:02:51.730> conditions
