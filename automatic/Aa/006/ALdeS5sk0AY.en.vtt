00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:14.219
 bern leads after eight games with 22 to 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.830
 14 is still a good one 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.380
 piece of the victory at beat the best of 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.699
 first pad removed for that needs 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.250
 you get 34 points 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.930
 and neither the warm nor the can 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.570
 already create with the next game 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.099
 the next game is big or small 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.759
 we'll put you both right now 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.640
 each a bowl of balls in front 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:38.460
 in it are both the old 38 mm balls 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.739
 as well as the 9 40 mm shaft in total 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.899
 It's eleven balls and your task is 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.430
 find out how many of them 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.430
 small and how many of the big ones 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.500
 are blindfolded in it 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.620
 Do you have these shapely and fashionable 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.940
 Glasses already on the forehead with 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.739
 blindfold otherwise that would be the whole 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.660
 of course a bit too easy and 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.910
 we have this wave for the audience 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.480
 colored so they know too 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.769
 and guessing can do something 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.020
 you can still do it you are allowed the balls 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.880
 Take the hand you recognize 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.530
 You must not put her on the table 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.270
 She is not allowed anywhere on the body 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.340
 you can not pinch her in the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.140
 take mouth or similar you must in 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.869
 the bowl will stay if a ball 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.869
 unintentionally from colat while fumbling 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.960
 then we will use it again 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:30.780
 understand everything then set yourselves 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.070
 great eyewear on thank you and 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.770
 I'm assuming that the whole 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.520
 Now it's really tight 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.890
 not that I once again provided 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.079
 I meet and then I'm allowed around the bowl 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.970
 ask with the balls 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.350
 there is no time limit who believes 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.189
 not yet intervene yet 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.649
 intervention 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.409
 there is no time limit who believes 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.700
 that he says the solution hard stop then 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.590
 the other one will please continue immediately 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.439
 and then we want to have a solution 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.979
 We got the right solution 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.840
 point and who says a wrong solution 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.509
 the point goes to the opponent we play 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.970
 a total of five passages three needs 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.979
 So you both win everything 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:28.110
 Roger that 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:30.030
 then the game starts for the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.900
 spectator the note the oranges 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:40.260
 Balls are the small 38 millimeters 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:43.170
 balls are right and the whites are white 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.560
 the current wave with it theoretically 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:51.540
 press No, please do not push 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.620
 do not mark or know anything like that 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.620
 That's because they draw at the draw 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.780
 in which ball did you have at all 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.780
 already in hand 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.920
 do you already have any? 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.620
 difference bernd bernd them for you 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.370
 all the same I'm just before the goal 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:28.370
 just before the goal 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:29.690
 no, it has all the balls in it now 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.520
 hand that also a very interesting one 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.930
 Variant I wonder what he is doing now 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.430
 feels and feels at all 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.930
 and i think you can use the tactics of 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:50.540
 already recognize a bit 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:51.950
 I hope you will always recognize that 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.680
 curious when the first stop here 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:00.050
 signal comes stop i say 3 less 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.050
 and that's exactly right and you have 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.440
 the important three balls in the left 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.390
 hand it was a tactic okay good us 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.890
 exchange course the bowls make out 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.780
 a new mix you can put off 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.790
 you want to be able to do that for a moment 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.250
 look at 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:25.250
 that was very good and look okay 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:29.510
 now have the turn or not her 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.160
 both have the same just right 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.400
 so then i may order the new bowl 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.400
 ask 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.419
 So please put the glasses on first 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:44.650
 thank you to the direction and thank you 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:46.240
 now the balls will be us 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.740
 do not touch it yet 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.820
 you are both ready you know that 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.440
 play in the meantime and go 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.800
 now we also know which tactics the 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.419
 bern to follow could see if he 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.419
 now stalks a little closer here 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:33.770
 an idea that's an idea okay fine 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.480
 that you have an idea for one 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.230
 I will not give any hints here 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.230
 is correct and what is not 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:47.520
 stocker stops bale 55 is correct 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.530
 right and also this point goes on 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.870
 this is the next passage 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.930
 then there's a matchball for this one 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.250
 play in any case and you leave the 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.600
 just have glasses on then we have no 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.370
 problem that you have something here her 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.660
 just leave the glasses so the sony 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.950
 wanted to have a look and see them 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.660
 look at liquid rheinberg's good 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.080
 put glasses on then you see the 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.800
 next bowl please the glasses 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.600
 I can sit down for the next one 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.360
 provide pictures or 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:23.430
 get the bowls off us first 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:27.650
 prepare the next mix 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.650
 Of course we will not tell you 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.880
 10 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.190
 so if I win 1 if you 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.840
 win is that is correct 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.840
 you are already and go 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.320
 So I have the feeling that somehow 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:56.020
 the bernd is so the turn out has 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:07:02.200
 to somehow recognize the wave too 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:05.250
 on a good way but something goal and 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.250
 haphazard i have the feeling 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:20.220
 and what is an answer four big me 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.960
 would like to know how many are small 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.759
 four equal to seven that is correct and 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.550
 With this you win this game completely 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:31.060
 clearly with 3 to 0 and get that way 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.620
 had you do that while the 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.030
 Somehow I had a trick now 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:42.780
 have somehow the feeling that has 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:42.780
 Small ones are hard on expressing problems 

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:57.819
 there are nine points and that's it 

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.729
 31 to 14 

00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:03.310
 for Bernd then in the next game 

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:05.620
 can make a lot of points and one 

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:09.389
 matchball game has in the next game 

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.389
 and that means transport soon
