00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.270
 the shaft was asked the last 12 days in Kazan 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.670
 held the Universiade which took 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.830
 participation of 13 thousand student athletes 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.570
 from more than 160 countries 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.860
 competed in record numbers 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.830
 sports 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.929
 351 medals were played in total 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.989
 more than the London Olympics 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:22.849
 last year and this is also a record for all 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:25.039
 dozens of games watched the world 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.929
 million viewers according to Russian estimates 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.089
 since the spectacular opening ceremony 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.029
 at the stadium of Kazan Arena by 45 thousand 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.160
 places that you see behind my back 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.469
 over 700 thousand viewers visited these 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.390
 competitions so they became 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.239
 one of the largest ever 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.949
 Universiade organizers of the very beginning 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.690
 argued that the Universiade is 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.329
 dress rehearsal before winter 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.550
 olympic games one of its main 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.260
 objectives to identify weaknesses in the organization and 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.989
 consider them when conducting the Olympiad 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.539
 Sochi next year Russia is 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.300
 in the medal standings at the absolute leader 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.550
 today in her piggy bank more 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.769
 150 gold medals Russia leads with 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.570
 a huge margin therefore she is accused 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.490
 politicization of the competition with the aim of 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.230
 enhance your sporting reputation in 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.870
 the run-up to important sporting events 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.880
 Russia is also criticized for the coming years. 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.380
 the fact that its representatives at the Universiade 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.540
 are professional athletes 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.760
 unlike fans from other countries 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.590
 however international federation 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.720
 student sports who oversees 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.510
 these games checked all participants on 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.710
 compliance with established requirements 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.270
 Russia acts in accordance with 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.730
 rules that apply to all 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.470
 countries and as stated in composition 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.510
 Russian team less than ten 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.060
 percent of professional athletes 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.770
 another reason for criticism is the amount 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.930
 money spent on the organization 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.310
 Universiade at the beginning of the games of Russia 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.710
 rated them four and a half 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.480
 billion dollars however the organizers 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.610
 claim that it is not just a one-time 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.500
 payment for 12 day and party 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.970
 long-term investment in the future 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.010
 Russian sports 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.500
 as well as to Kazan, which for the last 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.720
 five years it has changed a lot and 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.240
 new transport networks of the new hotel 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.650
 and new campus and 30 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.780
 new sports facilities 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.690
 one resident told me that by comparison 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.000
 with kazan five years ago, then it was 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.000
 decided to hold a universiade 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.190
 the city has changed beyond recognition now 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.020
 everyone is waiting for the closing ceremony which 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.120
 will take place tonight at the stadium 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.950
 what is behind my back at this ceremony 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.690
 which will visit the Russian 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.360
 Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.310
 the relay will be handed over to south korea where 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.310
