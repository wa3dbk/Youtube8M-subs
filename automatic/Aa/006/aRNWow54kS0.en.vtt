00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.670
 Fernanda Alonso begins here 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.830
 collection the first world exhibition 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.259
 of Fernando Alonso and here the pilot of 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.599
 Formula 1 shows us where his 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.279
 dream where it all started here we have the 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.289
 first kart of Fernando Alonso that 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.720
 he built his father Jose Luis for his 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.519
 sister lorena but that was finally 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.739
 fernando alonso own which 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.110
 enjoyed this kart this first part of 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.330
 the exposure kilometer 0 shows those 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.730
 first cars the first illusions and 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.119
 Fernando's dreams that would end later 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.530
 on a world podium and that as it tells us 

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:47.720
 the own Fernando Alonso in some of 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.239
 the writings we find around here never 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.330
 I could think that the dream would come so 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.330
 far 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.500
 the truth is that it is a pass 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.769
 you do not see it there how is it possible that a 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.050
 boy so tiny and take those those 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:07.070
 expensive that the truth is that they are tremendous 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.880
 they are quite powerful and son of the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.420
 TV 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.799
 you'll know that the kid promised a lot 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.399
 I think a lot of people do not know 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.950
 many things about him and we go I think that 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.930
 it's fantastic that people see this is 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.070
 great the truth because you always notice 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.780
 in the last part of the stage of 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.490
 fernando in recent years in ferrari 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.069
 and you do not realize that behind 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.920
 a lot of work I'm quite a mythomaniac 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.720
 Alonso is one of my myths by merit 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.479
 that has and above all in order any 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.060
 so competitive and elitist world 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.950
 such as Formula 1 exit where it has 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.679
 left him with his origins because he 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.840
 has a special merit because with 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.549
 four years already ran with vicar me 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.549
 it seems something exceptional really 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.400
 well we have come to a part of the 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.560
 exhibition that I think is dedicated 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.930
 to the lovers of the data of the formula 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.070
 1 and the tables are so special 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.500
 that we have here that are called 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.560
 halo circuit and where we can find 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.480
 good no doubt if you say in 2007 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.640
 what teammates had 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.650
 Fernando Alonso on which team he was 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.110
 Well, all the data we have 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.120

 photos of the case he wore also in 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.840
 Monaco interviews with the press in the 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.049
 that you see your tattoo that tattoo that 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.150
 always look for graphic reporters 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.109
 to show here is the tattoo this 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.109
 It is the samurai tattoo 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.250
 excited you remember that stage in the 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.870
 that you started to follow Formula 1 and you 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.580
 you realize how much has happened 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.050
 that in the time that in the end we do not 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.730
 we realize but it has been missing many 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.430
 years of those world titles of those 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.710
 cups that are back here and there is a desire 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.500
 that is another title not the truth that 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.540
 era is fantastic and then the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.450
 travel with all the details with 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:28.040
 all the trophies good amazing had 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:30.690
 I read a lot of things about my turn and 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.330
 especially the interest of seeing the cars 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.040
 of 20 centimeters thing that you do not have 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.630
 possibilities and those here is not 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.540
 exciting the truth is that as 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.250
 Asturian and as a Spaniard I feel very 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.110
 proud and very satisfied with power 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.969
 visiting this is a matter that is very 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.119
 recommendable 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:50.610
 is the best way to bring the sport closer 

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:52.649
 to the fans a sport that is at 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.209
 reach of few people is quite 

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:57.889
 expensive to go to a circuit and it costs a lot 

00:04:54.209 --> 00:05:00.590
 I think I think it 's important 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.469
 supporting this and of course seeing all 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.199
 the trajectory of one of our 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:08.680
 Spain elite athletes' 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.330
 I think it's good about this state 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.870
 reaching where he arrived is still 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.819
 a simple person very close to all 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.039
 and therefore I think that is very 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.360
 also very worth seeing the video that 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.789
 recorded Fernando Alonso for this 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.979
 exhibition is an example for a lot 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.020
 of values ​​in this society that good is 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:30.319
 that it would be great if it were a 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.610
 example and it seems perfect but good 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.439
 Fernando Alonso is very big 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.259
 too big not all 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:38.000
 athletes may have something like this this 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.060
 It has been our walk through the first 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.580
 world exhibition of fernando alonso 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.469

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.590
 personal objects of the formula driver 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:52.419
 One is waiting for you here in Madrid in 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.419
 art channel exhibition center
