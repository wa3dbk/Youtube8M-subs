00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.820
 Fall 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.819
 2357 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.229
 It is a book 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:16.480
 I have not won 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.179
 I have a foreign language 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.259
 Above all, saying that business is cheap 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.230
 You have no experience 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.230
 If not 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:29.640
 Japanese laughter 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.880
 It seems that it has become a variety of reasons for the first time a branch 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.880
 It feels like an anxious person 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.200
 I am really strong or not interested in the acquaintance 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.490
 Active 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.220
 It is called the best 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.260
 That 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.550
 I think it is okay as the way of May 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.780
 Yeah I'm supposed from around 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.760
 It should be done because we are proposing 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.760
 That's why I want to drink a cup like that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.620
 free entrance 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.680
 No bit rate 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.170
 I can not drink alcohol 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.010
 not really 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.010
 Stress release and good throw 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.850
 City is then 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.710
 What is it 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.710
 It seems to be in the foreground or one 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.250
 Once in a hand and now I will 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.410
 Can I still drop out 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.510
 I agree 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.960
 Add-on book 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.990
 Returning to the blackboard 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.630
 Northern 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.630
 100 It is the top priority to think so 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.660
 Oh yes 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.160
 Yes 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.439
 Recently 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.340
 1 will be lost, so 3 so far 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.350
 For example 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.420
 I just think it's interesting 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.430
 I thought it was interesting 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.430
 8th blue line is out 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 I decided to go ahead that day 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.470
 15 hours on average 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.780
 It is said that we can do it once by the next medium hard Aoki 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.089
 This work is 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.319
 Great stress in me 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.319
 1110 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.150
 Where I am angry 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.129
 Goal in second place 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.929
 Internet and Ando 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:24.929
 I was busy 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.929
 The 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.639
 But 8 items 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.639
 Use beef from Shikoku 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.879
 It is station yard activation 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.299
 Return to Germany 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.249
 Since both foreign and diplomatic sports entered, please 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:49.989
 There is a lot of support
