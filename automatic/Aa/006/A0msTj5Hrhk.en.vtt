00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.330
 since we have our folded sheets 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.820
 now what are we going to do? 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.980
 our silicone 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.980
 and put on the shores 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.130
 it's a little 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.859
 we grab other leaves 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.500
 and the enzyme more 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.500
 that is the same as below 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.440
 and we wait a bit to dry 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.589
 since we have all our leaves 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.100
 joined to the one we're going to be taking 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:52.480
 the stockings here and here in Miami from 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.660
 16 13 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.890
 I 'm just going to climb 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:03.280
 let's make a strip 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.879
 for example without mine here measures 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.879
 16 x 13 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.470
 let's go now 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:25.620
 to measure what I'm doing here, for example 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.490
 it measures two centimeters then I 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.490
 I'm going to put about ten centimeters 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.119
 8 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.149
 10 centimeters and I'm going to put a little 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.149
 more than height 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.659
 this 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.150
 about 4 centimeters more 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.280
 then my measurements would be 20 feet and 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.190
 16 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:25.600
 and on another card or in the same color 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.600
 I'm going to make a 13 x 13 unit 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.349
 and I'm going to put the same 20 centimeters 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.219
 I'm going to do like that and I'm going to cut them 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.860
 since we do not have cropped we are going to 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.520
 bend in 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.960
 two 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.960
 by the marked lines 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.560
 and in the 13 x 13 cube 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.770
 what would I be active 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.750
 I left about 3 centimeters 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.770
 and there 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.870
 I'm going to paste this piece 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:37.650
 in the longest part that will be 1000 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.650
 meters I'm going to hit it like this 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.060
 ah 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.990
 once we have already pasted it, we are going to 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.480
 grab our leaves and we're going to 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.560
 put the silicone to the last needle that 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.560
 we did not put the one on top 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:28.660
 and let us strike up 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:31.510
 the big picture of this feeling 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.140
 since we have our sheets attached to 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.820
 the short unit let's do two things 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.730
 paste this part here or leave it open 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.410
 I'm going to leave it open because this 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.780
 you can get to expand a little more 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.480
 It depends on the letters you have 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.170
 and now what are we going to do would sheathe 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.170
 the joyce 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.810
 that is already the creativity of each one and 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.260
 now let's put the velcro 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.050
 in the part of the lid closing this 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.330
 would be the longest stage we are going to 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.560
 put the first 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.560
 a little nothing more 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.139
 with a little silicone 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.480
 to 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.249
 and we are going to put it approximately as 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.929
 around here in the middle 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:45.929
 more focused than you can 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.070
 and now we put some silicon in 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.070
 this side 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.230
 and we see more or less how high it 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.230
 we want 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:16.110
 so I want it like here 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.110
 and wait for it to dry for a while 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.860
 Well, that's how we would stay 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:26.360
 I remember a little this velcros when 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.360
 There is a little English 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.440
 and already put a little card 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:44.610
 and as I say it is going to expand more 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:47.180
 so that's why I'm left with the size 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:51.450
 What I put 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:54.060
 because it looks very spaced here is for 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:57.720
 large or long cards or photos like 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.210
 to long then I hope you like the 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:05.090
 tutorial do not forget to like
