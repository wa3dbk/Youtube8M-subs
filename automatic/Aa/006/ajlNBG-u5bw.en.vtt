00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.539 
I'll pretty sure I swore something
similar<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.810> before<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> past<00:01:16.710> maybe

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
similar to this before in the past maybe

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.520 
similar to this before in the past maybe
a<00:01:17.729> darker<00:01:18.420> blue<00:01:18.540> color<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.080> I'm<00:01:19.170> sure<00:01:19.350> he's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
a darker blue color but I'm sure he's

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.350 
a darker blue color but I'm sure he's
wore<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> blue<00:01:20.070> attire<00:01:20.369> before<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> past

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
wore a blue attire before in the past

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.660 
wore a blue attire before in the past
and<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.439> looks<00:01:22.590> good<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:23.009> something<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.520> he

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and it looks good it's something that he

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090 
and it looks good it's something that he
could<00:01:23.880> wear<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.619> it's<00:01:25.619> something<00:01:26.009> I

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
could wear and it's something I

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.859 
could wear and it's something I
appreciate<00:01:26.159> has<00:01:26.850> wore<00:01:27.090> something<00:01:27.299> similar<00:01:27.840> to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
appreciate has wore something similar to

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.690 
appreciate has wore something similar to
before<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> past<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.369> know<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.610> you

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
before in the past so you know if you

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.020 
before in the past so you know if you
wanted<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.270> realistic<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.530> either

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
wanted to get that realistic it either

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.969 
wanted to get that realistic it either
then<00:01:33.030> make<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.780> one<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.740> is

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
then make this one because this is

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.260 
then make this one because this is
similar<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.369> something<00:01:35.640> he's<00:01:35.850> won<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> prize

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
similar to something he's won the prize

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.240 
similar to something he's won the prize
for<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:36.570> sure<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.040> blue<00:01:38.220> one

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
for I'm sure but I like that blue one

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.770 
for I'm sure but I like that blue one
then<00:01:38.549> finally<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.210> yellow<00:01:39.540> one

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
then finally we have this yellow one

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.710 
then finally we have this yellow one
it's<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:41.189> an<00:01:41.340> inverse<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> time<00:01:42.180> because<00:01:42.509> all

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
it's like an inverse a time because all
