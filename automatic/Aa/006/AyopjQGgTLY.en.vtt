00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello friends with you diamond and 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.280
 today i would like to tell you my 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.240
 assumptions and theories about the bite 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.969
 80 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.400
 one theory sounds so that someone 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.680
 one girl had a birthday 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.140
 she decided to sell it in a pizzeria with 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.410
 friends girl really wanted to see 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.539
 semolina but mangle was nowhere instead 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.210
 brazier girl saw fox she 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.730
 got mad and hit him because of that 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.430
 Foxy bit off and the frontal lobe of the head 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.190
 but if you think that foxy couldnâ€™t 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.950
 the day will appear before the children because he 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.200
 was half disassembled lay in stock 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.450
 therefore, we can conclude that it was 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.969
 not fox then who could it be 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.160
 the theory of what it was Fox seemed 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.079
 very believable because it 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.930
 the only animatronics that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.840
 jaw strongly projecting forward from but 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.660
 Bonnie such a jaw was not the same as 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.640
 Freud think puppet at all funny 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.250
 and we have a check 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.100
 here that comes to mind when the check 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.950
 is in the room she has coleus a 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.979
 when she comes out of it so there is no livonia 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.520
 where could he go all of a sudden it has 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.909
 what is the relation to the bite 87 after all not 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.270
 just the same way she lost him and now i'm 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.159
 would like to give you my assumptions 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.189
 it can be assumed that foxy is still 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.009
 repaired but still could be water day 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.710
 in the pizzeria and take a bite 87 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.869
 see from the first part we remember that on 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.470
 a plate appears with the backstage 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.909
 inscription 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.729
 sorry not work but sometimes seen 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.100
 nameplate its my what it means is me this 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.740
 the plate appears rarely and mostly 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.200
 only when the wings open 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.080
 and the fox appears as if making it clear 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.050
 what is he doing this 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.420
 taste maybe it really was a fox 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.480
 because his jaws come out i mean 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.730
 most likely it was weakened after being bitten 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.740
 security reasons but also possible 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.410
 suggest that bite 87 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.840
 I could do it because she has 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.480
 as well as in acute fox zoom 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.150
 and also if you slow down the sound which is 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.020
 this manga with 3 part smile false 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.600
 words and I appreciate it by saying something myself 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.750
 it was she who took this bite 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.330
 But in general, I saw pictures where 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.330
 mangle and foxy together and pretty 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.170
 many on some of them they are depicted 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.870
 hugging 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.630
 on others they kiss and on some 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.330
 Mongolian fox are depicted on the background of hearts 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.850
 which means that there is a version that 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.140
 Mongolian fox in love with each other 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.420
 so 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.720
 foxy in pirate bay with a sign it's 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.840
 my takes the blame for the bite and manga 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.980
 slow sound also makes words 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.440
 children so he take the blame these 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.480
 words they remove suspicion friend 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.570
 friend, respectively, the circle of suspects 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.670
 we have reduced to two animatronics 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.030
 exactly mango and fox 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.400
 so which one of them attacked bite 87 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.050
 if you have your own assumptions 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.880
 about bite 87 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.160
 be sure to write about them in 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.010
 comments we may have 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.940
 new versions of who could have done 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.040
 bite 87 is all friends put
