at this point what you want to do is put

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.749 
at this point what you want to do is put
in<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.770> 1/2<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.159> gallon<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.780> milk<00:01:27.780> remember

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
in this is 1/2 a gallon of milk remember

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.819 
in this is 1/2 a gallon of milk remember
so<00:01:29.759> I'm<00:01:29.909> going<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.119> put<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.420> about<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.720> cup<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.290> my

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
so I'm going to put in about a cup of my

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.780 
so I'm going to put in about a cup of my
previous<00:01:32.100> yogurt<00:01:32.759> mixture<00:01:33.680> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.710> use<00:01:35.369> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
previous yogurt mixture you can use a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.300 
previous yogurt mixture you can use a
store-bought<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.630> would<00:01:37.560> avoid<00:01:37.799> anything<00:01:38.100> that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
store-bought I would avoid anything that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.960 
store-bought I would avoid anything that
says<00:01:38.670> pectin<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.420> an<00:01:40.079> additive<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.799> there<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
says pectin as an additive in there and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.510 
says pectin as an additive in there and
of<00:01:42.210> course<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.570> has<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.899> say<00:01:43.079> live<00:01:43.590> cultures<00:01:44.159> in

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
of course it has to say live cultures in

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.639 
of course it has to say live cultures in
there<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.840> we're<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.259> ahead<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.530> put

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
there so we're going to go ahead and put

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.670 
there so we're going to go ahead and put
that<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.280> about<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.549> cup<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.409> can<00:01:49.409> see<00:01:49.560> how

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
that in it's about a cup you can see how

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.620 
that in it's about a cup you can see how
runny<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.520> was<00:01:50.700> made<00:01:50.880> with<00:01:51.060> 2%

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
runny it is and that was made with 2%

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.389 
runny it is and that was made with 2%
milk<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:55.439> I'm<00:01:55.530> going<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.710> go<00:01:55.860> ahead<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.219> give

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
milk so I'm going to go ahead and give

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.170 
milk so I'm going to go ahead and give
that<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.610> stir

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.200 

blend<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.329> in

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
blend it in

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.550 
blend it in
now<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.270> reason<00:02:03.630> why<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.810> want<00:02:04.080> to<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.410> it

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
now the reason why you want to have it

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.340 
now the reason why you want to have it
cooled<00:02:04.860> down<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.310> about<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.880> hundred<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.570> ten

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
cooled down to about a hundred and ten

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.600 
cooled down to about a hundred and ten
degrees<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:08.070> so<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.430> the<00:02:08.869> cultures<00:02:09.869> um<00:02:10.610> won't

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
degrees is so that the cultures um won't

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.490 
degrees is so that the cultures um won't
die<00:02:11.790> off<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.150> bacteria<00:02:12.630> won't<00:02:12.780> die<00:02:12.990> off<00:02:13.200> and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
die off the bacteria won't die off and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.520 
die off the bacteria won't die off and
they'll<00:02:13.890> be<00:02:14.190> able<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.580> multiply<00:02:15.290> also<00:02:16.290> at<00:02:16.410> this

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
they'll be able to multiply also at this

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.140 
they'll be able to multiply also at this
point<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.920> can<00:02:17.100> add<00:02:17.250> any<00:02:17.460> sweeteners<00:02:18.030> that

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
point you can add any sweeteners that

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.990 
point you can add any sweeteners that

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
in the towel and the reason why we're

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.510 
in the towel and the reason why we're
doing<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.720> because<00:03:06.900> we<00:03:07.290> want<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.250> cool

doing this is because we want it to cool

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.440 
doing this is because we want it to cool
slowly<00:03:09.330> so<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.050> bacteria<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.650> multiply<00:03:11.450> and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
slowly so the bacteria is multiply and

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.630 
slowly so the bacteria is multiply and
they<00:03:12.630> like<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:13.080> little<00:03:13.200> bit<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.440> warmth<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.040> as

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
they like a little bit of warmth and as

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.870 
they like a little bit of warmth and as
the<00:03:15.420> warmth<00:03:15.870> decreases<00:03:16.560> they're<00:03:16.880> multiplying

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
the warmth decreases they're multiplying

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.340 
the warmth decreases they're multiplying
kind<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.720> dies<00:03:19.020> down<00:03:20.270> so<00:03:21.270> I'm<00:03:21.720> going<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.200> go

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
kind of dies down so I'm going to go

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.449 
kind of dies down so I'm going to go
