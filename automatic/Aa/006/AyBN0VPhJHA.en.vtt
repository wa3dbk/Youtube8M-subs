00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.740
 the action generated strong chest 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.850
 I am a strong shot born in the pc in 2001 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.200
 and made considerable success 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.859
 which ensures a sequel in 2002 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.390
 bruno alves 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.489
 the balcony was here 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:30.800
 it's very violent 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.210
 both were competent shooting games and I'm going to give a civilian had a plot 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.380
 well tied looking around the amanda missionary 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.240
 the saints in the end is a complement to the package and not the 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.090
 contrary 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.780
 as unfortunately happens with the city and the third chapter 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.810
 are from a single company force 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.140
 in front of memorable first-person games launched at the end of the year 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.570
 as parents explained the source 4 is just a second line game 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.660
 the idea is that unlike previous ones 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.460
 was developed by a different producer 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.789
 maybe for this 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:11.970
 precipitate for creating an entirely new game 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.460
 without links to predecessors 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.050
 now comes on the scene 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.530
 the inexpressive the soldiers of fortune with the major 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.940
 and during a mission 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.720
 discover that he was betrayed by his contractor and decided to run the world 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.720
 to settle the bills 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.430
 history is a shallow mere pretext for violence 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.930
 dozens of books come up at any moment 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.340
 everywhere 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.360
 and each player used operational 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.320
 with various calibration and customization options for literally 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.630
 destroyed opposition 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.270
 as the intention is to kill people for example a live farm 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.730
 at the invitation of simplex how to destroy objects or put bombs in 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.279
 certain places 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.299
 so that more time for the killing 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.279
 some opponents offer a good degree of difficulty since 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.259
 positioned in points of low visibility 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:22.510
 ensuring a satisfactory challenge 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.129
 in times when the pace becomes more frenetic 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.259
 is a pure action game 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:33.289
 the thick tupi and that therefore runs the risk of appearing repetitive before 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.289
 other games with a more elaborate style of play 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.609
 who get excited enough to go to the end of single player mode 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.970
 it will not be enough time 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.349
 something that is common 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.930
 in first-person shooter games that are usually officially 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.990
 titles in early oblivion 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.449
 it's multiplayer mode 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:55.309
 will also be paid 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:59.029
 Ever since modes of catching flag are there 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:04.319
 uninspired and more exposed with the loss of much of the carnage 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.819
 presented at the opening men 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.579
 the owners of export 360 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.210
 still have some stimulus 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.509
 since most of the achievements are related to online actions 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:20.009
 but for this they will have to face light and three constant collections 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.310
 as the audio is not exactly memorable 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.889
 even linked to a set of trusts having 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.450
 and the charts were only average 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.469
 although there are good effects of light particles everything seems generic 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:36.589
 highlighting all that new year blood 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:38.760
 And believe me, they are 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.999
 in liters and more liters of red blood cells flying to all sides 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.520
 on the beginner or sing 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.930
 and at the same time fun trying to find out how much is possible 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.229
 massacre some poor-poor soldier opponent 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.339
 however over time 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.049
 everything turns out so free and forced 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.699
 What a comic idea? 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:03.939
 even to remember this afternoon made some of the worst versions we gave a 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:04.919
 little more 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.759
 with the victim being torn apart and in the midst of the blood cascades the 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.639
 five legs or three vertebral columns 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.780
 here we do not get to much but it is strange to be as easy as 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.370
 example 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.739
 if the ball with the arm of a real person 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.820
 it is also interesting to note that in times where video game violence 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.439
 once again created controversy 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:28.510
 with all that discussion around the press office 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.050
 one of two a game like pdt 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.759
 in which the gameplay totally revolves around the aggression then free 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.009
 would have gone unnoticed 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.419
 there are still technical problems 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.479
 serious taxi cab crashes that disappear textures and problems 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.330
 connection 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.950
 and although it is not an item 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.439
 take the brightness of the game presentation 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:52.460
 as well as many of his films 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.530
 I'm from the strong commitment deck 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.430
 It's a bureaucratic game. 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.180
 which does not count on the refinement of creativity of several of its 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.389
 competitors 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.240
 still able to amuse 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.630
 especially those who do not know the previous titles of the franchise 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.219
 who will be surprised by 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:12.370
 over the years and violence 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.620
 but linearity allied with the fat is not able to arrest fanatic players 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.720
 especially in a busy and busy season 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.720
 like that of 2007 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:57.309
