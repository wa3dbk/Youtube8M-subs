00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.879
 the problem is that the water as well as a month 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.599
 his killers and seven injured is the human being when they benefit from these 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.520
 amounts 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.669
 three Salvadoran runners 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.470
 and it's because of the critical state of the water that the salvador ballester will soon 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.880
 face the crisis 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.990
 we are the only country in Central America about to reach 13 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.100
 said this is about not having enough availability not only for 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.110
 future generations even for women 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.120
 strictly speaking the irp is one of the main sources that supply water 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.370
 and electrical energy Salvadorans 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.510
 and it is also one of the many polluted rivers in the national territory 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.630
 the attacks of the river lempa expense budget and even in his novels' the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.350
 cuate ' 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.600
 It is obvious that this cause was even more shocking and they are not capturing and it is also 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.610
 where we provide ourselves in greater measure of drinking water percent the great san 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.049
 savior and this means not only costs in terms of health that has 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:26.590
 an impact 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.580
 everything in order means also posted aranda that every time it costs more 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.320
 Making this water drinkable will mean more problems for irrigation 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.320
 there is very little water that this country is making use of reliably 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.750
 for irrigation this is a problem of all sectors 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.830
 institutions 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.710
 We are working to solve the problem that gets worse is in our 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.500
 country 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.030
 churches beyond the Salvadoran border 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.800
 the longest violin in Central America with an extension of 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.510
 almost 18 thousand square kilometers 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.409
 the headquarters of the txiki department 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.450
 guatemala where the benefits of coffee 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.179
 discard the honeys waters to river swans suitable treatment 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.059
 I talk to the manager of the cooperative 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:20.079
 they also emphasize that given the legal age at eleven o'clock at night to the plant 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:22.459
 from the plant 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.939
 warning 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.939
 this year will come to movie theaters 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.289
 when leaving Guatemalan territory 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:35.910
 today before reaching the salvador the tie runners 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.459
 where pollution is no longer just the waters in it 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.269
 the dog maron a drunken insecticide to the river 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.529
 where one goes behind his amazing his surroundings others worried 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:47.809
 by the situation 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.549
 we have denounced in two the 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.609
 said and we have also made the fame of basketball has not done the 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:56.879
 pollution continues

 we think that the monkeys were involved in life the savior banner of baeza 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.359
 mouth of the river where el salvador 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.069
 use the lemon river 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.899
 pollution is not limited to this river 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.779
 since others present 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.779
 since October 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.599
 we do not have big in the cold river 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.709
 It was going to flow into the Lempa river and one of the cold river and polluted air and this 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.730
 river cold pollutes river lempa my opinion see apart from concession comes 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.500
 polluted pollutes the river lempa the sinuapa river comes contaminated kohat 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:38.730
 to see the river lempa and has also contaminated the inadequate management of 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.590
 solid waste and certainly one of the main pollutants 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:47.759
 apart from the contamination of the favorable 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.879
 the large amount of blue water the foot waters a 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.279
 the one that fall into the river 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:54.949
 police personnel 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.949
 both the final will have the central 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.329
 end the complement 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.999
 but atmospheric pollution guatemala side get a high level 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.929
 stipulated pollute them the way too exaggerated 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:10.939
 where we have a new open air where approximately 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.809
 I do not know how many tons of garbage a day they will throw between 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:18.239
 trillo athletes asked 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.519
 where does the water we consume daily come from and where does it go? 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.789
 is a subject that few provide the necessary attention however the high 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.389
 pollution level 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.400
 not only affects the environment 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.780
 but it also has an impact on the people that we will talk about 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.219
 survey soon 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:38.689
