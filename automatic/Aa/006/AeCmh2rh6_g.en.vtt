00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.189
 Dear Friends 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.969
 in this case the turn for the bass 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.410
 chassis is for chevrolet aveo and 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.360
 following the line that 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.270
 comparisons are not odious are 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.380
 illustrative 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.380
 I want to show you 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.780
 some similar with the wing if by 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.060
 example 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:37.030
 the front train from similar design 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.809
 lower frame with the kneecap and 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.809
 mcpherson above 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.530
 I want to show you also that like 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.530
 that the wing comes quite protected the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.500
 sump 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.420
 up here in the low to hit 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.520
 the crankcase 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.220
 the exhaust pipe 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.050
 here in the second probe nothing is this that 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.050
 you see here it has a protection 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.369
 why 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.280
 do not get hooked do not hit any 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.259
 strange and good object since we are 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.509
 here in the exhaust pipe and the system 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.240
 anti pollution this that we see here is the 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.100
 catalyst that is fine to the exit 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.650
 from the multiple to the entrance of the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.780
 catalyst there is a first landa probe 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.890
 what today we saw here in the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.440
 second that controls what goes in and 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.430
 this other sensor what comes out controlling 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.980
 the efficiency of the catalyst 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.580
 I want to show you also 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.840
 is 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.840
 of input you see here 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.950
 in the aphonic network 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.600
 and this that comes here 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.060
 it's the abs sensor 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.740
 I commented that comes pretty 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.130
 unprotected because it gets dirty 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.409
 easily here 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.690
 and good another of the things that 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.070
 I do not see him very well 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.160
 [Music] 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:13.100
 it's the total lack of anti-graffiti paint 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.250
 this sheet as well as leaves the house by 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.370
 X and nothing else in the only place that 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.660
 It has a small anti gravel paint 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.630
 is under the socket here come 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.010
 this line down this means 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.319
 this 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.260
 but that everything pulling the wheel 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.099
 and well at least the socket is 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.040
 protected after good in protection 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.859
 for the heat as they bring most 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:50.239
 the high the first silent is a 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:50.239
 resonance chamber after here we have 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.160
 the naphtha tank this is a 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.040
 Protection for heat for blows 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.520
 the stones and a detail of this I see that 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.010
 2011 model that does not have the filter of 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.190
 Naphtha outside usually comes here from 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.340
 This side only brings it inside the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.800
 tank incorporated in the naphtha pump 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.120
 which according to recommendation is changed every 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.850
 80,000 kilometers later following with 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.000
 the similar ones though this here 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.540
 who makes them remember football he 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.360
 Canister is in the same place and 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.610
 it is practically very similar after the 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.940
 Rear suspension system is 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.250
 similar also of rigid shaft but to 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.010
 difference of football this comes with the 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.250
 spiral on one side and the shock absorber 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.830
 on the other the football enters the spiral 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.920
 incorporated damper what happens 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.630
 to be a back parsons 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:57.110
 then good here we have the sensor of the 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.900
 abs you are well protected this is the 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.549
 rear brake plate 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.910
 then another this one so I want 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.440
 show them 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.020
 the soul of the rear bumper 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.040
 [Music] 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.040
 and you can see 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.880
 plastic 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.389
 what they see here is the soul is what 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.389
 that holds 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.110
 most of the cars are metal this 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.110
 It's plastic 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:37.969
 and another difference is that this 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:41.269
 brings a kind of double crossbar 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:44.319
 of reinforcement on the 1st floor down here and 

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:44.319
 another in the middle 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.810
 and good in short 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.760
 this is the low chassis of the chevrolet 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.760
 aveo
