00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
Lego elites and I made them out of

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.979 
Lego elites and I made them out of
focusing<00:00:50.650> hard<00:00:53.500> baked<00:00:54.500> card<00:00:54.890> clay<00:00:55.220> and<00:00:55.460> I<00:00:56.210> just

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989

put it in the oven and the work I pretty

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.900 
put it in the oven and the work I pretty
nicely<00:01:00.379> actually<00:01:00.739> just<00:01:01.100> made<00:01:01.280> it<00:01:01.400> all<00:01:01.489> by<00:01:01.879> hand

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910

and then their plasma rifles and the
plasma<00:01:07.759> rifles<00:01:08.119> two<00:01:08.390> are<00:01:09.009> from<00:01:10.009> another<00:01:10.160> video

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
plasma rifles two are from another video

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.510 
plasma rifles two are from another video
I<00:01:11.060> thought<00:01:11.509> it<00:01:11.630> was<00:01:11.720> really<00:01:11.810> cool<00:01:12.050> so<00:01:12.830> I<00:01:12.890> kind

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
I thought it was really cool so I kind

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.730 
I thought it was really cool so I kind
of<00:01:13.610> copycat<00:01:14.210> at<00:01:14.330> that<00:01:14.479> you've<00:01:15.440> seen<00:01:15.619> the

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
of copycat at that you've seen the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.010 
of copycat at that you've seen the
gravity<00:01:16.070> hammer<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:17.920> so<00:01:19.330> its<00:01:20.330> feet<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:20.780> eat

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
gravity hammer and so its feet you eat

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.469 
gravity hammer and so its feet you eat
and<00:01:21.759> you<00:01:22.759> can<00:01:23.660> be<00:01:23.810> looking<00:01:24.170> forward<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:25.479> lego

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
and you can be looking forward to a lego

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.550 
and you can be looking forward to a lego
