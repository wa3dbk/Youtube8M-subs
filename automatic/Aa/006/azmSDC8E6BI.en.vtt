00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 The best question is whether someone is right right away 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.270
 getting to know is what is your best game 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.309
 ever 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.660

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.300

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.080
 the music and stock kettles 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.279

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.070

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.410
 once been whole two and I think so 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.570
 an impossible question to answer 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.890
 so about the same as choosing what you like 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.510

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.920

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.600
 collection've played it I realized 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.180
 suddenly a brilliant shooter instead 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.460
 That is positive testing once before 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.860
 to me that is really quite something for us 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.260

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.119

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.610
 all of that english perfect 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.350
 nature when time like that just one 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.799
 revolutionary own 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.250
 nice and long, atmospheric everything and them 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.570
 never will 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.370
 and the euro issue 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.740
 is the list korfiati and fill the most 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.450
 I still come out on half-life 2 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.420
 waited a long time , I am still waiting 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.190
 always given episode 3 but 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.130
 remains the classic serious is that now 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.690
 just install 4 steam 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.030
 The games that Dorian still have 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.050
 really good back then 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.910
 to endure 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.490
 great setting tour course bizarre 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.350
 weapons really appropriate 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.830
 my best game ever may not be 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.700
 real and you but more a leaf is the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.350
 stripey 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.180
 seriously him too or played in the game 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.470
 was so well balanced it is the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.360
 multiplayer shooter 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.039
 two teams the influence of the to 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.850
 terrorists against one for the counter 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.119
 terrorist 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.860
 now maps were perfectly balanced 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.050
 weapons were good 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.910
 the game became hefty for me now here 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.649
 because if I had played that danny 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.390
 I think hey Mark is nice 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.709
 found but it didn't have my passion 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.410
 because no longer work 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.670
 but there can be so much time 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.070
 from undisturbed in found it so 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.480
 fantastic that day ok i have to be here 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.230
 go further I have to do something with 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.780
 garnish 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.680
 with games so yes is promising for me 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.680
 best game ever
