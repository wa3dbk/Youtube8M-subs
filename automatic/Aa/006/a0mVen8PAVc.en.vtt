00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
but anyway as you can see it's just a

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:55.719 
but anyway as you can see it's just a
plain<00:05:54.589> white<00:05:54.770> background<00:05:54.830> it<00:05:55.429> didn't<00:05:55.610> really

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:19.519 
looking through the pages and stuff like

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:23.589 
looking through the pages and stuff like
that<00:06:20.619> it<00:06:21.619> shows<00:06:22.009> a<00:06:22.039> very<00:06:22.309> small<00:06:22.669> gain<00:06:23.149> screen

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
that it shows a very small gain screen

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.239 
that it shows a very small gain screen
right<00:06:23.779> here<00:06:23.809> it<00:06:24.199> basically<00:06:24.679> doesn't<00:06:24.979> show

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:25.249

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:29.019 
right here it basically doesn't show
anything<00:06:25.699> so<00:06:26.860> good<00:06:27.860> luck<00:06:27.889> trying<00:06:28.159> to<00:06:28.399> look

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:29.029 
anything so good luck trying to look

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:30.429 
anything so good luck trying to look
trying<00:06:29.240> to<00:06:29.330> see<00:06:29.479> this<00:06:29.629> I<00:06:29.839> mean<00:06:29.959> it's<00:06:30.110> hard<00:06:30.259> to

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:30.439 
trying to see this I mean it's hard to

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:33.519 
trying to see this I mean it's hard to
see<00:06:30.559> in<00:06:30.649> black<00:06:30.800> and<00:06:31.009> white<00:06:31.099> and<00:06:32.050> then<00:06:33.050> you<00:06:33.409> know

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:33.529 
see in black and white and then you know

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:36.639 
see in black and white and then you know
some<00:06:33.949> other<00:06:34.009> stuff<00:06:34.399> and<00:06:34.729> menu<00:06:35.209> campaign<00:06:35.839> yeah

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:36.649 
some other stuff and menu campaign yeah

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:38.350 
some other stuff and menu campaign yeah
I<00:06:36.919> think<00:06:37.490> the<00:06:37.550> campaign<00:06:37.699> this<00:06:38.029> game<00:06:38.209> is<00:06:38.269> gonna

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
I think the campaign this game is gonna

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.980 
I think the campaign this game is gonna
be<00:06:38.479> great<00:06:38.659> but<00:06:39.019> the<00:06:39.740> multiplayer<00:06:40.300> it<00:06:41.300> was<00:06:41.719> also

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
be great but the multiplayer it was also

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.899 
be great but the multiplayer it was also
pretty<00:06:42.139> fun<00:06:42.379> from<00:06:42.499> what<00:06:42.559> I<00:06:42.709> played<00:06:42.979> so<00:06:43.369> we'll
