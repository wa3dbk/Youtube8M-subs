00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.460
 just for this it seems that I want to follow my life being that until then giving 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.849
 an internet party never saw that they would have to invest 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.449
 I do not know why I did it by the world's media the roads are being 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.039
 harmful 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.509
 however we could not win but during the day 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.419
 due to the extent of the icy city is the largest of all the stars of our 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.119
 system 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.860
 because to me 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.859
 still it's up to me alone 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.300
 bug 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.870

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.170
 6 6 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.360
 but the question that arises 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.020
 I think not 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.050
 kutcher 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.050
 the question is to finance with one point less 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.950
 not only the points 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.800
 the images also show that of the browsers that would be used by the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.370
 constellations 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.370
 This is because for 2010 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.930
 spider to pastry a year 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.100

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.440
 friends of the victim 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.760
 the attack happened 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.490
 did not have any of this 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.310
 nothing again 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.670
 This is what I expect from the southern cruise. 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.430
 the entity's calculations had received a complaint 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.430

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.810
 in the largest program 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.530
 the intention is that the conversion 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.370

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.710

 tombini defended today in rio de janeiro 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.239
 on Sunday the 21st 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.220
 - not 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.250
 to mark the story to red aline menéndez 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.179

 in the river called the neighbor the astronauts does not even know it exists 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.659
 and speaking of euphoria 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.819
 know that the recession 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.439

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:41.169
 There is a chance beside someone but I will not promise anything. 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.029
 I know it's beautiful 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.999
 it's nothing serious and nobody 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.579
 despite the 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.169
