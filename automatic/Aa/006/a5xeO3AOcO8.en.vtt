 hello to all and in years as a pilot and among the transporters dotcom 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.520
 score 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.090
 before starting the tutorial our tutorials flash zisis 5 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.390
 a kilo 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.859
 secure my son I want 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.130
 he said before starting the tutorial equine assistants had techniques 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.039
 facilitated 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.970
 many like a lot of people in almost shot 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.580
 and many people use this same form that I am going to use on how to raise a 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.119
 text writing 6 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.860
 we will start with the tutorial 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.500
 the first thing we do we have to take the sectional 5ª - 1 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.040
 cell placed in a car and removed tics 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.020
 let's go spa edition the text tool 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.000
 the click 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.420
 i acz 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.980
 I make myself noticed 5th tips cars that use percent 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.080
 and color and it was then that the puppy idol chips 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.130
 rik smits 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.670
 i'm going to sit a little more 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.820
 once 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.200
 kilos between here I'll throw with a layer of stamps icons below 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.600
 once in this ability to remove to this black point and block and layer 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.990
 so that I can not give 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.810
 no any kind 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.460
 d 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.290
 no type d 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.560
 how to say it 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.940
 of movement 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.680
 or selection 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.240
 nac capture to block bo in the layer that we had already created 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.550
 let's go and calculate a little more or less for the team of fifty 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.040
 we will walk a click and we will arrest down 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.360
 pressing the key 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.640
 f5 achieve their selection 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.840
 is up to the limit so to speak - ucr and photographs 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.230
 off or fear of more impassive correct word we will use so that 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.370
 alonso text 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.820
 writing to yourself 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.470
 this day the limit 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.180
 good we will start is here 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.700
 pons and we know nothing rocha d tool so if the pilsen dad 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.690
 I will go down in Hercules 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.180
 a little bit to get rid of my success 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.719
 and now if beijing to the tool 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.419
 d 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.509
 they must have prepared the key this is 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:18.659
 not with the rain maybe in red color and good what they will do to paint this 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:19.659
 this way 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.619
 and that without architects that are no longer the first frame or with us 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:26.860
 let's finish our our 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.130
 our work with frames so that the celtics writing to each other 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.339
 the first thing that will appear until texas was that part of art 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:39.449
 so it could be that I appear these incidents that regulate their use 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.929
 photographers the frames cars pointers 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.169
 I can be like that 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.139
 paleo program asier another photo in hama ccoo 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.649
 does so by native parts 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.369
 cusco stockings 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:57.389
 and so on to mourn finish the south wind culín that 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.389
 this 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.039
 and basically 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.379
 when you must give the play it will appear like this 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:13.779
 I will not put this meeting the keyboardist in the tank and we will continue 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.379
 with trying to do something fast 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.060
 Well it did not take too long in his post-its tutoring decision 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:25.739
 we are Real Madridists need to have these Munich today 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.639
 in common and decency that does not require any part in your text any part 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.819
 in black or one never 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.079
 imagine that you are well marked until this part 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:42.509
 that you have calculated will take will last until these frames that for 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:43.879
 you 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.159
 of you what you do when you reached the limit imagine yourself going to 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.320
 be used 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.919
 it's going to be like 20 frames 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.389
 place in each case and be these and and that is news is a bottom the cb sully 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:58.769
 we are going to determined 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.319
 as you can see 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.109
 will operate 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.109
 thus constanzó text 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:12.309
 Now what are we going to do, we are a lot of layers 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:13.129
 created 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.120
 our last layer that we will win who has made 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.999
 mask 

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:21.019
 you when you persue 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.550
 3 also this plot your text 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.759
 writes 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.159
 a simple tips 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.530
 in forgiveness style 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.550
 among the victims our first 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.680
 and study has been created percent the intro that had been previously 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.590
 Many people ask me how the one who entered 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.979
 I will see myself an idea to create at this moment to fight something simple 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.789
 this student and many different ways of creating 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.330
 money that I do not know if something was tested 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.710
 again created 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.529
 words for words one by one if I'm not wrong 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:56.219
 and they said good that was all I hope that state we will be seeing in 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:57.119
 the next video
