having a little bit of difficulty with

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.040 
having a little bit of difficulty with
this<00:00:28.919> note<00:00:29.160> okay<00:00:29.759> yeah<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.509> really<00:00:30.689> hard<00:00:30.960> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
this note okay yeah it's really hard to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.139 
this note okay yeah it's really hard to
find<00:00:31.230> yes<00:00:31.770> no<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.399> know<00:00:32.489> I'm<00:00:32.550> pulling<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:32.969> of

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
find yes no you know I'm pulling out of

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.470 
find yes no you know I'm pulling out of
any<00:00:33.450> middle<00:00:34.320> thin<00:00:34.800> air<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.970> find<00:00:36.240> with<00:00:36.360> any

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
any middle thin air but I find with any

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
any middle thin air but I find with any
shift<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.320> really<00:00:37.500> important<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
shift it's it's really important to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.090 
shift it's it's really important to
measure<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.640> shift<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.870> find<00:00:40.170> if<00:00:40.650> you

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
measure the shift so I find if you

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.920 
measure the shift so I find if you
measure<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.610> distance<00:00:41.790> between<00:00:42.150> your<00:00:42.570> nose

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
measure the distance between your nose

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.040 
measure the distance between your nose
and<00:00:42.990> your<00:00:43.620> thumb<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:45.090> know<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.870> gives

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and your thumb you know that it gives

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.530 
and your thumb you know that it gives
you<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> good<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.890> know<00:00:46.980> idea<00:00:47.370> well<00:00:48.270> my

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
you a good you know idea well my

00:00:48.540 --> 00:01:16.460 
you a good you know idea well my
percentage<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.140> getting<00:00:49.800> it<00:01:14.780> well<00:01:15.780> let<00:01:16.409> me

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
percentage of getting it well let me

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:27.170 
percentage of getting it well let me
play<00:01:16.950> something<00:01:17.220> else<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.549> then<00:01:17.729> yeah

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.490 

yeah<00:01:28.180> almost

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
yeah almost

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.070 
yeah almost
what<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.040> it<00:01:30.160> needed<00:01:30.610> well<00:01:30.850> with<00:01:31.600> any<00:01:31.750> kind<00:01:32.020> of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
what is it needed well with any kind of

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.010 
what is it needed well with any kind of
intervals<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:34.030> nice<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.450> check<00:01:34.810> them

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
intervals it's nice to check them

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.130 
intervals it's nice to check them
against<00:01:35.230> the<00:01:35.350> open<00:01:35.650> string<00:01:35.980> so<00:01:36.730> he<00:01:37.180> would

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
against the open string so he would

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.160 
against the open string so he would
check<00:01:38.380> against<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.950> using<00:01:39.640> string<00:01:39.970> yeah

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
check against the using string yeah

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:49.530 
check against the using string yeah
really<00:01:41.170> good<00:01:41.320> friend<00:01:41.530> position<00:01:47.550> but<00:01:48.550> what<00:01:49.390> if

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
really good friend position but what if

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.950 
really good friend position but what if
you<00:01:49.690> have<00:01:49.990> an<00:01:50.290> e-flat<00:01:51.070> arpeggio<00:01:52.000> oh<00:01:52.270> well<00:01:52.780> just

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
you have an e-flat arpeggio oh well just

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.540 
you have an e-flat arpeggio oh well just
it's<00:01:53.290> simple<00:01:53.680> I'd<00:01:53.770> say<00:01:53.980> you<00:01:54.100> should<00:01:54.130> still<00:01:54.520> use

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550

some trouble with this this opening the
one<00:02:20.740> oh<00:02:20.980> yeah<00:02:21.880> ship<00:02:22.270> shifting<00:02:22.960> there<00:02:23.140> it's

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
one oh yeah ship shifting there it's

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.440 
one oh yeah ship shifting there it's
really<00:02:23.920> fast<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.550> it's<00:02:24.700> it's<00:02:25.000> it's<00:02:25.240> really

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
really fast and it's it's it's really

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.250 
really fast and it's it's it's really
it's<00:02:25.540> too<00:02:26.020> fast<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.980> shift<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.670> know<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.630> so

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
it's too fast to shift you know and so

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.750 
it's too fast to shift you know and so
there's<00:02:29.620> there's<00:02:29.890> only<00:02:30.130> really<00:02:30.340> one<00:02:30.459> thing

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
so just get started get yourself in

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.780 
so just get started get yourself in
third<00:02:38.140> position<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.800> then<00:02:39.310> just<00:02:39.550> use<00:02:39.760> your

third position and then just use your

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.960 
third position and then just use your
thumb<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.090> get<00:02:40.330> started<00:02:43.530> yeah<00:02:44.560> Michael<00:02:45.520> simple

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
thumb to get started yeah Michael simple
