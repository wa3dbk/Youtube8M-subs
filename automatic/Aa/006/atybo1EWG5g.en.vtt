just<00:06:07.060> takes<00:06:07.270> one<00:06:07.480> bite<00:06:07.780> and<00:06:08.139> then<00:06:08.350> it<00:06:08.470> leaves

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
just takes one bite and then it leaves

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.860 
just takes one bite and then it leaves
but<00:06:10.150> one<00:06:10.360> bite<00:06:10.570> sometimes<00:06:11.350> all<00:06:11.650> it<00:06:11.680> takes

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870
