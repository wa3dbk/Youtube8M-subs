00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
probably could have done that using for

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.200 
probably could have done that using for
barbarians<00:00:43.500> come<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.550> through<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.760> wall<00:00:45.000> but

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
barbarians come in through the wall but

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.450 
barbarians come in through the wall but

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.110 
destroyed so I'm not going to bring any
additional<00:01:44.860> forces<00:01:45.190> but<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:45.460> think<00:01:45.760> from<00:01:45.940> a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
additional forces but I think from a

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.600 
additional forces but I think from a
cost<00:01:46.840> return<00:01:47.380> perspective<00:01:48.040> it's<00:01:48.130> not<00:01:48.370> that

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
cost return perspective it's not that

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.860 
cost return perspective it's not that
great<00:01:48.640> that's<00:01:48.970> probably<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.420> worst<00:01:49.690> one

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
great that's probably the worst one

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.800 
great that's probably the worst one
we've<00:01:50.170> done<00:01:50.470> so<00:01:50.740> far<00:01:50.770> because<00:01:51.640> we<00:01:51.970> spent<00:01:52.390> just

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
we've done so far because we spent just

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.350 
we've done so far because we spent just
slightly<00:01:53.200> over<00:01:53.380> 2,000<00:01:54.310> elixir<00:01:54.760> I'm<00:01:55.240> only

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
slightly over 2,000 elixir I'm only

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.210 
slightly over 2,000 elixir I'm only
getting<00:01:55.690> two<00:01:55.810> thousand<00:01:56.229> back<00:01:56.440> I<00:01:56.770> mean

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
getting two thousand back I mean

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.950 
getting two thousand back I mean
obviously<00:01:57.369> yes<00:01:57.760> you<00:01:57.970> do<00:01:58.090> have<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.300> 2,000<00:01:58.930> gold

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
obviously yes you do have the 2,000 gold

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.770 
obviously yes you do have the 2,000 gold
you're<00:01:59.260> also<00:01:59.410> getting<00:01:59.740> but<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:01.240> elixir<00:02:01.570> alone

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
you're also getting but the elixir alone

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.109 
you're also getting but the elixir alone
i<00:02:01.810> mean<00:02:02.020> we<00:02:02.110> use<00:02:02.290> 16<00:02:02.740> archers<00:02:03.130> which<00:02:03.400> is<00:02:03.640> you

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
i mean we use 16 archers which is you

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.780 
i mean we use 16 archers which is you
know<00:02:04.149> probably<00:02:04.450> on<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.780> high<00:02:04.930> side<00:02:05.550> not<00:02:06.550> too

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
know probably on the high side not too

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.660 
know probably on the high side not too
happy<00:02:07.000> with<00:02:07.270> this<00:02:07.660> one<00:02:07.990> from<00:02:08.770> our<00:02:08.979> minimalist

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
happy with this one from our minimalist

happy with this one from our minimalist
army<00:02:10.119> perspective<00:02:10.810> but<00:02:11.530> nonetheless<00:02:12.630> you

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
army perspective but nonetheless you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.970 
army perspective but nonetheless you
know<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.810> can<00:02:13.989> probably<00:02:14.140> get<00:02:14.320> away<00:02:14.350> with<00:02:14.530> with

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
know you can probably get away with with

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.550 
know you can probably get away with with
fewer<00:02:15.570> again<00:02:16.570> you<00:02:16.690> bring<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.020> Giants<00:02:17.410> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
fewer again you bring in the Giants the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.900 
fewer again you bring in the Giants the
Giants<00:02:17.590> are<00:02:18.010> just<00:02:18.190> going<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.790> know

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
Giants are just going to you know

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.390 
Giants are just going to you know
increase<00:02:19.390> your<00:02:19.600> costs<00:02:19.930> dramatically<00:02:20.860> again

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
increase your costs dramatically again

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.479 
increase your costs dramatically again
1500<00:02:22.120> /<00:02:22.270> giant<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:23.709> I<00:02:23.739> don't<00:02:24.130> think<00:02:24.340> it's

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
1500 / giant so I don't think it's

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.810 
1500 / giant so I don't think it's
really<00:02:24.970> applicable<00:02:25.470> for<00:02:26.470> our<00:02:26.860> type<00:02:27.489> of<00:02:27.670> play

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
really applicable for our type of play

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.729 
really applicable for our type of play
through<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.239> we're<00:02:28.360> doing<00:02:28.450> here<00:02:28.870> anyways

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
that was gold rush hopefully the next

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.630 
that was gold rush hopefully the next
one's<00:02:31.570> gonna<00:02:31.690> be<00:02:31.870> better<00:02:32.080> again<00:02:32.800> not<00:02:33.310> happy

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
one's gonna be better again not happy

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.840 
one's gonna be better again not happy
