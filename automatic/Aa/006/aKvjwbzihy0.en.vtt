it's<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> four-shot<00:01:55.979> kill<00:01:56.250> it'll

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
it's going to be a four-shot kill it'll

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.060 
it's going to be a four-shot kill it'll
be<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> four-shot<00:01:57.630> kill<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.770> way<00:01:58.860> until

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
be a four-shot kill all the way until

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.249 
be a four-shot kill all the way until
back<00:01:59.490> here<00:01:59.880> which<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.329> fairly<00:02:00.540> decent<00:02:01.079> for<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
back here which is fairly decent for a

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.929 
back here which is fairly decent for a
four-shot<00:02:01.710> kill<00:02:01.920> range<00:02:02.130> especially<00:02:02.310> because

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
four-shot kill range especially because

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.450 
four-shot kill range especially because
of<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.149> rate<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.329> fire<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.130> anything<00:02:05.130> beyond

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
of the rate of fire and anything beyond

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.069 
of the rate of fire and anything beyond
that<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> five<00:02:06.420> shot<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.899> kill

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
that is going to be a five shot to kill

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.740 
that is going to be a five shot to kill
as<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.560> guys<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.860> see<00:02:07.920> here<00:02:08.569> they'll<00:02:09.569> just

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
as you guys can see here they'll just

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.690 
as you guys can see here they'll just
see<00:02:09.899> bullets<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.739> mean<00:02:10.890> five<00:02:11.160> shots<00:02:11.489> to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
see bullets and I mean five shots to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.309 
see bullets and I mean five shots to
kill<00:02:11.879> you're<00:02:12.300> definitely<00:02:12.510> not<00:02:12.840> going<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.170> want

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
kill you're definitely not going to want

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.210 
kill you're definitely not going to want
to<00:02:13.410> take<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.590> shot<00:02:13.830> like

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
to take a shot like

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.610 
to take a shot like
that<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:14.880> would<00:02:15.270> definitely<00:02:15.300> not<00:02:16.020> recommend

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
that so I would definitely not recommend

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.680 
that so I would definitely not recommend
taking<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.130> shot<00:02:17.310> any<00:02:17.520> further<00:02:17.790> than<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.060> now

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
taking a shot any further than that now

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.080 
taking a shot any further than that now
for<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:18.990> hvr<00:02:19.530> look<00:02:19.950> at<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.400> three<00:02:20.640> shot<00:02:20.850> kill

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
for the hvr look at the three shot kill

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.930 
for the hvr look at the three shot kill
range<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:22.410> four<00:02:22.830> shot<00:02:23.070> kill<00:02:23.310> range<00:02:23.550> versus

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
range the four shot kill range versus

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.600 
range the four shot kill range versus
the<00:02:24.060> HP<00:02:24.450> rs3<00:02:24.900> shot<00:02:25.140> kill<00:02:25.440> range<00:02:25.710> is<00:02:26.010> basically

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
the HP rs3 shot kill range is basically

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.880 
the HP rs3 shot kill range is basically
the<00:02:26.730> same<00:02:26.940> thing<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.450> it's<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:28.470> melting

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
the same thing and it's just melting

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.870 
the same thing and it's just melting
them<00:02:29.010> at<00:02:29.730> four<00:02:29.970> shots<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.630> kill<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:31.320> far<00:02:31.620> away

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
them at four shots to kill that far away

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.820 
them at four shots to kill that far away
the<00:02:32.880> hbr<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.450> blowing<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.260> ballad<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
the hbr is blowing the ballad of the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.710 
the hbr is blowing the ballad of the
water<00:02:35.070> for<00:02:35.340> damage<00:02:35.760> especially<00:02:36.030> with<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
water for damage especially with the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.860 
water for damage especially with the
same<00:02:36.930> amount<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.380> recoil<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:39.510> can't<00:02:39.720> really

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
same amount of recoil you can't really

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.170 
same amount of recoil you can't really
go<00:02:40.110> wrong<00:02:40.140> with<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.650> hbr<00:02:40.980> our<00:02:41.340> next<00:02:41.790> test<00:02:42.000> is

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
go wrong with the hbr our next test is

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.480 
go wrong with the hbr our next test is
the<00:02:42.360> hipfire<00:02:42.570> spread<00:02:42.810> now<00:02:43.620> all<00:02:43.890> assault

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
the hipfire spread now all assault

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.699 
the hipfire spread now all assault
rifles<00:02:44.970> are<00:02:45.180> going<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.360> have<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.630> same

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
rifles are going to have the same

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.080 
rifles are going to have the same
hipfire<00:02:46.709> spread<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:47.190> all<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.459> assault<00:02:47.730> rifles

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
hipfire spread is all the assault rifles

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.900 
hipfire spread is all the assault rifles
so<00:02:48.240> these<00:02:48.420> two<00:02:48.690> are<00:02:48.720> no<00:02:49.110> different<00:02:49.910> exactly

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
so these two are no different exactly

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.940 
so these two are no different exactly
the<00:02:51.060> same<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.600> singles<00:02:52.020> for<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.290> SMGs<00:02:52.770> all

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
the same and singles for the SMGs all

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.520 
the same and singles for the SMGs all
the<00:02:53.100> SMGs<00:02:53.550> have<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.910> same<00:02:54.209> exact<00:02:54.840> amount<00:02:55.290> of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the SMGs have the same exact amount of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.400 
the SMGs have the same exact amount of
hipfire<00:02:56.190> spread<00:02:56.300> further<00:02:57.300> rate<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.870> fire<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
hipfire spread further rate of fire the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.949 
hipfire spread further rate of fire the
Val<00:02:58.709> actually<00:02:59.420> increases<00:03:00.420> rate<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:00.780> fire

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
Val actually increases rate of fire

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.900 
Val actually increases rate of fire
after<00:03:01.380> its<00:03:01.530> first<00:03:01.770> four<00:03:02.100> shots<00:03:02.130> as<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.790> can

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
after its first four shots as you can

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.699 
after its first four shots as you can
see<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.150> starts<00:03:03.480> at<00:03:03.600> six<00:03:03.870> six<00:03:04.080> six<00:03:04.290> which<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.680> a

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
see it starts at six six six which is a

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.440 
see it starts at six six six which is a
clear<00:03:05.010> indication<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.820> sledgehammer<00:03:06.180> games

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
clear indication that sledgehammer games

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.560 
clear indication that sledgehammer games
is<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.050> Illuminati<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:08.030> HP<00:03:09.030> are<00:03:09.150> actually

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
is in the Illuminati and HP are actually

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.970 
is in the Illuminati and HP are actually
shoots<00:03:09.780> faster<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.230> its<00:03:10.350> first<00:03:10.560> four<00:03:10.950> shots

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
shoots faster in its first four shots

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.380 
shoots faster in its first four shots
and<00:03:12.020> gradually<00:03:13.020> slows<00:03:13.290> down<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.790> last<00:03:15.030> test<00:03:15.270> I

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
and gradually slows down the last test I

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.270 
and gradually slows down the last test I
have<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.720> guys<00:03:15.810> today<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.680> very<00:03:16.950> simple

that<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.560> bow<00:03:19.769> has<00:03:20.070> 32<00:03:20.700> bullets<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.180> where<00:03:21.330> the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
that the bow has 32 bullets is where the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.380 
that the bow has 32 bullets is where the
hbr<00:03:21.810> has<00:03:22.170> 30<00:03:22.760> leaving<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.880> ballot<00:03:24.269> the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
hbr has 30 leaving the ballot the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.949 
hbr has 30 leaving the ballot the
advantage<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.700> in<00:03:26.700> conclusion<00:03:27.510> I'm

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
advantage of that in conclusion I'm

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.930 
advantage of that in conclusion I'm
gonna<00:03:28.230> have<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.560> say<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:28.860> HBR<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.459> actually

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
gonna have to say that HBR is actually

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.750 
gonna have to say that HBR is actually
better<00:03:30.180> especially<00:03:30.600> with<00:03:31.110> this<00:03:31.260> new<00:03:31.440> patch<00:03:31.760> it

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
better especially with this new patch it

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.120 
better especially with this new patch it
may<00:03:33.060> get<00:03:33.239> nerfed<00:03:33.570> who<00:03:33.870> knows<00:03:34.080> but<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.739> mean<00:03:34.950> this

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
may get nerfed who knows but I mean this

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.460 
may get nerfed who knows but I mean this
thing<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.459> really<00:03:36.150> really<00:03:36.660> good<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.260> know<00:03:37.320> a

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
thing is really really good and I know a
