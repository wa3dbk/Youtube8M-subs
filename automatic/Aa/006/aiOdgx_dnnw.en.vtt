00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.670

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.010
 I summed 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.080
 and didn't upload my videos so I immediately 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.900
 I apologize and today our release will be 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.180
 unrealistically interesting and fascinating for 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.250
 you this release will be interesting because 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.000
 what is in it we will discuss with you kik tea 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.009
 suvorov 2014 is like a rude thing 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.350
 nickelodeon this year with our guys 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.149
 All Rascher and this year were really days 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.360
 upset and because guys and 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.280
 nominated for one rank in the past 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.450
 year we were nominated for two ranks 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.969
 we had carlos 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.520
 for the title of best actor and generally 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.129
 general group as the best boyband and in 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.739
 this year there were no guys in any 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.680
 nomination Rascher and very upset 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.190
 they worked four years plowed for this 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.879
 channel 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.070
 un repaid like that that is not even 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.930
 nominated just for some title 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.119
 because rascher counted on it because 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.540

 harvests 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.070
 rusher and were serious about 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.360
 victory but since our guys don't even 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.030
 dominated and the class is still like that fact 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.579
