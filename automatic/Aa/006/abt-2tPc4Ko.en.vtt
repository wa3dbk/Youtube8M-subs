00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello and welcome to our forest us 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.859
 let's introduce you today 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.069
 chanterelle in tube 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.880
 it's a mushroom that we find at this 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.170
 early autumn period so late 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.109
 October early November that grows on 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:23.160
 softwood so where there is 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.160
 of fir and moss so forests a 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.410
 little dark and wet 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.060
 there you see some chanterelles in 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.710
 tube 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:44.610
 so in fact you see the dock the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:47.219
 hat so the foot is rather yellow the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.350
 brown hat with see in them 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.390
 forms that they are common adults like 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.559
 a funnel 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:05.850
 so you're going back some slats that 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:09.720
 are moderately spaced and the foot that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.310
 is hollow it's a mushroom for 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.840
 which one can not be wrong as soon as 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.580
 when you have it in the eye 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.740
 so when you pick up the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.259
 chanterelles in tube in fact it takes 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.830
 like all mushrooms of course the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.619
 cut at the base and cut only the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.580
 bigger because you will see that 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.040
 shoot 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.810
 you see them there are bigger and 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.950
 so little ones like that you need them 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.710
 leave because they are going they are going 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.150
 become big and you can come back 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.160
 a few days later and they understood 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.870
 an adult form and you will be able to 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.120
 again make a picking always 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.940
 well cut at the base to let them 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.470
 mushroom babies sprout and it's 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.930

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.890
