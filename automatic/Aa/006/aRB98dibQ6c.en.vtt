00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.350 
performance so I've gone ahead and
created<00:01:39.900> two<00:01:40.350> steps<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.040> example<00:01:41.640> just

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
created two steps in this example just

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.719 
created two steps in this example just
so<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> could<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.290> chord<00:01:43.799> follow<00:01:44.340> me<00:01:44.549> to

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so I could have one chord follow me to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.130 
so I could have one chord follow me to
the<00:01:44.850> next<00:01:45.000> inversion<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.780> I'm<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.020> go

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the next inversion so I'm going to go

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.590 
the next inversion so I'm going to go
from<00:01:46.320> G<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.890> D<00:01:47.130> briefly<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.210> instead<00:01:48.510> of

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
from G to D briefly but instead of

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.240 
from G to D briefly but instead of
having<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.020> tap<00:01:49.229> through<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.680> change<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.100> key

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
having to tap through and change the key

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.280 
having to tap through and change the key
in<00:01:50.400> my<00:01:50.549> presets<00:01:51.060> I'm<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.960> hit<00:01:52.140> this

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
in my presets I'm just going to hit this

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.289 
in my presets I'm just going to hit this
one<00:01:52.560> button<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:53.280> next<00:01:53.640> button<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.210> will

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
one button this next button and it will

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:08.150 
one button this next button and it will
follow<00:01:54.540> me<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:54.869> this

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.559 

Oh

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.930 

Yaffe

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.000 

so<00:02:20.540> if<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.720> listen<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.320> followed<00:02:21.710> me<00:02:21.830> when<00:02:21.980> I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
so if you listen it followed me when I

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:30.370 
so if you listen it followed me when I
did<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.370> change<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:29.090> just<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.600> one<00:02:29.870> step

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
did this change so just on that one step

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.740 
did this change so just on that one step
I've<00:02:30.620> had<00:02:31.010> VoiceLive<00:02:31.490> follow<00:02:31.790> me<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.210> changed

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
I've had VoiceLive follow me and changed

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.960 
I've had VoiceLive follow me and changed
the<00:02:32.990> chord<00:02:33.260> with<00:02:33.680> me<00:02:33.920> but<00:02:34.490> you<00:02:34.580> don't<00:02:34.670> have<00:02:34.850> to

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
the chord with me but you don't have to

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.790 
the chord with me but you don't have to
do<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.240> again<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.780> just<00:02:35.990> set<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.320> key<00:02:36.530> and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
do that again you just set the key and

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.410 
do that again you just set the key and
