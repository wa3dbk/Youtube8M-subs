 the touch of fred's ball on one side by

 neymar looks at it but has not started yet 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.270
 reached behind the record due to the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.279
 number 10 tharit and maybe it's record 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.779
 in soccer history he will leave 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.640
 before the charge jonas left before 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.779
 billing closed collection 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.140
 many European teams are using 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.059
 spreads the player on the line 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.380
 impediment to see if it takes the defense there 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.270
 inside 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.250
 there on the left daniel alves will he 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.710
 short cut inside show 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.100
 hit skill picked up net from side 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.100
 out 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:55.320
 kolarov theoretically the left lateral 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:59.699
 where he was early made the touch 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.199
 to neymar the Serbian player falls 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.870
 promising neymar had left the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.729
 elbow on his face 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.310
 the act goes there closely we will have 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.610
 to see the image repeat 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.400
 look neymar's expression is that 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.100
 expression of 15 something wrong 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.140
 do not think the very normal good move to 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.180
 people who the attacker when receiving 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.340
 ball back to the defender he 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.860
 also uses his arms to protect himself 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.149
 Let's see, I think that's what he did. 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.810
 plays the player who 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:37.450
 is back for that well took the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.770
 marc anthony got stuck 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:45.659
 in the marking of the basta 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:49.299
 saber won when he was thrashed 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.369
 appeared the foot of the Serbian player 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.229
 the kick went out the ball was pressed 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.350
 deviated 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.420
 Look who's talking and who was Ivan? 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.049
 but Marcelo fights for her 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.049
