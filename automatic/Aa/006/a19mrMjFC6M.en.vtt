because it is the hobbit adventure map

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.530 
because it is the hobbit adventure map
now<00:00:10.440> if<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:10.620> guys<00:00:10.769> know<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.969> hobbit<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
now if you guys know the hobbit the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.180 
now if you guys know the hobbit the
unexpected<00:00:13.200> journey<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.799> pretty<00:00:14.099> much

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
unexpected journey this is pretty much

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.709 
unexpected journey this is pretty much
it<00:00:14.340> follows<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:14.880> story<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.509> think

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
it follows that story and I think

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.810 
it follows that story and I think
eventually<00:00:15.839> they<00:00:16.650> might<00:00:16.920> branch<00:00:17.220> off<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.490> do

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
eventually they might branch off and do

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.370 
eventually they might branch off and do
the<00:00:17.850> other<00:00:18.029> two<00:00:18.390> stories<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.960> are<00:00:19.080> gonna<00:00:19.199> be

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
