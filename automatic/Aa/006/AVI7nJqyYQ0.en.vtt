awkward<00:03:58.600> talking<00:03:59.050> to<00:03:59.290> him<00:03:59.440> because<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.800> seems

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
awkward talking to him because it seems

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.850 
awkward talking to him because it seems
because<00:04:00.700> what<00:04:01.600> we<00:04:01.780> both<00:04:01.990> do<00:04:02.230> is<00:04:02.440> exactly

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
because what we both do is exactly

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.949

think<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:11.590> two<00:04:11.830> are<00:04:11.860> intertwined<00:04:12.610> I<00:04:12.970> think

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
think the two are intertwined I think

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.530 
think the two are intertwined I think
George<00:04:13.989> is<00:04:14.170> actually<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:15.010> nicer<00:04:15.910> guy<00:04:15.940> than<00:04:16.120> Ken

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
George is actually a nicer guy than Ken

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.930 
George is actually a nicer guy than Ken
he<00:04:16.750> is<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.900> fiction<00:04:17.410> melody<00:04:18.280> can<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.519> think

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
he is a fiction melody can I think

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.819 
he is a fiction melody can I think
George<00:04:19.180> has<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.450> few<00:04:19.720> redeeming<00:04:19.989> qualities<00:04:20.560> and

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
George has a few redeeming qualities and

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.670 
George has a few redeeming qualities and
Ken<00:04:22.590> George<00:04:23.590> is<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.600> self-obsessed<00:04:25.680> asshole

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
Ken George is a self-obsessed asshole

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.050

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
and um no I don't think there's any

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.050 
and um no I don't think there's any
similarities<00:04:31.870> at<00:04:32.020> all<00:04:32.169> I<00:04:32.590> think<00:04:33.190> that<00:04:33.640> George

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
similarities at all I think that George

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.890 
similarities at all I think that George
isn't<00:04:34.330> really<00:04:34.630> conscious<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.470> a<00:04:36.010> lot<00:04:36.340> of<00:04:36.460> the
