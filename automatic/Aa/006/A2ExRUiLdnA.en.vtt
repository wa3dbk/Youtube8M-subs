one of our favorite bikes super capable
light<00:00:44.120> it<00:00:44.450> was<00:00:44.600> a<00:00:44.660> category<00:00:44.960> defined<00:00:45.440> by

redefining bike at that point in 2009 my

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.740 
redefining bike at that point in 2009 my
absolutely<00:00:49.490> top<00:00:49.730> of<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:49.970> game<00:00:50.150> and<00:00:50.480> then<00:00:50.630> in

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
absolutely top of the game and then in

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.450 
absolutely top of the game and then in
two<00:00:50.840> thousand<00:00:51.200> and<00:00:51.260> ten<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.650> eleven<00:00:52.100> they

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
two thousand and ten and eleven they

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.340 
two thousand and ten and eleven they
steep<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:53.120> up<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.330> head<00:00:53.480> angle<00:00:53.630> which<00:00:53.990> made<00:00:54.200> it

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
steep it up the head angle which made it

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.620 
steep it up the head angle which made it
little<00:00:54.710> scary<00:00:55.160> under<00:00:55.580> sets<00:00:55.790> little<00:00:56.180> fast<00:00:56.450> and

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
little scary under sets little fast and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.080 
little scary under sets little fast and
twitchy<00:00:56.900> and<00:00:57.140> they<00:00:57.740> put<00:00:57.950> a<00:00:57.980> 30<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.430> work<00:00:58.730> on<00:00:58.940> it

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
twitchy and they put a 30 to work on it

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.170 
twitchy and they put a 30 to work on it
instead<00:00:59.840> of<00:00:59.900> the<00:01:00.140> lyric<00:01:00.500> or<00:01:00.860> 36<00:01:01.760> that<00:01:01.910> they<00:01:02.000> had

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
instead of the lyric or 36 that they had

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.060 
instead of the lyric or 36 that they had
on<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.750> bikes<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.200> so<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.590> front<00:01:03.830> end<00:01:03.950> house

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
on the bikes and so the front end house

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.640 
on the bikes and so the front end house
without<00:01:04.250> flexi<00:01:04.699> last<00:01:05.479> year<00:01:05.840> or<00:01:06.020> what<00:01:06.470> would<00:01:06.560> be

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
without flexi last year or what would be

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.219 
without flexi last year or what would be
model<00:01:06.920> your<00:01:07.070> 2012<00:01:07.759> they<00:01:07.939> put<00:01:08.119> a<00:01:08.150> dial<00:01:08.900> back<00:01:09.170> the

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
model your 2012 they put a dial back the

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.989 
model your 2012 they put a dial back the
geometry<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:09.920> it's<00:01:10.039> nice<00:01:10.219> and<00:01:10.249> aggressive<00:01:10.880> and

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:10.999 
geometry so it's nice and aggressive and

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:12.639 
geometry so it's nice and aggressive and
it's<00:01:11.090> capable<00:01:11.539> in<00:01:11.630> two<00:01:11.749> sets<00:01:11.960> but<00:01:12.170> they<00:01:12.320> still

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
it's capable in two sets but they still

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.249 
it's capable in two sets but they still
have<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.950> 32<00:01:13.429> and<00:01:13.670> that's<00:01:14.659> what<00:01:14.810> makes<00:01:14.960> us<00:01:15.109> sad

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
have a 32 and that's what makes us sad

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.849 
have a 32 and that's what makes us sad
about<00:01:15.469> 2013<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.820> geometries<00:01:17.390> right<00:01:17.679> so<00:01:18.679> much

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
about 2013 the geometries right so much

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.770 
about 2013 the geometries right so much
is<00:01:19.009> right<00:01:19.159> about<00:01:19.310> this<00:01:19.490> bike<00:01:19.670> but<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.539> still

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
is right about this bike but it still

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.499 
is right about this bike but it still
got<00:01:20.929> that<00:01:21.079> pinner<00:01:21.350> flexi<00:01:21.859> for<00:01:22.069> come<00:01:22.280> from<00:01:22.509> so

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
got that pinner flexi for come from so

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
this by that was was the frame the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.410 
this by that was was the frame the
jumper<00:01:27.950> jeez<00:01:28.100> da<00:01:28.340> but<00:01:28.609> the<00:01:28.670> rear<00:01:28.850> suspension

jumper jeez da but the rear suspension

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.800 
jumper jeez da but the rear suspension
is<00:01:29.630> is<00:01:30.729> outperforms<00:01:31.729> a<00:01:31.880> lot<00:01:32.060> of<00:01:32.210> other<00:01:32.420> by<00:01:32.569> ever

just cannot drive that bike where it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.510 
just cannot drive that bike where it
needs<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.680> go<00:02:14.120> but<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.240> as<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.710> know<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.370> have

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
needs to go but on as I know we have

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.100 
needs to go but on as I know we have
this<00:02:17.640> in<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.880> all-mountain<00:02:18.120> category<00:02:18.810> and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
this in the all-mountain category and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.830 
this in the all-mountain category and
it's<00:02:19.920> it's<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.460> little<00:02:20.820> one<00:02:21.000> for<00:02:21.420> our<00:02:21.510> course

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
it's it's a little one for our course

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.130 
it's it's a little one for our course
especially<00:02:22.170> it's<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.860> little<00:02:23.100> on<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.280> on<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
especially it's a little on the on the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.140 
especially it's a little on the on the
the<00:02:25.140> weekend<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.890> but<00:02:26.220> as<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> trail<00:02:26.910> bike

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
the weekend of that but as a trail bike

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.910 
the weekend of that but as a trail bike
were<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.450> writing<00:02:27.600> ninety-eight<00:02:28.200> percent<00:02:28.410> of

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
were you writing ninety-eight percent of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.550 
were you writing ninety-eight percent of
you<00:02:29.370> know<00:02:29.490> what<00:02:30.060> would<00:02:30.810> have<00:02:30.900> been<00:02:31.080> our<00:02:31.140> trail

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
you know what would have been our trail

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.830 
you know what would have been our trail
course<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.460> would<00:02:32.580> have<00:02:32.670> been<00:02:32.760> great<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.600> it

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
course it would have been great and it

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.420 
course it would have been great and it
would<00:02:34.020> have<00:02:34.110> been<00:02:34.200> able<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.560> if<00:02:34.830> you're<00:02:35.130> riding

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
would have been able to if you're riding

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.340 
would have been able to if you're riding
two<00:02:35.610> percent<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:36.060> our<00:02:36.150> all-mountain<00:02:36.630> category

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
two percent of our all-mountain category

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.570 
two percent of our all-mountain category
I<00:02:37.410> think<00:02:37.650> I'd<00:02:37.710> have<00:02:37.830> been<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.950> great<00:02:38.160> bike<00:02:38.340> for

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
I think I'd have been a great bike for

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.660 
I think I'd have been a great bike for
that<00:02:39.380> just<00:02:40.380> as<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> two<00:02:40.950> percent<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.370> your<00:02:41.460> ride

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
that just as a two percent of your ride

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.700 
that just as a two percent of your ride
besides<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.780> won't<00:02:42.870> need<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.230> make<00:02:43.500> sure<00:02:43.530> that

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
besides you won't need to make sure that

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.560 
besides you won't need to make sure that
not<00:02:44.070> fooled<00:02:44.370> into<00:02:44.550> thinking<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:45.270> is<00:02:45.540> a

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
not fooled into thinking this is a

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.020 
not fooled into thinking this is a
definitive<00:02:46.410> or<00:02:46.530> wide-open<00:02:46.740> bike<00:02:47.100> still<00:02:47.430> yeah

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
definitive or wide-open bike still yeah

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.790 
definitive or wide-open bike still yeah
but<00:02:48.270> that's<00:02:48.420> what<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.630> trek<00:02:48.840> slashes<00:02:49.290> for<00:02:49.530> and

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
but that's what the trek slashes for and

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.040 
but that's what the trek slashes for and
then<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.850> course<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.270> were<00:02:51.360> on<00:02:51.510> today<00:02:51.720> and

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
then the course we were on today and

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.770 
then the course we were on today and
it's<00:02:52.470> very<00:02:52.680> great<00:02:52.950> because<00:02:53.280> trick<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:54.210> there

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
it's very great because trick in there

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.290 
it's very great because trick in there
there<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.860> vocabulary<00:02:56.520> they're<00:02:56.790> trying<00:02:57.060> to

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
there the vocabulary they're trying to

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.110 
there the vocabulary they're trying to
force<00:02:58.290> on<00:02:58.470> by<00:02:58.620> categorization<00:02:59.010> they<00:02:59.670> put<00:03:00.030> this

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
force on by categorization they put this

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.970 
force on by categorization they put this
in<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.300> same<00:03:00.480> categories<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:01.080> scratch<00:03:01.290> there

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
in the same categories of scratch there

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.040 
in the same categories of scratch there
they're<00:03:02.190> both<00:03:02.510> technical<00:03:03.510> that's<00:03:03.780> Ted

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
they're both technical that's Ted

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.760 
they're both technical that's Ted
scratched<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:05.300> technical<00:03:06.300> trail<00:03:06.660> it's<00:03:07.470> just

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
scratched the technical trail it's just

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.690 
scratched the technical trail it's just
let<00:03:07.950> down<00:03:08.160> its<00:03:08.700> let<00:03:08.970> down<00:03:09.150> by<00:03:09.450> focus<00:03:10.140> groups<00:03:10.380> or

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
let down its let down by focus groups or

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.320 
let down its let down by focus groups or
somebody<00:03:11.700> just<00:03:12.000> finding<00:03:14.180> redefining<00:03:15.180> what

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
somebody just finding redefining what

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.840 
somebody just finding redefining what
this<00:03:15.570> bike<00:03:15.750> could<00:03:15.930> be<00:03:16.160> I'm<00:03:17.160> numb<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> whole

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
this bike could be I'm numb to the whole

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.060 
this bike could be I'm numb to the whole
thing<00:03:18.180> because<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.930> think<00:03:19.260> geometry<00:03:19.950> and

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
thing because I think geometry and

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.760 
thing because I think geometry and
travel<00:03:20.580> does<00:03:21.270> not<00:03:21.510> an<00:03:21.750> all<00:03:21.959> mountain<00:03:22.350> bike<00:03:22.530> me

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
travel does not an all mountain bike me

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.850 
travel does not an all mountain bike me
and<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.420> doesn't<00:03:24.810> have<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.290> be<00:03:25.320> an<00:03:25.709> all

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
and and it doesn't have to be an all

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.320 
and and it doesn't have to be an all
mountain<00:03:26.160> bike<00:03:26.340> just<00:03:26.580> because<00:03:26.880> it's<00:03:27.060> six

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
mountain bike just because it's six

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.320 
mountain bike just because it's six
inches<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.870> has<00:03:27.989> right<00:03:28.350> hey<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.300> there<00:03:30.300> are

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
inches and has right hey so there are

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.640 
inches and has right hey so there are
there<00:03:30.690> are<00:03:30.810> plenty<00:03:31.080> of<00:03:31.200> people<00:03:31.530> out<00:03:31.590> there

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
there are plenty of people out there

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
like the tech more technical parts of

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.290 
like the tech more technical parts of
our<00:03:36.330> trail<00:03:36.570> course<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.670> don't<00:03:38.670> want<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.910> 29er

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
our trail course and don't want a 29er

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.750 
our trail course and don't want a 29er
to<00:03:39.510> make<00:03:39.630> up<00:03:39.780> for<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.430> don't<00:03:41.430> want<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.670> all

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
mountain bike so there there's there's

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.190 
mountain bike so there there's there's
tons<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.120> people<00:03:45.360> out<00:03:45.420> there<00:03:45.630> they<00:03:45.780> just<00:03:45.810> want

missing out of it I think we've talked
about<00:04:13.200> balance<00:04:13.709> so<00:04:13.980> almost<00:04:14.550> all<00:04:14.819> of<00:04:15.000> actually

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
talked about is like having and balance

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.740 
talked about is like having and balance
in<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.190> bike<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.519> this<00:04:17.760> bike<00:04:18.000> doesn't<00:04:18.359> seem
