00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.070 
have here it kind of kind of a warm here
um<00:03:26.230> it's<00:03:27.230> starting<00:03:27.800> quickly<00:03:28.550> to<00:03:29.030> get<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.870> little

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
um it's starting quickly to get a little

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.350 
um it's starting quickly to get a little
bit<00:03:30.260> difficult<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:31.330> blow<00:03:32.330> dry<00:03:32.600> them<00:03:32.870> with

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
bit difficult to blow dry them with

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.290 
bit difficult to blow dry them with
their<00:03:35.360> own<00:03:35.769> brush<00:03:36.769> that<00:03:37.010> I<00:03:37.070> have<00:03:37.340> for<00:03:37.850> it<00:03:38.000> but

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
their own brush that I have for it but

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.750 
their own brush that I have for it but
maybe<00:03:38.600> because<00:03:38.840> it's<00:03:39.140> not<00:03:40.269> big<00:03:41.269> enough<00:03:41.390> for

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
maybe because it's not big enough for

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.280 
maybe because it's not big enough for
thicker<00:03:43.760> hair<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.150> don't<00:03:44.420> know<00:03:44.660> but<00:03:44.930> it<00:03:45.050> was
