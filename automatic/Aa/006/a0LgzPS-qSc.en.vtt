directly into my RCS rock as the ends

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.609 
directly into my RCS rock as the ends
have<00:01:26.970> gone<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> drekar<00:01:27.659> meter<00:01:27.930> which

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.170 
have gone for the drekar meter which
automatically<00:01:29.159> tells<00:01:29.430> me<00:01:29.520> he<00:01:29.640> does<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:29.939> have

automatically tells me he does not have
the<00:01:30.299> aura<00:01:30.479> sphere<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.350> he<00:01:31.470> does<00:01:31.650> want<00:01:31.829> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the aura sphere so if he does want to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.109 
the aura sphere so if he does want to
save<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.100> auger<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.820> keep<00:01:32.909> that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119

information<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.780> my<00:01:34.380> mind<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:34.860> later<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.189> in

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
information in my mind for later on in

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.920 
information in my mind for later on in
the<00:01:35.430> battle<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.820> Belford<00:01:36.240> recover<00:01:36.600> he<00:01:36.810> is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the battle as I Belford recover he is

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.330 
the battle as I Belford recover he is
then<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.590> go<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.950> dragon

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
then just going to go for the dragon

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
then just going to go for the dragon
tail<00:01:38.520> which<00:01:39.240> automatically<00:01:39.810> tells<00:01:40.110> me<00:01:40.259> that

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
tail which automatically tells me that

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.929 
tail which automatically tells me that
he<00:01:40.530> doesn't<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.040> or<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.430> he<00:01:41.520> did<00:01:41.759> at

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
he doesn't have it or if he did at

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.850 
he doesn't have it or if he did at
minus-2<00:01:42.299> he<00:01:42.630> wouldn't<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.079> doing<00:01:43.290> much<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.740> me

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
minus-2 he wouldn't be doing much to me

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.770 
minus-2 he wouldn't be doing much to me
so<00:01:44.399> he<00:01:44.490> dragon<00:01:44.880> tells<00:01:45.060> me<00:01:45.180> out<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.420> my<00:01:45.540> lawdy

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
so he dragon tells me out to my lawdy

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.899 
so he dragon tells me out to my lawdy
awesome<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.350> at<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.829> point<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.310> doesn't

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
awesome and at this point it doesn't

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.069 
awesome and at this point it doesn't
really<00:01:48.090> matter<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.509> he<00:01:48.570> switches<00:01:48.840> into

knocked me out within our sphere which

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.360 
knocked me out within our sphere which
really<00:02:46.260> doesn't<00:02:46.500> matter<00:02:46.770> just<00:02:47.040> because

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
really doesn't matter just because

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.250

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
not carrying a brick break then he can't

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330 
not carrying a brick break then he can't
touch<00:04:06.600> my<00:04:06.870> skarmory<00:04:07.320> whatsoever<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.100> at<00:04:08.220> this

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
touch my skarmory whatsoever and at this

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.000 
touch my skarmory whatsoever and at this
point<00:04:08.550> his<00:04:08.790> RCS<00:04:09.240> is<00:04:09.360> basically<00:04:09.780> dead<00:04:10.050> so<00:04:10.590> i<00:04:10.620> can

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
point his RCS is basically dead so i can

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.650 
point his RCS is basically dead so i can
just<00:04:11.160> roost<00:04:11.430> up<00:04:11.610> as<00:04:11.760> he<00:04:12.000> dies<00:04:12.180> off<00:04:12.390> to<00:04:12.570> the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
just roost up as he dies off to the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.510 
just roost up as he dies off to the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
sandstorm he then brings in the genocide

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.490 
sandstorm he then brings in the genocide
lives<00:04:16.919> on<00:04:17.160> one<00:04:17.549> percent<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.510> even<00:04:19.109> if<00:04:19.200> he<00:04:19.230> does
