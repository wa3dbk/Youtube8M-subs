00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
going to teach you some more shapes for

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.789 
going to teach you some more shapes for
your<00:00:05.970> major<00:00:06.120> pentatonic<00:00:06.569> scale<00:00:07.049> this<00:00:07.620> is

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
your major pentatonic scale this is

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.919 
your major pentatonic scale this is
important<00:00:08.280> because<00:00:08.309> it<00:00:08.639> allows<00:00:09.000> you<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.719> start

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
important because it allows you to start

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.660 
important because it allows you to start
expressing<00:00:10.200> yourself<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:10.950> other<00:00:11.130> areas<00:00:11.519> on

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
expressing yourself in other areas on

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.339 
expressing yourself in other areas on
the<00:00:11.759> fret<00:00:12.000> board<00:00:12.030> knowing<00:00:12.870> all<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.170> these

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
the fret board knowing all of these

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.839 
the fret board knowing all of these
scale<00:00:13.559> shapes<00:00:13.860> really<00:00:14.190> frees<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.639> up<00:00:14.670> to

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
scale shapes really frees you up to

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.760 
scale shapes really frees you up to
explore<00:00:15.480> some<00:00:15.660> more<00:00:15.780> tonal<00:00:16.170> options<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:16.710> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
explore some more tonal options on the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.170 
explore some more tonal options on the
guitar<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.100> helps<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.520> conjure<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:17.940> some

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
guitar and helps you conjure up some

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.120 
guitar and helps you conjure up some
different<00:00:18.330> sounds<00:00:18.840> now<00:00:19.260> let<00:00:19.619> me<00:00:19.710> just<00:00:19.890> say

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
different sounds now let me just say

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.160 
different sounds now let me just say
it's<00:00:20.550> more<00:00:20.880> important<00:00:21.330> for<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.990> know

QuickStart series
you<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.739> take<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.489> these<00:00:38.700> scales<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
you can take one of these scales and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.459 
you can take one of these scales and
work<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.510> them<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.809> few<00:00:39.930> months<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.320> then

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:16.980 

I

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:16.990 

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.240

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
shape up actually starts on that same

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.550 
shape up actually starts on that same
root<00:04:26.360> note<00:04:26.540> on<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.840> tenth<00:04:27.080> fret<00:04:27.230> of<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.500> a

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
root note on the tenth fret of the a

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.100 
root note on the tenth fret of the a
string<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:28.070> G<00:04:28.310> note<00:04:28.460> but<00:04:28.790> you<00:04:29.120> start<00:04:29.990> with

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
string that G note but you start with

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.810

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
scale shape believe it or not you

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.110 
scale shape believe it or not you
already<00:06:05.890> know<00:06:06.100> the<00:06:06.310> shape<00:06:06.640> but<00:06:06.910> we're<00:06:07.030> going

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
already know the shape but we're going

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.580 
already know the shape but we're going
to<00:06:07.180> look<00:06:07.360> at<00:06:07.510> it<00:06:07.630> in<00:06:07.750> a<00:06:07.870> little<00:06:08.200> different<00:06:08.530> way

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
to look at it in a little different way

so<00:06:08.770> you<00:06:09.670> should<00:06:09.850> know<00:06:10.000> this<00:06:10.180> minor<00:06:10.390> pentatonic

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
so you should know this minor pentatonic

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.930 
so you should know this minor pentatonic
scale<00:06:11.260> shape<00:06:11.290> if<00:06:11.650> you<00:06:11.770> started<00:06:12.160> it<00:06:12.280> right<00:06:12.730> here

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
scale shape if you started it right here

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:21.330 
scale shape if you started it right here
on<00:06:13.090> this<00:06:13.210> Ino<00:06:13.660> right<00:06:13.870> here<00:06:19.230> that<00:06:20.230> is<00:06:20.500> also<00:06:20.890> a

you have to do is change your root note

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.380 
you have to do is change your root note
over<00:06:27.250> the<00:06:27.370> way<00:06:27.490> you<00:06:27.520> think<00:06:27.700> about<00:06:27.820> root<00:06:28.180> notes

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
over the way you think about root notes

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.180 
over the way you think about root notes
instead<00:06:28.630> of<00:06:28.810> using<00:06:29.170> this<00:06:29.290> low<00:06:29.530> E<00:06:29.560> as<00:06:29.890> a<00:06:29.920> root

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
instead of using this low E as a root

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.770 
instead of using this low E as a root

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.580 

I<00:06:57.120> know<00:06:58.120> this<00:06:58.389> is<00:06:58.540> a<00:06:58.570> lot<00:06:58.780> of<00:06:58.870> information<00:06:59.410> and

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
I know this is a lot of information and

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.530 
I know this is a lot of information and
it's<00:06:59.800> kind<00:07:00.040> of<00:07:00.070> hard<00:07:00.310> to<00:07:00.370> digest<00:07:00.669> all<00:07:01.150> at<00:07:01.300> once

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:01.540 
it's kind of hard to digest all at once

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.420 
it's kind of hard to digest all at once
but<00:07:01.780> the<00:07:02.320> things<00:07:02.530> you<00:07:02.680> want<00:07:02.800> to<00:07:02.830> focus<00:07:02.889> on<00:07:03.310> are

but the things you want to focus on are

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.510 
but the things you want to focus on are
just<00:07:03.639> taking<00:07:03.970> one<00:07:04.540> skill<00:07:04.810> shape<00:07:05.020> at<00:07:05.169> a<00:07:05.199> time

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
just taking one skill shape at a time
