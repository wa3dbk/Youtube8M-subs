00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
modular flooring that's that's what race

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.939 
modular flooring that's that's what race
tech<00:00:18.420> basically<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.109> guys<00:00:19.260> pretty

tech basically is and you guys pretty
much<00:00:20.039> invented<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.550> technology<00:00:20.910> some<00:00:21.449> time

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
much invented this technology some time

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.000 
much invented this technology some time
ago<00:00:21.810> yeah<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.380> were<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.529> first<00:00:22.650> ones<00:00:22.920> that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010

ago yeah we were the first ones that
come<00:00:23.130> out<00:00:23.250> with<00:00:23.430> its<00:00:24.090> floor<00:00:24.390> specifically<00:00:25.080> for

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
come out with its floor specifically for

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.960 
come out with its floor specifically for
the<00:00:25.410> garage<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> modular<00:00:26.369> industry<00:00:26.730> how

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the garage and the modular industry how
