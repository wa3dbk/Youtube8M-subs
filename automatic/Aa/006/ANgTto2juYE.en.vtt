00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
if I'm running out of space obviously at

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.740 
if I'm running out of space obviously at
that<00:00:41.309> point<00:00:41.730> then<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.000> gotta<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.360> move

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
card so once we clear the cache data go

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.360 
card so once we clear the cache data go
back<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.739> go<00:00:50.309> to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
you clear the RAM and you're going to

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.999 
you clear the RAM and you're going to
click<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.390> device<00:01:48.689> Diagnostics<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.799> click

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
click on device Diagnostics just click

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.330 
click on device Diagnostics just click
on<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:51.409> where<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.500> says<00:01:52.619> clean<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.130> right

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
on that and where it says clean up right

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.300 
on that and where it says clean up right
here<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.329> right<00:01:54.509> now<00:01:54.659> 85%<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.560> RAM<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.100> use

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
here so right now 85% of RAM is and use

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.520 
here so right now 85% of RAM is and use
the<00:01:56.670> cache<00:01:56.939> data<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.810> reason<00:01:58.079> why<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the cache data the reason why I like to

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.230 
the cache data the reason why I like to
do<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.770> through<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.070> storage<00:01:59.399> option<00:01:59.880> instead

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
do it through the storage option instead

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.959 
do it through the storage option instead
of<00:02:00.329> through<00:02:00.630> vitamins<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:02.490> usually<00:02:02.700> found

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
of through vitamins is I usually found

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.240 
of through vitamins is I usually found
out<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.479> reads<00:02:03.869> less<00:02:04.140> cache<00:02:04.439> data<00:02:04.770> than<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
out this reads less cache data than the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.709 
out this reads less cache data than the
storage<00:02:05.579> option<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:06.210> why<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.450> do

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
storage option so that's why I just do

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.109 
storage option so that's why I just do
it<00:02:06.750> there<00:02:07.340> but<00:02:08.340> anyways<00:02:08.610> you're<00:02:08.700> going<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.910> tap

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
it there but anyways you're going to tap

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.490 
it there but anyways you're going to tap
on<00:02:09.239> clean<00:02:09.569> up<00:02:09.720> Ram<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.940> now<00:02:11.940> you're<00:02:12.390> at<00:02:12.510> 59%

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
on clean up Ram and now you're at 59%

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.640 
on clean up Ram and now you're at 59%
used<00:02:13.680> now<00:02:14.520> usually<00:02:15.390> after<00:02:15.510> doing<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.110> what

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
used now usually after doing this what

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.620 
used now usually after doing this what
I'll<00:02:16.740> do<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.100> I'll<00:02:17.280> reboot<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.970> phone<00:02:18.150> turn<00:02:18.510> it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
off turn it back on and that should also

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.980 
off turn it back on and that should also
clear<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:22.590> anything<00:02:22.920> else<00:02:23.100> now<00:02:23.880> if<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.540> have<00:02:24.960> a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
that you're running out of space just so

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.620 
that you're running out of space just so
you<00:02:29.520> know<00:02:29.580> what<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:30.060> do<00:02:30.209> is<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.450> can<00:02:30.600> use

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
you know what you can do is you can use

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.550 
you know what you can do is you can use
like<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.020> USB<00:02:31.590> OTG<00:02:31.940> adapter<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:34.350> buy

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
like a USB OTG adapter this is one buy

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.420 
like a USB OTG adapter this is one buy
made<00:02:34.860> by<00:02:35.070> Leif<00:02:35.400> le<00:02:36.360> EF<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.200> basically<00:02:38.100> just

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
made by Leif le EF and basically just

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.940 
made by Leif le EF and basically just
put<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.610> memory<00:02:38.940> card<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.480> plug<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.470> into<00:02:40.740> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
put a memory card in it plug it into the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.460 
put a memory card in it plug it into the
phone<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:44.690> mean<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:45.930> obviously<00:02:46.020> plug

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
phone and I mean you can obviously plug

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.020 
phone and I mean you can obviously plug
it<00:02:46.590> into<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.830> computer<00:02:46.980> transfer<00:02:47.520> your<00:02:47.820> stuff

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
it into a computer transfer your stuff

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.490 
it into a computer transfer your stuff
there<00:02:48.300> but<00:02:48.510> if<00:02:48.600> anything<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.050> can<00:02:49.170> plug<00:02:49.380> it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
there but if anything you can plug it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.380 
there but if anything you can plug it
into<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.520> this<00:02:50.640> way<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.880> can<00:02:50.940> transfer

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
into this so this way you can transfer

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.540 
into this so this way you can transfer
everything<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.870> memory<00:02:52.230> card<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:53.400> my

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
everything to a memory card and in my

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.130 
everything to a memory card and in my
files<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.150> then<00:02:54.360> right<00:02:54.600> here<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.900> USB

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
storage a is the memory card so you just

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.630 
storage a is the memory card so you just
tap<00:02:58.020> on<00:02:58.170> device<00:02:58.440> storage<00:02:58.739> pick<00:02:59.160> which<00:02:59.340> files

and<00:03:00.360> then<00:03:00.540> move<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.930> memory<00:03:04.230> card

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
and then move to the to the memory card

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.910 
and then move to the to the memory card
so<00:03:05.840> hope<00:03:06.840> this<00:03:06.870> helped<00:03:07.200> thanks<00:03:07.470> for<00:03:07.620> watching
