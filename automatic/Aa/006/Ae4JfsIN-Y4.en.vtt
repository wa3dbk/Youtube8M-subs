who's Iran but personally have a
hardware<00:00:12.780> Christie<00:00:13.350> utilize<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.430> which<00:00:14.580> was<00:00:14.790> a

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
hardware Christie utilize it which was a

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.670 
hardware Christie utilize it which was a
camera<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.719> was<00:00:15.929> able<00:00:16.259> to<00:00:16.490> move<00:00:17.490> have<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
camera that was able to move have a

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.510 
camera that was able to move have a
pan-tilt-zoom<00:00:20.180> kind<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.270> thing<00:00:21.419> so<00:00:22.340> many<00:00:23.340> was

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
pan-tilt-zoom kind of thing so many was

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.979 
pan-tilt-zoom kind of thing so many was
telling<00:00:23.820> me<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> lot<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.509> times<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.930> was

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:24.989 
telling me that a lot of times I was

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.519 
telling me that a lot of times I was
like<00:00:25.849> you<00:00:26.849> guys<00:00:27.180> had<00:00:27.360> webcast<00:00:27.869> or<00:00:28.169> meetings

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
like you guys had webcast or meetings

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.979 
like you guys had webcast or meetings
etc<00:00:28.800> over<00:00:29.489> that<00:00:29.669> and<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.360> have<00:00:30.509> to<00:00:30.720> meet

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
etc over that and you have to meet

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.020 
etc over that and you have to meet
hanselman<00:00:31.439> set<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.919> camera<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.489> track

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
hanselman set up a camera to track

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.639 
hanselman set up a camera to track
people<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.050> that's<00:00:34.230> what<00:00:34.500> they're

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
people so but that's what they're

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.660 
people so but that's what they're
separated<00:00:35.190> screen<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.890> what<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.130> came<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.399> with

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
separated screen so what I came up with

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.579 
separated screen so what I came up with
the<00:00:38.760> idea<00:00:38.790> was<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.270> use<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.750> Kinect<00:00:40.079> to

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
the idea was to use the Kinect to

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.610 
the idea was to use the Kinect to
actually<00:00:41.570> track<00:00:42.570> someone<00:00:42.929> and<00:00:43.140> keep<00:00:43.320> them<00:00:43.469> in

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
actually track someone and keep them in

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.869 
actually track someone and keep them in
the<00:00:43.710> center<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.219> we've<00:00:44.399> got<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.699> connect

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
the center so we've got to connect

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.700 
the center so we've got to connect
tracking<00:00:47.879> Manning<00:00:48.269> we<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.839> it<00:00:49.199> feeding

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
tracking Manning we have it feeding

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.430 
tracking Manning we have it feeding
information<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.149> camera<00:00:51.660> telling

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
information to this can camera telling

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.180 
information to this can camera telling
it<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:53.600> basically<00:00:54.600> keep<00:00:55.440> Manning<00:00:55.859> the<00:00:55.949> center

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it to basically keep Manning the center

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.130 
it to basically keep Manning the center
of<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> screen<00:00:56.519> so<00:00:57.120> wherever<00:00:57.300> he<00:00:57.510> moves<00:00:57.780> well

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
of the screen so wherever he moves well

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.939 
of the screen so wherever he moves well
she'll<00:00:59.039> play<00:00:59.309> prepped<00:00:59.730> my<00:00:59.909> scope<00:01:00.710> so<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.800> long

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
she'll play prepped my scope so as long

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.799 
she'll play prepped my scope so as long
as<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.550> kinect<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:02.999> see<00:01:03.239> him<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.629> will

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
as it the kinect can see him it will

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.000 
as it the kinect can see him it will
zoom<00:01:03.839> and<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.379> actually<00:01:04.559> feeding

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
zoom and it's actually feeding

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.149 
zoom and it's actually feeding
independently<00:01:05.820> into<00:01:06.600> another<00:01:07.560> computer<00:01:07.770> so

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
independently into another computer so

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.430 
independently into another computer so
the<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.640> two<00:01:08.850> different<00:01:09.150> color<00:01:09.840> images<00:01:10.290> are

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
the the two different color images are

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.900 
the the two different color images are
independent<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.040> each<00:01:11.190> other<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
independent of each other it's just the

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.490 
independent of each other it's just the
kinect<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.540> could<00:01:12.690> really<00:01:12.870> this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
kinect so this could really this

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.680 
kinect so this could really this
software<00:01:13.740> could<00:01:14.100> work<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.370> any<00:01:14.610> camera<00:01:14.940> long

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
software could work on any camera long

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.820 
software could work on any camera long
that<00:01:15.990> had<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:17.430> capabilities<00:01:18.500> so<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> next

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that had the capabilities so the next

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.020 
that had the capabilities so the next
thing<00:01:19.980> that<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.730> came<00:01:20.940> up<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.390> was

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
thing that we came up with was

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.609 
thing that we came up with was
you<00:01:22.540> might<00:01:22.690> have<00:01:22.869> a<00:01:22.900> couple<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.320> people<00:01:25.619> in

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
you might have a couple of people in

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:27.780 
you might have a couple of people in
this<00:01:26.770> meeting<00:01:27.159> they<00:01:27.310> might<00:01:27.490> want<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:27.700> if

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
this meeting they might want it if

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.460 
this meeting they might want it if
you're<00:01:27.909> doing<00:01:28.150> a<00:01:28.240> Telecaster<00:01:29.049> over<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.320> web

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
you're doing a Telecaster over the web

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.310 
you're doing a Telecaster over the web
so<00:01:30.250> what<00:01:30.610> I<00:01:30.640> did<00:01:30.729> was<00:01:30.880> anytime<00:01:31.630> person<00:01:32.110> was<00:01:32.229> on

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
so what I did was anytime person was on

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.899 
so what I did was anytime person was on
the<00:01:32.409> screen<00:01:32.680> if<00:01:32.860> they<00:01:32.979> want<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.250> take<00:01:33.700> control

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
the screen if they want to take control

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.219 
the screen if they want to take control
the<00:01:34.180> camera<00:01:34.360> be<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.810> center<00:01:35.110> of<00:01:35.140> attention

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
the camera be the center of attention

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.350 
the camera be the center of attention
they<00:01:36.070> just<00:01:36.250> raise<00:01:36.490> their<00:01:36.759> hand<00:01:37.000> man<00:01:37.540> you<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
they just raise their hand man you so

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.850 
they just raise their hand man you so
raise<00:01:40.600> your<00:01:40.630> hand<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.170> it<00:01:41.380> starts<00:01:41.619> tracking

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
raise your hand and it starts tracking

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.370 
raise your hand and it starts tracking
them<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:43.540> again<00:01:43.899> that<00:01:44.110> could<00:01:44.229> be<00:01:44.350> changed

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
them that again that could be changed

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.980 
them that again that could be changed
anything<00:01:44.950> you<00:01:45.100> want<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:45.479> wonder<00:01:46.479> who<00:01:46.659> put<00:01:46.720> their

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
anything you want I wonder who put their

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.300 
anything you want I wonder who put their
hand<00:01:47.140> up<00:01:47.290> they<00:01:47.560> could<00:01:47.770> jump<00:01:48.460> or<00:01:48.670> whatever<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
hand up they could jump or whatever the

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.160 
hand up they could jump or whatever the
zooming<00:01:51.700> is<00:01:51.820> controlled<00:01:52.270> because<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.840> camera

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
zooming is controlled because the camera

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.499 
zooming is controlled because the camera
is<00:01:53.200> able<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.500> see<00:01:53.680> how<00:01:53.890> far<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.399> are<00:01:54.460> no<00:01:55.270> meter

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
is able to see how far you are no meter

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.870 
is able to see how far you are no meter
wide<00:01:55.690> is<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.990> ease<00:01:56.140> thresholds<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.670> pan

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
wide is to ease thresholds and the pan

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.540 
wide is to ease thresholds and the pan
tilt<00:01:58.149> is<00:01:58.390> just<00:01:58.630> again<00:01:58.929> using<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.560> skeleton

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.640 

so<00:02:04.120> I<00:02:04.210> could<00:02:04.390> be<00:02:04.480> moving<00:02:04.840> independent<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:05.470> him

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
so I could be moving independent of him

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.350 
so I could be moving independent of him
we<00:02:06.070> actually<00:02:06.490> tried<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:06.790> sitting<00:02:07.180> down

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
we actually tried this sitting down

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.300 
we actually tried this sitting down
yesterday<00:02:07.660> like<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.260> POS<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.010> works<00:02:09.160> like

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
yesterday like a POS and it works like
