00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.540
 hello today we're going to show you something that was 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.540
 quite expected the new ipad mini 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.240
 you will wonder what is the great 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.020
 novelty offered by the mini pair 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.759
 basically it's an ipad2 with one with two 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.880
 big differences has a size 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:32.140
 less than how you can check and it's 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.140
 rather thinner 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.910
 and one of the big differences that yes 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:45.470
 that has this program at least inside 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.710
 of the iPad mini is that if one touches inside 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.400
 of the margin as you see are very narrow 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.080
 nothing happens 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.210
 It seems like we have not done anything yet 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.910
 anyway the margin is still 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.340
 As you can see assets to pass the 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.320
 page but if you just grab it 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.600
 the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.930
 the program does not react to the pass of the 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.930
 cabin 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.530
 As you can see we can see the videos 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.890
 with the same characteristics with the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.220
 that we would see them on a classic ipad but 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.840
 in this case it is quite more portable 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.500
 tiny and lightweight fits in any 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.500
 joy 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.060
 here we see the ipad mini compared to the 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.950
 classic ipad though it will not really be 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.130
 as classic as the ipad mini 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.900
 this is also new the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.270
 same day and it's the fourth ipad 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.340
 generation the only 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.170
 great difference that we can find 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.259
 compared to the third generation at 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.760
 that was presented six months ago is this 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.850
 connector that is the lightning that is the 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.990
 it opened with the iphone 5 and that 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.740
 it replaces the 30-pin connector and the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.020
 internal chip that carries the 6 x that is a 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.650
 chip that basically doubles the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.550
 already very good capacities that had the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.550
 third generation ipad 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.950
 good friends you've seen the ipad 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.950
 mini until the next link
