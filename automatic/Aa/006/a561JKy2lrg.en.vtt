00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.139
 as federanziani 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.840
 we reiterate our will to be 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.090
 next to the institutions to help 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.110
 evolve and support the challenges of the 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.790
 future and the first challenge for everyone 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.599
 we know is that of aging 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.599
 of the population 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:34.180
 but you noticed that the partner model 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:39.010
 current welfare health care is not 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:42.429
 still that of long-lived companies me 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:48.969
 I ask what will happen to ours 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:53.350
 nation when in 2050 one person out of five 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:56.489
 will have more than 60 years we have the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.350
 material tools but above all 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.870
 that strategic vision to make 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.199
 possible for citizens and patients 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:10.030
 chronic those of today and those of 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.220
 tomorrow it's around the corner they can 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.870
 still access to care within 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:20.560
 a sustainable health system will be 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.660
 possible or one day minister there 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.690
 we will find another type of 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.830
 discussion as we tell him he died 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.830
 the national health service 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.480
 all this happens because we have 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.810
 created a civilization that has 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:43.290
 produced an explosive progress 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.090
 in the demographic field and how we have it 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.600
 emphasized on the European day with 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.689
 ms globalization also means 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.740
 look beyond the borders but we are 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.479
 governing health globalization 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:02.369
 or health globalization does 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.979
 governing us and how we can look 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.330
 beyond when it is barely possible 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.310
 talk about sustainable health 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.920
 when we live in a system based 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.860
 on stubborn competition between the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.670
 regions created by past choices 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.450
 wrong policies with disparity that 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.450
 persist between the regional systems and that 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.250
 indeed they are more evident than in the past 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.910
 decentralization of powers and 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.269
 functions was seen as the panacea 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.299
 for all but an instrument has been found 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.760
 inadequate for the solution of so many 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:45.030
 problems and in particular that 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.820
 of equity precisely because the regions 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.010
 they play an important role then 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.780
 emerge more and more clearly 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.510
 lack of programming knowledge 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.400
 of strategy by many 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.870
 administrations and many children 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.510
 there are local decision makers 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.420
 need to strongly affirm one 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.659
 solidarity vision of exchange and 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.280
 shared growth but up to where it comes from 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.280
 today our brotherhood 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.579
 the challenge we face is one 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.500
 economic challenge of the health of the 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:31.190
 sustainability but know that one 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:37.099
 colossal reach and the great crisis that 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:42.440
 everyone says it's not an economic crisis it is 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:47.090
 a political crisis because man 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.069
 Today's politician does not govern forces 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.940
 that unleashed by those politicians 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.859
 previous us from federanziani noi 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:00.440
 Senior citizens 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:04:04.760
 we come into the world to live trying to 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:09.709
 be happy to stay healthy together 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:13.220
 to our loved ones because life is short and 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:16.569
 he leaves and health is the most good 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.569
 precious that we have 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.240
 this minister is federanziani 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:42.850
 and you look around we have the here 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.850
 friends of Sicily 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:51.560
 the lombardi the emiliani 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:56.720
 the Tuscans and Calabrians 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.070
 the Sardinian Piedmontese and many others from Campania 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:06.190
 of each region of Italy 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:06.190
 but however also the Lazio 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.650
 but we are all Italian ministers 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:23.590
 certainly some of you are here today 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:28.300
 discriminated against for health reasons but 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:33.520
 for us of federanziani this does not count 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:38.020
 the more you all know we are leaving 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:42.490
 for a challenging journey where 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:46.630
 we will work together and live like one 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:50.650
 family where the person next to 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:55.050
 you will look towards your own 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:59.139
 goals we will find ourselves fighting 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.780
 logic against insidious enemies 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.759
 accounting of the regions i 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.620
 partisan interests 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.750
 age discrimination in 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.080
 dispensation of care 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.660
 the bureaucratic dullness the decrees that 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.830
 they would like to determine who should be 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.710
 treated with dignity and who not so by 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:24.570
 divide us into serial citizens and of 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.570
 series b but 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:35.909
 if you approve what is proposed of these 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:40.199
 three days we will be able to do a lot 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:46.610
 I cannot guarantee that we will win 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:52.680
 all the battles but I promise you that 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:57.330
 this team of clairvoyance in the moment 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:07:00.860
 in which we will need to commit to 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:04.289
 conflict to fight 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:07.770
 federanziani and the people who have 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:09.780
 the honor of representing it will be before us 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.000
 to institutions 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.349
 we will be the first to go down to the field of 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.550
 battle and the last to abandon it e 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:22.680
 we will never leave anyone behind 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:26.960
 with its problems 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.960
 who agrees with me raise your hand 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.970
 came out
