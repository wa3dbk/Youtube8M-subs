00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:06.120
 we are going to do in impressionistic glicineas for that we take magenta 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.120
 loading with the idea that the humidity of the painting lasts in the base 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.970
 if we make a kind of cluster 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.970
 and with the purple 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.169
 we give the part of the shadow 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.999
 with a round round brush and white 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:31.149
 we are giving brushstrokes from the finer end upwards 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.630
 as you see it is mixing 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.860
 with the color that down there that will allow us 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.220
 see the volume 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.980
 we give brushstrokes 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.040
 whenever we load 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.020
 the white dee brush we started with the clear part 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.840
 and then we continue 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.840
 towards the dark part from time to time we do not go out we do incoming 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.300
 I was doing the dark part 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.570
 we are giving paintbrushes 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.050
 we follow 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.880
 we give the forms 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.880
 we have to get is the progression of the color of light and shadow 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.080
 to give us 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.300
 the relief 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.740
 with a little brown and ocher 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.630
 let's make small twigs 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.850
 which are the ones that hold the flowers together 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.170
 we make twigs 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.169
 and now we make the trunk 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:39.019
 we have decided that this part be the shadow 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.579
 and this one has more light 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:51.749
 there we have a glycine 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:58.579
 the leaves that correspond to the glycine are of the same type 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.939
 with which we do 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.489
 we take light green dark green 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.979
 the area of ​​light is on this side 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:12.369
 and we make a small bunch of leaves 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.309
 let's catch more 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.049
 we unload 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.019
 we go there because the paper dries everything 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:40.589
 we reload 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:03.319
 that would be the type of leaves that correspond to the glycines 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.249
 another type of impressionist flower with these same colors 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:09.699
 it could be the hydrangea
