00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
we're gonna raise in something today I'm

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.379 
we're gonna raise in something today I'm
going<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.500> be<00:00:07.560> testing<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.250> new<00:00:08.490> art<00:00:08.910> resin

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
going to be testing the new art resin

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
photograph by our friend Ron Smith and

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.429 
photograph by our friend Ron Smith and
it's<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.210> great<00:00:15.450> way<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.660> show<00:00:15.900> off<00:00:15.929> your<00:00:16.080> photos

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.410 

so<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.650> test<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.100> resin<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.640> came<00:00:20.820> up<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.000> a

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
so to test this resin I came up with a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.450 
so to test this resin I came up with a
checklist<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:22.260> all<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.100> characteristics

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
checklist of all the characteristics

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.759 
checklist of all the characteristics
that<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.510> resin<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.930> need<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.260> have<00:00:25.410> if<00:00:25.650> we're

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
that this resin we need to have if we're

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.490 
that this resin we need to have if we're
going<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.949> stand<00:00:26.160> behind<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.730> sell<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:26.970> and

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
going to stand behind it and sell it and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.540 
going to stand behind it and sell it and
really<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.680> has<00:00:28.859> been<00:00:29.010> two<00:00:29.220> years<00:00:29.250> in

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
really this has been two years in

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.659 
really this has been two years in
development<00:00:30.170> so<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.349> hot<00:00:31.590> priority<00:00:32.219> for<00:00:32.520> art

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
development so it's hot priority for art

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.520 
development so it's hot priority for art
resin<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.239> wanted<00:00:33.510> our<00:00:33.660> new<00:00:33.809> product<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.380> be

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
resin is we wanted our new product to be

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.049 
resin is we wanted our new product to be
very<00:00:34.860> safe<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.940> product<00:00:36.390> has<00:00:36.630> no<00:00:37.380> VOCs<00:00:38.059> no

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
very safe this product has no VOCs no

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.900 
very safe this product has no VOCs no
fumes<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.899> low<00:00:40.110> odor<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.010> makes<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.489> much

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
fumes and a low odor so it makes it much

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.990 
fumes and a low odor so it makes it much
more<00:00:42.660> safe<00:00:43.410> than<00:00:43.800> anything<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.430> most

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
more safe than anything that most

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.549 
more safe than anything that most
artists<00:00:45.239> are<00:00:45.360> using<00:00:45.510> currently<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
artists are using currently on the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.400 
artists are using currently on the
market<00:00:46.829> next<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> list<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.899> wanted<00:00:49.230> our

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
market next on the list we wanted our

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.500 
market next on the list we wanted our
tress<00:00:49.620> into<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> UV<00:00:50.160> stabilized<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.360> added

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
tress into the UV stabilized so we added

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.630 
tress into the UV stabilized so we added
UV<00:00:51.809> stabilizers<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.649> another<00:00:53.460> chemical

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
UV stabilizers and another chemical

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.090 
UV stabilizers and another chemical
called<00:00:53.879> hauls<00:00:54.660> which<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.800> keeps<00:00:55.980> your

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
called hauls which just keeps your

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.369 
called hauls which just keeps your
artwork<00:00:56.430> looking<00:00:56.699> clear<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.270> beautiful<00:00:57.870> for

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
artwork looking clear and beautiful for

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.639 
artwork looking clear and beautiful for
longer<00:00:58.680> now<00:00:58.969> alongside<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.359> obviously<00:01:01.350> we

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
longer now alongside that obviously we

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.650 
longer now alongside that obviously we
wanted<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.219> very<00:01:02.460> clear<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.000> we're

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
wanted it to be very clear and we're

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.820 
wanted it to be very clear and we're
happy<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.379> well

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
happy with that as well

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.620 
happy with that as well
next<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.700> want<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.970> resin<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
next we want to resin to the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.649 
next we want to resin to the
user-friendly<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> formula<00:01:09.630> here

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
user-friendly so we have a formula here

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.690 
user-friendly so we have a formula here
that<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> one-to-one<00:01:10.650> mixing<00:01:11.100> ratio<00:01:11.430> which

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
that is a one-to-one mixing ratio which

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.310 
that is a one-to-one mixing ratio which
is<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> lot<00:01:12.119> easier<00:01:12.150> than<00:01:12.840> some<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.229> those

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
is a lot easier than some of those

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.020 
is a lot easier than some of those
formulas<00:01:13.920> out<00:01:14.070> there<00:01:14.130> which<00:01:14.490> are<00:01:14.640> two<00:01:14.790> two<00:01:14.909> one

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
formulas out there which are two two one

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.820 
formulas out there which are two two one
three<00:01:15.360> one<00:01:15.600> makes<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
three one makes it so that you have to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.130 
three one makes it so that you have to
do<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> lot<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> math<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:18.090> way<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.840> pour

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
do a lot of math this way you just pour

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.570 
do a lot of math this way you just pour
equal<00:01:19.439> parts<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.860> your<00:01:20.040> resin<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.430> your

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
equal parts of your resin and your

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.929 
equal parts of your resin and your
hardener<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.380> you're<00:01:22.380> good<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.670> piece

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
hardener and you're good so this piece

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.719 
hardener and you're good so this piece
is<00:01:23.970> about<00:01:24.240> two<00:01:24.659> square<00:01:25.020> feet<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.680> our<00:01:26.189> starter

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
is about two square feet and our starter

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.359 
is about two square feet and our starter
kit<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.150> 32<00:01:27.990> ounces<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.470> covers<00:01:28.740> roughly<00:01:28.950> eight

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
kit is 32 ounces it covers roughly eight

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.960 
kit is 32 ounces it covers roughly eight
square<00:01:29.820> feet<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:31.020> I'm<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.009> mix<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
square feet so I'm going to mix about a

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.289 
square feet so I'm going to mix about a
quarter<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:34.100> these<00:01:35.100> bottles<00:01:35.549> mix<00:01:36.150> them

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
quarter of these bottles mix them

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.330 
quarter of these bottles mix them
together<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.810> cover<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.380> particular<00:01:37.710> work

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
together to cover this particular work

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.920 
together to cover this particular work
and<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:39.180> means<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> could<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.810> about

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
and that means that I could do about

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.679 
and that means that I could do about
four<00:01:40.409> pieces<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.579> size<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.360> starter

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
four pieces this size with the starter

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.420 
four pieces this size with the starter
kit

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.950 

the<00:01:47.430> best<00:01:47.640> resin<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.150> has<00:01:48.300> got<00:01:48.480> to<00:01:48.510> have<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the best resin that has got to have a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.170 
the best resin that has got to have a
good<00:01:49.460> viscosity<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> don't<00:01:51.060> want

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
good viscosity to it you don't want

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.230 
good viscosity to it you don't want
anything<00:01:51.360> too<00:01:52.050> thick<00:01:52.320> or<00:01:52.590> too<00:01:52.620> thin<00:01:53.240> watery

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
anything too thick or too thin watery

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.600 
anything too thick or too thin watery
and<00:01:54.510> our<00:01:55.050> earthen<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.800> that<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.370> got

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
and our earthen is just that it's got

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:15.290 
and our earthen is just that it's got
the<00:01:56.730> viscosity<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.390> honey<00:01:58.110> let's<00:01:58.650> say

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.390 

so<00:02:16.300> not<00:02:17.020> many<00:02:17.319> bubbles<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.950> they<00:02:18.040> seem<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.250> be

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
so not many bubbles and they seem to be

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.770 
so not many bubbles and they seem to be
popping<00:02:18.849> on<00:02:18.970> their<00:02:19.060> own<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.330> ones<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.660> are

there<00:02:19.989> I'm<00:02:20.590> still<00:02:20.950> in<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.160> habit<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.550> using<00:02:21.730> a

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
there I'm still in the habit of using a

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.030 
there I'm still in the habit of using a
flame<00:02:22.330> just<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.900> make<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.080> flawless<00:02:23.620> surface

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
flame just to make a flawless surface

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.750 
flame just to make a flawless surface
but<00:02:24.640> it's<00:02:24.970> not<00:02:25.239> necessary<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.190> cure<00:02:30.489> time

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
but it's not necessary so a cure time

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.120 
but it's not necessary so a cure time
about<00:02:31.150> eight<00:02:31.390> hours<00:02:31.930> which<00:02:32.410> means<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.950> you

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
about eight hours which means that you

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.740 
about eight hours which means that you
leave<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.640> overnight<00:02:33.849> and<00:02:34.239> it's<00:02:34.450> not

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
leave it overnight and it's not
