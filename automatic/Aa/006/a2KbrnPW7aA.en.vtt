00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
we're going to turn it on low so it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.380 
we're going to turn it on low so it
doesn't<00:02:32.250> splash<00:02:32.490> out<00:02:34.550> okay<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.790> then<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.060> beat

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
doesn't splash out okay and then I beat

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
leavening and mix that in there now I

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.880 
leavening and mix that in there now I
didn't<00:02:51.450> add<00:02:51.570> any<00:02:51.600> salt<00:02:51.810> because<00:02:52.440> there<00:02:52.620> is

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
what they are this way okay so now we

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.410 
what they are this way okay so now we
have<00:03:01.380> all<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.590> our<00:03:01.860> dry<00:03:02.070> ingredients<00:03:02.420> and

have all of our dry ingredients and
again<00:03:03.750> we're<00:03:03.900> gonna<00:03:03.959> mix<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.380> but<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.650> time

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
again we're gonna mix it but this time

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.350 
again we're gonna mix it but this time
we're<00:03:04.890> gonna<00:03:05.010> mix<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.340> on<00:03:05.430> low<00:03:05.489> because<00:03:06.239> we

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
we're gonna mix it on low because we

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.890 
we're gonna mix it on low because we
don't<00:03:06.720> want<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.260> flour<00:03:07.590> just<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:09.060> know<00:03:09.209> oops

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:18.869 
don't want the flour just you know oops
look<00:03:10.380> going<00:03:10.560> all<00:03:10.799> over<00:03:11.010> like<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:11.420> okay

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.720 

okay<00:03:19.879> now<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.299> is<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.510> good<00:03:20.840> idea<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:22.400> take<00:03:22.700> your

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
okay now it is a good idea to take your

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.780 
okay now it is a good idea to take your
spatula<00:03:23.599> and<00:03:23.629> to<00:03:24.409> just<00:03:24.890> kind<00:03:25.159> of<00:03:25.220> mix<00:03:25.549> the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
spatula and to just kind of mix the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.979 
spatula and to just kind of mix the
dough<00:03:25.909> around<00:03:26.150> in<00:03:26.269> case<00:03:26.420> there's<00:03:26.629> anything

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
dough around in case there's anything

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.660 
dough around in case there's anything
that's<00:03:27.319> at<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.709> bottom<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.099> hasn't<00:03:28.459> been

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
that's at the bottom that hasn't been

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.320 
that's at the bottom that hasn't been
mixed

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
mixed

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.210 
mixed
now<00:03:29.720> this<00:03:29.989> tends<00:03:30.319> to<00:03:30.440> happen<00:03:30.709> once<00:03:31.069> we're

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
now this tends to happen once we're

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.220 
now this tends to happen once we're
gonna<00:03:31.340> add<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.700> oats<00:03:31.910> so<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:32.390> really<00:03:33.019> want<00:03:33.170> to

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
bottom and you mix them up on the top

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.119

this<00:03:44.420> just<00:03:44.840> briefly

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.540 

okay<00:03:54.580> now<00:03:55.420> this<00:03:55.660> is<00:03:55.720> where<00:03:56.110> we're<00:03:56.290> gonna<00:03:56.550> flip

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
okay now this is where we're gonna flip

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
of course it's been tinkered with a

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.290 
of course it's been tinkered with a
little<00:04:07.270> bit<00:04:07.420> but<00:04:07.660> only<00:04:08.440> for<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.710> better<00:04:09.300> okay

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
little bit but only for the better okay

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.590
