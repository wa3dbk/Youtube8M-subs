00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:03.449
 camacho euros was the opposite at the request of all of you 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.670
 here is the video 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.320
 I examine it that my screen is like having in the background hi point 8 here 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:13.800
 on the screen of your computer 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.330
 because this part of what is useful to see it also serves to manage it 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.310
 from here as well as you can see from here uria 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.439
 I can raise and lower the screen 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:24.689
 change me 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.089
 options 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.249
 here is just let's say that touching the screen is the same as making a 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.839
 click every time I click, it's as if we were touching the screen 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:34.610
 time 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.850
 it is so good not to go 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.850
 noel the commands to move what they are are easy 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.900
 nothing more difficult as I told you 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.210
 to touch nothing else 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.559
 and to return to the jobs screen always 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.300
 is going to be worth the right jonquil that always give a right foot the greatest 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.860
 to the screen said 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.290
 and good when they give a left kit it's as if I touch the screen 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.690
 well then 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.300
 once cleared of 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.090
 the use of this application that the saving is that he 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.489
 more than anything is this to be able to see it today 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.770
 epn obviously they can do it aon 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.840
 something like how to put it in 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.539
 as per the black screen 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.020
 they can not do it 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.050
 walk from here so good so I'll go and simple 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.700
 Well, let's start being what it is 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.040

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.550
 Internet program to have it on your computer and the application for 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.480
 for Suarez as his deputy it's something simple, it's easy 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.810
 and so 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.950
 still few are expected that lacked if to have 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.810
 we hope we have 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.100
 with running running and running 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.140
 parker you said you had to act in Syria 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.360
 as if the southern part 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.360
 and here I am writing you bad application application name 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.330
 again in 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.370
 and here already steve slaton application what is said write v 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:12.409
 again p 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:13.869
 n 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:15.689
 ibon to worry 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.149
 this is how you write 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.149
 lighter is not that you have been sectioned have not installed 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.369
 and well he had installed this is not all they need in their 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.770
 struck out four 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.829
 and now let's go to the computer part 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.100
 oscar parra to be with the painter 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.100
 they have to go to the gala page that who handles the right part of the 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.109
 video screen 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.449
 what is going to be something like this 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.719
 because when they see pages of the neighborhood an image more or less like this 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:45.610
 i 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.559
 aquesta to download it to go to whose party 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:49.969

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.739
 and here says a part that says windows 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.199
 here in this part you can see 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.199
 This name of the file must be downloaded 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:09.119
 This is the one that sends you down, they click you 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:12.529
 a razor and recommended clear on your desk to make it easier and 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:14.369
 is going to give you an 8 or so 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.819
 rather it is highly like that 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.829
 what you have to do is open it 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.839
 Iraq and the only thing they will need 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:23.719
 is the one that says pnc 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.719
 cover and double uve rebounded this 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.409
 let's get it out here 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.169
 this icon will give you this 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.489
 almost like a 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.569
 like a little boy a patient 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.569
 they will not open 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:43.079
 here what are they going to do in this local part to beings that are going to put him 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:45.110
 at 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.159
 in the entity from its 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.089
 from his alfonso al poto 8 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:52.089
 simple spin already know all ponce acerinox 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:58.429
 of cervix foncea warfare 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:00.460
 from here 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.570
 we already know how to adapt to the flequita casaquintas com 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:07.069
 and here we already have our piano present 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.489
 this what we are going to write 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.249
 where it says xenserver comes 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:14.449
 let's exclude from printing 192 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.269
 together 168 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.279
 next to two points 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.379
 and once they are written this is only going to give 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.849
 here as you can see send sport 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:29.439
 bothers us screen 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:30.390

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.650
 yes yes they accept how they accept to connect their podium to this server 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.969

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.550
 I wanted to have two 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.550
 and this what is going to happen when accepting is going to be extreme 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.470
 Well, well, I do not think 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.469
 that was it 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.949
 in structural vicens and love 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.199
