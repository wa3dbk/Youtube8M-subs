this is the the pouch that goes inside
the<00:01:56.250> case<00:01:56.430> here<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> nice<00:01:57.149> little<00:01:57.210> case

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
the case here so it's a nice little case

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.690 
the case here so it's a nice little case
these<00:01:58.469> really<00:01:58.770> won't<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.040> leaving<00:01:59.280> my<00:01:59.520> house

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
these really won't be leaving my house

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.120 
these really won't be leaving my house
so<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.420> do<00:02:00.540> enjoy<00:02:00.780> having<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.710> hard<00:02:01.920> case

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
so I really do enjoy having a hard case

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.010 
so I really do enjoy having a hard case
a<00:02:02.189> shell<00:02:02.670> case<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.030> protect<00:02:03.210> them

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
a shell case to protect them

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.020 
a shell case to protect them
when<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.350> do<00:02:04.470> actually<00:02:04.920> move<00:02:05.610> them<00:02:05.790> somewhere

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
when I do actually move them somewhere

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.630 
when I do actually move them somewhere
so<00:02:06.840> these<00:02:06.930> are<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.170> headphones<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.460> saw

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
so these are the headphones like you saw

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.310 
so these are the headphones like you saw
they<00:02:08.910> are<00:02:09.180> not<00:02:09.390> actually<00:02:09.780> connected<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
they are not actually connected to the

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.230 
they are not actually connected to the
cable<00:02:10.710> that's<00:02:11.190> because<00:02:11.550> right<00:02:11.760> here<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
cable that's because right here on the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.910 
cable that's because right here on the
left<00:02:12.420> hand<00:02:12.570> side<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.440> can<00:02:13.590> connect<00:02:13.860> your

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
left hand side you can connect your

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.350 
left hand side you can connect your
three-and-a-half<00:02:14.370> millimeter<00:02:14.820> cable<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
three-and-a-half millimeter cable and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.530 
three-and-a-half millimeter cable and
that<00:02:16.140> will<00:02:16.350> be<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.610> case<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:18.000> damage<00:02:18.390> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that will be so in case you damage the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.700 
that will be so in case you damage the
cable<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.930> don't<00:02:19.110> have<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.290> buy<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> whole<00:02:19.650> new

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
cable you don't have to buy a whole new

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.220 
cable you don't have to buy a whole new
pair<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.040> headphones<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:21.420> taking<00:02:21.810> an<00:02:21.900> actual

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
pair of headphones so taking an actual

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.930 
pair of headphones so taking an actual
hardware<00:02:22.710> tour<00:02:22.920> before<00:02:23.160> we<00:02:23.310> talk<00:02:23.490> about<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
hardware tour before we talk about the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.450 
hardware tour before we talk about the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
sound and the comfortability these are

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.550 
sound and the comfortability these are

website<00:02:30.750> but<00:02:30.960> I'm<00:02:31.050> going<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> go<00:02:31.320> over<00:02:31.470> with<00:02:31.560> it

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.680 
website but I'm going to go over with it
anyway<00:02:31.980> this<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> little<00:02:33.120> aluminum<00:02:33.540> on<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
anyway this is a little aluminum on the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.110 
anyway this is a little aluminum on the
left-hand<00:02:34.110> side<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.620> course<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.520> part<00:02:35.820> here

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
left-hand side of course this part here

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.890 
left-hand side of course this part here
is<00:02:36.440> adjustable<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.590> it's<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.160> little<00:02:38.370> bit<00:02:38.490> less

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
is adjustable so it's a little bit less

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.870 
is adjustable so it's a little bit less
fragile<00:02:39.900> than<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.530> solo<00:02:40.980> HD<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.610> would<00:02:41.730> say

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
fragile than this solo HD is I would say

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.300 
fragile than this solo HD is I would say
much<00:02:42.090> more<00:02:42.150> sturdy<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:43.770> happens<00:02:44.130> on<00:02:44.280> both

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
much more sturdy that happens on both

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.040 
much more sturdy that happens on both
sides<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.970> there<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.120> course<00:02:45.150> labeled<00:02:45.780> right

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
sides and there of course labeled right

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.290 
sides and there of course labeled right
and<00:02:46.230> left<00:02:46.440> these<00:02:47.310> are<00:02:47.460> noise<00:02:47.760> cancelling

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
and left these are noise cancelling

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.360 
and left these are noise cancelling
headphones<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.990> you'll<00:02:49.140> have<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.890> triple-a

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
headphones so you'll have the triple-a

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.100 
headphones so you'll have the triple-a
batteries<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:50.910> here<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.360> there's<00:02:51.840> also<00:02:51.990> a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
batteries in here and there's also a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.650 
batteries in here and there's also a
power<00:02:52.410> button<00:02:52.710> right<00:02:53.640> there<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:54.090> our<00:02:54.120> power

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
power button right there so our power

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.390 
power button right there so our power
switch<00:02:54.990> you<00:02:55.200> flick<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.620> actually<00:02:56.160> I'll<00:02:56.280> go

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
switch you flick it actually I'll go

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.920 
switch you flick it actually I'll go
ahead<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:56.610> turn<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:56.880> for<00:02:57.090> you

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
ahead and turn it on for you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.660 
ahead and turn it on for you
when<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.320> turn<00:02:58.530> them<00:02:58.740> on<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.040> get<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> little

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
when you turn them on you get a little

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.330 
when you turn them on you get a little
amber<00:03:00.090> light<00:03:00.300> here<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.830> it'll<00:03:01.830> be<00:03:01.950> red<00:03:02.160> when

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
amber light here and it'll be red when

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.950 
amber light here and it'll be red when
they're<00:03:02.490> on<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.880> it'll<00:03:03.360> turn<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.690> different

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
they're on and it'll turn a different

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.740 
they're on and it'll turn a different
color<00:03:04.170> when<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.070> batteries<00:03:05.430> are<00:03:05.460> loved<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.940> say

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
color when the batteries are loved I say

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.720 
color when the batteries are loved I say
battery<00:03:07.140> because<00:03:07.470> we<00:03:07.620> can<00:03:07.770> open<00:03:07.950> up<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.459> on

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
battery because we can open up this on
