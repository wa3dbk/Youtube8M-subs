set this up as fast as we can we claim
we<00:00:21.119> can<00:00:21.270> do<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.510> under<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.810> minute

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
we can do it under a minute

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.580 
we can do it under a minute
but<00:00:22.859> see<00:00:23.400> how<00:00:23.550> much<00:00:23.730> faster<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.269> can<00:00:24.420> do<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:27.590> all

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
but see how much faster we can do it all

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.870 
but see how much faster we can do it all

out of the box as soon as we touch bag

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.090 
out of the box as soon as we touch bag
to<00:00:39.210> ground<00:00:39.450> we'll<00:00:40.079> get<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.559> about<00:00:40.739> 60

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
to ground we'll get up in about 60

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:57.770 
to ground we'll get up in about 60

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
keep your tent stakes here to the side

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.609 
keep your tent stakes here to the side
for<00:01:04.530> later<00:01:06.080> then<00:01:07.080> you're<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.320> spread

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
for later then you're going to spread

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.660 
for later then you're going to spread
the<00:01:07.710> fabric<00:01:07.890> around

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.690 

let<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.330> tools<00:01:11.600> drop<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.140> ground<00:01:12.700> while

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
let the tools drop to the ground while

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.870 
let the tools drop to the ground while
still<00:01:14.000> holding<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:14.420> center<00:01:14.930> hub<00:01:15.580> up<00:01:16.580> right<00:01:16.760> in

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
still holding the center hub up right in

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.400 
still holding the center hub up right in
the<00:01:16.940> middle<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.360> then<00:01:17.930> you're<00:01:18.050> going<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:18.230> fold

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
the middle and then you're going to fold

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.680 
the middle and then you're going to fold
out<00:01:18.560> each<00:01:18.770> one<00:01:19.040> of<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:19.220> top<00:01:19.400> poles<00:01:19.700> this

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
out each one of the top poles this

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.270 
out each one of the top poles this
basically<00:01:21.020> grab<00:01:21.260> the<00:01:21.410> pole<00:01:21.620> and<00:01:21.830> pull<00:01:22.040> towards

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
basically grab the pole and pull towards

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.750 
basically grab the pole and pull towards
you

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.640 

for<00:01:25.760> all<00:01:25.850> six<00:01:26.150> poles<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:30.140> then<00:01:30.290> if<00:01:30.410> you<00:01:30.500> look

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
for all six poles and then if you look

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.010 
for all six poles and then if you look
carefully<00:01:30.910> at<00:01:31.910> the<00:01:32.150> full<00:01:32.360> structure<00:01:32.690> there'll

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
carefully at the full structure there'll

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.110 
carefully at the full structure there'll
be<00:01:33.050> four<00:01:33.320> poles<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:33.770> will<00:01:33.920> extend<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.580> it'll

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
be four poles that will extend and it'll

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.270 
be four poles that will extend and it'll
be<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.270> bigger<00:01:35.570> pull<00:01:35.840> in<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.620> little<00:01:36.770> pull<00:01:37.040> you're

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
be a bigger pull in a little pull you're

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.430 
be a bigger pull in a little pull you're
going<00:01:37.400> to<00:01:37.460> want<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.670> grab<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.970> little<00:01:38.210> pull

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
going to want to grab the little pull

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.810 
going to want to grab the little pull
pull<00:01:39.440> out<00:01:39.590> as<00:01:39.710> far<00:01:39.950> as<00:01:39.980> you<00:01:40.130> can<00:01:40.340> -<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:40.610> hear<00:01:40.790> a

pull out as far as you can - you hear a

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.969 
pull out as far as you can - you hear a
click<00:01:41.120> and<00:01:41.270> it's<00:01:41.570> locked<00:01:41.750> in<00:01:41.930> place<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:42.890> you're

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
click and it's locked in place so you're

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:43.870 
click and it's locked in place so you're
going<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.130> want<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.400> do<00:01:43.460> that<00:01:43.580> four<00:01:43.850> times

going to want to do that four times
pulls<00:01:44.870> in<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.050> front<00:01:45.350> two<00:01:45.590> poles<00:01:45.830> in<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.070> back

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
pulls in the front two poles in the back

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.090 
pulls in the front two poles in the back
important<00:01:47.720> thing<00:01:47.870> to<00:01:47.990> remember<00:01:48.229> is<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.890> two

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
important thing to remember is the two

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.160 
important thing to remember is the two
side<00:01:49.370> poles<00:01:50.380> there's<00:01:51.380> no<00:01:51.560> need<00:01:51.770> for<00:01:51.800> those<00:01:52.070> two

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
side poles there's no need for those two

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.270 
side poles there's no need for those two
telescope<00:01:54.170> out<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:54.560> just<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.860> four<00:01:55.040> corner

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
telescope out so just the four corner

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.450 
telescope out so just the four corner
poles<00:01:55.520> work<00:01:55.729> saying<00:01:56.800> ok<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:58.040> once<00:01:58.310> that's

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
poles work saying ok and once that's

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.680

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
is go around to the six leg poles and

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.160 
is go around to the six leg poles and
you<00:02:01.880> want<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.180> going<00:02:02.540> to<00:02:02.660> want<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.840> work<00:02:02.960> from

front to back to get them up correctly

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.490 
front to back to get them up correctly
without<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.570> tent<00:02:05.780> being<00:02:05.960> too<00:02:06.110> awkward

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
without the the tent being too awkward

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
so you're going to grab the top hub

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.199 
so you're going to grab the top hub
section<00:02:09.260> pull<00:02:09.890> on<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.550> bottom<00:02:10.670> hole<00:02:11.000> and

it's<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.180> same<00:02:58.359> step

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
it's the same step

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.020 
it's the same step
just<00:02:59.409> let<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.680> six<00:02:59.889> leg<00:03:00.040> folds<00:03:00.310> fall<00:03:00.700> push

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
just let the six leg folds fall push

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.420 
just let the six leg folds fall push
push<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:01.540> button<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.470> pull<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.769> telescope<00:03:03.250> in

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.250 

and<00:03:10.180> once<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:10.450> get<00:03:10.570> it<00:03:10.690> down<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.840> this<00:03:11.020> level

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
and once you get it down to this level

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.710 
and once you get it down to this level
just<00:03:11.530> go<00:03:11.650> ahead<00:03:11.740> and<00:03:11.950> push<00:03:12.100> those<00:03:12.720> silver

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
just go ahead and push those silver

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.800 
just go ahead and push those silver
buttons<00:03:14.050> we<00:03:14.650> slide<00:03:14.920> those<00:03:15.100> four<00:03:15.310> poles<00:03:15.550> in

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
buttons we slide those four poles in

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.790 
buttons we slide those four poles in
just<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.900> same<00:03:17.080> way<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.230> did<00:03:17.440> when<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.590> set

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
just the same way you did when you set

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.360 
just the same way you did when you set
it<00:03:17.830> up<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:22.410> then<00:03:23.410> basically<00:03:23.770> just<00:03:23.890> going<00:03:24.280> to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
it up and then basically just going to

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.260 
it up and then basically just going to
push<00:03:24.550> these<00:03:24.760> four<00:03:25.090> or<00:03:25.930> these<00:03:26.170> two<00:03:26.320> poles<00:03:26.560> in

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
push these four or these two poles in

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.480 
push these four or these two poles in
first<00:03:28.270> just<00:03:28.690> push<00:03:28.960> on<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.260> hub<00:03:29.410> directly<00:03:30.340> in

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
first just push on the hub directly in

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.450 
first just push on the hub directly in
towards<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:30.940> tent<00:03:31.150> put<00:03:31.840> your<00:03:31.990> hand<00:03:32.170> here

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
towards the tent put your hand here

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.490 
towards the tent put your hand here
and<00:03:33.510> then<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.660> tent<00:03:34.870> will<00:03:34.960> collapse<00:03:35.200> in<00:03:35.410> on

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
and then the tent will collapse in on

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.500 
and then the tent will collapse in on
itself<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:36.010> then<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:36.250> grab<00:03:36.460> the<00:03:37.060> six<00:03:37.300> main

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
itself and then you grab the six main

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.300 
itself and then you grab the six main
folds<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:37.990> sweep<00:03:38.320> them<00:03:38.530> back<00:03:38.860> towards<00:03:39.220> the

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
folds and sweep them back towards the

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.490 
folds and sweep them back towards the
center<00:03:39.600> so<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:40.630> get<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.840> nice<00:03:41.050> tight<00:03:41.350> spiral

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
center so you get a nice tight spiral

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.970 
center so you get a nice tight spiral
here<00:03:42.750> then<00:03:43.750> lift<00:03:44.050> each<00:03:44.290> one<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.620> leg<00:03:44.740> poles

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
here then lift each one of the leg poles

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:53.770 
here then lift each one of the leg poles
and<00:03:45.220> force<00:03:45.460> the<00:03:45.580> center<00:03:45.790> hub

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.210 

once<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.900> get<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.140> six<00:03:55.379> leg<00:03:55.560> holes<00:03:55.769> gathered

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
once you get the six leg holes gathered

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.420 
once you get the six leg holes gathered
I'm<00:03:57.180> going<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.390> take<00:03:57.540> one<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.250> scoops<00:03:59.250> of

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
I'm going to take one of the scoops of

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.910 
I'm going to take one of the scoops of
