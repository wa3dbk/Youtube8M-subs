00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.149 
it off and turn like that it turns back
and<00:01:11.490> blue<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.689> here's<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.560> where<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> cable

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and blue so here's the where the cable

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.980 
and blue so here's the where the cable
goes<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.850> goes<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.299> side<00:01:15.570> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
goes in it just goes on on the side and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.010 
goes in it just goes on on the side and
then<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.040> pretty<00:01:17.189> short<00:01:17.880> cable<00:01:18.420> which

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
then it's a pretty short cable which

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
then it's a pretty short cable which
it's<00:01:19.680> okay<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.400> any<00:01:20.430> clothes<00:01:20.790> which

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it's okay if you have any clothes which

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.390 
it's okay if you have any clothes which
I<00:01:21.119> guess<00:01:21.299> most<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.750> guys<00:01:21.840> are<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
I guess most of you guys are but if you

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.370 
I guess most of you guys are but if you
have<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.549> desktop<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.150> might<00:01:24.299> not<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
have a desktop that might not be the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.530 
have a desktop that might not be the
best<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.369> get<00:01:26.549> lengthier<00:01:26.909> cables

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
best so you can get lengthier cables

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.960 
best so you can get lengthier cables
I'm<00:01:27.840> pretty<00:01:28.500> sure<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.799> cable<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> microUSB

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
I'm pretty sure this cable is a microUSB

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.609 
I'm pretty sure this cable is a microUSB
which<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> same<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:31.079> most<00:01:31.290> phones

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:45.299 
actually touching it's just near so if

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:46.489 
actually touching it's just near so if
you<00:06:45.419> get<00:06:45.599> it<00:06:45.719> near<00:06:45.899> enough<00:06:46.079> to<00:06:46.199> turn<00:06:46.379> this

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:46.499 
you get it near enough to turn this

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:48.199 
you get it near enough to turn this
white<00:06:46.739> light<00:06:46.919> on<00:06:47.129> and<00:06:47.429> you<00:06:47.789> can<00:06:47.969> move<00:06:48.089> it

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:48.209 
white light on and you can move it
