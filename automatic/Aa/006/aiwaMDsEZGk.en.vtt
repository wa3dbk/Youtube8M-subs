built the quality into the clock I put

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.550 
built the quality into the clock I put
the<00:01:32.729> veneer<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.299> run<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> veneer<00:01:34.140> toward<00:01:34.470> the

the veneer and run the veneer toward the
center<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> clock<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:36.150> it's

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
center in the clock so it's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.350 
center in the clock so it's
perpendicular<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> door<00:01:37.500> frame<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.360> I

did this to strengthen this edge around

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.149 
did this to strengthen this edge around
here<00:01:41.670> I've<00:01:42.570> running<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.020> grain<00:01:43.259> toward<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.490 
here I've running the grain toward that
it<00:01:44.759> will<00:01:44.909> probably<00:01:45.149> never<00:01:45.329> split<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.990> break

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
it will probably never split a break

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.260 
it will probably never split a break
