00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.689 
isn't on the same level customization
wise<00:00:21.330> but<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.890> same<00:00:23.039> level<00:00:23.100> as<00:00:23.519> far

wise but it is on the same level as far

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.460 
wise but it is on the same level as far
as<00:00:23.789> innovation<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.480> concerned<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.109> let's<00:00:25.380> go

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
as innovation is concerned so let's go

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.779 
as innovation is concerned so let's go
into<00:00:25.619> our<00:00:25.740> settings<00:00:26.189> app<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.699> I'll<00:00:26.760> show

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
into our settings app here and I'll show

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.589 
into our settings app here and I'll show
you<00:00:27.140> what<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.349> tweak<00:00:28.650> aims<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.480> go

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
you what this tweak aims to do if you go

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.510 
you what this tweak aims to do if you go
down<00:00:30.720> here<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.109> should<00:00:31.349> see<00:00:31.380> clever<00:00:32.219> pin

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
down here you should see clever pin

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.959 
down here you should see clever pin
there<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:32.969> go<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.840> I'll<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:33.960> tap<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.469> and

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
there we go so I'll just tap on that and

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.330 
there we go so I'll just tap on that and
essentially<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.480> see<00:00:36.950> this<00:00:37.950> tweak

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
essentially as you can see this tweak

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.240 
essentially as you can see this tweak
allows<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.450> disable<00:00:40.050> your<00:00:40.170> passcode<00:00:40.710> when

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
allows you to disable your passcode when

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.850 
allows you to disable your passcode when
you<00:00:41.399> meet<00:00:41.579> certain<00:00:42.239> conditions<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.500> whenever

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you meet certain conditions so whenever

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.279 
you meet certain conditions so whenever
you're<00:00:43.980> connected<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> specific<00:00:45.149> network<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
you're connected to a specific network a

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.740 
you're connected to a specific network a

predefined pre-authorized network you

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.690 
predefined pre-authorized network you
can<00:00:48.899> disable<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.379> passcode<00:00:49.829> whenever<00:00:50.550> you're

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
can disable the passcode whenever you're

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.250 
can disable the passcode whenever you're
playing<00:00:51.000> music<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.809> disable<00:00:52.050> the

the network's now why is this useful you

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080 
the network's now why is this useful you
might<00:01:04.290> ask<00:01:04.500> well<00:01:05.100> say<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> Wi-Fi
