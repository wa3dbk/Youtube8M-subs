00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
already well I'm still in the shower so

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.830 
already well I'm still in the shower so
that<00:02:24.760> kind<00:02:25.760> of<00:02:25.819> sucks<00:02:26.060> but<00:02:26.569> then<00:02:26.720> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
that kind of sucks but then the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.390 
that kind of sucks but then the
conditioner<00:02:27.260> makes<00:02:27.440> up<00:02:27.770> for<00:02:27.980> its<00:02:28.129> lightweight

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
conditioner makes up for its lightweight

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.699 
conditioner makes up for its lightweight
but<00:02:28.849> it's<00:02:29.300> a<00:02:29.480> butter<00:02:29.720> smooth<00:02:30.110> on<00:02:30.349> your<00:02:30.500> hair
