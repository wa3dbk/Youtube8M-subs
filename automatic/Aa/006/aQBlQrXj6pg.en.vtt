there's<00:01:47.810> also<00:01:48.020> in<00:01:48.409> our<00:01:48.619> design<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:50.450> little

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
there's also in our design and a little

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.330 
there's also in our design and a little
bit<00:01:50.780> later<00:01:50.990> coming<00:01:51.470> up<00:01:51.590> pretty<00:01:51.740> soon<00:01:51.860> there's

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
bit later coming up pretty soon there's

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.690 
bit later coming up pretty soon there's
going<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.549> be<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.759> Volvo<00:01:53.530> t8<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.979> that's<00:01:55.520> a

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
going to be a Volvo t8 and that's a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.350 
going to be a Volvo t8 and that's a
plug-in<00:01:56.180> hybrid<00:01:56.560> model<00:01:57.560> we<00:01:58.310> saw<00:01:58.580> that<00:01:58.850> we

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
plug-in hybrid model we saw that we

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.350 
plug-in hybrid model we saw that we
haven't<00:01:59.630> driven<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:00.020> but<00:02:00.140> we<00:02:00.259> did<00:02:00.439> see<00:02:00.680> it<00:02:00.799> and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
haven't driven it but we did see it and

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.679 
haven't driven it but we did see it and
so<00:02:02.950> basically<00:02:03.950> it's<00:02:04.460> competing<00:02:05.030> in<00:02:05.299> a<00:02:05.479> mature

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
so basically it's competing in a mature

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.229 
so basically it's competing in a mature
class<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.619> three<00:02:06.920> row<00:02:07.070> luxury<00:02:07.490> SUV<00:02:07.939> there's<00:02:08.179> a

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239

this is a beautiful car beautiful SUV we

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.330 
this is a beautiful car beautiful SUV we
did<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.600> separate<00:02:45.110> walk<00:02:45.350> around<00:02:45.650> video<00:02:45.800> be<00:02:46.160> sure

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
did a separate walk around video be sure

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.770 
did a separate walk around video be sure
to<00:02:46.370> check<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:46.700> out<00:02:46.910> where<00:02:47.180> we<00:02:47.300> talk<00:02:47.510> about

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
to check that out where we talk about

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.340 
to check that out where we talk about
some<00:02:48.410> of<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.590> styling<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.870> third<00:02:51.140> reason

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
some of the styling and the third reason

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.330 
some of the styling and the third reason
is<00:02:51.740> it's<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.160> very<00:02:52.400> high-tech<00:02:52.700> vehicle<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:55.160> is

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
is it's a very high-tech vehicle this is

is it's a very high-tech vehicle this is
a<00:02:55.370> large<00:02:55.880> SUV<00:02:56.570> it's<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.380> three<00:02:57.620> row<00:02:57.770> SUV<00:02:58.250> as<00:02:58.400> I've

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
a large SUV it's a three row SUV as I've

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.220 
a large SUV it's a three row SUV as I've
said<00:02:58.880> probably<00:02:59.390> at<00:02:59.600> least<00:02:59.780> three<00:03:00.020> times

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
said probably at least three times

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.840 
said probably at least three times
already

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
already

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.850 
already
and<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:02.000> has<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.200> four-cylinder<00:03:03.200> engine

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
and it has a four-cylinder engine

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.900 
and it has a four-cylinder engine
now<00:03:04.780> we've<00:03:05.780> been<00:03:06.050> led<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.620> believe<00:03:06.910> probably

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
now we've been led to believe probably

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.490 
now we've been led to believe probably
most<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.240> our<00:03:08.360> lives<00:03:08.600> that<00:03:08.780> 4-cylinder

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
engines are for smaller cars well that's

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.040 
engines are for smaller cars well that's

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
can put it on dynamic and when we do

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.860 
can put it on dynamic and when we do
that<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:43.280> shift<00:03:43.580> points<00:03:44.060> all<00:03:44.239> of<00:03:44.450> a<00:03:44.540> sudden

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
suspension which is another option which

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.010 
suspension which is another option which
really<00:04:01.040> handles<00:04:01.690> bumps<00:04:02.690> and

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
really handles bumps and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.010 
really handles bumps and
cracks<00:04:04.740> an<00:04:05.070> irregular<00:04:05.790> road<00:04:06.030> surfaces<00:04:06.750> with

this<00:04:08.460> is<00:04:08.640> all-wheel-drive<00:04:09.030> we<00:04:09.630> have<00:04:09.750> not<00:04:09.960> had

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
this is all-wheel-drive we have not had

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.020 
this is all-wheel-drive we have not had
a<00:04:10.230> chance<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.740> take<00:04:10.920> it<00:04:11.070> off-road<00:04:11.340> but<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.760> bet

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
a chance to take it off-road but I bet

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.450 
a chance to take it off-road but I bet
it<00:04:12.180> probably<00:04:12.600> pays<00:04:12.780> big<00:04:13.050> dividends<00:04:13.500> there<00:04:14.190> as

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
it probably pays big dividends there as

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.110 
it probably pays big dividends there as
well<00:04:15.500> now<00:04:16.500> being<00:04:16.830> a<00:04:16.950> Volvo<00:04:17.280> this<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.550> loaded

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
well now being a Volvo this is loaded

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
would take me at least another ten

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.360 
would take me at least another ten
minutes<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.020> I'd<00:04:25.140> have<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.350> have<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.650> script<00:04:26.130> go
