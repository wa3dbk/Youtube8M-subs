making<00:00:20.650> music<00:00:21.039> with<00:00:21.130> iOS<00:00:21.550> devices<00:00:21.909> is<00:00:22.210> we<00:00:22.329> have

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
making music with iOS devices is we have

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.059 
making music with iOS devices is we have
these<00:00:22.569> various<00:00:22.900> apps<00:00:23.109> we<00:00:23.319> have<00:00:23.349> synthesizers

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:24.069 
these various apps we have synthesizers

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.470 
these various apps we have synthesizers
that<00:00:24.220> can<00:00:24.339> record<00:00:24.550> audio<00:00:24.759> we<00:00:25.149> have<00:00:25.179> drum

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
that can record audio we have drum

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.729 
that can record audio we have drum
machines<00:00:25.749> that<00:00:25.929> can<00:00:26.019> record<00:00:26.230> audio<00:00:26.439> and<00:00:26.679> of

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
machines that can record audio and of

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.139 
machines that can record audio and of
course<00:00:26.890> we<00:00:26.949> have<00:00:27.069> audio<00:00:27.189> recorders<00:00:27.789> as<00:00:27.939> well

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:28.149 
course we have audio recorders as well

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.239 
course we have audio recorders as well
and<00:00:28.539> there<00:00:28.989> are<00:00:29.019> copy/paste<00:00:29.710> utilities<00:00:30.220> that

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:30.249 
and there are copy/paste utilities that

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:32.100 
and there are copy/paste utilities that
allow<00:00:30.550> us<00:00:30.579> to<00:00:30.849> move<00:00:30.999> audio<00:00:31.359> from<00:00:31.929> say<00:00:32.079> a

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
allow us to move audio from say a

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.020 
allow us to move audio from say a
synthesizer<00:00:32.590> into<00:00:33.010> a<00:00:33.040> recorder<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:33.640> create

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
synthesizer into a recorder and create

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.940 
synthesizer into a recorder and create
multitrack<00:00:34.480> productions<00:00:34.960> that<00:00:35.200> way<00:00:35.350> but

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
multitrack productions that way but

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.500 
multitrack productions that way but
there's<00:00:36.100> been<00:00:36.250> no<00:00:36.400> way<00:00:36.550> up<00:00:36.730> until<00:00:36.880> now<00:00:37.210> of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
there's been no way up until now of

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.060 
there's been no way up until now of
actually<00:00:38.080> routing<00:00:38.440> audio<00:00:38.740> from<00:00:38.950> a

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
actually routing audio from a

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.830 
actually routing audio from a
synthesizer<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.700> drum<00:00:40.090> machine<00:00:40.210> or<00:00:40.660> another

audio application into a recording app

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.940 
audio application into a recording app
but<00:00:43.840> now<00:00:43.990> there<00:00:44.170> is<00:00:44.200> with<00:00:44.560> an<00:00:44.650> app<00:00:44.770> called

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
but now there is with an app called

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.190 
but now there is with an app called
audio<00:00:45.310> bus<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:46.300> audio<00:00:46.540> bus<00:00:46.720> is<00:00:46.900> actually<00:00:47.170> a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
audio bus the audio bus is actually a

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.560 
audio bus the audio bus is actually a
very<00:00:47.380> simple<00:00:47.560> app<00:00:47.890> we<00:00:48.820> open<00:00:49.060> it<00:00:49.150> up<00:00:49.240> and<00:00:49.480> there

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
very simple app we open it up and there

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.150 
very simple app we open it up and there
are<00:00:49.600> three<00:00:49.840> stages<00:00:50.080> or<00:00:50.410> three<00:00:50.590> slots<00:00:50.860> if<00:00:51.070> you

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
are three stages or three slots if you

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.560 
are three stages or three slots if you
will<00:00:51.340> there's<00:00:51.550> an<00:00:51.640> input<00:00:51.940> slot<00:00:52.180> here<00:00:52.450> an

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
will there's an input slot here an

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.110 
will there's an input slot here an
effect<00:00:53.080> slot<00:00:53.350> and<00:00:53.590> an<00:00:53.650> output<00:00:53.980> slot<00:00:54.190> now<00:00:55.000> we

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
effect slot and an output slot now we

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.240 
effect slot and an output slot now we
can<00:00:55.240> install<00:00:55.420> apps<00:00:55.750> into<00:00:56.050> all<00:00:56.170> those<00:00:56.350> slots<00:00:56.710> so

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
can install apps into all those slots so

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.580 
can install apps into all those slots so
if<00:00:57.340> we<00:00:57.460> click<00:00:57.550> on<00:00:57.730> the<00:00:57.850> input<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.510> list<00:00:59.170> comes<00:00:59.410> up

back<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.159> audio<00:01:33.549> bus<00:01:33.819> now<00:01:34.630> when<00:01:34.749> we're<00:01:34.899> back<00:01:35.049> in

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
back to audio bus now when we're back in

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.620 
back to audio bus now when we're back in
audio<00:01:35.920> bus<00:01:36.219> we<00:01:36.670> can<00:01:36.700> add<00:01:36.939> a<00:01:36.969> second<00:01:37.389> input

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
audio bus we can add a second input

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.440 
audio bus we can add a second input
device<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.979> let's<00:01:39.189> choose<00:01:39.490> rebirth<00:01:40.209> from

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
device so let's choose rebirth from

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.449 
device so let's choose rebirth from
propellerheads<00:01:41.109> and<00:01:41.829> once<00:01:41.979> rebirth<00:01:42.280> is

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
propellerheads and once rebirth is

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:45.419 
propellerheads and once rebirth is
active<00:01:42.819> we<00:01:42.939> can<00:01:43.060> click<00:01:43.240> on<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:44.039> come<00:01:45.039> over<00:01:45.130> here

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
active we can click on it come over here

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.160 
active we can click on it come over here
and<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:45.639> will<00:01:45.729> play<00:01:45.909> back

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
and it will play back

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.660 
and it will play back
this<00:01:48.170> does<00:01:48.380> before<00:01:48.560> now<00:01:49.100> we've<00:01:49.219> got<00:01:49.369> our<00:01:49.460> sub

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
this does before now we've got our sub

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.109 
this does before now we've got our sub
menu<00:01:49.939> here<00:01:50.210> we<00:01:50.750> can<00:01:50.899> switch<00:01:51.109> back<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:52.119> sunrise

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
menu here we can switch back to sunrise

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:04.790 
menu here we can switch back to sunrise
err

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.900 

so<00:02:05.800> what<00:02:05.920> you<00:02:06.010> saw<00:02:06.190> there's<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.580> two<00:02:06.730> apps

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
so what you saw there's the two apps

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.940 
so what you saw there's the two apps
being<00:02:07.180> mixed<00:02:07.360> together<00:02:07.540> in<00:02:07.900> real<00:02:08.140> time<00:02:08.170> inside

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
being mixed together in real time inside

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.040 
being mixed together in real time inside
the<00:02:09.100> audio<00:02:09.340> bus<00:02:09.580> application<00:02:10.270> now<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.810> cool

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
the audio bus application now the cool

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.140 
the audio bus application now the cool
thing<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.320> when<00:02:12.040> we<00:02:12.100> go<00:02:12.250> back<00:02:12.400> over<00:02:12.430> here<00:02:12.700> to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
thing is when we go back over here to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.870 
thing is when we go back over here to
audio<00:02:13.630> bus<00:02:17.100> now<00:02:18.100> when<00:02:18.190> we<00:02:18.250> come<00:02:18.370> back<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.640> audio

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
audio bus now when we come back to audio

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.490 
audio bus now when we come back to audio
bus<00:02:19.090> again<00:02:19.240> we<00:02:19.840> can<00:02:20.020> choose<00:02:20.170> an<00:02:20.320> output

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
bus again we can choose an output

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.350 
bus again we can choose an output
destination<00:02:21.280> for<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:22.030> could<00:02:22.150> be<00:02:22.270> an

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
destination for this that could be an

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.060 
destination for this that could be an
app<00:02:22.540> or<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.870> can<00:02:22.960> also<00:02:23.020> be<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.320> speaker<00:02:23.710> output

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
app or it can also be the speaker output

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.590 
app or it can also be the speaker output
in<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.580> case<00:02:24.640> we'll<00:02:24.970> route<00:02:25.150> straight<00:02:25.360> out<00:02:25.510> of

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
in this case we'll route straight out of

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.120 
in this case we'll route straight out of
the<00:02:25.660> speaker<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.260> your<00:02:26.410> headphones<00:02:26.560> or<00:02:26.980> tiny

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
the speaker to your headphones or tiny

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.950 
the speaker to your headphones or tiny
speakers<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.640> might<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:27.910> connected<00:02:28.330> beyond

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
speakers you might have connected beyond

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.750 
speakers you might have connected beyond
this<00:02:29.200> we<00:02:29.530> can<00:02:29.650> add<00:02:29.770> an<00:02:29.860> effects<00:02:30.130> processor<00:02:30.670> in

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
this we can add an effects processor in

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.090 
this we can add an effects processor in
the<00:02:30.850> middle<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.330> this<00:02:31.660> case<00:02:31.930> I've<00:02:32.230> got<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.770> jamup

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
the middle in this case I've got a jamup

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.190 
the middle in this case I've got a jamup
light<00:02:33.520> which<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.540> actually<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.900> guitar

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
light which is actually a guitar

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.680 
light which is actually a guitar
processor<00:02:35.800> but<00:02:36.400> we'll<00:02:36.550> load<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:36.940> up<00:02:36.970> so

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
processor but we'll load that up so

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
processor but we'll load that up so
that's<00:02:37.870> running<00:02:38.080> in<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.290> middle<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.620> any

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
that's running in the middle and any

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.950 
that's running in the middle and any
processing<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.370> we<00:02:39.490> apply<00:02:39.760> will<00:02:40.480> be<00:02:40.630> added

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
processing that we apply will be added

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.840 
processing that we apply will be added
using<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:42.100> any<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.430> apps<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:42.700> we

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
using this to any of the apps that we

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.370 
using this to any of the apps that we
run<00:02:43.030> through<00:02:43.270> it<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.900> it's<00:02:44.050> basically

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
run through it so it's basically

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.780 
run through it so it's basically
happening<00:02:44.830> here<00:02:45.010> in<00:02:45.070> audio<00:02:45.310> busses<00:02:45.670> and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
happening here in audio busses and

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.280 
happening here in audio busses and
serving<00:02:46.090> as<00:02:46.210> a<00:02:46.240> mixer<00:02:46.660> for<00:02:46.690> those<00:02:46.960> input

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
serving as a mixer for those input

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.170 
serving as a mixer for those input
devices<00:02:47.560> we<00:02:48.220> can<00:02:48.340> have<00:02:48.460> apps<00:02:48.700> as<00:02:48.910> input

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
devices we can have apps as input

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.730 
devices we can have apps as input
devices<00:02:49.450> we<00:02:49.720> can<00:02:49.750> keep<00:02:50.050> adding<00:02:50.200> those<00:02:50.440> up<00:02:50.500> to

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
devices we can keep adding those up to

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.230 
devices we can keep adding those up to
the<00:02:50.830> limits<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.190> what<00:02:51.340> your<00:02:51.490> iOS<00:02:51.700> device<00:02:52.060> will

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
the limits of what your iOS device will

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.180 
the limits of what your iOS device will
run<00:02:52.450> we<00:02:52.960> could<00:02:53.110> have<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.260> microphone<00:02:53.590> input<00:02:53.920> so

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
run we could have a microphone input so

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.260 
run we could have a microphone input so
we<00:02:54.280> could<00:02:54.400> route<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.580> guitar<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.090> or<00:02:55.240> a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
we could route a guitar in or a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.850 
we could route a guitar in or a
microphone<00:02:55.720> then<00:02:56.230> we've<00:02:56.350> got<00:02:56.500> our<00:02:56.530> effects

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
microphone then we've got our effects

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.260 
microphone then we've got our effects
processor<00:02:57.370> we<00:02:57.490> can<00:02:57.610> use<00:02:57.760> then<00:02:57.910> we<00:02:57.940> can<00:02:58.120> send

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
processor we can use then we can send

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.330 
processor we can use then we can send
that<00:02:58.390> single<00:02:58.750> signal<00:02:59.110> out<00:02:59.290> using<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.130> speaker

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
that single signal out using the speaker

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.460 
that single signal out using the speaker
outputs<00:03:00.760> from<00:03:00.910> your<00:03:01.030> iOS<00:03:01.120> device<00:03:01.630> so<00:03:02.350> it's

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
outputs from your iOS device so it's

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.720 
outputs from your iOS device so it's
great<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.770> we<00:03:02.830> can<00:03:02.860> use<00:03:03.130> audio<00:03:03.370> bus<00:03:03.550> as<00:03:03.700> a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
great that we can use audio bus as a

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.340 
great that we can use audio bus as a
mixer<00:03:04.060> for<00:03:04.090> those<00:03:04.330> input<00:03:04.690> apps<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.140> audio

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
mixer for those input apps and audio

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.229 
mixer for those input apps and audio
devices<00:03:05.680> but<00:03:06.280> what's<00:03:06.430> really<00:03:06.580> cool<00:03:06.850> is<00:03:06.910> we<00:03:07.090> can

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
devices but what's really cool is we can

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.850 
devices but what's really cool is we can
also<00:03:07.360> put<00:03:07.660> apps<00:03:07.810> here<00:03:08.050> in<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.230> output<00:03:08.380> stage

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
also put apps here in the output stage

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.770 
also put apps here in the output stage
so<00:03:09.459> let's<00:03:09.489> bring<00:03:09.790> in<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:09.970> couple<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.390> inputs

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
so let's bring in a couple of inputs

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.830 
so let's bring in a couple of inputs
here<00:03:11.110> we've<00:03:11.320> got<00:03:11.500> funk<00:03:11.860> box<00:03:12.100> which<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.840> drum

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
here we've got funk box which is a drum

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.930 
here we've got funk box which is a drum
machine<00:03:14.040> now<00:03:15.040> we'll<00:03:15.160> load<00:03:15.280> up<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.489> synthesizer

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
machine now we'll load up a synthesizer

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.820 
machine now we'll load up a synthesizer
I'll<00:03:16.209> choose<00:03:16.390> sunrise<00:03:16.750> err<00:03:16.780> again<00:03:17.170> just<00:03:17.530> to

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
I'll choose sunrise err again just to

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.070 
I'll choose sunrise err again just to
load<00:03:18.250> up<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.459> base<00:03:18.670> sound<00:03:18.970> on<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.239> let's<00:03:19.959> move

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
load up a base sound on that let's move

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.960 
load up a base sound on that let's move
over<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.350> our<00:03:20.500> output<00:03:20.920> slot<00:03:21.190> here<00:03:21.459> now<00:03:21.880> we

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
over to our output slot here now we

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.400 
over to our output slot here now we
could<00:03:22.120> again<00:03:22.330> choose<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.570> speaker<00:03:23.020> output<00:03:23.170> if

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
could again choose the speaker output if

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.750 
could again choose the speaker output if
we<00:03:23.500> just<00:03:23.680> wanted<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:23.950> use<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.160> as<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> mixer

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
we just wanted to use this as a mixer

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.400 
we just wanted to use this as a mixer
but<00:03:25.120> if<00:03:25.209> we<00:03:25.300> want<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.540> record<00:03:25.810> those<00:03:26.050> signals

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
but if we want to record those signals

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.900 
but if we want to record those signals
we<00:03:26.590> could<00:03:26.709> choose<00:03:26.860> loopy<00:03:27.220> HD<00:03:27.610> or<00:03:27.790> I've<00:03:27.880> got

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
we could choose loopy HD or I've got

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:06.939 
point now we can jump over to sunrise

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:25.620 
point now we can jump over to sunrise
err<00:04:08.489> choose<00:04:09.489> up<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.969> bass<00:04:10.150> sound<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:25.419> we<00:04:25.509> can

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
err choose up the bass sound and we can

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.110 
err choose up the bass sound and we can
even<00:04:25.750> control<00:04:26.550> multitrack<00:04:27.550> door<00:04:27.789> from<00:04:27.970> right

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
even control multitrack door from right

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.510 
even control multitrack door from right
here<00:04:28.270> we<00:04:28.449> can<00:04:28.539> also<00:04:28.690> control<00:04:29.169> funk<00:04:29.620> box<00:04:29.800> from

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
here we can also control funk box from

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.920 
here we can also control funk box from
here<00:04:30.639> so<00:04:30.820> we<00:04:30.910> have<00:04:31.000> to<00:04:31.060> start<00:04:31.240> stop<00:04:31.479> control

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
here so we have to start stop control

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.600 
here so we have to start stop control
there<00:04:32.110> we<00:04:32.229> can<00:04:32.349> switch<00:04:32.530> among<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.889> apps<00:04:33.070> so

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
there we can switch among the apps so

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.950 
there we can switch among the apps so
this<00:04:33.729> is<00:04:33.849> a<00:04:33.910> really<00:04:34.240> cool<00:04:34.419> way<00:04:34.599> to<00:04:34.630> create<00:04:34.930> a

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
this is a really cool way to create a

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.900 
this is a really cool way to create a
multitrack<00:04:35.380> recording<00:04:35.860> now<00:04:36.460> we<00:04:36.520> can<00:04:36.699> switch

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
multitrack recording now we can switch

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.810 
multitrack recording now we can switch
back<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.120> multitrack<00:04:37.690> da<00:04:38.250> we<00:04:39.250> can<00:04:39.400> see<00:04:39.550> our<00:04:39.639> two

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
back to multitrack da we can see our two

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.520 
back to multitrack da we can see our two
tracks<00:04:40.060> have<00:04:40.210> been<00:04:40.300> recorded<00:04:40.780> here<00:04:41.020> let's

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
tracks have been recorded here let's

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.140 
tracks have been recorded here let's
jump<00:04:41.860> our<00:04:42.039> play<00:04:42.220> back<00:04:42.400> up<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.759> where<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:43.000> bass

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
jump our play back up to where the bass

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:52.370 
jump our play back up to where the bass
comes<00:04:43.419> in

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.540 

so<00:04:53.380> we've<00:04:53.500> recorded<00:04:53.740> those<00:04:53.979> two<00:04:54.099> tracks<00:04:54.340> onto

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
so we've recorded those two tracks onto

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.830 
so we've recorded those two tracks onto
their<00:04:54.699> own<00:04:54.849> separate<00:04:55.240> tracks<00:04:55.479> we<00:04:55.630> can<00:04:55.660> add

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
their own separate tracks we can add

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.180 
their own separate tracks we can add
effects<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.199> them<00:04:56.380> here<00:04:56.530> we<00:04:56.650> can<00:04:56.770> edit<00:04:56.919> them

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
effects to them here we can edit them

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.010 
effects to them here we can edit them
here<00:04:57.370> we<00:04:57.490> can<00:04:57.639> mix<00:04:57.820> them<00:04:58.000> however<00:04:58.150> we<00:04:58.300> like<00:04:58.539> but

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
here we can mix them however we like but

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.589 
here we can mix them however we like but
we<00:04:59.080> can<00:04:59.199> also<00:04:59.349> switch<00:04:59.710> back<00:04:59.919> to<00:04:59.949> audio<00:05:00.340> buss

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.260 

close<00:05:04.599> up<00:05:04.840> that<00:05:05.130> synth<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.370> let's<00:05:06.639> open<00:05:06.789> up<00:05:07.060> an

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
close up that synth and let's open up an

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.350 
close up that synth and let's open up an
log<00:05:07.599> Pro<00:05:08.080> so<00:05:09.009> now<00:05:09.130> that<00:05:09.220> we've<00:05:09.370> got<00:05:09.610> n<00:05:09.820> log<00:05:10.120> Pro

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
log Pro so now that we've got n log Pro

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.460 
log Pro so now that we've got n log Pro
loaded<00:05:10.690> up<00:05:10.810> we<00:05:10.930> can<00:05:11.050> switch<00:05:11.229> back<00:05:11.440> to

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
loaded up we can switch back to

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.649 
loaded up we can switch back to
multitrack<00:05:12.250> DAW<00:05:12.520> make<00:05:13.150> sure<00:05:13.300> that's<00:05:13.509> the

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
track that's a record enabled here we'll

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.110 
track that's a record enabled here we'll
rewind<00:05:15.940> and<00:05:16.840> let's<00:05:17.139> just<00:05:18.070> bring<00:05:18.669> this<00:05:18.820> up<00:05:19.030> a

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
rewind and let's just bring this up a

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.960 
rewind and let's just bring this up a
little<00:05:19.300> bit<00:05:19.479> before<00:05:20.550> switch<00:05:21.550> back<00:05:21.820> here<00:05:23.970> and

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
little bit before switch back here and

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.450 
little bit before switch back here and
we<00:05:25.509> should<00:05:25.780> be<00:05:25.930> ready<00:05:26.169> to<00:05:26.259> go<00:05:26.409> once<00:05:27.310> again

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
we should be ready to go once again

and paste the audio you can actually do

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
and paste the audio you can actually do
it<00:06:20.250> with<00:06:20.370> much<00:06:20.550> more<00:06:20.700> of<00:06:20.820> a<00:06:20.880> real-time

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
it with much more of a real-time

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.760 
it with much more of a real-time
workflow<00:06:21.870> when<00:06:22.050> you're<00:06:22.140> working<00:06:22.440> this<00:06:22.560> way

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
workflow when you're working this way

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.650 
workflow when you're working this way
now<00:06:23.310> in<00:06:23.460> the<00:06:23.550> background<00:06:23.970> we<00:06:24.090> can<00:06:24.120> synchronize

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
now in the background we can synchronize

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.270 
now in the background we can synchronize
devices<00:06:25.140> using<00:06:25.320> MIDI<00:06:25.650> so<00:06:25.890> if<00:06:26.010> we're<00:06:26.160> using

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
devices using MIDI so if we're using

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.280 
devices using MIDI so if we're using
sailu<00:06:26.790> PhD<00:06:27.360> and<00:06:27.570> we're<00:06:27.660> creating<00:06:28.050> a<00:06:28.140> loop

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
sailu PhD and we're creating a loop

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.930 
sailu PhD and we're creating a loop
production<00:06:28.860> but<00:06:29.220> we<00:06:29.250> want<00:06:29.490> to<00:06:29.550> run<00:06:29.670> a<00:06:29.700> drum

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
production but we want to run a drum

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.190 
production but we want to run a drum
machine<00:06:30.030> along<00:06:30.390> with<00:06:30.600> that<00:06:30.720> we<00:06:30.870> can<00:06:30.990> Lock

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 
machine along with that we can Lock

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.870 
machine along with that we can Lock
those<00:06:31.380> together<00:06:31.590> using<00:06:32.040> the<00:06:32.130> commands<00:06:32.430> inside

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
those together using the commands inside

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.280 
those together using the commands inside
those<00:06:33.090> two<00:06:33.270> apps<00:06:33.480> to<00:06:33.660> synchronize<00:06:34.140> them

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
those two apps to synchronize them

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.110 
those two apps to synchronize them
together<00:06:34.470> so<00:06:35.220> we<00:06:35.310> can<00:06:35.460> still<00:06:35.610> use<00:06:35.760> all<00:06:35.940> those

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
together so we can still use all those

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
together so we can still use all those
different<00:06:36.420> functions<00:06:36.780> that<00:06:36.870> are<00:06:36.990> available

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
different functions that are available

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.990 
different functions that are available
in<00:06:37.440> the<00:06:37.530> apps<00:06:37.680> it's<00:06:38.220> just<00:06:38.430> the<00:06:38.520> audio<00:06:38.820> that's

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
in the apps it's just the audio that's

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.310 
in the apps it's just the audio that's
being<00:06:39.240> routed<00:06:39.420> here<00:06:39.750> and<00:06:39.900> we<00:06:39.960> can<00:06:40.080> route<00:06:40.200> it

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
being routed here and we can route it

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.870 
being routed here and we can route it
into<00:06:40.500> our<00:06:40.590> multitrack<00:06:40.980> recorder<00:06:41.400> or<00:06:41.580> off<00:06:41.700> to

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
into our multitrack recorder or off to

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.760 
into our multitrack recorder or off to
the<00:06:41.910> speakers<00:06:42.360> so<00:06:42.810> it's<00:06:42.930> a<00:06:43.020> very<00:06:43.200> powerful<00:06:43.380> app

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
the speakers so it's a very powerful app

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.860 
the speakers so it's a very powerful app
to<00:06:43.920> have<00:06:44.100> it<00:06:44.490> really<00:06:44.880> turns<00:06:45.090> your<00:06:45.240> iOS<00:06:45.540> device

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870
