that's<00:02:40.110> really<00:02:40.380> seems<00:02:40.910> not<00:02:41.910> really<00:02:42.150> worth<00:02:42.270> the

to twenty-five dollars and if you think

you're going to get a better one by

you're going to get a better one by

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
paying say five or ten dollars more that

very<00:02:53.430> disappointing<00:02:54.030> really<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.420> modern

technology because logistics well it
almost<00:02:58.590> seems<00:02:59.100> like<00:02:59.310> they<00:02:59.430> want<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.820> have

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
almost seems like they want you to have
