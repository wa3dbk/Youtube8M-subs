brothers<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.899> SL<00:00:58.320> 3<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> SL<00:00:59.129> 4<00:00:59.430> it

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
brothers the SL 3 in the SL 4 it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.000 
brothers the SL 3 in the SL 4 it
galvanic<00:01:00.660> isolation<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.649> all<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.890> good

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
galvanic isolation and all that good

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.600 
galvanic isolation and all that good
stuff<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.460> well<00:01:03.290> so<00:01:04.290> basically<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
stuff as well so basically it's just the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.940 
stuff as well so basically it's just the
you<00:01:06.000> know<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.630> higher<00:01:06.930> quality<00:01:07.380> version<00:01:07.619> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
you know the higher quality version of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.910 
you know the higher quality version of
the<00:01:08.100> sl1<00:01:08.990> some<00:01:09.990> limitations<00:01:10.500> though<00:01:10.680> just

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the sl1 some limitations though just

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.929 
the sl1 some limitations though just
like<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> SL<00:01:11.460> 1

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
like the SL 1

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.760 
like the SL 1
you<00:01:12.180> can't<00:01:12.390> record<00:01:12.720> your<00:01:12.869> set<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> SL<00:01:13.560> 2

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
you can't record your set with the SL 2

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
you can't record your set with the SL 2
obviously<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.580> there's<00:01:14.850> only<00:01:14.970> two<00:01:15.210> inputs

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
obviously is there's only two inputs

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.730 
obviously is there's only two inputs
which<00:01:15.930> you're<00:01:16.110> probably<00:01:16.259> going<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.590> using

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
which you're probably going to be using

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.350 
which you're probably going to be using
from<00:01:16.979> both<00:01:17.130> your<00:01:17.280> decks<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:18.150> you're<00:01:18.270> on

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
from both your decks so if you're on

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.190 
from both your decks so if you're on
record<00:01:18.509> you're<00:01:18.810> set

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
record you're set

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.600 
record you're set
you're<00:01:19.770> gonna<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> use<00:01:20.189> another<00:01:20.280> sound

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
you're gonna have to use another sound

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.630 
you're gonna have to use another sound
card<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.060> program<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> SL<00:01:22.200> 1

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
card in program just like the SL 1

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.740 
card in program just like the SL 1
interestingly<00:01:23.640> enough<00:01:24.000> though<00:01:24.390> there's<00:01:24.600> no

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
interestingly enough though there's no

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.990 
interestingly enough though there's no
microphone<00:01:24.960> input<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> SL<00:01:26.040> 2<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> SL

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
microphone input on the SL 2 like the SL

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.210 
microphone input on the SL 2 like the SL
1<00:01:27.210> however<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.290> don't<00:01:28.470> know<00:01:28.590> how<00:01:28.740> many<00:01:28.890> people

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
1 however I don't know how many people

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.069 
1 however I don't know how many people
actually<00:01:29.520> honestly<00:01:30.270> use<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.689> microphone

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
actually honestly use the microphone

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.920 
actually honestly use the microphone
input<00:01:31.229> all<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.610> often<00:01:32.820> especially<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:33.869> with

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
input all that often especially now with

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.660 
input all that often especially now with
the<00:01:34.049> live<00:01:34.290> feed<00:01:34.530> option<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.100> scratch<00:01:35.400> life

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the live feed option in scratch life

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.999 
the live feed option in scratch life
kind<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.720> takes<00:01:36.930> over<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.320> functionality

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
kind of takes over that functionality

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.620 
kind of takes over that functionality
just<00:01:40.340> like<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> SL<00:01:41.729> 3<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.060> that's<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.360> for

the scratch life program just like the

the scratch life program just like the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
which has its pros and cons as well I

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.560 
which has its pros and cons as well I
actually<00:02:05.490> kind<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> separate

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
actually kind of like the separate

actually kind of like the separate

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
through outputs on the SL 1 but it is

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.700 
through outputs on the SL 1 but it is
what<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:11.300> USB<00:02:12.300> 2.0<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.260> like<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
what it is USB 2.0 just like the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.660 
what it is USB 2.0 just like the
3sl<00:02:14.340> for<00:02:14.840> better<00:02:15.840> sound<00:02:16.050> quality<00:02:16.520> than<00:02:17.520> the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
3sl for better sound quality than the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.170

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
sl1

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.510 
sl1
obviously<00:02:18.870> same<00:02:19.440> sound<00:02:19.710> quality<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.220> sl3

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
obviously same sound quality is the sl3

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.360 
obviously same sound quality is the sl3
in<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.880> SL<00:02:21.150> for<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:23.130> know<00:02:23.190> that's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
in the SL for it and you know that's

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.920 
in the SL for it and you know that's
pretty<00:02:23.490> much<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.720> new

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
pretty much it so this is the new

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.900 
pretty much it so this is the new
reigning<00:02:25.470> SL<00:02:25.800> 2<00:02:25.950> sound<00:02:26.220> card<00:02:26.280> for<00:02:26.610> scratch

reigning SL 2 sound card for scratch
live<00:02:27.590> price<00:02:28.590> price<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.850> MSRP<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.950> 629<00:02:31.950> I

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
live price price the MSRP is 629 I

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.190 
live price price the MSRP is 629 I
believe<00:02:32.450> which<00:02:33.450> means<00:02:33.720> it'll<00:02:33.960> probably

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
believe which means it'll probably

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.680 
believe which means it'll probably
Street<00:02:34.650> matte<00:02:34.890> price<00:02:35.190> probably<00:02:35.580> around<00:02:35.880> $4.99

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
Street matte price probably around $4.99

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.010 
Street matte price probably around $4.99
which<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.880> honestly<00:02:39.240> think<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.630> probably<00:02:39.870> a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
which I honestly think is probably a

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.620 
which I honestly think is probably a
little<00:02:40.140> bit<00:02:40.320> too<00:02:40.530> high<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.340> especially<00:02:41.940> these

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
little bit too high and especially these

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.470 
little bit too high and especially these
days<00:02:42.840> with<00:02:43.110> recession<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.710> all<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.040> stuff

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
days with recession and all that stuff

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.960 
days with recession and all that stuff
but<00:02:45.480> again<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:45.900> what<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:47.100> $4.99

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
but again it is what it is so $4.99

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.610 
but again it is what it is so $4.99
probably<00:02:48.570> we're<00:02:48.870> just<00:02:48.990> going<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.140> cost<00:02:49.320> you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
probably we're just going to cost you

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.780 
probably we're just going to cost you
one<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.670> debuts<00:02:51.060> which<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.480> think<00:02:51.930> comes<00:02:52.260> up

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
one in debuts which I think comes up

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.490 
one in debuts which I think comes up
this<00:02:53.790> month<00:02:54.030> next<00:02:54.240> month<00:02:54.390> not<00:02:54.660> check<00:02:55.020> on<00:02:55.170> that

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
this month next month not check on that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.340 
this month next month not check on that
again<00:02:56.420> but<00:02:57.420> that's<00:02:57.540> pretty<00:02:57.660> much<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.080> this

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
again but that's pretty much it so this

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.770 
again but that's pretty much it so this
is<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.710> new<00:02:58.830> rain<00:02:59.190> SL<00:02:59.640> 2<00:02:59.820> sound<00:03:00.180> card<00:03:00.270> for
