00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
they took all the toppings and threw

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.930 
they took all the toppings and threw
them<00:05:08.380> on<00:05:08.470> and<00:05:09.040> then<00:05:09.160> had<00:05:09.280> to<00:05:09.310> cook<00:05:09.580> it<00:05:09.730> for<00:05:09.880> like

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
them on and then had to cook it for like

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.520 
them on and then had to cook it for like
five<00:05:10.240> minutes<00:05:10.450> to<00:05:10.750> have<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:10.990> cheese<00:05:11.200> melt

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
into the topping that's what I'm

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.760 
into the topping that's what I'm
assuming<00:05:12.850> they<00:05:13.150> did<00:05:13.360> so<00:05:14.230> it's<00:05:14.350> actually<00:05:14.410> not

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
assuming they did so it's actually not

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.130 
assuming they did so it's actually not
that<00:05:15.010> bad<00:05:15.220> but<00:05:15.490> it's<00:05:15.550> not<00:05:16.120> great<00:05:16.630> let's<00:05:16.900> put<00:05:17.050> it

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
that bad but it's not great let's put it

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.710 
that bad but it's not great let's put it
that<00:05:17.260> way<00:05:17.320> there's<00:05:17.680> no<00:05:17.800> seasoning<00:05:18.280> at<00:05:18.400> all

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
that way there's no seasoning at all

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.510 
that way there's no seasoning at all
it's<00:05:19.720> just<00:05:19.960> basic<00:05:20.380> sauce<00:05:20.650> meat<00:05:21.100> and<00:05:21.310> cheese

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.520 
it's just basic sauce meat and cheese
and<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.180> the<00:05:22.300> breading<00:05:22.660> and<00:05:22.780> that's<00:05:22.930> it<00:05:23.110> take

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
and and the breading and that's it take

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.890 
and and the breading and that's it take
one<00:05:23.680> more<00:05:23.830> bite

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.320 

hmmm<00:05:33.439> so<00:05:34.439> essentially<00:05:34.979> what<00:05:35.789> you're<00:05:35.939> getting

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
hmmm so essentially what you're getting
