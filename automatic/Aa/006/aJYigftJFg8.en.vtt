you've<00:01:16.000> got<00:01:16.300> to<00:01:16.420> remember<00:01:16.659> that<00:01:16.870> here<00:01:17.380> is<00:01:17.500> a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
you've got to remember that here is a

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.080 
you've got to remember that here is a
bit<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.130> in<00:01:18.190> particular<00:01:18.520> here<00:01:18.880> with<00:01:19.000> the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
bit and in particular here with the

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.820 
bit and in particular here with the
double<00:01:19.300> bridle<00:01:19.810> we've<00:01:19.960> got<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.170> lever<00:01:20.500> action

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
double bridle we've got a lever action

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.980 
double bridle we've got a lever action
and<00:01:21.280> that's<00:01:21.880> on<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.210> tongue<00:01:22.479> of<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.780> horse

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
and that's on the tongue of the horse

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.960 
and that's on the tongue of the horse
and<00:01:23.260> here's<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.590> grazing<00:01:23.920> animal<00:01:24.430> as<00:01:24.670> tongues

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
and here's a grazing animal as tongues

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.090 
and here's a grazing animal as tongues
really<00:01:25.450> important<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:25.990> him<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.260> it's<00:01:26.860> really

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
really important to him and it's really

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.550 
really important to him and it's really
really<00:01:27.220> sensitive<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.750> we<00:01:28.780> owe<00:01:28.930> it<00:01:29.290> to<00:01:29.320> the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
really sensitive so we owe it to the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.310 
really sensitive so we owe it to the
horse<00:01:29.799> to<00:01:30.370> have<00:01:30.549> contact<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.210> be<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.659> lightest

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
horse to have contact to be the lightest

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.010 
horse to have contact to be the lightest
possible<00:01:33.100> pressure<00:01:33.460> on<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:34.360> horse's<00:01:34.780> mouth

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
possible pressure on the horse's mouth

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.859 
possible pressure on the horse's mouth
just<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:36.040> keep<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.520> straight<00:01:37.030> line<00:01:37.330> there<00:01:37.630> with

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
just to keep a straight line there with

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.440 
just to keep a straight line there with
the<00:01:38.049> reins<00:01:38.320> so<00:01:39.100> contact<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:39.850> not<00:01:40.180> about

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
the reins so contact is not about

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.440 
the reins so contact is not about
pressure<00:01:40.869> if<00:01:41.260> I<00:01:42.010> let<00:01:42.369> go<00:01:42.400> of<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.880> reins<00:01:43.060> I<00:01:43.390> no
