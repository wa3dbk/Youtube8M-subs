00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
couple little issues here and there but

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.970 
couple little issues here and there but
for<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.039> most<00:00:29.070> part<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.490> ready<00:00:30.859> there<00:00:31.859> was

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
for the most part it's ready there was

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.180 
for the most part it's ready there was
just<00:00:32.160> going<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.579> no<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.300> could<00:00:33.980> fix<00:00:34.980> this

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
just going to be no way I could fix this

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.160 
just going to be no way I could fix this
the<00:00:35.370> correct<00:00:35.610> way<00:00:35.910> because<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.660> attention

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the correct way because of the attention

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.280 
the correct way because of the attention
the<00:00:37.469> panel<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.890> under<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.840> you<00:00:39.840> know<00:00:39.960> just

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the panel is under and you know just

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.250 
the panel is under and you know just
just<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.739> way<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.480> basically<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.230> is

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
just the way that basically what it is

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.389 
just the way that basically what it is
is<00:00:43.710> there's<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.690> there's<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> crease<00:00:46.250> sort<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
is there's a there's a crease sort of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.510 
is there's a there's a crease sort of
that<00:00:47.670> kind<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.910> runs<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.600> way<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.520> that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
that kind of runs out this way and that

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.569 
that kind of runs out this way and that
kind<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.000> runs<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.629> way<00:00:51.840> where<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.550> know

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
kind of runs out that way where you know

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.670 
kind of runs out that way where you know
when<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.940> clamp<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.989> pull<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
when we clamp this in and pull it up it

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.310 
when we clamp this in and pull it up it
you<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> calls<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.969> lower<00:00:57.780> section<00:00:58.289> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you know it calls the lower section of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.250 
you know it calls the lower section of
the<00:00:58.379> panel<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> adjust<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.989> this<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.170> going

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the panel to adjust in so this is going

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.529 
the panel to adjust in so this is going
to<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.440> impossible<00:01:02.039> unless<00:01:02.160> unless<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:03.000> put<00:01:03.239> you

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
to be impossible unless unless I put you

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.030 
to be impossible unless unless I put you
know<00:01:03.660> an<00:01:03.809> inch<00:01:03.989> thick<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.409> filler<00:01:04.650> all<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> way

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
know an inch thick a filler all the way

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.039 
know an inch thick a filler all the way
around<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.180> know<00:01:06.210> got<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
around there and then you know got a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.830 
around there and then you know got a
sculptor<00:01:07.619> over<00:01:07.890> here<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.540> sculpt<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.689> the

that all in with filler and you know and
got<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.000> got<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:04.490> shaved<00:02:05.490> down<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.570> it'd<00:02:06.899> be<00:02:07.079> you

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
got it got it shaved down so it'd be you

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.949 
got it got it shaved down so it'd be you
know<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.849> we<00:02:09.000> could<00:02:09.149> change<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:09.810> then

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
know and we could change that but then

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.180 
know and we could change that but then
we'd<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.289> change<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.619> other<00:02:10.709> side<00:02:10.979> so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
we'd have to change the other side so

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.360 
we'd have to change the other side so
just<00:02:11.489> go<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.660> put<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.930> hole

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
just go in and put in the hole

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.089 
just go in and put in the hole
and<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.549> just<00:02:13.790> opens<00:02:14.209> up<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.450> whole<00:02:14.799> nother<00:02:15.799> can

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
and on just opens up a whole nother can

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.610 
and on just opens up a whole nother can
of<00:02:16.129> worms<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.730> then<00:02:16.879> we<00:02:17.690> could<00:02:17.930> cut<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:18.409> out

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
of worms and then we could cut this out

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.670 
of worms and then we could cut this out
smaller<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.909> make<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.239> closer<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.659> the<00:02:20.870> you

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
smaller and make it closer to the you

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.030 
smaller and make it closer to the you
know<00:02:21.799> to<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.040> contour<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:24.530> closer<00:02:24.769> you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
know to the contour but the closer you

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.660 
know to the contour but the closer you
get<00:02:25.190> down<00:02:25.400> into<00:02:25.640> there<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:28.430> more<00:02:28.640> the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
get down into there the the more the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.610 
get down into there the the more the
panel<00:02:29.120> is<00:02:29.209> warped<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:30.290> know<00:02:30.409> there<00:02:30.560> are

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
panel is warped and you know there are

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.649 
panel is warped and you know there are
issues<00:02:30.650> there<00:02:31.010> plus<00:02:32.000> it's<00:02:32.239> just<00:02:32.269> a<00:02:32.480> lot<00:02:32.629> easier

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
issues there plus it's just a lot easier

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.080 
issues there plus it's just a lot easier
to<00:02:33.110> do<00:02:33.500> block<00:02:33.739> sanding<00:02:34.129> and<00:02:34.250> bodywork<00:02:34.730> out<00:02:34.940> in

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
to do block sanding and bodywork out in

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.300 
to do block sanding and bodywork out in
an<00:02:35.209> open<00:02:35.360> flat<00:02:36.230> area<00:02:36.620> than<00:02:36.769> it<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:36.950> once<00:02:37.220> you

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
an open flat area than it is once you

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.690 
an open flat area than it is once you
get<00:02:37.459> down<00:02:37.610> into<00:02:37.670> those<00:02:37.940> contours<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:39.700> that's

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
get down into those contours so that's

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.789 
get down into those contours so that's
what<00:02:40.849> we're<00:02:40.940> going<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.090> do<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.530> I'll<00:02:42.530> quit

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
what we're going to do and I'll quit

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.199 
what we're going to do and I'll quit
talking<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.370> we'll<00:02:43.610> get<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.849> it<00:02:46.209> alright

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
talking and we'll get to it alright

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.280 
talking and we'll get to it alright
welcome<00:02:47.540> back<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:49.150> c-clamp<00:02:50.150> Gary<00:02:50.540> Channel

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
welcome back to the c-clamp Gary Channel

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.050 
welcome back to the c-clamp Gary Channel
oh<00:02:51.440> yeah<00:02:51.859> we<00:02:52.040> got<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.250> C<00:02:52.400> clamps<00:02:52.700> back<00:02:52.849> out

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
oh yeah we got the C clamps back out

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.319 
oh yeah we got the C clamps back out
again<00:02:53.180> as<00:02:53.959> you<00:02:54.170> can<00:02:54.290> see<00:02:54.440> we<00:02:54.560> got<00:02:54.680> our<00:02:55.329> opening

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
again as you can see we got our opening

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.899 
again as you can see we got our opening
cut<00:02:56.480> out<00:02:56.629> and<00:02:57.909> since<00:02:58.909> this<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:01.190> a<00:03:01.579> large

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
cut out and since this is a large

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.630 
cut out and since this is a large
surface<00:03:02.180> area<00:03:02.629> and<00:03:02.840> it's<00:03:03.260> going<00:03:03.379> to<00:03:03.440> need<00:03:03.650> as

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
surface area and it's going to need as

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.610 
surface area and it's going to need as
much<00:03:04.849> support<00:03:05.090> as<00:03:05.269> we<00:03:05.390> can<00:03:05.480> get

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
much support as we can get

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.490 
much support as we can get
I<00:03:06.680> thought<00:03:06.980> about<00:03:07.870> instead<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:08.930> but<00:03:09.170> welding

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
I thought about instead of but welding

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.039 
I thought about instead of but welding
this<00:03:09.650> do<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.390> flange<00:03:11.390> all<00:03:11.659> the<00:03:11.750> way<00:03:11.810> across

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
this do a flange all the way across

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.899 
this do a flange all the way across
there<00:03:12.349> but<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.680> flange<00:03:12.920> wouldn't<00:03:13.280> work<00:03:13.670> too

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
there but the flange wouldn't work too

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.210 
there but the flange wouldn't work too
well<00:03:14.060> going<00:03:14.500> down<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.650> vertical<00:03:15.799> runs

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
well going down the vertical runs

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.960 
well going down the vertical runs
because<00:03:16.549> you<00:03:17.329> know<00:03:17.450> it's<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:18.500> may<00:03:18.970> interfere

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
because you know it's it may interfere

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.879 
because you know it's it may interfere
with<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.299> contour<00:03:20.720> probably<00:03:21.590> going<00:03:21.709> to<00:03:21.769> use

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
with the contour probably going to use

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.589 
with the contour probably going to use
it<00:03:22.010> across<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.400> top<00:03:22.609> but<00:03:22.639> we're<00:03:23.389> going<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.540> use

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
it across the top but we're going to use

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.559 
it across the top but we're going to use
the<00:03:23.900> backing<00:03:24.680> strip<00:03:25.040> method<00:03:25.310> here<00:03:25.669> and<00:03:25.790> I

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
the backing strip method here and I

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.089 
the backing strip method here and I
don't<00:03:26.630> know<00:03:26.780> if<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:26.959> can<00:03:27.139> if<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.799> can<00:03:27.950> see

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
don't know if you can if you can see

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.979 
don't know if you can if you can see
this<00:03:28.220> or<00:03:28.400> not<00:03:28.430> but<00:03:28.790> we<00:03:29.299> get<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.480> two<00:03:29.660> inch<00:03:29.840> strip

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
this or not but we get a two inch strip

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.860 
this or not but we get a two inch strip
of<00:03:30.489> metal<00:03:31.489> that<00:03:31.730> we<00:03:31.819> cut<00:03:32.030> out<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.419> new

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
of metal that we cut out of the new

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.900 
of metal that we cut out of the new
quarter<00:03:33.230> panel<00:03:33.849> and<00:03:36.160> we<00:03:37.160> plug<00:03:37.430> welded<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
quarter panel and we plug welded the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.539 
quarter panel and we plug welded the
existing<00:03:38.359> quarter<00:03:38.629> or<00:03:39.040> punched<00:03:40.040> holes<00:03:40.190> in<00:03:40.459> the

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
existing quarter or punched holes in the

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.220 
existing quarter or punched holes in the
existing<00:03:40.910> quarter<00:03:41.150> panel<00:03:41.359> to<00:03:41.510> make<00:03:41.629> spots<00:03:42.019> for

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
existing quarter panel to make spots for

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.699 
existing quarter panel to make spots for
plug<00:03:42.440> welds<00:03:42.769> so<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.900> new<00:03:45.049> metal<00:03:45.349> is<00:03:45.500> going<00:03:45.590> to

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
plug welds so the new metal is going to

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.379 
plug welds so the new metal is going to
be<00:03:45.799> able<00:03:45.919> to<00:03:46.069> rest<00:03:46.400> right<00:03:46.760> up<00:03:46.910> against<00:03:47.180> this

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
be able to rest right up against this

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.420 
be able to rest right up against this
similar<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.840> how<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.959> flange<00:03:48.319> is<00:03:48.590> but<00:03:48.859> hopefully

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
similar to how a flange is but hopefully

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.550 
similar to how a flange is but hopefully
it'll<00:03:49.579> keep<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.599> panel<00:03:50.780> from<00:03:51.019> distorting<00:03:51.470> as

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
it'll keep the panel from distorting as

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.879 
it'll keep the panel from distorting as
much<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:52.569> so<00:03:53.569> we'll<00:03:53.959> drill<00:03:54.199> holes<00:03:54.410> in<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.709> new

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
much and so we'll drill holes in the new

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.009 
much and so we'll drill holes in the new
quarter<00:03:55.340> panel<00:03:55.669> and<00:03:55.849> through<00:03:56.209> this<00:03:56.389> backing

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
quarter panel and through this backing

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.589 
quarter panel and through this backing
plate<00:03:57.310> backing<00:03:58.310> strip<00:03:58.609> and<00:03:58.849> use<00:03:59.239> our<00:03:59.359> click

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
plate backing strip and use our click

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.360 
plate backing strip and use our click
O's<00:03:59.780> or<00:03:59.810> some<00:04:00.290> sheet<00:04:00.769> metal<00:04:01.010> screws<00:04:01.250> or

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
something to pull that in tight so

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.250 
something to pull that in tight so

so should make a nice little flange for
the<00:05:22.840> new<00:05:23.840> piece<00:05:24.050> of<00:05:24.259> sheet<00:05:25.039> metal<00:05:25.069> to<00:05:25.340> fit<00:05:25.550> on

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
the new piece of sheet metal to fit on

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.150 
the new piece of sheet metal to fit on

quarter<00:05:31.550> panel<00:05:31.820> that<00:05:31.940> we<00:05:32.030> cut<00:05:32.210> today<00:05:32.360> and<00:05:32.919> the

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
quarter panel that we cut today and the

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.040 
quarter panel that we cut today and the
only<00:05:34.070> thing<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.400> was<00:05:34.490> good<00:05:34.669> for<00:05:34.849> was<00:05:35.150> to<00:05:35.900> be<00:05:36.020> a

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
only thing it was good for was to be a

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.920 
only thing it was good for was to be a
donor<00:05:36.729> for<00:05:37.729> those<00:05:37.880> strips<00:05:38.270> to<00:05:38.509> have<00:05:38.660> the<00:05:38.780> right

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
donor for those strips to have the right

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.460 
donor for those strips to have the right
contours<00:05:39.470> and<00:05:39.590> everything<00:05:40.330> because<00:05:41.349> you<00:05:42.349> know

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
contours and everything because you know

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.320 
contours and everything because you know
was<00:05:42.680> going<00:05:42.800> to<00:05:42.889> kind<00:05:43.280> of<00:05:43.310> cut<00:05:43.490> it<00:05:43.610> down<00:05:43.759> because

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
was going to kind of cut it down because

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.379 
was going to kind of cut it down because
we<00:05:44.419> don't<00:05:44.660> need<00:05:44.780> all<00:05:44.960> of<00:05:44.990> it<00:05:45.199> and<00:05:45.759> you<00:05:46.759> know

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
we don't need all of it and you know

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.879 
we don't need all of it and you know
it's<00:05:47.570> a<00:05:47.630> lot<00:05:47.750> easier<00:05:47.900> to<00:05:48.050> fit<00:05:48.289> as<00:05:48.470> a<00:05:48.500> smaller

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
it's a lot easier to fit as a smaller

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.830 
it's a lot easier to fit as a smaller
piece<00:05:49.160> so<00:05:49.430> I<00:05:49.639> thought<00:05:50.000> I<00:05:50.030> was<00:05:50.240> over<00:05:50.360> cutting<00:05:50.720> it

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
piece so I thought I was over cutting it

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.330 
piece so I thought I was over cutting it
by<00:05:50.930> a<00:05:50.960> couple<00:05:51.169> of<00:05:51.380> inches<00:05:51.560> and<00:05:51.770> ended<00:05:52.280> up

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
by a couple of inches and ended up

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.620 
by a couple of inches and ended up
undercutting<00:05:52.880> in<00:05:53.090> one<00:05:53.300> spot<00:05:53.570> so<00:05:55.060> yeah<00:05:56.060> got<00:05:56.539> to

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630
