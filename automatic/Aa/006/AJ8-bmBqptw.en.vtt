then<00:03:21.210> I<00:03:21.510> have<00:03:21.810> even<00:03:21.930> more<00:03:22.050> travel<00:03:22.650> for<00:03:22.890> the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
then I have even more travel for the

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:40.210 
then I have even more travel for the
treble<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.310> over<00:03:23.550> seven<00:03:25.400> okay<00:03:26.400> too<00:03:27.060> much
