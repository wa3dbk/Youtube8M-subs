00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
interesting feature apart from that is

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
are limited apps that support this but

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.969 
are limited apps that support this but
the<00:01:59.340> fact<00:01:59.579> these<00:01:59.850> two<00:02:00.149> just<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:01.020> adds<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.590> lot

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the fact these two just just adds a lot

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.980 
the fact these two just just adds a lot
to<00:02:02.040> your<00:02:02.310> productivity<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.869> open

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
to your productivity so you can open

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.010 
to your productivity so you can open
chrome<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.210> open<00:02:06.479> let's<00:02:06.659> say<00:02:06.810> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
chrome and you can open let's say a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.070 
chrome and you can open let's say a
video<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.580> will<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.840> two<00:02:09.840> things

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
video so you will have two things

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.479 
video so you will have two things
running<00:02:10.319> there<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:10.979> probably<00:02:11.190> play<00:02:11.459> a

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
running there you can probably play a

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.490 
running there you can probably play a
video<00:02:11.819> here<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.390> work<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.690> your

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
video here you can work on your
