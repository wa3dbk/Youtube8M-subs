00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.800
 fight for all competitions or 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.600
 to be more exact to fight for all 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.340
 the parties regardless of the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.170
 competition is the owner that can be 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.480
 extract from the press conference that Alvaro 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.820
 arbeloa offered this Friday nobody is going 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.929
 to perform because each match will be unique 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.140
 for real madrid they are not equal 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:26.099
 important nobody can think we're going 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.649
 to lower your arms in the league if this 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.829
 team wants to aspire to win titles to 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:34.080
 opt for the champions jump to the cup if 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.210
 it is impossible to do them and if it does not compete 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.640
 week after week yes yes in the league not 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.050
 you give it everything, it's very difficult then 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.820
 matches of champions matches 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.760
 of the cup this is butt 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.200
 any professional knows that to 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.420
 maintain the level you have to do it 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.040
 every day you can not choose the the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.750
 day you want to play well and in the rest 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.150
 relax 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.340
 starting with the first of 2013 at 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.290
 bernabéu reaches a real society that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.440
 he has earned the respect of the defense 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.440
 madridista 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.520
 good the first game after 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.650
 Christmas is always always complicated 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.390
 it's never easy, I think the year 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.630
 past was the malaga in cup that 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.580
 we had to go up this year so good 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.160
 we face a real team that 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.420
 are I believe that at its best 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.960
 is doing a great football is 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.880
 winning matches outside and well then 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.300
 knowing how complicated it is going to be and 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.680
 we have to improve dust I think 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.740
 that we face it with much desire and 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.750
 very excited that this 2013 is 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.540
 special for all Madridistas and 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.910
 good for that you have to start well 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.770
 and if Real Madrid wants to start 2013 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.660
 and winning must keep repeating the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.130
 successes that there have been and amending 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.420
 the mistakes that there have also been 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.430
 as recognized by the arbeloa himself 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.810
 well, we have not had that much 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.329
 aim like last year 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.869
 and defensively as well as not 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.810
 we created many occasions because we have 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.360
 granted more opportunity to the good rival 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.850
 I think it's when you're at 16 points 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.799
 it is a cumulus of many circumstances 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.330
 and as always special mention to 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.430
 madridismo to the public of santiago 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.260
 bernabéu arbeloa is convinced that 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.330
 the demanding and always faithful hobby 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.220
 Blanca will continue to support the team 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.220
 on top of everything and in every game 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.470
 I believe that the bernabéu the only way 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.660
 that has to react is playing not 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.390
 and you want to support your team and I think 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.800
 what is going to do to support the real 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.210
 madrid because they are fans of 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.940
 real madrid are not fans of iker 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.270
 boxes obviously also normal 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.670
 that in a moment of delicacy for 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.810
 iker are supporting you I think that 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.360
 it is admired by the amateur 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.240
 madridista I think iker will be 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.660
 delighted and good then well I think that 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.520
 it is important that the fans are with 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.510
 his players but mostly with the 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.510
 team that's the most important thing
