00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.060
 a m1 abrams tank from a teenager 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.619
 can distinguish why a g36 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.720

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.709
 kalashnikov 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.490
 At least that's what I'm asking 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:41.170

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.940
 Get your real us company tricon 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.530
 about the cooperation between triton and 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.300
 There are even detectors of developers 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.460
 a pr video you just here in 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.409
 background she sees a manufacturer 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.419
 military bat and has stabbing weapons 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.340
 even a wave of arx suitable 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.690
 the game develops cooperation 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.490
 between weapon manufacturers and 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.530
 electronic arts in the development of 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.210
 Manowar father, I had, too 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.620
 already in games and politics episode eleven 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.840
 detailed wow 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.639
 Great how to use the spd on one 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.860
 Axis can kill people if you want 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.419
 idiot part in the coming battlefield 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.430
 it will be a lot of weapons again 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.840
 including accessories that is also the 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.280
 That's why I'm even on this 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.289
 theme for the video came 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.180
 Also in battlefield 4 it continues with 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:40.470
 many many weapons and many many 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.880
 accessories but understand me now 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.409
 really please do not go wrong i play 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.580
 but you like this game yourself 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.289
 Sometimes I come to ponder 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.570
 why do I know so many 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.789
 weapon types become easy as a gamer 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.889
 Affiner for weapons How to let yourself go 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.659
 then also influence and if so 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.800
 I let myself be influenced 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:57.900
 Maybe other people like that 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.370
 I influence my principle 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.930
 you have to recognize that weapons 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.759
 something bad are despite the 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.409
 they are partly sure of fascination 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.940
 do not radiate and I want here too 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.500
 not howling at all but you find it 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.330
 normal that already some kids the 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.860
 Shooter games also different real 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.210
 distinguish existing weapons 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.650
 can and know a lot about this weapon 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.360
 I mean in Germany , we shake 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.100
 often head when in the usa again 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.960
 came to a killing spree and then again 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.460
 about firearms is discussed and 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.440
 clearly you can be lucky in germany 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.210
 not so easy on weapons but have 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.800
 We do not have a lot of weapons 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.169
 fetishism as a player modern 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.270
 meditations it might be better 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.300
 when weapons in video games are not real 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.250
 models are imitated 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.900
 no idea but what do you mean this 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.970
 video is supposed to be a discussion about 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.620
 to stimulate the topic I am looking forward to 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.910
 Your opinion, she writes down 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.440
 this video in the comments 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.419
 and as you know, I'm happy too 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.460
 again and again about new subscriptions and celebrations 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:49.960
 off mentally soon be found here then 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.090
 sure again a few longer 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.220
 videos but I have just little time 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.570
 june do housework and write as well 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.370
 I'm writing a book about military 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.990
 video games probably the end of the year 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.690
 or early next year then 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.520
 will appear so the blog is hereby 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.470
 also ticked off maybe there will be soon 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.360
 then also a video of me about 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.190
 futuristic weapons of the future in 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.849
 video games like those already shown 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.099
 crysis 3 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:16.419
 because in the game the statements are in 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:18.250
 Things Weapons Yes, Alas becomes even for 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:20.370
 a message is clearer than that 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:26.909
 a ball 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:26.909
 and I have a message to announce
