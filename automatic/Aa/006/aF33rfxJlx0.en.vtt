 God 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.059
 10 minutes of youtube in this month 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.190
 I'm going to show you how to upload to ios 8 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.349
 guys and I want to tell you something this 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:21.560
 version that came out today good I came out 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:23.980
 yesterday is already the official version of ios 8 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.019
 ok guys the version that will come out the 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.970
 18 is the same the only thing that will be 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.670
 available to everyone what it does for 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.210
 with the gm the gold master is that the 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.700
 Launches for it to be tested but 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.370
 not the general public but this is already 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.530
 the same changes will have this 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.750
 are the same ones that are going to have the final 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.850
 then I made this video as many 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.649
 of us we like we have the 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.480
 jailbreak nobody wants to lose their 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.120
 jailbreak then what I recommend 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.000
 is that they come up now if you want 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.780
 and they have until 17 when a po is going to 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.579
 stop signing ios 7 to download that is 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.539

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.690
 that if you raise ios 8 pay attention 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.989
 and you make a backup in 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.500
 ios 8 that backup is not going to 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.940
 work for ios 7 if you in the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.120
 downgrade ok 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.610

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.530
 of security that they used now I do 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.660

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.250

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.739
 before that is it supports that the 8 official 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.140

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.180
 difference to go back to your boil in 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.709

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.330
 I did buying ios 8 with the jailbreak 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.250
 super recommended for you 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.319

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.630
 expect me to always do for them 8 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.780
 before I go up I will not go up to me 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.569

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.310
 let's have a jailbreak they are seeing that 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.489

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.110

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.570

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.910

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.610

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:53.349
 you are in any beira you 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:56.469
 they must go up because those beiras are going to 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:58.809
 expire everything new from ios 8 and I'll 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:01.059
