pretty<00:02:15.810> cool<00:02:16.050> but<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.410> know<00:02:16.530> exactly<00:02:16.590> shocked

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
pretty cool but I know exactly shocked

his<00:02:17.400> chosen<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.940> multiplayer<00:02:18.270> FPS<00:02:18.480> given<00:02:19.140> his

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
his chosen and multiplayer FPS given his

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.070 
his chosen and multiplayer FPS given his
history<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:20.550> words<00:02:20.730> free<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.270> play<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.810> think

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
history the words free to play I think

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.750 
history the words free to play I think
that's<00:02:22.500> going<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.800> be<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.890> difficult<00:02:23.310> one<00:02:23.460> yes

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
that's going to be a difficult one yes

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.730 
that's going to be a difficult one yes
this<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.030> cliffy<00:02:24.330> B<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.080> free-to-play<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.710> a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
this is cliffy B but free-to-play is a

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.800 
this is cliffy B but free-to-play is a
very<00:02:26.220> oversaturated<00:02:27.060> market<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.630> those

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
very oversaturated market and those

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.150 
very oversaturated market and those
words<00:02:28.110> are<00:02:28.260> enough<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.620> put<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.770> lot<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.010> people

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
words are enough to put a lot of people

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.370 
words are enough to put a lot of people
off<00:02:29.370> these<00:02:29.580> days<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.270> don't<00:02:31.110> know<00:02:31.170> about<00:02:31.260> that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
off these days so don't know about that

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.020 
off these days so don't know about that
I'll<00:02:31.710> see<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.010> all<00:02:32.100> comes<00:02:32.310> down<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.490> gameplay

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
I'll see it all comes down to gameplay

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.370 
I'll see it all comes down to gameplay
and<00:02:33.570> when<00:02:33.690> we're<00:02:33.840> not<00:02:33.930> people<00:02:34.110> are<00:02:34.290> actually
