00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
get into definitely the the round stages

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.030 
get into definitely the the round stages
are<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.710> easier<00:01:26.130> ones<00:01:27.140> or<00:01:28.140> flat<00:01:28.619> would<00:01:28.920> be

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
are the easier ones or flat would be

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.219 
are the easier ones or flat would be
easy<00:01:29.570> compared<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.630> some<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> other

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
easy compared to some of the other

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.319 
easy compared to some of the other
stages<00:01:31.790> where<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.880> gets<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.060> little<00:01:33.180> bit

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
stages where it gets a little bit

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.109 
stages where it gets a little bit
trickier<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.500> let's<00:01:35.009> kind<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.639 

actually<00:01:40.119> let's<00:01:40.359> go<00:01:40.479> with<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.719> flat<00:01:41.049> one<00:01:41.229> will

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
actually let's go with the flat one will

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:56.719 
actually let's go with the flat one will
give<00:01:41.770> it<00:01:41.859> a<00:01:41.920> shot<00:01:42.570> see<00:01:43.570> what<00:01:43.600> happens<00:01:44.079> here

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.809 

like<00:01:57.729> I<00:01:57.850> said<00:01:57.909> this<00:01:58.869> one<00:01:59.079> is<00:01:59.289> much<00:01:59.530> flatter<00:02:00.399> one

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
like I said this one is much flatter one

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.499 
like I said this one is much flatter one
so<00:02:01.149> much<00:02:01.420> easier<00:02:01.990> than<00:02:02.500> going<00:02:02.709> through<00:02:02.859> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
so much easier than going through the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.880 
so much easier than going through the
some<00:02:04.509> of<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.659> harder<00:02:04.959> stages<00:02:05.380> that<00:02:05.530> have<00:02:05.709> the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
some of the harder stages that have the

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:32.309 
some of the harder stages that have the
screen<00:02:06.250> shakes<00:02:06.549> or<00:02:06.759> they<00:02:07.420> can<00:02:07.569> be<00:02:23.730> caught<00:02:24.730> you

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.800 

that<00:02:33.319> was<00:02:33.470> such<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.890> wild<00:02:34.299> you<00:02:35.299> know<00:02:35.330> wild

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
little bit but still avoid challenging

00:03:40.440 --> 00:04:02.330 
little bit but still avoid challenging
at<00:03:40.620> times<00:03:52.610> faster<00:03:53.610> you<00:03:53.730> get<00:03:54.060> them<00:04:00.740> yes<00:04:01.740> yes<00:04:01.980> yes

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:51.510 

one<00:04:27.110> more<00:04:27.440> shot<00:04:27.740> ah<00:04:49.000> that's<00:04:50.000> game<00:04:50.420> over
