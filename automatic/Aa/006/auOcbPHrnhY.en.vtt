00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.000 

I<00:00:00.269> think<00:00:00.690> if<00:00:00.780> you<00:00:00.840> look<00:00:00.989> at<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.230> context<00:00:01.920> of

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
I think if you look at the context of

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.280 
I think if you look at the context of
the<00:00:02.070> sell-off<00:00:02.310> it<00:00:02.879> doesn't<00:00:03.210> change<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.750> story

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
the sell-off it doesn't change the story

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.460 
the sell-off it doesn't change the story
of<00:00:04.410> gold<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:05.069> summer<00:00:05.790> buyer<00:00:06.000> so<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.470> that

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
of gold and summer buyer so you that

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.440 
of gold and summer buyer so you that
implies<00:00:07.980> you<00:00:08.189> think<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:08.550> will<00:00:08.730> not<00:00:09.210> only

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
implies you think it will not only

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.900 
implies you think it will not only
recover<00:00:09.929> after<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.800> recent<00:00:11.219> drop<00:00:11.639> but<00:00:11.820> it

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
recover after the recent drop but it

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.820 
recover after the recent drop but it
will<00:00:11.969> carry<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.420> go<00:00:12.630> absolutely<00:00:13.469> Jeremy<00:00:13.799> I

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
will carry on go absolutely Jeremy I

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.140 
will carry on go absolutely Jeremy I
think<00:00:13.889> if<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.340> look<00:00:14.519> at<00:00:14.610> what<00:00:14.759> happened<00:00:15.120> in

in central banks around the world

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.830 
in central banks around the world
because<00:00:26.189> they're<00:00:26.430> trying<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> manage<00:00:26.910> their

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
currencies against gold and gold is a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.609 
currencies against gold and gold is a
barometer<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.869> tells<00:00:31.140> them<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.470> they're

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
barometer that tells them that they're

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.659

doing<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.920> bad<00:00:32.219> job

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
doing a bad job

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.200 
doing a bad job
so<00:00:33.300> once<00:00:33.540> gold<00:00:33.870> spiked<00:00:34.380> up<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.890> way<00:00:35.430> panic

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
so once gold spiked up in this way panic

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.560 
so once gold spiked up in this way panic
bells<00:00:36.420> rang<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:38.100> went<00:00:38.430> after<00:00:38.550> gold<00:00:38.940> sure

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
but tell the explain the series I don't

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.240 
but tell the explain the series I don't
we<00:00:42.690> abandon<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.200> gold<00:00:43.350> standard<00:00:43.770> years<00:00:43.980> ago

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
we abandon the gold standard years ago

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.779 
we abandon the gold standard years ago
we<00:00:44.820> did<00:00:45.000> think<00:00:45.840> about<00:00:45.870> gold<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
we did think about gold is that it's the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.279 
we did think about gold is that it's the
only<00:00:47.820> reason<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.360> has<00:00:48.510> value<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.170> it

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
only reason it has value is that it

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.740 
only reason it has value is that it
always<00:00:49.469> has<00:00:49.940> people<00:00:50.940> buy<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.149> because<00:00:51.449> other

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
always has people buy it because other

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.260 
always has people buy it because other
people<00:00:52.020> buy<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.610> because<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> hasn't<00:00:53.879> uses

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
people buy it because it hasn't uses

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.029 
people buy it because it hasn't uses
jewelry<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.230> um<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
jewelry and so on but um but for the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.619 
jewelry and so on but um but for the
most<00:00:56.190> part<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> kind<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.090> investment

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
most part it's a kind of investment

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.630 
most part it's a kind of investment
that's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:58.230> bet<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.989> civilization<00:01:00.989> or<00:01:01.109> collapse

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
that's a bet on civilization or collapse

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
that's a bet on civilization or collapse
but<00:01:02.640> let's<00:01:02.820> look<00:01:02.940> at<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.120> gold<00:01:03.300> standard

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
but let's look at that gold standard

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.509 
but let's look at that gold standard
question<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> second<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.619> since<00:01:04.860> 2009

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
question for a second because since 2009

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.940 
question for a second because since 2009
central<00:01:06.180> banks<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.450> been<00:01:06.659> buyers<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.680> gold

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950

for the first time in decades because

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.620 
for the first time in decades because

we've got over there is worth several
thousand<00:03:10.299> pounds<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.909> can<00:03:13.030> divide

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
thousand pounds and and you can divide

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.910 
thousand pounds and and you can divide
it<00:03:13.510> up<00:03:13.629> it's<00:03:13.870> easily<00:03:14.019> measurable<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.739> mean

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
it up it's easily measurable I mean

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.860 
it up it's easily measurable I mean
historically<00:03:15.340> do<00:03:15.730> good<00:03:15.940> reasons<00:03:16.269> why<00:03:16.329> why<00:03:16.810> it

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
historically do good reasons why why it

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.539 
historically do good reasons why why it
was<00:03:17.049> used<00:03:17.230> as<00:03:17.410> currency<00:03:17.560> but<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.040> just<00:03:18.310> think<00:03:18.459> as

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
was used as currency but I just think as

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.189 
was used as currency but I just think as
a<00:03:18.579> civilization<00:03:19.299> we've<00:03:19.449> kind<00:03:19.690> of<00:03:19.750> moved<00:03:19.959> past

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.199 
a civilization we've kind of moved past

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.319 
a civilization we've kind of moved past
that<00:03:20.319> there's<00:03:21.040> another<00:03:21.370> factor<00:03:21.819> here<00:03:21.849> Jeremy

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
that there's another factor here Jeremy

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.360 
that there's another factor here Jeremy
which<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.629> that<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.049> central<00:03:23.410> banks<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:24.010> the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
which is that the central banks and the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.490 
which is that the central banks and the
big<00:03:24.609> too-big-to-fail<00:03:25.269> banks<00:03:25.629> don't<00:03:26.199> trust

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
big too-big-to-fail banks don't trust

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.140 
big too-big-to-fail banks don't trust
each<00:03:26.739> other<00:03:27.040> that's<00:03:27.639> why<00:03:27.849> they're<00:03:28.030> not

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
each other that's why they're not

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.939 
each other that's why they're not
lending<00:03:28.750> into<00:03:29.049> this<00:03:29.139> marketplace<00:03:29.709> because
