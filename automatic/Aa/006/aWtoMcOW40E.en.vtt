00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.849
 good 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.470
 the next thing I wanted to show you 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.859
 it is this 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.329
 this is a drum brake at first 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.350
 seen the difference with the brakes of 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.720
 disk 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.070
 this has a couple of pills around 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.020
 a couple of d 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.940
 of hallway in the big pills are 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.940
 ice cream as it is called in colombia 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.640
 good but they are if the bands tell them 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.940
 bands and are some pills on average 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.400
 moon in in this way if one here and another 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.769
 that form the circuit what happens is 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.470
 that this inside has a spring when 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.230
 do not press the brake if that distorts 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.900
 the spring so that the spring was this 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.180
 and the bands are pushed against this area 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.160
 that there is another friction band and for the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.539
 friction if this is the part that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.250
 surround this part of here they keep 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.259
 always quiet is for that which 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.610
 wheel with that final friction will do 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.899
 contact of the bands with that section 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.270
 outside 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.220
 they begin to slow down the if different from the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.440
 brake disc disc brake and rotate 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.840
 everything and what there is is a 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.520
 floating gag that yes it is 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.770
 grabbed and bites the disk has all 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.960
 the anthologies inside the system not 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.240
 there is how it is triggered between once 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.150
 this does so the spring antrum was 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.920
 push the bands outside 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.370
 damn me yo and the bands are the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.260
 that slow 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.230
 the case what I wanted to show you is 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.290
 who 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.860
 these out are not comfortable because they are 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.850
 per share 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.600
 manual or springs there are some very bands 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.369
 particular there is a vision 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.369
 and some is that the actions always 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.230
 have a fingerprint 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.780
 this is a water and this line is going to 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.660
 take the cable to do I thought here 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.100
 it is supremely descending its brakes to 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.710
 as much as the actions the more 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.940
 begins to come down as a brake tension 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.060
 When so it has given extension 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.770
 ok regularly this piece coming 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.770
 here it is more outward 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:29.590
 I hope there are songs because they can 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.560
 hold the camera while good what 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.690
 one does is take this and pull it 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.330
 inwards if one starts to squeeze 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.600
 Squeeze this character 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.600
 begin to tighten 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.780
 plus one always messes with us 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.810
 and the more you tighten with me, the more 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.350
 hard harder harder indeed this in 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.780
 reality was to get hold of 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.610
 Maya 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.260
 it's not hard enough to 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.030
 have to apply the force of the key 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.439
 and I do it by hand and what's important 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.439
 it is karapetista nut in such a way 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.580
 which agrees with the guides and which are 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.280
 the guides they have in all the planes 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:22.260
 we're going to have to always have a 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.319
 little experience one face 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.170
 horrible autofocus term bed good 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.180
 always a small guide 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.620
 I made this date and this arrow let me say 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.260
 with another little guide here is another 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.000
 flechita and on 'the motorcycle are located in 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.010
 different sites that is to say we can be 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.940
 one here and the other digs but always 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.090
 you have to leave one with the other couple 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.190
 So if what we do is go up here 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.950
 above 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.870
 to touch the brake let's see what 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.910
 surprise is no longer going to be coming 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.130
 background but it starts actions here 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.350
 but still I feel a little loose 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.730
 for my taste but let's do the 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.310
 anyone who needs what will 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.700
 to do is to continue tightening the one 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.700
 little more 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.840
 does not know what it is to squeeze height 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.849
 trap 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.449
 actually we have gone is very small 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.780
 right now I think it's already like 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.780
 almost to the top 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.420
 back to that up and much more 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:29.000
 tight much more coma 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.770
 and as well as then the way 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.540
 stress to a drum plane is 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.950
 exactly the same mechanism for the 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.470
 rear brake that the front when 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.730
 this drum 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.550
 and a first-timer does not really need 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.800
 to retire 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:48.080
 you have to be fighting with cables or 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.080
 bullshit and moving it towards 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.390
 forward and backward 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.470
 we'll see 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.840
 much more common then it is actually 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.840
 more effective but also you do not have 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.779
 need to be stressing by moving it to 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.949
 nowhere 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:17.150
 another thing that I wanted to comment and it's 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.180
 I received a lot of criticism and comments 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.129
 because when I did the first tour the 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.560
 understand to drive on a motorcycle we started 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.360
 a very gentle tactician take us 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.639
 and the bike started to move and many 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.430
 people told me but everything moves 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:36.250
 without acceleration to my motorcycle does not happen that 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.250
 then a motorcycle with high displacement motorcycles 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.990
 loose 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.110
 began to be the 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.010
 very soft made to make it very soft 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.010
 to see that it does not go out 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.800
 but impossible to be paid with the motorcycle 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.840
 low displacement has all the power 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.610
 that has the dirty 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.260
 that's why that happens that's why they're going to 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.480
 pass to many people who try 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.480
 motorcycles of 100 the 125 cubic centimeters 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.550
 not being more the comrades abandonments 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.580
 because this one 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.690
 Displaying fail to see but here at 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.690
 dance the bike and again 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:24.500
 look how it is 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:27.590
 and the letter 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.740
 3 chamber is fired up then very 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.740
 all right 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.760
 i 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.530
 good
