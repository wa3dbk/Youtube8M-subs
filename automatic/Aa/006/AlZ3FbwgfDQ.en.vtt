be<00:02:21.200> using<00:02:21.650> regular<00:02:22.099> sewing<00:02:22.430> thread<00:02:29.109> with<00:02:30.109> a

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
be using regular sewing thread with a

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.929 
be using regular sewing thread with a
needle<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:31.519> what<00:02:32.239> you're<00:02:32.390> going<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.689> do<00:02:32.930> is

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
needle and what you're going to do is

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.819 
needle and what you're going to do is
it's<00:02:34.939> much<00:02:35.209> like<00:02:35.510> finger<00:02:35.959> loop<00:02:36.170> rating<00:02:36.620> and

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
it's much like finger loop rating and

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.649 
it's much like finger loop rating and
what<00:02:37.609> you're<00:02:37.730> going<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:37.970> be<00:02:38.090> doing<00:02:38.480> is

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
what you're going to be doing is

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.289 
what you're going to be doing is
securing<00:02:39.439> that<00:02:39.680> braid<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.760> edge<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.180> the

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
securing that braid to the edge of the

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.930 
securing that braid to the edge of the
fabric<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:42.349> it<00:02:42.739> finishes<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.280> fabric<00:02:43.790> as

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
fabric and it finishes the fabric as

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.830 
fabric and it finishes the fabric as
well<00:02:44.150> as<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:45.650> it's<00:02:45.829> two<00:02:46.040> pieces<00:02:46.430> together<00:02:46.840> so

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
well as so it's two pieces together so

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.979 
well as so it's two pieces together so
