this was about 50 cents a bottle if you

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.470

some water so I get a very kind of a
diluted<00:01:16.130> medium<00:01:17.130> opaque<00:01:17.700> finish<00:01:18.689> what<00:01:18.930> does

that mean medium opaque well it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.760 
that mean medium opaque well it
basically<00:01:21.000> means<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.930> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.530> runny

start to apply the white on to the
surface<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.640> my<00:01:29.790> model<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.930> I'll<00:01:31.079> take<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
surface of my model then I'll take a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.100 
surface of my model then I'll take a
hairdryer<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.340> accelerate<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.479> drying<00:01:33.689> time

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
hairdryer to accelerate the drying time

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.920 
hairdryer to accelerate the drying time
and<00:01:34.350> give<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.590> some<00:01:34.799> unique<00:01:35.270> look<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.659> this

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and give it some unique look like this

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.100 
and give it some unique look like this
here<00:01:37.259> some<00:01:37.530> staining<00:01:38.030> as<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.270> see<00:01:39.479> along<00:01:39.720> here

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
here some staining as you see along here

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.039 
here some staining as you see along here
and<00:01:40.369> that<00:01:41.369> will<00:01:41.490> give<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> unique<00:01:42.240> look

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and that will give that a unique look

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.539 
and that will give that a unique look
where<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.380> lay<00:01:43.560> down<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.799> little<00:01:44.009> thicker<00:01:44.310> and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
where you lay down a little thicker and

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.399 
where you lay down a little thicker and
that<00:01:45.030> helps<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> give<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.810> weathered

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
that helps to give it that weathered

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.830 
that helps to give it that weathered
faded<00:01:47.040> look<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.820> can<00:01:48.119> put<00:01:48.360> one<00:01:48.659> or<00:01:48.689> two

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840

light<00:03:53.000> or<00:03:53.180> dark<00:03:53.209> it<00:03:53.630> doesn't<00:03:53.660> matter<00:03:54.110> you

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
light or dark it doesn't matter you

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.750 
light or dark it doesn't matter you
don't<00:03:54.470> want<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.769> be<00:03:54.860> perfect<00:03:55.310> because<00:03:55.430> that's

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
don't want to be perfect because that's

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.819 
don't want to be perfect because that's
not<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.180> way<00:03:56.209> things<00:03:56.630> happen<00:03:57.110> over<00:03:57.799> time

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
not the way things happen over time

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.220 
not the way things happen over time
they're<00:03:58.280> not<00:03:58.430> perfect<00:03:58.940> so<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.420> little<00:04:00.049> variety

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
they're not perfect so a little variety

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.319 
they're not perfect so a little variety
is<00:04:00.590> good<00:04:00.829> so<00:04:01.040> if<00:04:01.130> you<00:04:01.250> think<00:04:01.850> you're<00:04:02.000> making<00:04:02.150> a

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
is good so if you think you're making a

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.520 
is good so if you think you're making a
mistake<00:04:02.420> you're<00:04:02.840> probably<00:04:02.870> not<00:04:03.320> it's

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
mistake you're probably not it's

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.440 
mistake you're probably not it's
probably<00:04:03.650> just<00:04:03.890> looking<00:04:04.609> more<00:04:04.850> realistic

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
probably just looking more realistic

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.090 
probably just looking more realistic

the powder on to the surface of the the
building<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.000> so<00:04:21.810> I'll<00:04:22.079> accelerate<00:04:22.530> dry<00:04:23.070> time

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
same sort of thing and didn't make it

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.110 
same sort of thing and didn't make it
perfect<00:05:04.800> on<00:05:04.980> my<00:05:05.130> building<00:05:05.400> doesn't<00:05:05.820> have<00:05:05.970> to

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
perfect on my building doesn't have to

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
because people are going in and out then

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.870 
because people are going in and out then
I<00:05:12.120> applied<00:05:12.510> these<00:05:12.750> signs<00:05:13.050> I<00:05:13.440> had<00:05:14.250> this<00:05:14.460> thing

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
I applied these signs I had this thing

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.850 
I applied these signs I had this thing
left<00:05:15.210> over<00:05:15.480> from<00:05:15.630> another<00:05:15.780> kit<00:05:16.290> so<00:05:16.530> I<00:05:16.560> just

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
left over from another kit so I just

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.220 
left over from another kit so I just
glued<00:05:17.790> it<00:05:17.940> on<00:05:18.090> use<00:05:18.480> it<00:05:18.630> looks<00:05:18.840> like<00:05:18.990> a<00:05:19.020> nice

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
glued it on use it looks like a nice

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.640 
glued it on use it looks like a nice
ventilation<00:05:19.860> unit<00:05:20.130> I'll<00:05:20.490> use<00:05:20.790> another<00:05:20.820> one

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
ventilation unit I'll use another one

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.960 
ventilation unit I'll use another one
I'll<00:05:22.650> use<00:05:22.890> some<00:05:23.070> other<00:05:23.250> things<00:05:23.550> on<00:05:23.700> here<00:05:23.850> to

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
I'll use some other things on here to

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.850 
I'll use some other things on here to
make<00:05:24.150> it<00:05:24.300> look<00:05:24.450> more<00:05:24.630> realistic<00:05:25.050> for<00:05:25.440> venting

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
make it look more realistic for venting

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.450 
make it look more realistic for venting
now<00:05:26.300> over<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.450> train<00:05:27.780> interests<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.979> doorway

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
now over the train interests the doorway

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.060 
now over the train interests the doorway
here<00:05:29.850> you'll<00:05:30.330> notice<00:05:30.570> so<00:05:30.930> and<00:05:31.260> this<00:05:32.010> is

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
here you'll notice so and this is

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.520 
here you'll notice so and this is
because<00:05:32.610> trains<00:05:32.910> often<00:05:33.360> sit<00:05:33.570> here<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:34.020> the

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
because trains often sit here and the

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.930 
because trains often sit here and the
exhaust<00:05:34.919> will<00:05:35.190> go<00:05:35.340> up<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.550> side<00:05:35.760> of<00:05:35.790> the

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
exhaust will go up the side of the

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.640 
exhaust will go up the side of the
building<00:05:36.060> adds<00:05:36.390> just<00:05:36.690> another<00:05:36.990> dimension<00:05:37.290> of

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
building adds just another dimension of

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.140 
building adds just another dimension of
realism<00:05:38.010> and<00:05:38.340> again<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.270> door<00:05:39.570> and<00:05:39.840> base<00:05:40.470> of

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
realism and again the door and base of

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.350 
realism and again the door and base of
this<00:05:42.150> building<00:05:42.930> is<00:05:43.520> treated<00:05:44.520> with<00:05:44.700> the<00:05:44.940> the

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
this building is treated with the the

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.870 
this building is treated with the the
powders<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:46.020> then<00:05:46.890> along<00:05:47.190> the<00:05:47.340> side<00:05:47.370> same

things like that that you would find in
a<00:06:03.330> typical<00:06:04.340> railroad<00:06:05.340> machine<00:06:05.790> shed<00:06:06.090> all

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
a typical railroad machine shed all

a typical railroad machine shed all
right<00:06:07.200> now<00:06:07.380> that's<00:06:07.650> about<00:06:07.979> it<00:06:08.160> I<00:06:08.310> let<00:06:08.520> it<00:06:08.640> set

this one I've shown before but this is a

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.760 
this one I've shown before but this is a
fuel<00:06:25.470> dump<00:06:25.830> that<00:06:26.130> I<00:06:26.190> can't<00:06:26.580> bashed<00:06:26.880> or<00:06:27.330> a<00:06:27.360> few

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
fuel dump that I can't bashed or a few

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.270 
fuel dump that I can't bashed or a few
storage<00:06:28.250> area<00:06:28.610> and<00:06:28.819> I<00:06:29.810> did<00:06:30.319> sort<00:06:30.560> of<00:06:30.650> basically

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
storage area and I did sort of basically

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.279 
storage area and I did sort of basically
the<00:06:31.370> same<00:06:31.669> thing<00:06:31.970> here<00:06:32.300> with<00:06:32.599> weathering<00:06:33.139> and

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289 
the same thing here with weathering and
