draw these characters right now I'm just
doing<00:02:32.710> it<00:02:33.160> very<00:02:33.190> quickly<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.850> just<00:02:34.270> put<00:02:35.080> down

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
doing it very quickly to just put down

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.470 
doing it very quickly to just put down
some<00:02:35.470> ideas<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:36.040> can<00:02:36.280> move<00:02:36.940> on<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.390> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
some ideas so we can move on to the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.900 
some ideas so we can move on to the
other<00:02:37.630> steps<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:42.250> then<00:02:42.430> we<00:02:42.520> have<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.640> rough

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
other steps and then we have a rough

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.500 
other steps and then we have a rough
idea<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.330> illustration<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:46.420> I've

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
idea of the illustration and I've

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.270 
idea of the illustration and I've
already<00:02:46.810> done<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.020> few<00:02:47.140> drawing<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.040> few<00:02:48.190> of

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
already done a few drawing a few of

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.280 
already done a few drawing a few of
these<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:49.150> move<00:02:49.270> this<00:02:49.420> one<00:02:49.540> quicker<00:02:49.900> but<00:02:50.110> just

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
these to move this one quicker but just

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.890 
these to move this one quicker but just
show<00:02:50.470> my<00:02:50.650> thinking<00:02:51.270> that's<00:02:52.270> kind<00:02:52.570> of<00:02:52.630> what<00:02:52.810> I'm

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900

originally and there were certain

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.820 
originally and there were certain
problem<00:02:57.820> areas<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.300> I<00:02:58.480> mean<00:02:58.690> get<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.320> red<00:02:59.560> pen

long<00:03:22.830> he<00:03:23.830> doesn't<00:03:24.100> really<00:03:24.430> have<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:24.760> much<00:03:25.330> of<00:03:25.360> a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
long he doesn't really have a much of a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.100 
long he doesn't really have a much of a
neck

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
neck

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.070 
neck
he's<00:03:26.440> more<00:03:26.770> drawn<00:03:27.010> with<00:03:27.310> this<00:03:27.580> a<00:03:28.240> teardrop

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
he's more drawn with this a teardrop

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.980 
he's more drawn with this a teardrop
shape<00:03:29.200> with<00:03:29.740> an<00:03:29.860> egg<00:03:29.980> on<00:03:30.160> top<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:31.420> that's<00:03:31.690> more

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
shape with an egg on top and that's more

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.660 
shape with an egg on top and that's more
easy<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:32.470> this<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.800> he's<00:03:33.130> really<00:03:33.370> stretched

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
easy so this is he's really stretched

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:44.460 
easy so this is he's really stretched
out<00:03:33.910> here<00:03:34.209> but<00:03:34.480> it's<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.870> little<00:03:34.990> too<00:03:35.200> much<00:03:43.470> is

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
out here but it's a little too much is

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.040 
out here but it's a little too much is
it<00:03:44.620> just<00:03:44.800> thinking<00:03:45.130> things<00:03:45.490> I'm<00:03:45.900> thinking<00:03:46.900> of

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
it just thinking things I'm thinking of

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.560 
it just thinking things I'm thinking of
as<00:03:47.230> I'm<00:03:47.500> looking<00:03:48.160> at<00:03:48.430> what<00:03:48.700> I've<00:03:48.820> drawn<00:03:49.090> to

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
as I'm looking at what I've drawn to

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.310 
as I'm looking at what I've drawn to
modify<00:03:50.320> it

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
modify it

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.199 
modify it
this<00:03:56.310> Bunny's<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.400> little<00:03:57.610> bit<00:03:57.730> better<00:03:57.880> in<00:03:58.090> this

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
this Bunny's a little bit better in this

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.210 
this Bunny's a little bit better in this
version<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:58.810> I<00:03:58.900> drew<00:03:59.110> now<00:03:59.739> there's<00:04:00.070> some

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
version that I drew now there's some

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.430 
version that I drew now there's some
things<00:04:00.270> overall<00:04:01.270> composition<00:04:01.630> seems<00:04:02.170> to<00:04:02.350> be

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
things overall composition seems to be

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.430 
things overall composition seems to be
like<00:04:02.770> this<00:04:03.420> reversal<00:04:04.420> here<00:04:04.840> with<00:04:05.140> this

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
like this reversal here with this

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.810 
like this reversal here with this
that<00:04:07.440> finish<00:04:07.830> overall<00:04:08.340> visual<00:04:08.730> shape<00:04:09.300> I<00:04:10.820> drew

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
that finish overall visual shape I drew

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.820 
that finish overall visual shape I drew
it<00:04:11.970> in<00:04:12.360> silhouette<00:04:13.050> so<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.260> could<00:04:13.440> see<00:04:13.650> the

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
it in silhouette so I could see the

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.729 
it in silhouette so I could see the
shape<00:04:14.010> better

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
shape better

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.500 
shape better
right<00:04:16.739> now<00:04:16.860> so<00:04:17.100> not<00:04:17.489> super<00:04:17.880> interesting<00:04:18.420> the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
right now so not super interesting the

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.449 
right now so not super interesting the
other<00:04:18.570> thing<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.590> feels<00:04:19.830> like<00:04:19.980> bunny

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
other thing is that it feels like bunny

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.630 
other thing is that it feels like bunny
is<00:04:20.790> in<00:04:21.690> perspective<00:04:22.410> like<00:04:22.950> we're<00:04:23.220> looking

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
is in perspective like we're looking

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.110 
is in perspective like we're looking
down<00:04:23.670> on<00:04:24.060> this<00:04:24.180> shot<00:04:25.640> there<00:04:26.640> put<00:04:27.030> the

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
down on this shot there put the

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.380 
down on this shot there put the
perspective<00:04:27.720> perspective<00:04:27.930> grid<00:04:28.500> in<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.520> so

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
perspective perspective grid in and so

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.730 
perspective perspective grid in and so
what<00:04:30.600> I<00:04:30.630> did<00:04:30.780> was<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:30.990> tried<00:04:31.200> to<00:04:31.320> look<00:04:31.440> lower

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
what I did was I tried to look lower

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.170 
what I did was I tried to look lower
bunny<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:32.400> put<00:04:32.730> a<00:04:32.760> new<00:04:32.910> perspective

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
bunny and put a new perspective

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
bunny and put a new perspective
breathing<00:04:33.780> down<00:04:33.990> no<00:04:34.560> it<00:04:34.680> feels<00:04:34.800> better<00:04:36.200> just

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
breathing down no it feels better just

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.630 
breathing down no it feels better just
by<00:04:37.350> lowering<00:04:37.590> him<00:04:38.720> down<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:39.750> little<00:04:39.990> bit<00:04:40.610> so<00:04:41.610> I

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
by lowering him down a little bit so I

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.250 
by lowering him down a little bit so I
tried<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.120> move<00:04:42.240> him<00:04:42.390> over<00:04:42.450> here<00:04:42.900> and<00:04:43.020> now<00:04:43.200> he

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
tried to move him over here and now he

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.860 
tried to move him over here and now he
starts<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.890> know<00:04:44.010> become<00:04:44.670> fighting<00:04:45.360> me<00:04:45.510> the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
starts you know become fighting me the

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.440 
starts you know become fighting me the
edge<00:04:45.960> of<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.290> screen<00:04:46.560> here<00:04:46.950> and<00:04:47.520> it's<00:04:48.300> almost

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
edge of the screen here and it's almost

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.440 
edge of the screen here and it's almost
a<00:04:48.660> little<00:04:48.690> too<00:04:49.020> much<00:04:49.200> separation<00:04:50.210> so<00:04:51.210> I<00:04:51.240> don't

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
a little too much separation so I don't

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.200 
a little too much separation so I don't
want<00:04:51.570> to<00:04:51.630> do<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.840> so<00:04:52.170> I<00:04:52.200> move<00:04:52.440> him<00:04:52.530> back<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:54.090> I

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
want to do that so I move him back and I

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.520 
want to do that so I move him back and I
put<00:04:54.450> alright<00:04:54.870> so<00:04:55.050> what<00:04:55.200> if<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:57.530> horizon

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
put alright so what if the the horizon

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.200 
put alright so what if the the horizon
line<00:04:58.680> was<00:04:58.890> way<00:04:59.100> down<00:04:59.250> here<00:04:59.520> so<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.820> very<00:04:59.970> low

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
line was way down here so the very low

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.730 
line was way down here so the very low
angle<00:05:02.030> that<00:05:03.030> it<00:05:03.600> does<00:05:03.780> it<00:05:03.960> feels<00:05:04.380> like<00:05:04.560> he's<00:05:04.710> a

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
angle that it does it feels like he's a

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.250 
angle that it does it feels like he's a
little<00:05:04.890> too<00:05:05.190> more<00:05:05.430> remote<00:05:05.790> now<00:05:06.000> so<00:05:06.900> I<00:05:07.110> could

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
little too more remote now so I could

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.500 
little too more remote now so I could
change<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.190> bring<00:05:08.400> Giggy<00:05:08.790> in<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.120> foreground

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
change and bring Giggy in the foreground

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.950 
change and bring Giggy in the foreground
more<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.350> then<00:05:11.220> I<00:05:11.280> can<00:05:11.430> bring<00:05:11.520> bunny<00:05:12.030> down<00:05:12.390> and

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
more and then I can bring bunny down and

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.200 
more and then I can bring bunny down and
I<00:05:13.230> start<00:05:13.560> now<00:05:13.680> getting<00:05:14.040> this<00:05:14.130> nice<00:05:14.340> flow<00:05:14.790> going

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
I start now getting this nice flow going

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.200 
I start now getting this nice flow going
on<00:05:15.360> here<00:05:18.410> is<00:05:19.410> more<00:05:19.950> interesting<00:05:20.490> composition

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
on here is more interesting composition

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.620 
on here is more interesting composition
shape<00:05:22.220> it's<00:05:23.220> often<00:05:23.520> interesting<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.090> try<00:05:24.390> and

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
shape it's often interesting to try and

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.590 
shape it's often interesting to try and
create<00:05:25.620> your<00:05:25.860> overall<00:05:26.730> composition<00:05:27.090> is<00:05:27.450> that

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
create your overall composition is that

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.890 
create your overall composition is that
a<00:05:27.780> letter<00:05:28.140> form<00:05:28.560> or<00:05:28.860> maybe<00:05:29.550> even<00:05:29.850> some<00:05:30.600> sort<00:05:30.750> of

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
a letter form or maybe even some sort of

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.159 
a letter form or maybe even some sort of
imaginary<00:05:31.650> letter<00:05:31.950> or<00:05:32.160> foreign<00:05:32.550> letter<00:05:33.169> this

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
imaginary letter or foreign letter this

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.560 
imaginary letter or foreign letter this
is<00:05:34.380> what<00:05:34.530> I<00:05:34.560> did<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:35.160> final<00:05:35.580> part<00:05:35.760> when<00:05:36.180> I<00:05:36.210> move

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
is what I did the final part when I move

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.460 
is what I did the final part when I move
the<00:05:37.940> the<00:05:38.940> fireball<00:05:39.450> coming<00:05:39.720> towards<00:05:40.200> bunny

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
the the fireball coming towards bunny

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.470 
the the fireball coming towards bunny
much<00:05:40.800> closer<00:05:41.130> to<00:05:41.400> bunny<00:05:41.580> and<00:05:41.790> there's<00:05:42.300> more

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
much closer to bunny and there's more

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.600 
much closer to bunny and there's more
distance<00:05:42.960> here<00:05:43.140> so<00:05:43.770> really<00:05:44.100> leads<00:05:44.370> your<00:05:44.580> eye

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610
