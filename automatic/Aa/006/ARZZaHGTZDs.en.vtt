00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.650
 and we can from youtube what is in this 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.930
 video tutorial I will teach you how to put 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.560
 the blocking effect of the devices 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.420
 shakespeare since it consists in that the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.770
 phone do what in a way that 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:32.099
 look like an old television look here 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:36.090
 I'm going to show you what the effect is 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.460
 and as they saw it closes halfway 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.790
 and well then I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.840
 install it to do this they have to 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.170
 download two applications that are 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.300
 exposed to box and expo are installed 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.910
 two applications will be left in the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.210
 description so that you download them to your 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.400
 device when they have installed 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.290
 the two applications the first thing that 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.550
 let's do is go to the application is 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.550
 possible to install 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.530
 here in the application the first thing that 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.380
 should do is notice that here where I 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.020
 I have this is a number two color 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.630
 green you will appear another 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.720
 number or they will appear this but 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.840
 red if they appear red what they have 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.110
 what to do is give it here where it says 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.320
 install of that 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.850
 when they read there they will appear this and you 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.850
 give here where it says accept 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.120
 and that's it, and those numbers must already 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.790
 appear in green and thus equal to 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.460
 on the other side when they already have them 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.750
 what we are going to do is go to this 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.690
 tab that says modules 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.430
 in this tab you will see the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.060
 another application that I told them 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.030
 previously that is the expository to 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.540
 you will not appear here marked in 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.119
 this box will appear to them like this and 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.909
 you are going to chulear there 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.840
 and after chulear what they should do 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:18.959
 is to give here where says wife tweet box 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.360
 and will take you to another menu in this menu 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.680
 what they are going to do is select the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.870
 crt effect option 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.719
 when we see there we will see several 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.469
 options and what we should choose is 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.920
 this one that says crt of effects with this 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.859
 option 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.970
 we would be activating the effect so that 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:42.450
 close like this 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.060
 so when we have marked there what 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.870
 what we are going to do is restart our 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.870
 device 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.210
 ok since it has restarted its 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:04.960
 device 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:07.570
 they will block it and they will rehearse if yes 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.720
 they are left to the first few times 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.750
 you do it may not come out 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.030
 the effect or it comes out with some 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.150
 mistakes like I just happened to me that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.790
 I'm going to show you how you see there 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.750
 is getting right but that's while 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.360
 they are the first times they do it but 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.810
 After that, they do it again no longer 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.090
 will have errors like there are seeing 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.940
 Look, she does not have any mistakes and 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.510
 well when they see that they are good 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.580
 already there will not have failures again 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.400
 nor will the screen reappear 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.250
 learned and it shuts down immediately and 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.060
 with this they will fit and serve 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.970
 the crt effect when you have already 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.280
 done this do not install them in any of 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.130
 the two applications because they no longer 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.920
 will serve 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.960
 the good effect friends this has been all 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.060
 I hope you liked the tutorial
