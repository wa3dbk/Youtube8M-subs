00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
off the crate you should bounce quite a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.190 
off the crate you should bounce quite a
few<00:00:34.260> feet<00:00:34.469> foot<00:00:34.950> into<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> air<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.899> if<00:00:36.899> you

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
few feet foot into the air and if you

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.180

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
because there aren't many bounces in

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.170 
because there aren't many bounces in
modern<00:00:40.140> warfare<00:00:40.260> 3<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.790> don't<00:00:42.000> like

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
modern warfare 3 so if you don't like

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.639 
modern warfare 3 so if you don't like
