in this video you will understand how
the<00:00:10.760> search<00:00:11.180> engines

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
the search engines

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.570 
the search engines
work<00:00:13.799> how<00:00:14.799> do<00:00:14.860> searches<00:00:15.549> as<00:00:15.940> work<00:00:16.380> so<00:00:17.380> you<00:00:18.369> want

work how do searches as work so you want
to<00:00:18.670> know<00:00:18.849> what<00:00:19.420> makes<00:00:19.660> them<00:00:19.960> tick<00:00:20.020> and<00:00:20.470> how<00:00:21.250> you

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
to know what makes them tick and how you

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.909 
to know what makes them tick and how you

better<00:00:24.369> search<00:00:24.849> engine<00:00:25.180> ranking<00:00:25.980> let's<00:00:26.980> get

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
better search engine ranking let's get

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.080 
better search engine ranking let's get
started<00:00:27.220> by<00:00:28.000> looking<00:00:28.630> at<00:00:28.900> how<00:00:29.199> they<00:00:29.470> work<00:00:30.090> okay

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
started by looking at how they work okay

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.290

first<00:00:32.050> East<00:00:32.769> search<00:00:33.280> engine<00:00:33.730> will<00:00:34.059> have

first East search engine will have

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.360 
first East search engine will have
slightly<00:00:34.540> different<00:00:34.870> methods<00:00:35.410> of<00:00:35.890> collecting

slightly different methods of collecting

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.060 
slightly different methods of collecting
data<00:00:36.879> but<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:37.780> concept<00:00:38.410> will<00:00:38.949> be<00:00:39.129> similar

most search engines use what we call a

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.329 
most search engines use what we call a
spider<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.610> what<00:00:45.879> does<00:00:46.180> this<00:00:46.629> spider<00:00:47.049> do<00:00:47.470> well

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
be fresh because if you use too much old

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.890 
be fresh because if you use too much old
content<00:03:46.199> the<00:03:46.769> spider<00:03:47.220> will<00:03:47.879> recognize<00:03:48.599> this

content the spider will recognize this

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.979 
content the spider will recognize this
and<00:03:49.199> it<00:03:49.889> will<00:03:49.919> decrease<00:03:50.220> your<00:03:50.819> page<00:03:51.480> ranking

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
and it will decrease your page ranking

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.909 
and it will decrease your page ranking
so<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.799> spotter<00:03:53.160> actually<00:03:53.669> visits<00:03:54.239> your<00:03:54.449> site

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
so the spotter actually visits your site

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.129 
so the spotter actually visits your site
more<00:03:55.919> than<00:03:56.160> once<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:57.299> if<00:03:57.419> it<00:03:57.569> finds<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:58.019> it

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
more than once so if it finds that it

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.259 
more than once so if it finds that it
has<00:03:58.319> old<00:03:58.590> content<00:03:59.160> every<00:03:59.400> single<00:03:59.790> time<00:04:00.060> it

visits<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.900> then<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:02.099> decreases<00:04:02.639> your<00:04:03.239> page

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
visits it then it decreases your page
