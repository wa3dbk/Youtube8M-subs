00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.460
 before you bring a puppy home or in 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.919
 the first days of life puppies your home you 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.269
 must prepare an apartment and make 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.820
 safe for puppy 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.730
 Let's start with the fact that puppies explores the world with 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.220
 using your teeth with probing everything 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.470
 on the tooth and it's ok it's not harm 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.720
 they are not trying to do something for you bottom 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.600
 they just thus explores 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.789
 the world and understand that it is tasty that 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.539
 there are no opportunities for anyone 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.470
 subjects that you can say that you can not 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.500
 based on this you start 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.180
 prepare the apartment the appearance of a puppy 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.430
 let's start with what you get on 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.540
 fours you have to see the world since 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.219
 sees his puppy 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.590
 and introduce yourself to the puppy's place 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.430
 Carefully walk through that apartment where 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.039
 he will walk 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.899
 ordinary leschenko highlighting one or two 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.840
 room or room and corridor 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.430
 I close the rest of the apartment so 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.190
 much easier to prepare an apartment 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.010
 and pick up all the dangerous items 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.590
 we start with the wires all the wires which 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.680
 stick out who lie on the floor should be 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.220
 I hide hidden behind the baseboard or 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.580
 put 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.340
 near the wall of the board and in the board I 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.150
 spend the wire the next moment i can 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.939
 wire to take 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.570
 lift up and attach to the walls with 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.610
 using scotch tape or any fasteners 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.680
 this is very important ceilings are often invited 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.409
 wires and get just not all 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.290
 survive the second moment you start 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.470
 look at the presence of small details which 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.909
 out small details often she bedside tables 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.220
 There are some figurines of a pen toy. 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.040
 leaves of paper notebooks are all we 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.590
 we clean away the puppy field exhausted and 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.659
 will try it is fraught with not only 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.880
 so that you lose some valuable for 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.280
 you things but the fact that the puppy can 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.409
 gnawed off a piece to swallow and this 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.079
 the rest of my face create with 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.810
 using the operation and then not a fact survive 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.890
 spout or not so before 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.409
 have a puppy 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.399
 to grow on the knee in the middle atelier 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.829
 all that a puppy can take its teeth and 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.830
 look to what can reach on 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.240
 tidy up all these things hide the wires 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.700
 the next moment 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.920
 you should definitely look at you
