00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:13.990
 the truck part is very interesting 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:16.490
 talk about what power is 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.279
 specific to the motors of the 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.499
 trucks is also a tool of 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.539
 work is a work tool 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:26.390
 that must be totally profitable should 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.849
 to be able to pay himself for it he 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.710
 they require that these vehicles have to 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.329
 have some crucial characteristics 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.920
 one of the most characteristic 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.780
 particular is the consumption of 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.969
 fuel you have to maintain consumption 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.240
 of minimum minimum fuels that 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.400
 we can 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.430
 how do we take photos to keep others 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.260
 essentially consumed to a minimum 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.930
 we try to make the engine have the highest 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.230
 possible torque a low number of 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.230
 revolutions 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.800
 today the engines are giving their maximum 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.410
 powers around 1500 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.379
 constructions and they give a very good 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.800
 very usable power around 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.440
 1,100 1,200 1,300 revolutions 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.330
 then how is this good manifested 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.910
 that is what we call the whole 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.560
 the first motor torque is this 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.900
 effort that can spin the 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.240
 crankshaft the power that the 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.130
 crankshaft to spin the gears 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.260
 input of the gearbox for 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.900
 rotate the cardan so that the gimbal 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.150
 to chastity of the shield and the hitler panel 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.880
 well then if we have 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.310
 high torque engines in low 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.700
 revolutions we can take advantage of this 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.560
 maximum power in the maximum curve 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.120
 low speed torque where the motor 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.120
 consume less possible 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.920
 today if you look at many of the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.020
 modern advertisements are no longer 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.930
 talking about powerful says the engine of 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.360
 1500 motor of 2,000 kilometers of torque 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.300
 that's almost the most important thing in a 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.410
 truck the torque and not so much the power 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.410
 at high speed
