00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 and we have approached the alcatel stand 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.309
 and we are going to present a new 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.040
 wonder that responds to the name of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.929
 alcatel and del 3 in this case we have in 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.460
 our hands the version of 5.5 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.160
 inches but it's also going to 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.570
 market one of 4.7 at the level of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.580
 design as you can see we have a 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.439
 pretty uniform or pretty device 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.570
 similar in the bottom as 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.880
 at the top however in this 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.560
 occasion we have a peculiarity very 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.689
 interesting and that is that we take the phone 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.279
 the way in which we catch the menu 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.290
 will always be presented to us in a way 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.050
 vertical has a sensor that rotates 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.000
 automatically the entire menu and we were 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.340
 presents in the right way to be able to 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.719
 use it at the button level we have 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.180
 navigation menu buttons 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.370
 inside the screen the button 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.710
 unlocking this time we have it in 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.579
 the top forgiveness and the part 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.430
 top left of the screen 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.879
 while the volume buttons 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.399
 we will have on the right side of 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:02.250
 terminal as for the back 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.140
 we have a cover with a material 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.000
 quite nice to the touch and that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.890
 it gives a lot of quality 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.560
 at the level of benefits we are going to talk 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.260
 of a device with a screen of 55 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.940
 inches with full hd resolution at level 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.700
 of performance we have a good 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.520
 processor 1 is with 615 snapdragon 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.280
 64 bits and also an internal memory in 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.440
 this case in the 5.5-inch one 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.360
 great forgiveness memory of 3 gigabytes in 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.340
 this case we have the demo version that is 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.590
 of 2 gigabytes but the final version is 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.640
 will market with 3 gb of ram 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.890
 so that we will have a 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.960
 device quite fluid and capable of 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.610
 execute multitasking as you see we have 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.070
 endless open applications and the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.960
 terminal works quite fluently to 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.820
 camera level we have a very camera 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.970
 interesting with a 13 sensor 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.470
 megapixel camera on the back that 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.570
 presents novelties at the level of 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.180
 Face detection faces 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.619
 they quickly detect in less than one 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.030
 second we are talking about 0.20 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.970
 seconds if you see 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.100
 let's try to focus ipam we have 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.619
 a pretty quick face detection to 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.259
 level of focus when we try 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.550
 focus some element of the screen the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.950
 truth is that we have also given ourselves 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.720
 mind that it's pretty fast by the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.750
 front we have a 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.850
 of 8 megapixels at memory level 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.450
 internal we would be talking about a 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.350
 device with 16 and 32 gigabytes 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.420
 in the final version of the terminal and in 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.450
 the battery would be before a terminal 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.120
 with 3000 milliamps last android 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.840
 obviously 5.0 and all for a 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.270
 price of 300 euros so we have 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.120
 a terminal pretty good in terms of 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.470
 the price-quality ratio said this is not 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.300
 forget to follow us in our 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.070
 channel to follow all the news of 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.300
 this mobile world congress 2015 we 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.300
 we see in the next video
