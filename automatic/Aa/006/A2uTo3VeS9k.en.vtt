00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:15.733
A better Hilux Vigo yet is here

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.600
The still new 3GS injection (by Nippon Denso)

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:48.633
With hardness like never before by "Diamond-liked Carbon Coating"
Better oil spraying and accuracy, up to 9 times of shootout, 160-200 MPa pressure, also reduces engine's residual problems

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.700
It's actually what was once fitted in PreRunner D4D 2.5 
120HP, now standard to all D4D powered models

00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:55.167
A more clever finished ECU 32 bit with "Fuel Injection learning system" 
for more fuel saving possibility (and that depends on driving style)

00:00:56.833 --> 00:01:00.067
Variable Nozzle Turbo (VNT)

00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.034
Everything else is just the same

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:07.467
But with possibility for longer lifecycle of engine

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.600
All Intercooler / VNT models recieved a newer balanced larger intercooler scoop

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:27.467
Newer interior decoration, as well as some new stuffs

00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:39.234
TOP platform remained same, but suspension set has retooled

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.633
For better of roadholding and driving feel, of course

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:50.433
Changed many things the way of champ

00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:54.600
But also meant to defend its bestseller (of the segment) title

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:08.583
"Built" by only of everything that makes it remain "No.1"

00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:13.334
That's why it's appropriately called "Hilux Vigo Champ"
