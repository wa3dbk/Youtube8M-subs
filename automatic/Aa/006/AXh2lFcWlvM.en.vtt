with<00:01:17.610> us<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:19.890> know<00:01:19.920> I'm<00:01:20.340> not<00:01:20.430> sure<00:01:20.640> what

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
with us so I you know I'm not sure what

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.880 
with us so I you know I'm not sure what
to<00:01:21.299> do<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.900> out<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.409> money's<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
to do it's out like the money's a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.620 
to do it's out like the money's a
problem<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.850> more<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
problem but it's more of the the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.679 
problem but it's more of the the
principle<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:26.280> because<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:27.270> mom<00:01:27.479> always

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
principle of it because my mom always

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.170 
principle of it because my mom always
told<00:01:27.990> me<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.409> she<00:01:29.280> would<00:01:29.400> never<00:01:29.640> rent<00:01:29.970> out

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
told me that she would never rent out

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.030

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
because she owned this house and

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.530 
because she owned this house and
thankfully<00:01:35.040> she<00:01:35.310> gave<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.670> me<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:35.880> now<00:01:36.270> I'm

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
