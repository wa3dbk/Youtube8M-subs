plug the interface here into each one of
the<00:01:00.049> radios<00:01:00.409> right<00:01:00.830> where<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.159> speaker<00:01:01.489> mic

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
the radios right where the speaker mic

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.049 
the radios right where the speaker mic
would<00:01:01.850> connect<00:01:02.180> on<00:01:02.299> the<00:01:02.390> side<00:01:02.629> alright<00:01:03.170> and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
would connect on the side alright and

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.399 
would connect on the side alright and
that's<00:01:05.059> that's<00:01:05.420> all<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.780> installation<00:01:06.320> you

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
and everybody that's around camp would

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.370 
and everybody that's around camp would
set<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> radios<00:02:26.510> accordingly<00:02:26.930> with<00:02:27.350> the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
set the radios accordingly with the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.990 
set the radios accordingly with the
frequency<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.310> would<00:02:28.490> give<00:02:28.640> them<00:02:28.670> and

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
frequency that you would give them and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.200 
frequency that you would give them and
everybody<00:02:29.150> coordinate<00:02:29.720> there<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:32.060> can

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
everybody coordinate there and you can

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.830 
everybody coordinate there and you can
extend<00:02:32.540> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
extend the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.089 
extend the
the<00:02:32.900> range<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.440> your<00:02:33.849> repeater<00:02:34.849> site<00:02:35.300> greatly

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
the range of your repeater site greatly

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.500 
the range of your repeater site greatly
adding<00:02:37.099> outdoor<00:02:37.550> antennas<00:02:38.030> would<00:02:38.180> make<00:02:38.330> this

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
adding outdoor antennas would make this

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.009 
adding outdoor antennas would make this
further<00:02:38.870> in<00:02:39.769> distance<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:40.879> maybe<00:02:41.780> with<00:02:41.959> a

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
further in distance so maybe with a

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.140 
further in distance so maybe with a
couple<00:02:42.080> outdoor<00:02:42.950> omnidirectional<00:02:43.430> antennas

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
couple outdoor omnidirectional antennas

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.660 
couple outdoor omnidirectional antennas
or<00:02:44.319> yaki<00:02:45.319> antennas<00:02:45.980> you'd<00:02:46.190> be<00:02:46.280> able<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.519> couple

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
or yaki antennas you'd be able to couple

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.920 
or yaki antennas you'd be able to couple
a<00:02:46.849> couple<00:02:47.150> couple<00:02:47.660> miles<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.140> way<00:02:48.319> so<00:02:49.720> kj4

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
a couple couple miles this way so kj4

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.039 
a couple couple miles this way so kj4
why<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.620> eye<00:02:51.650> test<00:02:52.420> all<00:02:53.420> right<00:02:53.569> you<00:02:53.900> can

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
why is the eye test all right you can

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.309 
why is the eye test all right you can
also<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.980> also<00:02:55.129> passes<00:02:55.580> DTMF<00:02:56.450> codes<00:02:56.780> like<00:02:57.680> this

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
also it also passes DTMF codes like this

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.990 
also it also passes DTMF codes like this
all<00:03:00.319> right

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
all right

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.960
