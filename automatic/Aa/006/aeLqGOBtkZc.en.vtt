annoying<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.560> me<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.710> don't<00:01:49.950> want<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
annoying to me I don't want to have to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.149 
annoying to me I don't want to have to
pull<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.579> off<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> Dale<00:01:51.119> every<00:01:51.360> time<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:52.130> go<00:01:53.130> to

pull it off the Dale every time I go to
use<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.030> more<00:01:54.210> or<00:01:54.240> less<00:01:54.360> just<00:01:54.509> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
use it so this is more or less just a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.630 
use it so this is more or less just a
holder<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.200> me<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.189> keep<00:01:56.310> them<00:01:56.490> all

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
holder for me and to keep them all

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.950 
holder for me and to keep them all
together<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:57.240> where<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.570> visibly<00:01:57.869> see

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
together to where you can visibly see

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.010 
together to where you can visibly see
them<00:01:58.320> because<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:59.040> me<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.430> it's<00:02:00.030> out<00:02:00.270> I'll<00:02:00.570> use

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
them because for me if it's out I'll use

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.109 
them because for me if it's out I'll use
it<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.409> that's<00:02:01.590> worked<00:02:02.040> best<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.430> me<00:02:02.640> not<00:02:02.939> on

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
it and that's worked best for me not on

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.450 
it and that's worked best for me not on
planning<00:02:03.719> on<00:02:03.810> doing<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.259> tour<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.590> my<00:02:05.040> craft

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
planning on doing a tour of my craft

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.039 
planning on doing a tour of my craft
room<00:02:05.579> once<00:02:05.909> i<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.210> get<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.450> clean<00:02:06.719> enough<00:02:06.869> to

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
room once i can get it clean enough to

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.130 
room once i can get it clean enough to
be<00:02:07.950> presentable<00:02:08.539> which<00:02:09.539> could<00:02:09.780> take<00:02:09.929> forever

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
be presentable which could take forever

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.890 
be presentable which could take forever
but<00:02:11.090> that's<00:02:12.090> what<00:02:12.209> works<00:02:12.450> best<00:02:12.660> for<00:02:12.870> me

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
but that's what works best for me

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.580 
but that's what works best for me
everything

my<00:05:04.319> only<00:05:04.469> sister<00:05:04.650> in<00:05:05.069> law<00:05:05.189> but<00:05:05.669> that's<00:05:06.539> okay<00:05:06.840> I

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
my only sister in law but that's okay I
