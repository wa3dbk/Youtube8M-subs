hi I'm Gary Yamamoto and some of the

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.089 
hi I'm Gary Yamamoto and some of the
things<00:00:10.389> that<00:00:10.540> I<00:00:10.690> criticize<00:00:11.440> about<00:00:11.679> some<00:00:11.980> of

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.099 
things that I criticize about some of

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.209 
things that I criticize about some of
our<00:00:12.389> competitive<00:00:13.389> fishermen<00:00:13.809> is<00:00:13.990> that

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
our competitive fishermen is that

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.590 
our competitive fishermen is that
they're<00:00:15.219> too<00:00:15.429> anxious<00:00:15.639> about<00:00:15.999> setting<00:00:16.510> the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
they're too anxious about setting the

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.550 
they're too anxious about setting the
hook<00:00:17.130> my<00:00:18.130> theory<00:00:18.730> in<00:00:18.940> my<00:00:19.240> plastic<00:00:20.080> and<00:00:20.320> the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
hook my theory in my plastic and the

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.710 
hook my theory in my plastic and the
salt<00:00:20.830> that<00:00:21.070> we<00:00:21.220> add<00:00:21.400> whether<00:00:22.060> it's<00:00:22.330> the<00:00:22.450> same

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
salt that we add whether it's the same

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.620 
salt that we add whether it's the same
pool<00:00:22.960> the<00:00:23.170> cocktail<00:00:23.650> or<00:00:24.040> the<00:00:24.790> hula<00:00:25.060> grubs<00:00:25.360> or

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
pool the cocktail or the hula grubs or

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.900 
pool the cocktail or the hula grubs or
whatever<00:00:25.960> they<00:00:26.230> did<00:00:26.500> is<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:27.490> reason<00:00:27.520> for

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
whatever they did is the reason for

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.170 
whatever they did is the reason for
their<00:00:28.360> design<00:00:28.810> is<00:00:29.110> to<00:00:29.350> make<00:00:29.380> it<00:00:29.790> soft<00:00:30.790> and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
their design is to make it soft and

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.279 
their design is to make it soft and
pliable<00:00:31.870> and<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.270> salt<00:00:34.570> you<00:00:34.719> get<00:00:35.020> a

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:35.289 
pliable and with the salt you get a

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.980 
pliable and with the salt you get a
little<00:00:35.710> bit<00:00:35.890> of<00:00:36.040> case<00:00:36.280> so<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:37.390> confidence

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
little bit of case so the confidence

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.100 
little bit of case so the confidence
factor<00:00:38.200> the<00:00:39.190> fishermen<00:00:39.610> using<00:00:40.000> it<00:00:40.150> saying

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
factor the fishermen using it saying

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.890 
factor the fishermen using it saying
that<00:00:41.260> hey<00:00:41.650> this<00:00:42.040> is<00:00:42.220> a<00:00:42.250> bait<00:00:43.150> that<00:00:43.180> officials

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
that hey this is a bait that officials

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.229 
that hey this is a bait that officials
hang<00:00:44.140> on<00:00:44.410> to<00:00:44.739> and<00:00:45.040> he<00:00:45.550> won't<00:00:45.700> let<00:00:45.880> it<00:00:45.940> go

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
hang on to and he won't let it go

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.290 
hang on to and he won't let it go
there's<00:00:46.989> no<00:00:47.230> reason<00:00:47.829> you're<00:00:48.010> a<00:00:48.489> fisherman<00:00:49.030> who

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
there's no reason you're a fisherman who

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.210 
there's no reason you're a fisherman who
said<00:00:49.780> that<00:00:49.960> book<00:00:50.170> as<00:00:50.350> soon<00:00:50.560> as<00:00:50.649> he<00:00:50.770> feels<00:00:51.040> a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
said that book as soon as he feels a

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.370 
said that book as soon as he feels a
fish<00:00:51.430> and<00:00:52.180> what<00:00:52.360> I<00:00:52.390> try<00:00:52.720> to<00:00:52.750> teach<00:00:53.079> other

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
fish and what I try to teach other

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.310 
fish and what I try to teach other
fishermen<00:00:53.920> that<00:00:54.489> fish<00:00:54.730> with<00:00:54.970> me<00:00:55.149> is<00:00:55.300> that<00:00:55.480> they

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
fishermen that fish with me is that they

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.580 
fishermen that fish with me is that they
get<00:00:56.530> by<00:00:56.739> just<00:00:57.010> feeling<00:00:57.550> Wayne<00:00:58.059> he's<00:00:58.989> on<00:00:59.230> there

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
get by just feeling Wayne he's on there

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.829 
get by just feeling Wayne he's on there
and<00:00:59.980> just<00:01:00.850> basically<00:01:01.860> smooth<00:01:03.269> power<00:01:04.269> not<00:01:04.809> a

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
and just basically smooth power not a

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.420 
and just basically smooth power not a
power<00:01:05.259> set<00:01:05.560> but<00:01:05.799> you<00:01:05.829> see<00:01:06.130> smooth<00:01:06.820> swing<00:01:07.329> set

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
power set but you see smooth swing set

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.060 
power set but you see smooth swing set
and<00:01:08.550> that's<00:01:09.240> plenty<00:01:09.630> enough<00:01:09.840> with<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
and that's plenty enough with the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.220 
and that's plenty enough with the
quality<00:01:11.730> of<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.940> rod<00:01:12.120> the<00:01:12.150> lines<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.110> we

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
quality of the rod the lines that we

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.700 
quality of the rod the lines that we
have<00:01:13.440> thing<00:01:13.800> and<00:01:14.790> one<00:01:15.060> other<00:01:15.240> tidbit<00:01:15.840> I've

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
have thing and one other tidbit I've

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.120 
have thing and one other tidbit I've
gone<00:01:16.980> primarily<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:18.060> my<00:01:18.240> old<00:01:18.480> age<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:19.130> spinning

rods spinning tackle seems like I can

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.320 
rods spinning tackle seems like I can
cast<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.590> further<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.880> getting<00:01:24.150> my
