00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
minimal configuration needed to record

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.060 
minimal configuration needed to record
you<00:00:35.520> need<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.820> side<00:00:36.030> module<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:37.350> has<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> slot<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
you need to side module it has a slot to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.319 
you need to side module it has a slot to
slide<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.489> your<00:00:38.520> SSD<00:00:39.300> memory<00:00:39.780> cards<00:00:41.120> they<00:00:42.120> sit

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
slide in your SSD memory cards they sit

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.880 
slide in your SSD memory cards they sit
nicely<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.930> stick<00:00:43.200> out<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.860> see

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
nicely and stick out so you can see

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.010 
nicely and stick out so you can see
which<00:00:45.170> card<00:00:46.170> using<00:00:47.059> make<00:00:48.059> these<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:48.390> d<00:00:48.660> cards

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
which card using make these as d cards

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.880 
which card using make these as d cards
we've<00:00:49.890> got<00:00:50.129> two<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.120> them<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.629> 64<00:00:52.469> gigabytes

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
we've got two of them and 64 gigabytes

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.380 
we've got two of them and 64 gigabytes
so<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.309> use<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.730> while<00:00:53.940> we're<00:00:54.120> offloading

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
so we can use one while we're offloading

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.350 
so we can use one while we're offloading
data<00:00:54.750> from<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> other<00:00:55.550> it<00:00:56.550> fits<00:00:56.789> about<00:00:56.910> 20

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
data from the other it fits about 20

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360 
data from the other it fits about 20
minutes<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.719> data<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.710> don't<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
minutes of data so if you don't have a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.430 
minutes of data so if you don't have a
technician<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.120> set<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.570> will<00:01:00.930> probably<00:01:01.350> need

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
technician on set you will probably need

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.060 
technician on set you will probably need
more<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.800> these<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:03.559> also<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.710> don't<00:01:04.949> have

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
more of these and also if you don't have

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.520 
more of these and also if you don't have
a<00:01:05.159> powerful<00:01:05.369> workstation<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.990> takes<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.350> lot<00:01:07.500> of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
a powerful workstation it takes a lot of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.340 
a powerful workstation it takes a lot of
time<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.250> upload<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.030> media<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.140> will

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
time to upload the media so you will

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.390 
time to upload the media so you will
need<00:01:10.530> more<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.890> these<00:01:10.979> as<00:01:11.159> well<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:14.130> upload

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
need more of these as well to upload
