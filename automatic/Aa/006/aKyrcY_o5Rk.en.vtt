00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
transformers but I don't think it will

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.950 
transformers but I don't think it will
be<00:05:29.010> transformers<00:05:29.700> because<00:05:29.910> transformers<00:05:30.870> is

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
be transformers because transformers is

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.060 
be transformers because transformers is
still<00:05:31.140> kind<00:05:31.290> of<00:05:31.320> going<00:05:31.560> on<00:05:31.650> its<00:05:31.800> own<00:05:31.890> the

watch this with children maybe 7 them I
really<00:06:09.360> think<00:06:09.510> this<00:06:09.600> is<00:06:09.660> a<00:06:09.780> perfect<00:06:09.990> for

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
really think this is a perfect for

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.370 
really think this is a perfect for
children<00:06:10.290> 7<00:06:10.740> up<00:06:11.390> this<00:06:12.390> is<00:06:12.690> in<00:06:12.900> my<00:06:13.020> opinion<00:06:13.290> with

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
children 7 up this is in my opinion with

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.000 
children 7 up this is in my opinion with
why<00:06:13.590> 7<00:06:14.070> should<00:06:14.280> be<00:06:14.430> barring<00:06:14.880> the<00:06:14.970> language

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
why 7 should be barring the language

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.620 
why 7 should be barring the language
there<00:06:17.010> is<00:06:17.040> language<00:06:17.340> think<00:06:17.970> I<00:06:18.030> say<00:06:18.150> damn<00:06:18.360> and

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
there is language think I say damn and

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.900 
there is language think I say damn and
held<00:06:19.110> and<00:06:19.350> stuff<00:06:19.530> like<00:06:19.680> that<00:06:19.830> but<00:06:20.460> but<00:06:20.670> barring

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
held and stuff like that but but barring

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.020 
held and stuff like that but but barring
that<00:06:21.060> I<00:06:21.210> really<00:06:21.990> think<00:06:22.200> that<00:06:22.350> this<00:06:22.560> is<00:06:23.030> exactly

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030
