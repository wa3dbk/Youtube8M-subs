together it was kind of a really low
quality<00:00:26.180> production<00:00:26.810> but<00:00:26.990> I<00:00:27.020> was<00:00:27.260> willing<00:00:27.439> to

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
quality production but I was willing to

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.320 
quality production but I was willing to
suck<00:00:27.740> that<00:00:27.920> up<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.609> gameplay<00:00:28.939> was<00:00:29.029> actually

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330

pretty<00:00:29.510> fun<00:00:29.810> but<00:00:30.109> there<00:00:30.529> seems<00:00:30.740> there<00:00:30.830> was<00:00:30.920> a

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
pretty fun but there seems there was a

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.290 
pretty fun but there seems there was a
few<00:00:31.100> problems<00:00:31.490> I<00:00:31.550> didn't<00:00:31.760> like<00:00:31.880> about<00:00:32.029> the

you'll have some problems now I there is
certainly<00:04:41.990> some<00:04:42.200> strategy<00:04:42.620> to<00:04:42.740> not<00:04:42.770> always

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
certainly some strategy to not always

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.710 
certainly some strategy to not always
play<00:04:43.400> them<00:04:43.610> if<00:04:43.760> you<00:04:43.910> know<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.150> person<00:04:44.480> after

play them if you know the person after

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.880 
play them if you know the person after
you<00:04:44.810> can<00:04:44.930> handle<00:04:45.260> it<00:04:45.380> but<00:04:45.500> if<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.710> murder

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
you can handle it but if the murder

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.190 
you can handle it but if the murder
attempt<00:04:46.190> is<00:04:46.310> seven<00:04:46.700> and<00:04:46.820> you<00:04:47.540> refuse<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:48.020> play

that's definitely gone I mean this stuff
is<00:05:29.240> great<00:05:30.340> now<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:32.030> theme<00:05:32.300> itself<00:05:32.720> for

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
is great now the theme itself for

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.190 
is great now the theme itself for
families<00:05:33.500> I<00:05:34.370> don't<00:05:35.240> know<00:05:35.360> I<00:05:35.390> mean<00:05:35.690> clue<00:05:35.960> you're

here you're trying to trying to murder
doctor<00:05:40.700> lucky<00:05:41.030> in<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:41.360> I<00:05:41.660> realized<00:05:42.110> that

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
doctor lucky in and I realized that

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.510 
doctor lucky in and I realized that
perhaps<00:05:42.440> that<00:05:42.800> won't<00:05:42.980> go<00:05:43.100> over<00:05:43.130> well<00:05:43.490> with

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
perhaps that won't go over well with

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.220 
perhaps that won't go over well with
families<00:05:44.000> even<00:05:44.180> though<00:05:44.360> this<00:05:44.510> seems<00:05:44.990> that

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
families even though this seems that

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.960 
families even though this seems that
being<00:05:45.380> kind<00:05:45.560> of<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:45.740> family<00:05:46.040> game<00:05:46.190> it<00:05:46.370> it<00:05:46.730> can<00:05:46.880> go

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
being kind of a family game it it can go

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.070 
being kind of a family game it it can go
up<00:05:47.030> to<00:05:47.120> seven<00:05:47.390> players<00:05:47.600> and<00:05:47.810> it's<00:05:47.900> a<00:05:47.930> lot<00:05:48.050> of

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
up to seven players and it's a lot of

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.360 
up to seven players and it's a lot of
fun<00:05:48.350> but<00:05:48.530> you're<00:05:48.680> good<00:05:48.770> to<00:05:48.860> say<00:05:49.010> you're<00:05:49.160> trying

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
fun but you're good to say you're trying

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.110 
fun but you're good to say you're trying
to<00:05:50.320> capture<00:05:51.320> doctor<00:05:51.770> lucky<00:05:51.950> or<00:05:52.250> whatever<00:05:52.910> you

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
to capture doctor lucky or whatever you

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.180 
to capture doctor lucky or whatever you
know<00:05:53.210> if<00:05:53.390> that's<00:05:53.840> a<00:05:53.990> problem<00:05:54.140> although<00:05:54.530> it

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
know if that's a problem although it

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.380 
know if that's a problem although it
might<00:05:55.370> be<00:05:55.520> hard<00:05:55.730> to<00:05:55.760> explain<00:05:56.120> how<00:05:56.270> you're

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
might be hard to explain how you're

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.480 
might be hard to explain how you're
capturing<00:05:56.900> him<00:05:57.050> with<00:05:57.200> a<00:05:57.230> letter<00:05:57.470> opener<00:05:57.710> but<00:05:58.250> I

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
capturing him with a letter opener but I

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.310 
capturing him with a letter opener but I
don't<00:05:59.300> know<00:05:59.390> I<00:05:59.420> mean<00:05:59.720> I<00:05:59.780> think<00:05:59.900> it's<00:06:00.140> very

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
don't know I mean I think it's very

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.710 
don't know I mean I think it's very
light<00:06:00.680> there's<00:06:01.190> no<00:06:01.340> blood<00:06:01.820> guessing<00:06:02.330> door<00:06:02.600> and

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
light there's no blood guessing door and

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.850 
light there's no blood guessing door and
stuff<00:06:02.930> so<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:03.080> think<00:06:03.170> families<00:06:03.590> will<00:06:03.710> still

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
stuff so I think families will still

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.560 
stuff so I think families will still
have<00:06:03.950> no<00:06:04.040> problem<00:06:04.490> with<00:06:04.580> it<00:06:04.640> now<00:06:05.210> there<00:06:05.390> is<00:06:05.480> an

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
have no problem with it now there is an

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.480 
have no problem with it now there is an
expansion<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:06.320> very<00:06:06.590> small<00:06:06.920> expansion<00:06:07.370> that's

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
expansion a very small expansion that's

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.340 
expansion a very small expansion that's
killed<00:06:08.000> doctor<00:06:08.270> lucky<00:06:08.510> and<00:06:08.690> his<00:06:08.810> little<00:06:09.020> dog
