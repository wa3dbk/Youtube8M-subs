00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
hi i'm kenny from mini bowl design while

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.820 
hi i'm kenny from mini bowl design while
doing<00:01:30.550> a<00:01:30.700> little<00:01:30.990> snow<00:01:31.990> shoeing<00:01:32.290> today<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
doing a little snow shoeing today and

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.469 
doing a little snow shoeing today and
you<00:01:35.830> know<00:01:36.009> quite<00:01:36.250> a<00:01:36.310> while<00:01:36.520> i<00:01:36.550> decided<00:01:37.150> to<00:01:37.210> stop

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
you know quite a while i decided to stop

you know quite a while i decided to stop
and<00:01:37.740> mix<00:01:38.740> up<00:01:38.950> some<00:01:39.130> hot<00:01:39.369> chocolate<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:40.030> warm

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
and mix up some hot chocolate and warm

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.620 
and mix up some hot chocolate and warm
myself<00:01:40.420> up<00:01:40.840> melt<00:01:41.409> down<00:01:41.590> some<00:01:41.619> snow<00:01:42.009> yeah<00:01:42.630> it's

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
myself up melt down some snow yeah it's

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.969 
myself up melt down some snow yeah it's
uh<00:01:43.899> it's<00:01:44.290> about<00:01:45.220> 10<00:01:45.640> degrees<00:01:45.759> right<00:01:46.180> now<00:01:46.979> let's

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
uh it's about 10 degrees right now let's

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.200 
uh it's about 10 degrees right now let's
see<00:01:48.190> pretty<00:01:49.030> cool<00:01:49.320> now<00:01:50.320> today<00:01:51.130> while<00:01:51.820> less<00:01:52.000> is

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
see pretty cool now today while less is

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.359 
see pretty cool now today while less is
warming<00:01:52.570> up<00:01:52.690> you<00:01:53.560> talk<00:01:53.800> a<00:01:53.830> little<00:01:54.039> bit<00:01:54.190> about

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
warming up you talk a little bit about

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.700 
warming up you talk a little bit about
different<00:01:54.789> stoves<00:01:55.060> we're<00:01:56.050> here<00:01:56.350> right<00:01:56.500> now

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
different stoves we're here right now

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.590 
different stoves we're here right now
with<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.979> butane<00:01:57.369> stove<00:01:57.640> butane<00:01:58.270> isobutane

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
with the butane stove butane isobutane

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.460 
with the butane stove butane isobutane
stove<00:01:59.590> and<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:01.450> could<00:02:01.660> get<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:01.929> lit<00:02:02.140> what<00:02:02.350> you

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
stove and you could get it lit what you

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.210 
stove and you could get it lit what you
probably<00:02:02.770> could<00:02:04.830> what<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:05.920> will<00:02:06.009> do<00:02:06.190> is

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
probably could what it will do is

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.660 
probably could what it will do is
because<00:02:07.000> it's<00:02:07.179> so<00:02:07.360> cold<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.920> propane<00:02:09.459> in<00:02:09.640> the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
because it's so cold the propane in the

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.660 
because it's so cold the propane in the
mix<00:02:09.940> will<00:02:10.179> burn<00:02:10.360> off<00:02:10.650> first<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.980> leaving<00:02:12.580> the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
mix will burn off first and leaving the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.120 
mix will burn off first and leaving the
butane<00:02:13.030> behind<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.720> once<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.440> propane<00:02:14.860> burns

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
butane behind and once the propane burns

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.840 
butane behind and once the propane burns
off<00:02:15.400> then<00:02:16.209> all<00:02:16.390> you've<00:02:16.570> got<00:02:16.720> left<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:17.110> butane

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
off then all you've got left is butane

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.670 
off then all you've got left is butane
and<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:19.420> doesn't<00:02:19.780> burn<00:02:19.870> very<00:02:20.110> well<00:02:20.350> at<00:02:20.470> all<00:02:20.590> in

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
and it doesn't burn very well at all in

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.840 
and it doesn't burn very well at all in
this<00:02:20.800> kind<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.040> cold<00:02:21.250> sea<00:02:21.459> stove<00:02:21.730> will

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
this kind of cold sea stove will

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.780 
this kind of cold sea stove will
probably<00:02:22.209> go<00:02:22.300> out<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.190> make<00:02:24.340> things<00:02:24.370> even

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
probably go out and to make things even

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.390 
probably go out and to make things even
worse<00:02:25.200> because<00:02:26.200> you're<00:02:26.590> pulling<00:02:26.980> pressure

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
worse because you're pulling pressure

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.860 
worse because you're pulling pressure
out<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:27.910> tank<00:02:28.120> all<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.510> time<00:02:28.720> the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
out of that tank all the time the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.280 
out of that tank all the time the
pressurized<00:02:29.380> canister<00:02:29.709> as<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.989> fuel

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
pressurized canister as the fuel

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.020 
pressurized canister as the fuel
evaporates<00:02:32.860> out<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.190> cannister<00:02:33.549> it<00:02:33.790> tends

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
evaporates out of the cannister it tends

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.520 
evaporates out of the cannister it tends
to<00:02:34.120> cool<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.480> canister<00:02:34.930> even<00:02:35.170> in<00:02:35.290> warm

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
to cool the canister even in warm

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.900 
to cool the canister even in warm
weather<00:02:35.709> so<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.190> makes<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.489> cool<00:02:36.670> even

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
weather so that makes it cool even

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.030 
weather so that makes it cool even
faster<00:02:37.510> plus<00:02:38.079> the<00:02:38.200> fact<00:02:38.380> you've<00:02:38.590> probably<00:02:38.799> got

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
faster plus the fact you've probably got

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.830 
faster plus the fact you've probably got
a<00:02:39.070> setting<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:39.489> snow<00:02:39.850> so<00:02:40.180> between<00:02:40.390> those<00:02:40.630> three

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
a setting on snow so between those three

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.080 
a setting on snow so between those three
things<00:02:41.370> you're<00:02:42.370> not<00:02:42.489> going<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.700> boil<00:02:42.880> much

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
things you're not going to boil much

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.330 
things you're not going to boil much
cocoa<00:02:43.450> with<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.810> now<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.890> other<00:02:45.070> way<00:02:45.280> to

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
cocoa with that now the other way to

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.979 
cocoa with that now the other way to
goes<00:02:45.549> with<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.820> gas<00:02:46.060> stove<00:02:46.420> something<00:02:46.870> that

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
goes with a gas stove something that

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.270 
goes with a gas stove something that
uses<00:02:47.170> Coleman's<00:02:47.829> fuel<00:02:48.130> or<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.700> white<00:02:49.360> gas<00:02:50.280> now

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
uses Coleman's fuel or a white gas now

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.560 
uses Coleman's fuel or a white gas now
those<00:02:51.459> are<00:02:51.489> fine<00:02:51.880> if<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.180> can<00:02:52.329> get<00:02:52.480> them

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
those are fine if you can get them

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.300 
those are fine if you can get them
started<00:02:52.840> but<00:02:53.200> cold<00:02:53.530> weather<00:02:53.799> like<00:02:54.040> this

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
started but cold weather like this

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.400 
started but cold weather like this
usually<00:02:55.150> have<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.570> buy<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.690> tube<00:02:56.019> of<00:02:56.200> fire

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
usually have to buy a tube of fire

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.199 
usually have to buy a tube of fire
ribbon<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.070> put<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.340> on<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.549> pre<00:02:57.730> heated<00:02:58.060> by

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
ribbon and put it on the pre heated by

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.030 
ribbon and put it on the pre heated by
Iran<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.570> then<00:02:58.690> like<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.440> let<00:02:59.829> that

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
Iran and then like that and let that

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.039 
Iran and then like that and let that
warm<00:03:00.250> up<00:03:00.519> so<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.239> when<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.450> fuel<00:03:01.660> goes<00:03:01.840> under

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
warm up so that when the fuel goes under

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.479 
warm up so that when the fuel goes under
the<00:03:02.079> stove<00:03:02.350> it's<00:03:02.560> warm<00:03:02.769> enough<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.040> atomize

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
the stove it's warm enough to atomize

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.550 
the stove it's warm enough to atomize
and<00:03:03.820> turn<00:03:04.780> into<00:03:04.989> gas<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.560> burn<00:03:06.540> now<00:03:07.560> that's

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
and turn into gas and burn now that's

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.099 
and turn into gas and burn now that's
all<00:03:08.769> fine<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.010> dandy<00:03:09.220> but<00:03:09.790> it's<00:03:10.570> kind<00:03:11.049> of

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
all fine and dandy but it's kind of

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.020 
all fine and dandy but it's kind of
tough<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.350> do<00:03:11.590> specifically<00:03:12.130> windy<00:03:12.640> or<00:03:12.760> cold

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
tough to do specifically windy or cold

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.460 
tough to do specifically windy or cold
so<00:03:14.250> that's<00:03:15.250> not<00:03:15.430> really<00:03:15.609> the<00:03:15.850> answer<00:03:16.030> either

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
so that's not really the answer either

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.699 
so that's not really the answer either
now<00:03:17.470> this<00:03:17.650> stove<00:03:17.950> here<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.870> souped-up<00:03:19.870> ISIL

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.190 
now this stove here is a souped-up ISIL

didn't<00:03:23.500> design<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:24.010> be<00:03:24.130> good<00:03:24.280> in<00:03:24.400> cold

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
didn't design it to be good in cold

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.640 
didn't design it to be good in cold
weather<00:03:24.850> but<00:03:25.209> that's<00:03:25.480> pure<00:03:25.750> byproduct<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.560> the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
weather but that's pure byproduct of the

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.949 
weather but that's pure byproduct of the
whole<00:03:26.799> design<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.459> because<00:03:28.419> it<00:03:28.540> runs<00:03:28.750> on<00:03:28.900> a

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
whole design is because it runs on a

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.290 
whole design is because it runs on a
wick<00:03:29.260> it'll<00:03:30.220> burn<00:03:30.400> anywhere

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
wick it'll burn anywhere

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.440 
wick it'll burn anywhere
a<00:03:31.360> candle<00:03:32.110> will<00:03:32.260> burn<00:03:32.460> so<00:03:33.460> this<00:03:33.940> burn<00:03:34.180> just

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
a candle will burn so this burn just

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.670 
a candle will burn so this burn just
fine<00:03:34.750> because<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.110> only<00:03:35.230> you've<00:03:35.440> got<00:03:35.590> to

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
fine because the only you've got to

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.680 
fine because the only you've got to
preheat<00:03:36.010> is<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.190> wicked<00:03:36.460> self<00:03:36.880> no<00:03:37.180> problem<00:03:37.600> at

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
preheat is a wicked self no problem at

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.930 
preheat is a wicked self no problem at
all<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.500> rest<00:03:38.740> of<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:38.950> stove<00:03:39.130> stays<00:03:39.400> cold<00:03:39.670> all

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
all the rest of the stove stays cold all

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.690 
all the rest of the stove stays cold all
the<00:03:39.970> time<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.450> colder<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.810> better<00:03:41.700> so

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
the time and the colder the better so

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.670 
the time and the colder the better so
he'll<00:03:43.120> do<00:03:43.240> by<00:03:43.390> accident<00:03:43.930> I've<00:03:44.110> developed<00:03:44.410> a

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
he'll do by accident I've developed a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.220 
he'll do by accident I've developed a
stogie<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.310> that<00:03:45.630> actually<00:03:46.630> works<00:03:47.110> pretty

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
stogie of that actually works pretty

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.070 
stogie of that actually works pretty
good<00:03:47.470> in<00:03:47.830> cold<00:03:48.460> weather<00:03:48.670> in<00:03:48.910> fact<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.960> really

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
good in cold weather in fact it really

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.060 
good in cold weather in fact it really
doesn't<00:03:50.530> matter<00:03:50.790> how<00:03:51.790> cold<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.300> is<00:03:52.860> it'll<00:03:53.860> burn

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
doesn't matter how cold it is it'll burn

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:01.380 
doesn't matter how cold it is it'll burn
just<00:03:54.370> fine<00:03:55.560> as<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.830> can<00:03:56.980> see<00:03:59.880> melts<00:04:00.880> snow<00:04:01.000> just

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
just fine as you can see melts snow just

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.230 
just fine as you can see melts snow just
great

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.200
