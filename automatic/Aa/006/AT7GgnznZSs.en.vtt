worry about it too much just be patient

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.149 
worry about it too much just be patient
because<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.960> step<00:01:16.290> takes<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.009> lot<00:01:17.130> of

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
because this step takes a lot of

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.249 
because this step takes a lot of
patience<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.210> gonna<00:01:18.420> stay<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.110> this

preparing jailbreak data for some time

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.810

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
so you can see it's already moving so it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.249 
so you can see it's already moving so it
didn't<00:01:27.540> take<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.689> long

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
didn't take that long

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
injecting jailbreak data you see the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.429

corner<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:32.250> gonna<00:01:32.430> actually<00:01:32.640> reboot<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
corner it's gonna actually reboot the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.410 
corner it's gonna actually reboot the
device<00:01:33.540> now<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.549> this<00:01:35.549> will<00:01:35.729> take<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> while<00:01:36.090> as

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
device now and this will take a while as

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.170 
device now and this will take a while as
well<00:01:36.770> now<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> tool<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:39.030> were

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
well now if this was a tool that we were

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.359 
well now if this was a tool that we were
really<00:01:39.689> familiar<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.259> we<00:01:40.829> had<00:01:40.950> been<00:01:41.100> using

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
really familiar with we had been using

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.280 
really familiar with we had been using
like<00:01:41.610> red<00:01:41.880> snow<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.420> instance<00:01:42.810> then<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.079> would

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
like red snow for instance then I would

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.139 
like red snow for instance then I would
skip<00:01:43.560> past<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.100> lot<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.369> these<00:01:44.460> reboots<00:01:44.970> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
skip past a lot of these reboots and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.639 
skip past a lot of these reboots and
things<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.049> save<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.380> time

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
things like that just to save your time

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.380 
things like that just to save your time
but<00:01:46.890> since<00:01:47.009> we're<00:01:47.220> not<00:01:47.369> very<00:01:47.850> familiar<00:01:48.360> with

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
but since we're not very familiar with

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.539 
but since we're not very familiar with
this<00:01:48.689> tool<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.229> felt<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.799> was<00:01:49.890> probably<00:01:50.220> best<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
this tool I felt it was probably best to

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.429 
this tool I felt it was probably best to
show<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:50.909> much<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.420> process<00:01:51.659> as<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.140> could

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
show as much of the process as I could

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.830 
show as much of the process as I could
some<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.460> stuff<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.729> may<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.479> know<00:01:54.540> speed

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
some of this stuff I may you know speed

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.749 
some of this stuff I may you know speed
up<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.049> little<00:01:55.290> bit<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.310> most<00:01:56.490> part

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
up a little bit but for the most part

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.490 
up a little bit but for the most part
you're<00:01:56.909> gonna<00:01:57.030> see<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.420> jailbreak<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.290> its

it's<00:02:01.140> waiting<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.799> device<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.310> reboot

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
it's waiting for the device to reboot

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.780 
it's waiting for the device to reboot
this<00:02:03.990> shouldn't<00:02:04.259> take<00:02:04.350> too<00:02:04.469> much<00:02:04.860> longer<00:02:04.920> on

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
this shouldn't take too much longer on

pretty<00:03:44.220> much<00:03:44.310> it

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820

pretty much it
step<00:03:45.780> ten<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:46.980> now<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.220> evasion<00:03:47.700> tool<00:03:48.120> should

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
step ten so now the evasion tool should

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.509 
step ten so now the evasion tool should
show<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.810> done<00:03:49.109> message<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.859> then<00:03:50.070> your<00:03:50.250> device

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
show a done message and then your device

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.130 
show a done message and then your device
will<00:03:50.760> reboot<00:03:50.970> as<00:03:51.359> you<00:03:51.540> see<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.959> bottom

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
will reboot as you see in the bottom

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.650 
will reboot as you see in the bottom
right<00:03:52.470> hand<00:03:52.590> corner<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:53.420> it's<00:03:54.420> still

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
right hand corner and it's still

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.150 
right hand corner and it's still
rebooting<00:03:55.170> you<00:03:55.260> can<00:03:55.380> actually<00:03:55.680> close<00:03:55.920> out<00:03:56.130> of

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
rebooting you can actually close out of

rebooting you can actually close out of
the<00:03:56.340> evasion<00:03:56.640> tool<00:03:57.030> now<00:03:57.209> we're<00:03:57.420> completely

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
the evasion tool now we're completely

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.960 
the evasion tool now we're completely
done<00:03:58.109> with<00:03:58.140> it<00:03:58.470> then<00:03:59.220> we<00:03:59.310> just<00:03:59.459> need<00:03:59.579> a<00:03:59.730> wait

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
done with it then we just need a wait

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.930 
done with it then we just need a wait
for<00:04:00.000> our<00:04:00.359> device<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.959> finish<00:04:01.290> up<00:04:01.470> some<00:04:01.620> things
