Innova from the front is the big grill

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.740 
Innova from the front is the big grill
right<00:01:27.039> in<00:01:27.249> front<00:01:27.520> this<00:01:27.700> is<00:01:27.850> much<00:01:28.030> more<00:01:28.270> bolder

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
right in front this is much more bolder

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.450 
right in front this is much more bolder
in<00:01:29.020> terms<00:01:29.289> of<00:01:29.439> the<00:01:29.530> gaps<00:01:29.740> between<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.280> three

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
in terms of the gaps between the three

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.279 
in terms of the gaps between the three
horizontal<00:01:30.640> slats<00:01:31.240> being<00:01:31.539> much<00:01:31.719> bigger<00:01:31.990> and

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
horizontal slats being much bigger and

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.919 
horizontal slats being much bigger and
wider<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.520> overall<00:01:33.969> look<00:01:34.119> of<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.390> car<00:01:34.630> has

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
wider so the overall look of the car has

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.599 
wider so the overall look of the car has
changed<00:01:35.200> because<00:01:35.499> of<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.859> grill<00:01:36.039> itself<00:01:36.369> as

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
changed because of the grill itself as

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.279 
changed because of the grill itself as
you<00:01:36.969> move<00:01:37.240> towards<00:01:37.539> the<00:01:37.689> side<00:01:37.899> you<00:01:38.079> can<00:01:38.259> see

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
you move towards the side you can see

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.499 
you move towards the side you can see
some<00:01:38.439> chrome<00:01:38.890> touches<00:01:39.310> here<00:01:39.549> as<00:01:39.759> well<00:01:40.270> as<00:01:40.390> the

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
more sportier to look at but it's not

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.419 
more sportier to look at but it's not
