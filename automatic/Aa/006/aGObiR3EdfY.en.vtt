00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.490 
I'm adding three tablespoons of I'm
actually<00:03:37.069> using<00:03:37.549> little<00:03:38.209> chopped-up<00:03:38.870> dark

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
actually using little chopped-up dark

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.409 
actually using little chopped-up dark
chocolate<00:03:40.069> semi-sweet<00:03:40.340> chocolate<00:03:40.910> but<00:03:41.329> if

chocolate semi-sweet chocolate but if

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:42.909

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
you have chocolate chips you could use

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.710 
you have chocolate chips you could use

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.409 
that probably the mini chocolate chips
would<00:03:45.139> be<00:03:45.290> best<00:03:45.500> for<00:03:45.650> this<00:03:45.919> but<00:03:46.819> I<00:03:46.970> just<00:03:47.239> had

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
would be best for this but I just had

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.629
