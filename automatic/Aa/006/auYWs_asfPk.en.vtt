00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:08.750 

we<00:00:02.970> have<00:00:03.120> here<00:00:05.210> as<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.359> can<00:00:06.420> see<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.839> meter<00:00:07.760> be

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
we have here as you can see the meter be

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.810 
we have here as you can see the meter be
turning<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.360> direction<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:10.050> arrow<00:00:10.820> that

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
turning the direction of this arrow that

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.129 
turning the direction of this arrow that
way<00:00:12.469> but<00:00:13.469> it's<00:00:13.620> not<00:00:13.889> turning<00:00:14.519> backwards<00:00:15.139> and

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
way but it's not turning backwards and

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:27.920 
way but it's not turning backwards and
what<00:00:23.539> and<00:00:24.539> as<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.050> can<00:00:25.199> see<00:00:25.820> all<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.180> power<00:00:27.420> is

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
what and as you can see all the power is

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.500 
what and as you can see all the power is
coming<00:00:28.550> from<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:30.019> turbine<00:00:31.940> that's<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.210> ten

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
coming from that turbine that's the ten

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.270 
coming from that turbine that's the ten
kilowatt<00:00:34.280> turbine<00:00:35.280> from<00:00:36.000> Reed<00:00:36.360> ribbon<00:00:37.280> I've

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
kilowatt turbine from Reed ribbon I've

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.970 
kilowatt turbine from Reed ribbon I've
had<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:38.879> about<00:00:39.110> three<00:00:40.110> weeks<00:00:40.140> now<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:52.720 

basically<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.430> making<00:00:44.910> enough<00:00:45.149> power<00:00:47.300> to

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.950 

feed<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> house<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.300> turn<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> meter

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
feed the house and turn the meter

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.900 
feed the house and turn the meter
backwards<00:00:56.270> now<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.329> can't<00:00:58.020> hear<00:00:58.320> anything

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
backwards now you can't hear anything

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.560 
backwards now you can't hear anything
except<00:00:59.910> for<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.180> windows<00:01:00.600> becoming<00:01:02.480> in<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
except for the windows becoming in the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.039 
except for the windows becoming in the
wind<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.500> microphone<00:01:08.570> now<00:01:09.570> we're<00:01:09.869> pretty

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
wind in the microphone now we're pretty

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.740 
wind in the microphone now we're pretty
much<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:12.299> turbine<00:01:12.720> itself<00:01:14.540> now<00:01:15.540> that's

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
much on the turbine itself now that's

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.370 
much on the turbine itself now that's
the<00:01:15.900> tower<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:18.020> right<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the tower and right there is a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.670 
the tower and right there is a
hydraulics<00:01:20.189> where<00:01:21.049> it<00:01:22.049> lifts<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> tower

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
hydraulics where it lifts the tower

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.859 
hydraulics where it lifts the tower
straight<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.580> down<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:25.590> repair<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.130> or<00:01:26.869> to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
straight up and down to repair it or to

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.980 
straight up and down to repair it or to
maintain<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.439> once<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.220> year<00:01:30.200> over<00:01:31.200> here<00:01:32.990> we

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
maintain it once a year over here we

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.590 
maintain it once a year over here we
have<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> control<00:01:34.530> system<00:01:36.380> just<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.470> show<00:01:37.799> you

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
have the control system just to show you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.940 
have the control system just to show you
these<00:01:39.600> are<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> inverters<00:01:40.590> Aurora<00:01:42.770> right<00:01:43.770> now

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
these are the inverters Aurora right now

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.469 
these are the inverters Aurora right now
it's<00:01:44.159> saying<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.579> pushing<00:01:44.850> about<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
it's saying it's pushing about a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.480 
it's saying it's pushing about a
thousand<00:01:46.079> 1,100<00:01:46.950> watts

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
thousand 1,100 watts

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.990 
thousand 1,100 watts
each<00:01:47.729> one<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.329> them<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.290> that's<00:01:49.530> 12<00:01:49.979> times<00:01:50.399> 2<00:01:50.790> so

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
each one of them so that's 12 times 2 so

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.389 
each one of them so that's 12 times 2 so
it's<00:01:51.119> about<00:01:51.329> 24<00:01:51.899> watts<00:01:53.390> 2400<00:01:54.390> watts

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:10.350 

and<00:02:01.270> here<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.539> controller<00:02:03.030> by<00:02:04.030> Reed<00:02:04.329> Riven

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.199 

and<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:15.260> that's<00:02:15.439> it

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
and and that's it

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:23.850 
and and that's it
we'll<00:02:17.209> see<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.629> turbine<00:02:17.989> again<00:02:18.349> there<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.159> is

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.089 

turn<00:02:24.860> backwards<00:02:25.430> again<00:02:26.890> one<00:02:27.890> more<00:02:28.040> time

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
turn backwards again one more time

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:37.270 
turn backwards again one more time
before<00:02:28.519> we<00:02:28.760> go<00:02:34.989> here's<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.079> meter<00:02:36.409> turning

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
before we go here's the meter turning

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:48.399 
before we go here's the meter turning
backwards<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:47.090> is<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.299> real<00:02:47.510> thing<00:02:47.540> boys

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
backwards this is the real thing boys

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.829 
backwards this is the real thing boys
girls
