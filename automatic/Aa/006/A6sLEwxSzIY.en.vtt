00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
I know it sounds confusing but that's

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.990 
I know it sounds confusing but that's
what<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:05.690> did<00:02:05.900> throw<00:02:06.430> practically<00:02:07.430> most<00:02:07.759> of<00:02:07.910> the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
what I did throw practically most of the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.199 
what I did throw practically most of the
video<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:09.470> once<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:09.920> get<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.310> down<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.880> know

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
video so once you get that down you know

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.170 
video so once you get that down you know
this<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:12.050> emblem<00:02:12.410> would<00:02:12.560> be<00:02:12.740> pretty<00:02:13.130> easy<00:02:16.180> so

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
through all these top layers this is the

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.650 
through all these top layers this is the
hardest<00:05:06.310> part<00:05:06.669> but<00:05:07.120> i'm<00:05:07.240> going<00:05:07.330> to<00:05:07.390> be<00:05:07.480> trying

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
hardest part but i'm going to be trying

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.150 
hardest part but i'm going to be trying
to<00:05:07.750> figure<00:05:07.960> it<00:05:07.990> out<00:05:08.169> on<00:05:08.440> them<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.650> see<00:05:08.860> if<00:05:08.890> I

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
to figure it out on them to see if I

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.140 
to figure it out on them to see if I
could<00:05:09.220> try<00:05:09.640> to<00:05:09.700> explain<00:05:10.210> it<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.540> best<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:10.960> could

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
could try to explain it the best I could

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.300 
could try to explain it the best I could
so<00:05:13.150> I'm<00:05:13.270> clicking<00:05:13.600> on<00:05:13.900> it<00:05:14.080> and<00:05:14.200> then<00:05:14.770> I<00:05:14.890> bring
