00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:18.080
 when I write I hear music music that 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.050
 says if my verses are singing that 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.289
 I want to be felt by those who read for 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.339
 enjoy the pleasure that is heard 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.730
 I live each verse of mine intensely and I 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.670
 I immerse in that pure world magic in the 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.460
 who live all who write 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.850
 spilling true feelings we 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.850
 we put so deep into that essence that 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.760
 we no longer know if it is real is the world in 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.500
 that we live with the soul or that we 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.710
 surrounds each day sometimes we immerse ourselves in 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.519
 the shadows thoughts that underline 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.770
 yearnings dreams and two illusions that have 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:05.010
 been just that truncated hopes 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.690
 although not dead 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.480
 and we realize we remember and we suffer but 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.810
 it also comes to that infinite light that 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.750
 in abundance it is not flooded so that everything 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.830
 it shines and it should not 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:26.210
 the poet delivered each verse with 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.720
 everything with the soul and with life with each 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.100
 something that goes well in the background with each 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.330
 thing that touches the deepest 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.869
 and thus his life despite chimeras of 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.080
 fantasy that never ends and in to 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.810
 hours of your infinite time because it's 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.630
 That is the path you have chosen 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.970
 and when the bells ring with the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.140
 unmistakable special tune 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:02.440
 that's the work then sit down and 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.440
 write for a new poetry to be born
