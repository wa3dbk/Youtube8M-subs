00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.020
 hello we are live in place here 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.570
 Regensburg in the triathlon specialty store 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.490
 island resort and we have heard here 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.560
 can you be measured and that 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.950
 Just look at us that way 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.950
 easy with 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:45.890
 Now I landed here with you 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:48.799
 looks very interesting what makes 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.969
 you are Amazon now in the adjustment 

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:54.799
 for the sebastian 2014 first in the radio 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.989
 and it is a very important point in 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:59.239
 cover the area what you do there 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.829
 can and city is like this 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.780
 you have now so imagine two 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.210
 possibilities to overcome the height 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.679
 once the basin to tilt if that 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.479
 basin can not tilt however 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:09.470
 she has to stand above her 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.990
 compensate 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.880
 it now sees but one with sebastian 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.520
 remember little down when 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.600
 since then, his basin has been going in and out 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.490
 piece forward 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.429
 then the back will flatten automatically 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.610
 and saves about as much higher 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.830
 the 45 cm on the attack surface in the wind 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.050
 the one where, of course, then with the broad 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.569
 of the back has to count and it is 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.250
 already a lot of delicacies where you look 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.640
 just simply build a lot of watt 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.069
 can 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.660
 that depends either on the gate that the 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.860
 varieties do not fit we are so 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.020
 a bit difficult when baroque 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.410
 to find freezing biking between things 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.209
 between basin tilt and with after 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.250
 slip in the front and the second 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:51.289
 Possibility is just that the basin 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.819
 is blocked and there you have to with 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.319
 Physiotherapists work together and 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.300
 stehplatz sebastian we send 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.869
 Handy already knows exactly what he is 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.030
 have to do 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.970
 he gets five appointments and then that's it 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.509
 pool again and there are still 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.050
 ahead 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.819
 that is a round process 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.660
 looks very professional so if 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.269
 her husband is so relatively long and the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.250
 Basin story is extremely important for 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.620
 The size of cycling you can feel 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.620
 imagine that there are different ones 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.180
 Length except comes just so that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.550
 weiner the basin gives the longer it gets 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.920
 the body and that can often be two 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.540
 centimeters past the same length 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.940
 yes I mean he is not now 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.250
 unknown is that sebastian neef out 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.460
 Regensburg Hello first how are you 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.140
 since it is alright I sit here on my 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.930
 time forgive that the situation 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.550
 professionally adjusted and must say 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.430
 I would already be pretty 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.560
 well on it looks very uncomfortable because 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.310
 yes extremely bent so you're fine 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.430
 still good 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.230
 So yes, I know that the situation I then 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.960
 after that it will be good for you 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.730
 and I already know the wheel if 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.100
 the rt plus has already driven the season 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.800
 and has some very good ones 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.070
 results can enter and therefore 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.200
 contract already fully taken care of next 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.890
 the stream again and there again 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.530
 correctly 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.330
 For example, good results are called 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.490
 image start I have the international 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.360
 triathlon won as the oldest of them 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.390
 in Germany 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.950
 and yes, I could name a few 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.020
 the sample is already behind me 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.820
 otherwise he was fourth in kraichgau 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.440
 still at the german championship and 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.530
 thirteenth in wiesbaden at the 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.900
 European Championship respect what is it 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.600
 in which discipline do you start that is 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.060
 an argument 70 93 test is quasi the 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.560
 half of which is completely new and there 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.390
 just the wheel of very very important 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.550
 That's why I'm glad that I am 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.200
 otherwise we are talking in the professional here 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.790
 The partner found me there 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.620
 really super prepared 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.690
 that is very interesting to have one 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.690
 top athletes were you a regensburg 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.960
 and looks very interesting and would 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.660
