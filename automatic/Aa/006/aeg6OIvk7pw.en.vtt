00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello dear viewers today 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.620
 I want to share with you a winter recipe 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.530
 salad why winter because this 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.230
 salad is very nutritious and high in calories and 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.710
 It is mainly suitable for winter 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.680
 menu 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.730
 and also to me personally this salad right away 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.680
 casts a new year night scent composition 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.490
 This salad includes 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.119
 cod liver boiled potatoes 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.340
 boiled egg 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:38.340
 onion mayo before salt to taste 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:41.480
 in as you can see i'm already in the hole calling for the liver 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.910
 cod is not very small not very large 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.030
 does this mean we have a jar of liver 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.219
 cod 175 grams 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.000
 the nominal mass of the furnace do not be 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.190
 attentive buying jars and seeing 250 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.079
 gram don't think that there really 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.199
 250 grams really do something wrong in 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.470
 these 250 grams still come in oils whose 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.189
 there is a decent amount 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.710
 spices salt main product total 175 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.920
 gram so be attentive for 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.610
 cod liver night dew 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.740
 i add onion one onion i 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.710
 I love onions so I add a whole 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.500
 onion if you don't like the log anyway 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.170
 add at least half an onion about that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.590
 quarter because salad without sound 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.380
 this will be a prize per watt potato eggs 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.810
 this fresh products alla add to us 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.649
 such a highlight in this salad 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.590
 the next ingredient is boiled eggs i 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.409
 add 3 boiled 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.200
 chilled eggs by the way recently learned 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.170
 why are some i'm looking to clean well 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.270
 shell no some bad wanna with you 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.610
 share 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.290
 I used to think it was cold 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.990
 chilled eggs listed 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.880
 better than hot but it 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.160
 In general, then such a mistake is a theory that 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.800
 cold eggs and hot they are equally 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.290
 cleaned it all depends on the freshness of the eggs from 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.830
 face fresh it will be cleaned badly 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.530
 if the egg is not very fresh well, at least 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.319
 week lay in the fridge then she 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.640
 everything will be cleaned well because 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.720
 the egg is a living organism she then she decides 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.000
 produces its own products 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.190
 vital activity and you owe which 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.290
 produce and they have us they 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.569
 pile up under the shell of course 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.840
 partially gases go out through micro pores 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.180
 shells but part of the gas it accumulates 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.060
 under the shell and therefore creates such 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.989
 as if the air gap that's why 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.819
 eggs that are already a little bit they lay 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.569
 clear better than fresh eggs i 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.780
 I use homemade eggs they are with me 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.390
 fresh the next ingredient is boiled 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.790
 about my potatoes here are six 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.540
 or five or six potato medium 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.049
 size you can also use 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.090
 processed cheese 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.870
 then we will succeed in principle not 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.549
 salad and pate that you can 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.400
 easily smeared on black or white 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.280
 bread and you get a sandwich but I 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.959
 Today I do with boiled with boiled 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.739
 potatoes 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:31.680
 so does the pepper on red pepper without 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.340
 bigotry literally a little bit 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.290
 for spiciness and salt, too, a little without 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.109
 fanaticism because we have salty 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.950
 cod liver and we will have mayonnaise too 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.450
 salty add mayonnaise I took 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.690
 low-calorie to somehow 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.200
 save your figure 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:55.860
 I do not like a lot of mayonnaise add 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:59.100
 a little bit to start and mix 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.320
 child see what we can do if 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.990
 it will be dry I'll add more mayonnaise 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.120
 It seems to me that, in principle, probably 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.760
 this will be enough because more 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.640
 us here and cod liver oil 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.640
 so the salad is very juicy and 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.010
 everything seems to be ready to proceed 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.010
 skin in all bon appetit 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.370
