00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
it's pretty interesting to see that they

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.569 
it's pretty interesting to see that they
actually<00:01:59.289> made<00:01:59.799> that<00:01:59.919> one<00:02:00.099> happen<00:02:00.399> and<00:02:00.549> I

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
actually made that one happen and I

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.099 
actually made that one happen and I
think<00:02:00.609> it's<00:02:00.909> for<00:02:01.149> redemption<00:02:01.389> he<00:02:01.779> has<00:02:01.929> to

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
think it's for redemption he has to

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:03.629 
think it's for redemption he has to
prove<00:02:02.319> that<00:02:02.380> he<00:02:02.529> deserved<00:02:03.009> that<00:02:03.130> win<00:02:03.369> because

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:03.639 
prove that he deserved that win because

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.209 
prove that he deserved that win because
I'm<00:02:04.389> not<00:02:04.659> sure<00:02:04.869> he<00:02:05.020> ever<00:02:05.200> believed<00:02:05.679> that<00:02:05.859> just

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
considering hostess Eidos got a pretty

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.180 
considering hostess Eidos got a pretty
decent<00:03:52.810> following<00:03:53.500> out<00:03:53.620> there<00:03:53.799> in<00:03:53.890> Southern

decent following out there in Southern

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.560 
decent following out there in Southern
California<00:03:54.310> being<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.209> he's<00:03:55.359> from

California being that he's from
Riverside<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.280> think<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.760> would<00:03:57.850> be<00:03:57.970> kind

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180

considering<00:05:05.509> that<00:05:06.580> many<00:05:07.580> months<00:05:07.909> ago<00:05:07.999> Kahn

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
considering that many months ago Kahn

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.350 
considering that many months ago Kahn
told<00:05:08.659> me<00:05:08.749> that<00:05:08.930> he<00:05:09.110> did<00:05:09.680> sign<00:05:10.249> the<00:05:10.789> contract

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
told me that he did sign the contract

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.799 
told me that he did sign the contract
and<00:05:11.629> that<00:05:11.719> Floyd<00:05:12.499> said<00:05:13.490> he's<00:05:13.849> signed<00:05:14.119> but<00:05:14.509> the

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:14.809 
and that Floyd said he's signed but the

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:16.499 
and that Floyd said he's signed but the
paperwork<00:05:15.229> was<00:05:15.469> you<00:05:15.740> know<00:05:15.830> never<00:05:16.129> really

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
paperwork was you know never really

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:20.469 
paperwork was you know never really
delivered<00:05:17.539> so<00:05:18.499> I<00:05:18.529> until<00:05:19.249> the<00:05:19.580> paperwork<00:05:19.909> is<00:05:20.209> in

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
delivered so I until the paperwork is in

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.409 
delivered so I until the paperwork is in
I<00:05:20.779> guess<00:05:20.990> there<00:05:21.289> really<00:05:21.439> isn't<00:05:21.680> a<00:05:21.889> fight

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
I guess there really isn't a fight

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.649 
I guess there really isn't a fight
that's<00:05:23.419> definite<00:05:24.020> but<00:05:24.529> anyways<00:05:24.919> I<00:05:25.659> I'm
