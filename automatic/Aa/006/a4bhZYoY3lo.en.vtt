itself<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:36.530> was<00:01:37.430> struck<00:01:38.420> by<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:38.720> fact<00:01:39.110> that<00:01:39.290> it

itself I was struck by the fact that it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.750 
itself I was struck by the fact that it
is<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.730> binary<00:01:41.150> device<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.260> I<00:01:42.560> recalled<00:01:43.010> that

is a binary device and I recalled that

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.630 
is a binary device and I recalled that
numbers<00:01:44.570> could<00:01:44.870> be<00:01:45.020> written<00:01:45.250> using<00:01:46.250> the

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
of 0 1 2 3 up to 9 and it occurred to me

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.100 
of 0 1 2 3 up to 9 and it occurred to me
that<00:01:54.500> maybe<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.250> would<00:01:55.370> be<00:01:55.580> convenient<00:01:56.510> to<00:01:56.870> let

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
that maybe it would be convenient to let
