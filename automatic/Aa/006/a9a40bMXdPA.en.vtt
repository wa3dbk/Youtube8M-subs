00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.149 
have a character breathe and talk about
however<00:01:40.659> they're<00:01:40.840> feeling<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.439> lot<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:41.920> people

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
however they're feeling a lot of people

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.560 
however they're feeling a lot of people
say<00:01:42.310> there<00:01:42.460> was<00:01:42.549> a<00:01:42.609> ton<00:01:42.789> of<00:01:42.820> grown-up<00:01:43.329> jokes

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
say there was a ton of grown-up jokes

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.419 
say there was a ton of grown-up jokes
but<00:01:43.750> really<00:01:44.020> I<00:01:44.049> didn't<00:01:44.560> see<00:01:44.679> them<00:01:44.859> until<00:01:44.950> maybe

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
but really I didn't see them until maybe

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.710 
but really I didn't see them until maybe
near<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.850> end<00:01:46.030> right<00:01:46.750> stomp<00:01:47.409> on<00:01:47.649> with<00:01:47.829> that

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.820 

I<00:01:52.030> guess<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.150> only<00:01:53.510> main<00:01:53.900> problem<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.590> have

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
I guess the only main problem I have

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.860 
I guess the only main problem I have
with<00:01:55.010> it<00:01:55.190> is<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.610> story<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.150> touch<00:01:56.600> too

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
with it is that the story is a touch too

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.810 
with it is that the story is a touch too
predictable<00:01:57.260> I<00:01:57.770> mean<00:01:58.070> once<00:01:58.280> again<00:01:58.640> we're

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
predictable I mean once again we're

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.210 
predictable I mean once again we're
gonna<00:01:58.910> have<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.480> liar<00:01:59.840> revealed<00:02:00.500> backstory

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
gonna have the liar revealed backstory

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.010 
gonna have the liar revealed backstory
it's<00:02:01.580> not<00:02:01.760> gonna<00:02:01.940> be<00:02:02.180> just<00:02:02.210> brushed<00:02:02.810> over

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
it's not gonna be just brushed over

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.440 
it's not gonna be just brushed over
either<00:02:03.380> it's<00:02:03.770> gonna<00:02:03.950> take<00:02:04.310> up<00:02:04.550> a<00:02:04.730> good<00:02:05.030> chunk

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
either it's gonna take up a good chunk

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.060 
either it's gonna take up a good chunk
of<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.630> third<00:02:05.960> act<00:02:06.230> with<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.590> characters

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070

moping and doping and oh Jesus have gone
on<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.429> on<00:02:10.610> about<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.510> I'm<00:02:11.780> not<00:02:12.110> gonna

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
on and on about this I'm not gonna

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.080 
on and on about this I'm not gonna
prattle<00:02:12.710> anymore<00:02:13.070> let's<00:02:13.370> just<00:02:13.640> say<00:02:13.820> it's

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
prattle anymore let's just say it's

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.180 
prattle anymore let's just say it's
boring<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.320> don't<00:02:15.380> think<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.770> jokes<00:02:16.040> are

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
boring and I don't think the jokes are

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.340 
boring and I don't think the jokes are
quite<00:02:16.580> strong<00:02:17.000> enough<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.510> make<00:02:17.690> up<00:02:17.930> for<00:02:17.960> such

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
quite strong enough to make up for such

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.830 
quite strong enough to make up for such
a<00:02:18.380> lackluster<00:02:19.370> part<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.790> movie<00:02:20.150> but<00:02:20.660> like

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
a lackluster part of the movie but like

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.570 
a lackluster part of the movie but like
I<00:02:20.960> said<00:02:21.170> before<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.530> still<00:02:21.890> think<00:02:22.100> it<00:02:22.190> holds<00:02:22.370> up

I said before I still think it holds up
as<00:02:22.730> being<00:02:23.000> okay<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.990> is<00:02:24.170> still<00:02:24.440> very<00:02:24.680> creative

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
as being okay it is still very creative

story<00:02:42.170> arc<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.530> maybe<00:02:42.740> thought<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.040> little<00:02:43.340> bit

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
story arc and maybe thought a little bit

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.800 
story arc and maybe thought a little bit
more<00:02:43.580> out<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.940> box<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.360> would<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.600> liked

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
more out of the box I would have liked

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.660 
more out of the box I would have liked
it<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:45.050> lot<00:02:45.170> more<00:02:45.470> but<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:45.980> still<00:02:46.250> think<00:02:46.490> it's<00:02:46.610> a

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
it a lot more but I still think it's a

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.640 
it a lot more but I still think it's a
decent<00:02:46.850> flick<00:02:47.240> it's<00:02:47.780> got<00:02:47.959> just<00:02:48.140> enough<00:02:48.350> for

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
decent flick it's got just enough for

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.380 
decent flick it's got just enough for
kids<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.040> just<00:02:49.250> enough<00:02:49.490> for<00:02:49.640> adults<00:02:49.850> I<00:02:50.180> think

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
kids and just enough for adults I think

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.940 
kids and just enough for adults I think
it's<00:02:50.750> worth<00:02:50.900> at<00:02:51.020> least

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
it's worth at least

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.980 
it's worth at least
