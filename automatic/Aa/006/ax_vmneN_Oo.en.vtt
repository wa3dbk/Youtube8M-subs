of this out there lately jumping and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.990 
of this out there lately jumping and
shooting<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.980> works<00:00:35.190> with<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.399> wide<00:00:35.579> variety

shooting it works with the wide variety

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.299 
shooting it works with the wide variety
weapons<00:00:36.390> but<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.260> how<00:00:37.559> does<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.890> work<00:00:38.040> and

you<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:41.010> jumping<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.660> now<00:00:42.660> before<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.320> get

you be jumping with now before we get
into<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.680> specific<00:00:44.160> technique<00:00:44.550> let's<00:00:45.300> take<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
into the specific technique let's take a

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.720 
into the specific technique let's take a
look<00:00:45.780> at<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> very<00:00:46.230> important<00:00:46.680> factor<00:00:47.070> each

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
look at a very important factor each

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.090 
look at a very important factor each
weapon<00:00:48.030> has<00:00:48.300> different<00:00:48.690> accuracy<00:00:49.170> weapons

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
weapon has different accuracy weapons

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
weapon has different accuracy weapons
like<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> spider<00:00:50.640> shot<00:00:50.910> pro<00:00:51.180> fire<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.690> a

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
like the spider shot pro fire in a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.540 
like the spider shot pro fire in a
straight<00:00:51.989> line<00:00:52.020> with<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> occasional<00:00:53.190> bullet

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
straight line with the occasional bullet

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.549 
straight line with the occasional bullet
flying<00:00:53.820> slightly<00:00:54.270> left-to-right<00:00:54.750> other

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
flying slightly left-to-right other

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.170 
flying slightly left-to-right other
weapons<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.309> arrow<00:00:56.460> spray<00:00:56.789> or<00:00:56.940> spider

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
weapons like the arrow spray or spider

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.810 
weapons like the arrow spray or spider
shot<00:00:57.420> jr.<00:00:57.870> randomly<00:00:58.649> fire<00:00:58.859> bullets<00:00:59.250> all<00:00:59.430> over

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
shot jr. randomly fire bullets all over

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.130 
shot jr. randomly fire bullets all over
in<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> direction<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.600> are<00:01:00.629> generally

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
in the direction you are generally

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.439 
in the direction you are generally
aiming<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.190> accuracy<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.699> every<00:01:03.030> weapon<00:01:03.180> is

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
aiming the accuracy of every weapon is

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.179 
aiming the accuracy of every weapon is
ultimately<00:01:03.930> what<00:01:04.170> determines<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> winner<00:01:04.949> of

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
ultimately what determines the winner of

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.520 
ultimately what determines the winner of
one-on-one<00:01:05.489> combat<00:01:05.960> arrow<00:01:06.960> sprays<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
one-on-one combat arrow sprays and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.960 
one-on-one combat arrow sprays and
juniors<00:01:07.860> make<00:01:08.100> up<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.430> their<00:01:08.549> poor<00:01:08.729> accuracy

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
juniors make up for their poor accuracy

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.210 
juniors make up for their poor accuracy
with<00:01:09.360> their<00:01:09.510> fast<00:01:09.750> rate<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.049> fire<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:11.070> can

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
with their fast rate of fire you can

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.859 
with their fast rate of fire you can
afford<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.610> miss<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> few<00:01:11.909> shots<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
afford to miss a few shots because of

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.090 
afford to miss a few shots because of
the<00:01:12.960> amount<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.320> bullets<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.710> are<00:01:13.830> firing

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
the amount of bullets you are firing

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.270 
the amount of bullets you are firing
every<00:01:14.460> second<00:01:15.470> another<00:01:16.470> important<00:01:16.950> factor<00:01:17.250> is

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
every second another important factor is

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.640 
every second another important factor is
of<00:01:17.520> course<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.909> range<00:01:18.119> shorter<00:01:19.110> range<00:01:19.290> weapons

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
of course of range shorter range weapons

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
of course of range shorter range weapons
are<00:01:19.799> better<00:01:19.979> off<00:01:20.189> advancing<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.850> combat<00:01:21.240> while

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
are better off advancing in combat while

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.969 
are better off advancing in combat while
longer<00:01:21.810> range<00:01:22.110> weapons<00:01:22.470> are<00:01:22.619> better<00:01:22.799> at

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
longer range weapons are better at

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.710 
longer range weapons are better at
backing<00:01:23.310> away<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.759> finding<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.150> better<00:01:24.299> angle

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
backing away and finding a better angle

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.469 
backing away and finding a better angle
so<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:25.950> got<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> basics<00:01:26.400> down<00:01:26.759> every<00:01:27.330> weapon

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
so we got the basics down every weapon

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.060 
so we got the basics down every weapon
has<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> different<00:01:28.110> rate<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.350> fire<00:01:28.530> accuracy

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
has a different rate of fire accuracy

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.580
