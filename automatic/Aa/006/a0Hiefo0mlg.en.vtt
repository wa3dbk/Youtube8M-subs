00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.319
 in 2013 has been a very interesting year 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.080
 to the sony 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.120
 besides launching the flagship car, wait for the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.190
 company has not forgotten its audience 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.650
 of the medium range the two devices 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.029
 shown today belongs precisely to this 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.359
 category 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.160
 here are waiting it's ex psp linen 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.230
 the differences between the high end 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.369
 sony migrants are not noticed the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.199
 first sight 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.849
 so let's examine in detail 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.790
 of these two smartphones 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.899
 the ex-psp would be more like a 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.270
 lower class of 12 and zl and wait 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.030
 l follow the path i hope j 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.190
 the design of the wait is very different from 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.190
 the back is slightly curved and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.680
 the edges are tuned and a 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.350
 the entire device 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.539
 in addition the return home buttons 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.699
 are on the screen and a lower surface 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.970
 much greater than that which was not used 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.040
 display 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.450
 the ex psp on the other hand combines style 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.200
 effectively 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:10.110
 weighs 255 grams and the dimensions are well 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.730
 similar to the expert's and cl in the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.130
 below we find the 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.440
 already known in the series 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.420
 that they warn us if any 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.210
 message the called party is the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.650
 transparent you see here 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.080
 both devices have a ring 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.700
 around the camera and a detail 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.250
 important is that the two have 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.470
 physical shutter when you see a time 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.710
 less on smartphones 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.470
 browsing the internet we can see the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.600
 difference between the device screens 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.580
 based on the pitt android site 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.640
 we see that the sp screen is less bright 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.390
 and more readable than that of ex pfl 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.440
 the sp screen in addition is larger has 4.6 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.020
 inches against 4.3 of the ex pfl when 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.570
 we are talking about the few interface software 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.369
 differences separate pedro l 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.680
 however sp presents some 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.250
 pre-installed applications that it does not 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.100
 has high mode and the former pilot has 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.850
 navigation program 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.850
 the most powerful spa cpu with 1.7 ghz 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.560
 if a processor of the body, but more 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.600
 he is not far behind 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.730
 note only a small difference 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.220
 speed of access to the pages during 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.860
 browsing the internet 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.850
 in relation to the cameras there are not many 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.730
 differences 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.840
 both have the same software and 8 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.489
 megapixels 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.890
 I did some laps and I came to the conclusion 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.019
 that the expert produces the best 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.430
 images with more vivid colors and a 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.650
 impressive quality for a 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.450
 average apparatus 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.680
 this was the comparison between the expert sp 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.080
 an expert 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.790
