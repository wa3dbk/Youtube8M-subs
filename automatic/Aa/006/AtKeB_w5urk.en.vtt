00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.990
 So that's a real geek 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:21.660
 with gates so in fact I did a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.340
 wheel on a wheel so she is off center 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.160
 one of the magnets are on a wheel 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:33.960
 eccentric compared to the laax what me 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.829
 allows to make the attraction 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.340
 repulsion half of the elements there that 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.150
 are repulsive here and there he comes in 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.830
 Attraction attraction and hoist 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.620
 repulsion so when it's a turn he 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.560
 there is a place where it's hard to pass 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:00.950
 here with here it's a it's a 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:05.159
 permanent magnet like this 6.8 by 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.729
 diabate 8 by 30 centimeters long the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.729
 same as those there 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.490
 so it's a permanent magnet there is a 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.550
 coil around and the coil to the cables 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.770
 and for that current running through that 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.650
 reverse the polarity of leemans the opposite 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.600
 the polarity of the hands to cut 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:29.200
 actually the effect of passing elements 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.150
 criticize this here it's a contactor a 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:38.920
 switch actually plugs them on the 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:42.510
 more is the ja so far so a little 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.510
 magnet that was triggering let's talk 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.970
 I am patient see it I know how to do it 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.150
 bigger possible 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:02.930
 there are magnets here that triggers it 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.930
 a small step often 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.690
 attack 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.709
 so it stops there is not 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.019
 current if we turn the power on for everything 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.110
 the current goes to cancel the effect 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:27.120
 of permanent elements case there then we 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.120
 get it the gate had to watch 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.860
 Let's go 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:17.810
 titi electromagnets contact it is not 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.120
 very well done the coil around the 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.859
 permanent development we do not listen 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.450
 totally I think we will make a 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:29.150
 best performance with a coil made 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:32.480
 bigger and it costs enough 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.590
 for that 's why it falls so it's 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.950
 the element that make their 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.129
 electricity circle to peak at the moment he 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.129
 requires 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:59.799
 then show a little more 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:59.799
 300 minutes on a battra in salt 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.989
 much less landmarks anyway 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:27.050
 battery dribble enough we have 300 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:29.770
 min turns in complexity with like 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.770
 the most competent members 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:40.840
 and sets but the two cities he dreams to 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.840
 new to another
