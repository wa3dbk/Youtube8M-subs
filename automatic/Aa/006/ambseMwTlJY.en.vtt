00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.520
 we introduce a unique shooting tank 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.590
 virtual reality format battles 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.510
 and this is a rather unique event because 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.610
 that no one in the world has ever shot a tank 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.910
 battle virtual reality format in 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.100
 360 format 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.590
 it was not easy because we have to 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.660
 solve a bunch of technical issues right away 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.080
 which are layered on creative 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.670
 problems here the camera takes off right away 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.670
 panoramic 360 degrees 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.580
 maximally everything around the camera is 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.430
 everything is all visible but all this must 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.260
 be on very very small 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.500
 distance very close 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.420
 stone is not necessary to provide 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.860
 all filming space all this 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.320
 perimeter pad 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.210
 all that is more 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.330
 than 30 meters it's all not visible 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.340
 ordinary goupro which are located 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.160
 in a certain order in a certain 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.220
 position this allows the distance between 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.080
 lenses to make minimal if 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.560
 there were big cameras we would not do this 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.270
 could 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.520
 and, accordingly, no installation of all 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.600
 the scene should be happening here start before 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.600
 end in real time 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 drove 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.290
 we hang the cameras under the quadrocopter 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.610
 this whole thing flies and to 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.230
 compensate then cut 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.130
 quadrocopter can see that on top 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.430
 one more dust 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.400
 which then gives us the opportunity 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.230
 footage video with sky glue flying 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.620
 Quadcopter on top for now 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.209
 There are several ways to watch videos 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.640
 virtual reality format and the most 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.380
 the perfect best way is 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.690
 Naturally a year later in my hands 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.520
 now the easiest 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.250
 virtual reality helmet which I 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.050
 again on the development of google google 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.660
 cardboard 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.239
 which consists of cardboard 2 lenses 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.820
 liner for smartphone with correct 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.430
 selected focal length to the lenses 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.170
 with correct lenses 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.410
 This is the best way because you can 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.590
 insert the smartphone and look like this 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.489
 almost like oculus rift only much 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.489
 more affordable
