00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.340
 whatever your code requires 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.980
 correction or they are perfect i recommend 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.769
 color the natural contour with a tone or 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.990
 masking means it is appropriate 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.420
 since lip liner and lipstick 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.420
 we fix better this way and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.900
 lasts longer keeping you created 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.900
 form 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.150
 I read it myself and recommend it to you 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.810
 use special contour 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.840
 a pencil 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.650
 with a contour for a crazy pencil clubs 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.450
 always look darker and crisper 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.480
 I start forever the freshness of the corners of the lips 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.890
 you can adjust them a little 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.340
 are considered that you really should not be packing 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.170
 be on the donkey center line 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.089
 small neat strokes and draw 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.729
 contour try it to be 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.130
 symmetric and even after that 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.259
 continue it will show in that direction 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.400
 which we will find convenient for you and 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.590
 allows you to draw 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.950
 simultaneously smoothing natural 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.950
 folds 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.119
 lower lip all the same way I'm starting 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.720
 with a straight line in the middle and then 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.060
 neatly connecting it to the corners 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.009
 take your time and make sure that 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.500
 the pencil was well before use 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.110
 sharpened it is necessary not only for 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.030
 the contour to be thin and clear but 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.430
 and because then that is disinfection 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.430
 the pencil from it is removed old already 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.259
 used layer by the way it concerns 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.259
 all pencils you use 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.720
 if the pencil is different in color from 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.020
 lipstick contour gently shaded 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.060
 after which lipstick is applied 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.430
 one more tip apply lipstick 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.010
 special brush is not only 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.360
 hygienically but also convenient to your movement 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.780
 I will be more precise 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.210
 if so much convenience and of 13 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.280
 inside cop and then more 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.280
 carefully drawing edges along the contour 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.599
 blush applied last touch makeup 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.040
 shock face expressiveness for 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.250
 I prefer to use contact 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.830
 dry blush which I think I want 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.900
 the main ones are applied and shaded 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.420
 sources of blush avoid 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.580
 gossip why consult with these 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.410
 very small portions of maternity 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.580
 it is more difficult to get out of the way than 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.190
 fill the gap 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.830
 believe my experience how much was not 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.319
 I am going to put blush most often of this 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.040
 two more than you need but to be feather 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.780
 Armenian women need two longer and more thoroughly 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.060
 together no blush begins the most 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.370
 convex parts of the school clock 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.099
 shade towards temples and cheeks 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.349
 remember blush should not color 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.349
 face they have to refresh it
