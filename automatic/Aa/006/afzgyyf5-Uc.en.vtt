00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
don't know i pressure you can figure it

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.440 
don't know i pressure you can figure it
out<00:00:43.469> if<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.040> actually<00:00:44.190> looked<00:00:44.550> at<00:00:44.670> videos<00:00:45.059> but

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
out if you actually looked at videos but

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.840 
out if you actually looked at videos but
some<00:00:46.440> videos<00:00:46.829> you'd<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.640> look

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
some videos you'd have to like look

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.119 
some videos you'd have to like look
through<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.180> though<00:00:48.620> but<00:00:49.620> eventually<00:00:49.770> you'd

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
through it though but eventually you'd

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.069 
through it though but eventually you'd
probably<00:00:50.309> figure<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:51.379> um<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:54.020> go<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
probably figure it out um I go to

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.389 
probably figure it out um I go to
kinetic<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.210> yeah<00:00:57.859> which<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.010> basically<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399

another<00:01:05.820> thing<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.430> about<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.700> cold

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
another thing was that about the cold

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.480 
another thing was that about the cold
and<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.360> snow<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.830> meant<00:01:11.100> when<00:01:11.430> I

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and the snow and what I meant when I

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.600 
and the snow and what I meant when I
said<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:12.299> whatever<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.229> forgot<00:01:14.130> how<00:01:14.280> long<00:01:14.460> ago

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
said like whatever I forgot how long ago

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.560 
said like whatever I forgot how long ago
I<00:01:14.640> said<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.560> thought<00:01:16.560> snow<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.100> pretty

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
I said it but I thought snow was pretty

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.120 
I said it but I thought snow was pretty
because<00:01:18.570> when<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.930> snows<00:01:19.200> outside<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.979> you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
because when it snows outside and you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.440 
because when it snows outside and you
watch<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.850> see<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> snow<00:01:21.240> play

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
watch it and you see the snow play

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.670 
watch it and you see the snow play
coming<00:01:21.840> down<00:01:21.930> you're<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.200> oh<00:01:22.320> that's<00:01:22.560> so

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
think the worst part about it is that it

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.199 
think the worst part about it is that it
reminds<00:02:59.709> me<00:02:59.860> of<00:03:00.130> something<00:03:00.400> that's<00:03:00.700> exactly
