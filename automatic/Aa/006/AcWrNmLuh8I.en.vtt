enough<00:00:06.330> has<00:00:06.450> been<00:00:06.480> said<00:00:06.660> about<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.170> fact<00:00:07.410> that

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
enough has been said about the fact that

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.680 
enough has been said about the fact that
natural<00:00:07.890> fibers<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.760> process<00:00:09.300> which<00:00:09.570> is

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
natural fibers and the process which is

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.450 
natural fibers and the process which is
beautiful<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.260> organic<00:00:10.500> but<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.010> think<00:00:11.309> what<00:00:11.429> I

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
beautiful and organic but I think what I

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.120 
beautiful and organic but I think what I
love<00:00:11.820> most<00:00:12.120> about<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.080> we<00:00:13.559> forget<00:00:13.889> what

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
love most about is that we forget what

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.790 
love most about is that we forget what
true<00:00:14.490> Indian<00:00:14.940> sophistication<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.650> know

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
true Indian sophistication is you know

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.260 
true Indian sophistication is you know
without<00:00:17.070> being<00:00:17.130> trite<00:00:17.609> about<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.060> without

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
without being trite about it without

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.630 
without being trite about it without
being<00:00:18.510> too<00:00:18.720> ethnic<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.470> clunky<00:00:19.980> about<00:00:20.279> it

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
being too ethnic and clunky about it

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.029 
being too ethnic and clunky about it
it's<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.000> very<00:00:21.359> international<00:00:21.750> chic<00:00:22.560> ballad

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
it's a very international chic ballad

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.950 
it's a very international chic ballad
that<00:00:23.220> she<00:00:23.340> presented<00:00:23.519> as<00:00:24.240> much<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:24.660> we<00:00:24.779> talk

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
that she presented as much as we talk

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.620 
that she presented as much as we talk
about<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.380> being<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.220> full<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.820> heritage<00:00:27.240> and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
about it being so full of heritage and

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.830 
about it being so full of heritage and
the<00:00:28.080> processes<00:00:28.590> are<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.279> old<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:30.090> think<00:00:30.510> it's

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
the processes are so old I think it's

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.380 
the processes are so old I think it's
such<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> modern<00:00:31.859> Indian<00:00:32.369> look<00:00:32.640> first<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.239> all

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
saris for a long time and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.320 
saris for a long time and
from<00:01:20.460> designing<00:01:20.790> saris<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:22.710> draping<00:01:23.460> saris<00:01:23.880> -

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
from designing saris to draping saris -

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330 
from designing saris to draping saris -
then<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:25.320> thought<00:01:25.560> where<00:01:25.770> did<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.220> start

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
then we thought where did it all start

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.280 
then we thought where did it all start
you<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.479> took<00:01:27.690> us<00:01:27.840> back<00:01:28.020> into

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
you know and that took us back into

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.320 
you know and that took us back into
history<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.950> maybe<00:01:29.520> Indus<00:01:29.850> Valley<00:01:29.880> was<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
history and maybe Indus Valley was the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.060 
history and maybe Indus Valley was the
place<00:01:30.690> I<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.500> that's<00:01:31.710> where<00:01:31.920> we've

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
place I think because that's where we've

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.499 
place I think because that's where we've
trade<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> place<00:01:33.180> where<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
trade that that was the place where the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.359 
trade that that was the place where the
unstitch<00:01:34.110> garment<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.650> being<00:01:34.950> draped<00:01:35.190> like<00:01:35.310> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
unstitch garment was being draped like a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.550 
unstitch garment was being draped like a
sari<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.940> was<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.390> place<00:01:36.690> where<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.350> sari

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
sari so it was the place where the sari

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.350 
sari so it was the place where the sari
evolved<00:01:38.009> basically<00:01:38.580> we<00:01:38.700> were<00:01:38.820> inspired<00:01:39.030> by

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
evolved basically we were inspired by

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.469 
evolved basically we were inspired by
the<00:01:39.509> remains<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.770> town<00:01:41.460> planning<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.330> this

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the remains of the town planning so this

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.139 
the remains of the town planning so this
is<00:01:42.600> actually<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.320> hand-woven

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
is actually a hand-woven

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.820 
is actually a hand-woven
metallic<00:01:45.149> fabric<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:46.049> did<00:01:46.259> leaving

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
metallic fabric on that we did leaving

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.820 
metallic fabric on that we did leaving
with<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> cotton<00:01:47.630> yarn<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:49.020> top<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.500> urban

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
what modeling the movement would be

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.300 
what modeling the movement would be
where<00:03:01.170> you're<00:03:01.350> not<00:03:01.470> being<00:03:01.530> very<00:03:01.799> direct<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.280> a

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
where you're not being very direct to a

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.009

off pieces after tailoring and then we

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.390 
off pieces after tailoring and then we
