adventurer today we're gonna learn how
to<00:00:09.480> build<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.840> really<00:00:10.080> sweet<00:00:10.440> camping<00:00:10.889> stove

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
to build a really sweet camping stove

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.820 
to build a really sweet camping stove
out<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.910> Budweiser<00:00:12.179> aluminum<00:00:13.019> bottle<00:00:13.380> it's

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
out of a Budweiser aluminum bottle it's

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.099 
out of a Budweiser aluminum bottle it's
not<00:00:14.040> just<00:00:14.250> any<00:00:14.400> old<00:00:14.490> aluminum<00:00:15.179> bottle<00:00:15.480> it's<00:00:15.870> a

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
not just any old aluminum bottle it's a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.900 
not just any old aluminum bottle it's a
hefty<00:00:16.500> one<00:00:16.740> they<00:00:17.220> allow<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.580> bring<00:00:17.789> them

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
hefty one they allow you to bring them

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.029 
hefty one they allow you to bring them
into<00:00:18.029> stadiums<00:00:18.600> because<00:00:19.350> they're<00:00:19.650> not<00:00:19.770> glass

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
into stadiums because they're not glass

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.950 
into stadiums because they're not glass
but<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.730> very<00:00:20.939> heavy<00:00:21.180> aluminum<00:00:21.449> and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
but it's a very heavy aluminum and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.990 
but it's a very heavy aluminum and
you'll<00:00:22.320> see<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.650> advantages<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.490> as<00:00:23.640> we

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
you'll see the advantages of that as we

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.519 
you'll see the advantages of that as we
build<00:00:24.210> our<00:00:24.330> stove<00:00:24.630> let's<00:00:25.410> get<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:27.529> there's

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
build our stove let's get going there's

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.470 
build our stove let's get going there's
two<00:00:28.680> ways<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.010> cut<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.340> aluminum<00:00:29.789> bottle<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
two ways to cut this aluminum bottle the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.120 
two ways to cut this aluminum bottle the
first<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.289> hacksaw

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
first one is a hacksaw

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.590 
first one is a hacksaw
now<00:00:32.780> it's<00:00:33.780> hard<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:35.040> takes<00:00:35.280> forever<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.969> don't

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
now it's hard it takes forever I don't

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.150 
now it's hard it takes forever I don't
really<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> hacksaw<00:00:37.500> method<00:00:37.860> I'll<00:00:37.950> show

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
really like the hacksaw method I'll show

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.290 
really like the hacksaw method I'll show
it<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.550> because<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.030> most<00:00:39.149> common

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
it to you because it's the most common

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.450 
it to you because it's the most common
tool<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.989> found<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.920> there's<00:00:41.100> also<00:00:41.280> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
tool I found that there's also a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.209 
tool I found that there's also a
plumbing<00:00:42.030> cutting<00:00:42.420> wrench<00:00:42.680> this<00:00:43.680> guy<00:00:43.920> right

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
plumbing cutting wrench this guy right

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.400 
plumbing cutting wrench this guy right
here<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.879> opens<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.420> real<00:00:45.660> wide<00:00:45.899> wide<00:00:46.200> enough

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
here it opens up real wide wide enough

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.380 
here it opens up real wide wide enough
to<00:00:46.469> cut<00:00:46.770> our<00:00:46.950> aluminum<00:00:47.550> bottle<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.059> that's

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
to cut our aluminum bottle and that's

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.529 
to cut our aluminum bottle and that's
really<00:00:48.750> fast<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.530> make<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> stove<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.250> about

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
really fast I can make a stove in about

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.549 
really fast I can make a stove in about
10-15<00:00:51.539> minutes<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.230> these<00:00:52.350> guys

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
10-15 minutes with one of these guys

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.220 
10-15 minutes with one of these guys
I'll<00:00:53.160> show<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.430> how<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.730> done<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.989> first

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
I'll show you how it's done the first

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.500 
I'll show you how it's done the first
step<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.680> scoring<00:00:56.280> our<00:00:56.460> bottle<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.360> where

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
step is scoring our bottle to know where

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.569 
step is scoring our bottle to know where
we<00:00:57.629> want<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.840> cut<00:00:58.050> what<00:00:58.680> I've<00:00:58.800> used<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
we want to cut what I've used is just a

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.760 
we want to cut what I've used is just a
piece<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.570> tape<00:01:00.780> where<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.230> use<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> block

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
piece of tape where you can use a block

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.170 
piece of tape where you can use a block
to<00:01:02.640> set<00:01:03.539> up<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.920> guide<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.610> take<00:01:05.970> my

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
to set up as a guide and then I take my

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.480 
to set up as a guide and then I take my
exacto<00:01:06.810> knife<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.560> actually<00:01:07.920> spin<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
exacto knife and actually spin the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.850 
exacto knife and actually spin the
bottle<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.970> make<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> mark<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.520> side

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
bottle and make a mark on the side

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.920 
bottle and make a mark on the side
delineating<00:01:16.860> where<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> want<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.520> cut<00:01:20.780> now<00:01:21.780> with

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
delineating where I want to cut now with

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.800 
delineating where I want to cut now with
the<00:01:22.049> wrench<00:01:22.259> gives<00:01:22.560> real<00:01:22.770> easy<00:01:23.009> real<00:01:23.250> fast<00:01:23.810> you

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the wrench gives real easy real fast you

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.550 
the wrench gives real easy real fast you
line<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.439> up<00:01:25.580> pop<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:28.070> start<00:01:29.070> spinning

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
line it up pop it on and start spinning

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.859 
line it up pop it on and start spinning
and<00:01:31.560> what<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.130> know<00:01:32.479> it<00:01:33.479> immediately

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
and what do you know it immediately

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.300 
and what do you know it immediately
begins<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.890> cut<00:01:35.990> okay<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.770> got<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> bottom

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
begins to cut okay so we got the bottom

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.670 
begins to cut okay so we got the bottom
off<00:01:38.460> now<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.150> time<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.450> get<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> top<00:01:39.869> off<00:01:40.079> go

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
off now it's time to get the top off go

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.149 
off now it's time to get the top off go
about<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> thumb<00:01:41.189> width<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:42.890> Mark<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.009> right

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
about a thumb width and Mark it right

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.580 
about a thumb width and Mark it right
about<00:01:44.340> there<00:01:44.630> take<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> top<00:01:45.930> off<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.350> not<00:01:46.470> an

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
about there take the top off it's not an

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.590 
about there take the top off it's not an
exact<00:01:46.890> science<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> idea

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.390 

boom<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:57.130> that<00:01:57.400> easy

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
boom it's that easy

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.990 
boom it's that easy
okay<00:02:00.400> now<00:02:01.120> we<00:02:02.110> got<00:02:02.260> the<00:02:02.440> bottom<00:02:02.770> off<00:02:02.920> we<00:02:03.820> got

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
okay now we got the bottom off we got

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.300 
okay now we got the bottom off we got
the<00:02:04.120> top<00:02:04.330> off<00:02:04.630> time<00:02:05.620> to<00:02:05.740> go<00:02:05.860> for<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.130> middle

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
the top off time to go for the middle

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.790 
the top off time to go for the middle
section<00:02:06.610> this<00:02:07.510> does<00:02:07.870> have<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.320> be<00:02:08.440> measured

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
section this does have to be measured

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.830 
section this does have to be measured
this<00:02:08.950> middle<00:02:09.220> section<00:02:09.400> here<00:02:09.760> so<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.720> can

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
this middle section here so you can

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.620 
this middle section here so you can
either<00:02:11.020> put<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:11.830> inside<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.670> mark<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.420> line

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
either put this inside and mark a line

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.860 
either put this inside and mark a line
or<00:02:14.220> because<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.400> know<00:02:15.460> that<00:02:15.820> it's<00:02:15.970> exactly<00:02:16.330> the

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
denatured alcohol that should be good

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.320 
denatured alcohol that should be good
and<00:06:49.240> we're<00:06:49.630> gonna<00:06:49.720> prime<00:06:50.140> it<00:06:50.910> by<00:06:51.910> getting<00:06:52.210> a

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
and we're gonna prime it by getting a

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.910 
and we're gonna prime it by getting a
little<00:06:52.600> bit<00:06:52.720> of<00:06:52.810> alcohol<00:06:53.430> look<00:06:54.430> on<00:06:54.790> the<00:06:55.000> wick
