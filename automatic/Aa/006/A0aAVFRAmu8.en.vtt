00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.849
 good afternoon my favorite viewers are not for 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.009
 no secret for me for example 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.490
 washing this gas stove here 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.920
 this is the surface of the eternal problem 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:24.300
 okay, I can handle it somehow 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.880
 here these lattices are visible yes and to me here on 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.160
 work prompted one way today 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.309
 I want to show you this way 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.590
 and see it work it doesn't work and 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.860
 if it works then you are happy 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.520
 you can take notes too 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.570
 let's start need to take regular soda 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:52.469
 and make her have mush that is soak 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:58.739
 some little water so she grates and find out 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:02.910
 what's the point of what this mixture needs 100 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:06.110
 water applied on the grid and leave on 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.240
 40 minutes for these places and then 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.590
 after 40 minutes to grind 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.570
 and for a minute everything will be clean I don’t know how 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.130
 it works but today we 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.070
 show yes yes no no here 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.970
 made such mush 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:32.240
 place left circuit 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:37.110
 later after 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.369
 while she wore everything on the bars of me 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.760
 here everything is given 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.119
 by noon yes you know awesome she 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.900
 cleans all this surface 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:55.830
 pollution should find the usual signet 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:58.050
 without effort without such here with the help of another 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.770
 this is katerina excuse me for me 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.350
 a pun here that is and you need even a brush 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.090
 all you saw to what condition she 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:15.120
 We were gorgeous on us in general all the edges you 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:20.070
 even without effort even without what i can 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.530
 Balde said about the effect of a beggar I do not even 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.580
 I thought that soda can wash everything like that 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.730
 what look yes what effect on the floor 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.989
 wenonah washes no need 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.910
 pemolux and take no on 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.250
 note 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.510
 well what's left is just to grind and 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.959
 cloth to remove 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.049
 look to the fleet 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.670
 any effort totaling 90 whom I certainly don’t 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.549
 knew 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.980
 Be sure to take note and through 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:58.239
 some time remake come show 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.239
 what happened to her I 'm sorry not the plate 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:05.590
 to the grid that we left at 40 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:09.150
 minutes what then is time to go to 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.030
 the lattice stood on me practically 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:22.930
 Has dried up and now as not told need 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:28.900
 it is slightly brushed and as if 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:34.599
 all the dirt will go away together soda now it's me 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:36.930
 will do and after that show you was going on in 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:41.069
 During gone and what 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.099
 actually rubbed a minute probably 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:47.799
 It was necessary to clear the soda and 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:51.609
 You know, I'm stunned, probably not 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.769
 the word for this result is just when 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.799
 I washed it yes I looked Murakami there 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.500
 so much dirt by the way I will immediately say that she 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.169
 i'm running here of course me never 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.680
 It was not launched but the lattice belonged 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:07.930
 so of course you can make it all noise 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.489
 they don't have that smell she can't 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.680
 be sure to air and you 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:16.959
 you start choking from here at 1 1 1 and 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.350
 everyone knows slices just fast and very 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.150
 cheap and 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.020
 I think you know what if you do not run 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.990
 then this method 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.130
 there are even 40 minutes we do not have to wait 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.590
 there not through here you can just 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:37.490
 rinse there a little brush and 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.680
 all right everything let's write me if u 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.230
 do you have any interesting secrets 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.230
 Thank you all for your attention. Bye bye.
