you<00:03:45.150> know<00:03:45.240> III<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:47.010> past<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.490> see<00:03:47.640> there

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
you know III in the past you see there

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.990 
you know III in the past you see there
was<00:03:47.910> just<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.240> stopcock<00:03:48.510> out<00:03:48.870> there<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:50.000> I

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
was just a stopcock out there and I

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.310 
was just a stopcock out there and I
can't<00:03:51.540> see<00:03:51.690> how<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:51.840> would<00:03:52.050> have<00:03:52.170> been

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
can't see how that would have been

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.760 
can't see how that would have been
possible<00:03:52.790> because<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.690> stopcock<00:03:55.140> was<00:03:55.500> sealed

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
possible because the stopcock was sealed

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.960 
possible because the stopcock was sealed
that<00:03:56.310> there<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:57.060> not<00:03:57.360> sealed<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:58.790> no<00:03:59.790> they

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
that there is not sealed and no they

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.250 
that there is not sealed and no they
they<00:04:00.000> are<00:04:00.300> correct<00:04:00.600> that<00:04:01.110> is<00:04:03.020> that's<00:04:04.020> it

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
they are correct that is that's it

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.440 
they are correct that is that's it
that's<00:04:04.470> an<00:04:04.770> open<00:04:05.600> dangerous<00:04:06.860> situation<00:04:07.860> that

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
that's an open dangerous situation that

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.180 
that's an open dangerous situation that
is<00:04:09.450> putting<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.140> your<00:04:10.200> entire<00:04:10.470> family<00:04:10.680> at
