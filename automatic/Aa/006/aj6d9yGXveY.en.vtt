can<00:05:28.600> push<00:05:28.840> it<00:05:29.050> you<00:05:29.140> don't<00:05:29.380> get<00:05:29.560> that<00:05:29.740> much

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
can push it you don't get that much

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.180 
can push it you don't get that much
detail<00:05:30.430> now<00:05:30.460> right<00:05:31.360> just<00:05:31.630> look<00:05:31.960> in<00:05:32.200> you<00:05:33.040> can

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
detail now right just look in you can

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.860 
detail now right just look in you can
see<00:05:33.340> like<00:05:33.520> you<00:05:33.640> play<00:05:33.820> with<00:05:33.970> darts<00:05:34.390> and<00:05:34.570> get<00:05:34.780> all

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
see like you play with darts and get all

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.110 
see like you play with darts and get all
the<00:05:34.990> pistol<00:05:35.440> me<00:05:36.310> you<00:05:36.490> don't<00:05:36.670> get<00:05:36.880> stuff<00:05:37.090> like

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
the pistol me you don't get stuff like

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.090 
the pistol me you don't get stuff like
that<00:05:37.480> now<00:05:37.690> in<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.050> new<00:05:38.290> Bionicles

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
that now in the new Bionicles

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:46.860 
that now in the new Bionicles
so<00:05:39.790> that<00:05:40.030> is<00:05:43.410> how<00:05:44.410> you<00:05:44.440> can<00:05:44.830> see<00:05:45.070> we<00:05:45.760> have<00:05:45.880> got<00:05:46.120> a

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
so that is how you can see we have got a

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.050 
so that is how you can see we have got a
really<00:05:47.169> strange<00:05:47.620> mask<00:05:48.610> because<00:05:48.880> obviously

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
really strange mask because obviously

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.290 
really strange mask because obviously
the<00:05:49.450> Amika<00:05:49.660> do<00:05:50.020> have<00:05:50.260> organic<00:05:50.770> masks<00:05:51.610> organic

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
the Amika do have organic masks organic

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.950 
the Amika do have organic masks organic
cannoli<00:05:52.630> mass<00:05:52.980> that<00:05:53.980> is<00:05:54.130> why<00:05:54.340> they<00:05:54.700> are

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
cannoli mass that is why they are

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.610 
cannoli mass that is why they are
strange<00:05:55.960> and<00:05:56.230> in<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:57.070> para<00:05:57.310> is<00:05:57.610> no<00:05:57.730> exception

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
strange and in the para is no exception

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.800 
strange and in the para is no exception
to<00:05:59.620> say<00:05:59.770> this<00:05:59.919> is<00:06:00.040> a<00:06:00.070> musk<00:06:00.340> of<00:06:00.550> flight<00:06:01.030> that<00:06:01.780> is

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
to say this is a musk of flight that is

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.560 
to say this is a musk of flight that is
pretty<00:06:02.260> strange<00:06:02.800> it's<00:06:03.669> really<00:06:04.000> nice<00:06:04.210> and<00:06:04.510> I

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
pretty strange it's really nice and I

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.320 
pretty strange it's really nice and I
really<00:06:04.600> like<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.230> unique<00:06:05.440> Ahead's

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
really like the unique Ahead's

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.290 
really like the unique Ahead's
underneath<00:06:07.330> because<00:06:07.860> because<00:06:08.860> of<00:06:08.890> the

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
underneath because because of the

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.659 
underneath because because of the
simplicity<00:06:10.300> of<00:06:10.600> it<00:06:10.930> you<00:06:11.500> you<00:06:12.130> don't<00:06:12.400> really

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
simplicity of it you you don't really

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:13.800 
simplicity of it you you don't really
have<00:06:12.880> to<00:06:13.060> fail<00:06:13.300> you

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
have to fail you

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.840 
have to fail you
you<00:06:14.140> just<00:06:14.320> have<00:06:14.440> to<00:06:14.470> design<00:06:14.950> a<00:06:14.980> mask<00:06:15.340> so<00:06:15.700> go

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
you just have to design a mask so go

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.240 
you just have to design a mask so go
over<00:06:16.180> it<00:06:16.300> and<00:06:16.590> that's<00:06:17.590> pretty<00:06:17.770> much<00:06:17.890> all<00:06:18.130> you

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
over it and that's pretty much all you

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.890 
over it and that's pretty much all you
need<00:06:18.280> to<00:06:18.520> do<00:06:18.700> to<00:06:18.880> get<00:06:19.030> this<00:06:19.180> to<00:06:19.360> look<00:06:19.540> good

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
need to do to get this to look good

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.140 
need to do to get this to look good
because<00:06:20.200> of<00:06:20.440> the<00:06:20.560> simplicity<00:06:21.340> of<00:06:21.640> the<00:06:21.850> head

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
because of the simplicity of the head

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.510 
because of the simplicity of the head
underneath<00:06:23.080> and<00:06:23.500> as<00:06:23.830> you<00:06:23.919> can<00:06:24.010> see<00:06:24.070> the<00:06:24.370> lots

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
underneath and as you can see the lots

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.909 
underneath and as you can see the lots
of<00:06:24.669> spikes<00:06:25.030> ER<00:06:25.330> and<00:06:25.930> overall<00:06:26.260> it<00:06:26.530> just<00:06:26.560> look

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
of spikes ER and overall it just look

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.070 
of spikes ER and overall it just look
good<00:06:27.160> and<00:06:27.400> it<00:06:27.850> is<00:06:27.970> just<00:06:28.180> a<00:06:28.270> classic<00:06:28.419> must<00:06:28.900> you

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
good and it is just a classic must you

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.560 
good and it is just a classic must you
remember<00:06:29.440> in<00:06:29.500> Atari<00:06:29.770> for<00:06:30.100> an<00:06:30.880> alleged<00:06:31.180> to<00:06:31.330> see

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
this piece here and it can turn around

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.250 
this piece here and it can turn around
and<00:06:39.100> has<00:06:39.370> got<00:06:39.520> yellow<00:06:39.910> zombies<00:06:40.479> in<00:06:40.690> it<00:06:40.780> even

shoot them out
five<00:07:00.520> and<00:07:01.520> sometimes<00:07:02.330> you<00:07:02.840> can<00:07:03.080> knock<00:07:04.040> one<00:07:04.310> out

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:04.760 
five and sometimes you can knock one out

and<00:07:16.070> just<00:07:16.850> really<00:07:17.480> like<00:07:18.230> so<00:07:18.850> I'm<00:07:19.850> good<00:07:20.090> that<00:07:20.360> is

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:20.480 
and just really like so I'm good that is

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.080 
and just really like so I'm good that is
basically<00:07:21.170> it<00:07:21.650> for<00:07:21.680> power<00:07:22.370> and<00:07:22.670> you<00:07:22.760> can<00:07:22.940> be

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.090 
basically it for power and you can be

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.140 
basically it for power and you can be
power<00:07:23.440> so<00:07:24.440> now<00:07:24.590> I<00:07:24.620> roll<00:07:25.130> I'm<00:07:25.490> doing<00:07:25.730> ratings

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.150 
power so now I roll I'm doing ratings

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.900 
power so now I roll I'm doing ratings
for<00:07:26.510> this<00:07:26.720> set<00:07:27.170> and<00:07:27.350> what<00:07:27.500> I<00:07:27.530> think<00:07:27.980> definitely

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:28.910 
for this set and what I think definitely
