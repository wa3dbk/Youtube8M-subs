my<00:00:22.680> first<00:00:22.920> experience<00:00:23.070> with<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> mold<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.180> I

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
my first experience with the mold and I

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.960 
my first experience with the mold and I
am<00:00:24.420> pleasantly<00:00:24.960> surprised<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.279> thought<00:00:26.880> it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
am pleasantly surprised I thought it

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.060 
am pleasantly surprised I thought it
looked<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.210> bit<00:00:27.240> simplistic<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:28.140> pictures<00:00:28.680> but

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
looked a bit simplistic in pictures but

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.800 
looked a bit simplistic in pictures but
you<00:00:29.220> know<00:00:29.369> what<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.910> simplicity<00:00:30.330> actually

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
you know what that simplicity actually

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.260 
you know what that simplicity actually
adds<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.590> quite<00:00:31.890> significantly<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.880> both

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
adds to it quite significantly in both

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.299 
adds to it quite significantly in both
its<00:00:33.540> transformation<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.950> overall

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
its transformation and the overall

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.060 
its transformation and the overall
aesthetic<00:00:35.840> color<00:00:36.840> wise<00:00:37.200> obviously<00:00:37.920> its

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
aesthetic color wise obviously its

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.100 
aesthetic color wise obviously its
Ironhide<00:00:38.820> therefore<00:00:39.420> he's<00:00:39.570> going<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.809> be<00:00:39.899> red

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
Ironhide therefore he's going to be red

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.930 
Ironhide therefore he's going to be red
but<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> red<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.829> lot<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.340> people<00:00:41.670> pointed

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
but the red is a lot of people pointed

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.580 
but the red is a lot of people pointed
out<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:42.270> really<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.660> red<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.079> more<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.379> red

the only metallic on this is actually in
dark<00:02:11.910> silver<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:13.170> that's<00:02:13.319> something<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.680> come

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
dark silver and that's something I come

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.860 
dark silver and that's something I come
to<00:02:14.370> later<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:14.910> well<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.180> another<00:02:15.480> little

to later on as well is another little
minor<00:02:16.080> gripe<00:02:16.440> about<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.920> toy<00:02:17.540> but<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.720> seems

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
minor gripe about the toy but it seems

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.110 
minor gripe about the toy but it seems
weird<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.610> Dewey's<00:02:20.610> are<00:02:20.730> in<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.910> bronze

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
weird that Dewey's are in the bronze

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.490 
weird that Dewey's are in the bronze
whether<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.390> saw<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.750> dark<00:02:21.959> silver<00:02:22.170> moon

representation of Ironhide in the in the
animated<00:04:00.780> show<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:02.220> know<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:02.760> mold

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
animated show and I know that the mold

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.970 
animated show and I know that the mold
was<00:04:03.359> originally<00:04:03.810> designed<00:04:04.140> for<00:04:04.410> ratchet<00:04:04.859> but

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
was originally designed for ratchet but

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.530 
was originally designed for ratchet but
for<00:04:05.130> some<00:04:05.250> reason<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.579> works<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.209> well<00:04:06.239> with

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
for some reason it works so well with

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.970 
for some reason it works so well with
Ironhide<00:04:07.200> obviously<00:04:07.530> they<00:04:07.650> share<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:07.950> same

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
Ironhide obviously they share the same

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.860

protoform<00:04:08.700> in<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.000> show<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:09.510> this<00:04:09.660> earned

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
protoform in the show so this earned

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.539 
protoform in the show so this earned
shared<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.320> same<00:04:10.470> character<00:04:10.859> model<00:04:11.100> but<00:04:11.489> he

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
shared the same character model but he

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.460 
shared the same character model but he
just<00:04:11.760> seemed<00:04:11.880> so<00:04:12.060> much<00:04:12.120> chunkier<00:04:12.600> around<00:04:13.290> the

do the electrolysis thingies um the

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.770 
do the electrolysis thingies um the
storage<00:05:19.920> for<00:05:20.400> it<00:05:20.520> works<00:05:20.700> just<00:05:20.940> as<00:05:21.060> well<00:05:21.090> in<00:05:21.570> a

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
storage for it works just as well in a

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.420 
storage for it works just as well in a
robot<00:05:22.140> mode<00:05:22.290> messy<00:05:22.500> serves<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.950> fill<00:05:23.100> in<00:05:23.220> make

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
robot mode messy serves to fill in make

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.940 
robot mode messy serves to fill in make
it<00:05:23.610> a<00:05:23.730> bit<00:05:23.910> more<00:05:23.940> solid<00:05:24.240> backpack<00:05:24.890> they<00:05:25.890> do

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
it a bit more solid backpack they do

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.590 
it a bit more solid backpack they do
clip<00:05:26.280> onto<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.610> hands<00:05:26.970> it's<00:05:27.120> completely

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
clip onto the hands it's completely

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.210 
clip onto the hands it's completely
pointless<00:05:27.750> for<00:05:28.050> Ironhide<00:05:28.440> you<00:05:28.890> know<00:05:29.010> it<00:05:29.100> does

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
pointless for Ironhide you know it does

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.530 
pointless for Ironhide you know it does
kind<00:05:29.430> of<00:05:29.490> look<00:05:29.580> like<00:05:29.640> knuckle<00:05:30.060> dusters<00:05:30.390> which

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
kind of look like knuckle dusters which

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.560 
kind of look like knuckle dusters which
is<00:05:30.720> quite<00:05:30.990> nice<00:05:31.260> um<00:05:31.830> well<00:05:32.580> going<00:05:33.180> round<00:05:33.390> the

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
is quite nice um well going round the

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.020 
is quite nice um well going round the
back<00:05:33.720> as<00:05:34.200> we<00:05:34.410> have<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:35.070> kibble<00:05:35.400> is<00:05:35.580> obviously

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
back as we have the kibble is obviously

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.790 
back as we have the kibble is obviously
the<00:05:36.240> entire<00:05:36.540> top<00:05:36.750> of<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:36.870> car<00:05:37.110> and<00:05:37.350> it<00:05:37.650> does

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
the entire top of the car and it does

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.100 
the entire top of the car and it does
come<00:05:38.010> across<00:05:38.310> as<00:05:38.520> a<00:05:38.880> little<00:05:39.060> bit<00:05:39.390> backpaki

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
come across as a little bit backpaki

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.230 
come across as a little bit backpaki
but<00:05:40.560> again<00:05:40.980> it<00:05:41.100> just<00:05:41.280> heightened<00:05:41.610> just<00:05:42.000> pokes

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
but again it just heightened just pokes

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.300 
but again it just heightened just pokes
up<00:05:42.480> and<00:05:42.750> works<00:05:43.230> well<00:05:43.440> with<00:05:43.590> these<00:05:43.710> higher

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
up and works well with these higher

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.040 
up and works well with these higher
shoulder<00:05:44.940> areas<00:05:45.240> as<00:05:45.360> well<00:05:45.480> so<00:05:45.690> just<00:05:45.720> give<00:05:46.020> a

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
shoulder areas as well so just give a

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.680 
shoulder areas as well so just give a
more<00:05:46.290> rounded<00:05:46.980> largeness<00:05:47.790> to<00:05:48.150> his<00:05:48.270> upper<00:05:48.540> body

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
more rounded largeness to his upper body

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.330 
more rounded largeness to his upper body
and<00:05:49.230> one<00:05:49.530> of<00:05:49.650> my<00:05:49.770> gripes<00:05:50.040> that<00:05:50.190> are

there<00:06:06.390> they're<00:06:07.230> painted<00:06:07.620> and<00:06:07.800> it'd<00:06:08.340> be<00:06:08.460> really

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
there they're painted and it'd be really

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.920 
there they're painted and it'd be really
nice<00:06:08.760> if<00:06:08.850> that<00:06:09.030> had<00:06:09.120> been<00:06:09.150> filled<00:06:09.480> in<00:06:09.690> I<00:06:09.810> know

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
nice if that had been filled in I know

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.150 
nice if that had been filled in I know
it's<00:06:10.080> only<00:06:10.140> a<00:06:10.230> minor<00:06:10.440> detail<00:06:10.740> but<00:06:10.890> it<00:06:10.950> does

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
it's only a minor detail but it does

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.370 
it's only a minor detail but it does
show<00:06:11.190> up<00:06:11.640> in<00:06:11.880> the<00:06:12.090> toys<00:06:12.330> robot<00:06:12.660> mode<00:06:12.810> so<00:06:13.230> why

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
show up in the toys robot mode so why

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.480 
show up in the toys robot mode so why
not<00:06:13.440> just<00:06:13.620> go<00:06:13.770> to<00:06:13.830> that<00:06:13.950> eggs<00:06:14.160> for<00:06:14.310> a<00:06:14.340> little

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
not just go to that eggs for a little

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.460 
not just go to that eggs for a little
bit<00:06:14.610> of<00:06:14.670> length<00:06:14.790> and<00:06:15.030> actually<00:06:15.360> fill<00:06:16.170> in<00:06:16.350> the

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
bit of length and actually fill in the

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.410 
bit of length and actually fill in the
gap<00:06:16.650> as<00:06:16.890> it<00:06:17.010> were<00:06:17.100> it<00:06:17.520> would<00:06:17.580> have<00:06:17.790> been<00:06:17.910> nice

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420 
gap as it were it would have been nice

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.300 
gap as it were it would have been nice
completely<00:06:18.930> unnecessary<00:06:19.080> of<00:06:19.800> course<00:06:20.040> but

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
completely unnecessary of course but

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.280 
completely unnecessary of course but
really<00:06:20.520> would<00:06:21.060> have<00:06:21.120> been<00:06:21.180> a<00:06:21.330> nice<00:06:21.480> touch

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
really would have been a nice touch

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.500 
really would have been a nice touch
would<00:06:22.710> have<00:06:22.800> just<00:06:22.950> added<00:06:23.580> something<00:06:23.910> more<00:06:24.240> to

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
would have just added something more to

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.480 
would have just added something more to
it<00:06:24.540> I<00:06:24.810> mean<00:06:25.050> as<00:06:25.380> an<00:06:25.680> overall<00:06:25.950> figure<00:06:26.310> he<00:06:26.460> is

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
it I mean as an overall figure he is

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.360 
it I mean as an overall figure he is
fantastic<00:06:26.790> as<00:06:27.780> possibly<00:06:28.440> the<00:06:28.530> last<00:06:28.830> addition

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
fantastic as possibly the last addition

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.580 
fantastic as possibly the last addition
to<00:06:29.550> the<00:06:29.730> us<00:06:30.180> animated<00:06:30.660> line<00:06:30.990> along<00:06:31.320> with

to the us animated line along with
Rodimus<00:06:32.510> he<00:06:33.510> is<00:06:33.990> pretty<00:06:34.710> much<00:06:34.889> perfect<00:06:35.160> in

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
Rodimus he is pretty much perfect in

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.210 
Rodimus he is pretty much perfect in
that<00:06:35.760> sense<00:06:36.180> I<00:06:36.419> absolutely<00:06:37.139> adore<00:06:37.770> him

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
that sense I absolutely adore him

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.300
