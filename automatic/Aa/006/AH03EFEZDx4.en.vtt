00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.049
 last Wednesday, April 23 the 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.730
 driver of a bus on route 205 was 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.070
 the protagonist of a multiple accident 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.260
 on the new highway the jets 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.410
 after presenting faults in the system of 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.970
 brakes and driving at excessive speed 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.310
 leaving as a result more than 20 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.650
 people wounded since then and 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.570
 making use of technology agents 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.460
 the transit sub-directorate have 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.839
 increased speed controls 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.210
 on this road 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.130
 the purpose is to fine drivers 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.930
 that exceed the limit we are 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.570
 applying the lasers because the speed 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.060
 maximum allowed in the jet is 60 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.640
 kilometers per hour this is indicated 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.110
 laser was brought from the usa and it's 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.930
 able to detect long distance 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.020
 when a driver exceeds his speed 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.900
 this device is new that this has come 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.270
 last year barely but if we were 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.310
 using the other laser device 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.220
 earlier we have more or less 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.010
 about 6 years are using lasers and 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.250
 throw a red dot at the laser point 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.550
 If you place it high 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.200
 the vehicle you want to grab 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.330
 example lead to his command this has a 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.030
 range of 600 meters more than half 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.250
 kilometer for example the vehicle the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.860
 white minibus that in there comes to 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.050
 69 kilometers per hour I grab one 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.800
 distance from the point that we have 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.080
 from beni to 291 meters that what there is of 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.940
 here away until there for now 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.910
 There are several drivers that have been 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.470
 mounted with the help of this device 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.570
 because we have stopped it is because you 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.580
 it is circulating at a higher speed than 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.500
 The regulatory regulation is a 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.090
 general transit regulation of 90 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.600
 kilometers per hour however until the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.470
 sign there this restriction 70 kilometers 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.030
 per hour 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.619
 apart from that you do not use the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.630
 seatbelt therefore you will be 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.960
 going to put up with infractions does not mark the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.940
 speedometer nothing else belt are 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.910
 ruined the fine by driving to 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.910
 excessive speed amounts to 57 dollars 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.520
 with 14 cents while not using 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.119
 the safety belt reaches 34 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.040
 dollars with 29 cents was sold in a 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.260
 speed not allowed but excessive 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.450
 speed is not possible if the 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.190
 speed is more than 100 the new 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.959
 jetway of the jets is also 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.750
 loans for false accident alarms 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.570
 like 9 45 in the morning of the day of 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.120
 today we receive an emergency call 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.830
 to our operations a 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.680
 traffic accident of two buses 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.959
 in which we were informed that one of 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.150
 they were carrying 80 students of a 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.459
 institute were mobilized five 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.280
 red cross ambulances plus equipment 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.410
 rescue red cross to the place 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.400
 traveling the entire road of the 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.270
 jets to the edges and indeed 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.730
 monitoring the area we do not find 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.270
 no accident for the police 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.310
 civilian national the excessive speed 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.380
 of the main causes of accidents 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.330
 of transit it is important that 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.280
 drivers respect the limit of 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.500
 speed factor that has so far 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.660
 unleashed two large accidents 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.180
 magnitude in the new highway the 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.330
 jets for the newscast silvia
