then<00:02:18.739> let's<00:02:18.950> say<00:02:19.130> like<00:02:19.400> these<00:02:19.700> because<00:02:20.150> if<00:02:20.480> you

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
then let's say like these because if you

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.960 
then let's say like these because if you
do<00:02:20.750> fall<00:02:20.959> off<00:02:20.989> your<00:02:21.200> bike<00:02:21.370> it's<00:02:22.370> always<00:02:22.610> safer

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
do fall off your bike it's always safer

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.000 
do fall off your bike it's always safer

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
for these to pull apart rather than

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.979 
for these to pull apart rather than
being<00:02:25.190> screwed<00:02:25.519> together<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:26.300> way<00:02:26.480> you're

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.920 
high also low medium high and if we hold
it<00:02:50.660> will<00:02:51.650> go<00:02:51.830> into<00:02:52.360> flashing<00:02:53.360> mode<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:56.660> again

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
it will go into flashing mode so again

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.100 
it will go into flashing mode so again
it<00:02:57.170> turns<00:02:57.440> off<00:02:58.480> what's<00:02:59.480> your<00:02:59.720> going<00:03:00.049> through

back through the modes again and it kind

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.910 
back through the modes again and it kind
of<00:03:17.329> just<00:03:17.540> pulls<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.930> little<00:03:18.049> bit<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.440> enjoyment

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.630 
least this is actually built very well
it's<00:03:29.090> built<00:03:29.299> a<00:03:29.329> lot<00:03:29.510> better<00:03:29.720> than<00:03:29.930> me<00:03:30.079> the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
it's built a lot better than me the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.069 
it's built a lot better than me the
ending<00:03:31.640> light<00:03:31.910> which<00:03:32.120> I've<00:03:32.510> also<00:03:32.720> just

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
ending light which I've also just

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.979 
ending light which I've also just
reviewed<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.910> again<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.209> mounts<00:03:35.569> onto<00:03:35.750> the

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
reviewed and again it mounts onto the

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.650 
reviewed and again it mounts onto the
basket<00:03:36.440> very<00:03:36.470> much<00:03:36.859> to<00:03:36.980> stay<00:03:37.190> away<00:03:37.630> we<00:03:38.630> just

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
basket very much to stay away we just

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.250 
basket very much to stay away we just
hook<00:03:39.079> on<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.319> o-ring<00:03:39.620> on<00:03:39.739> there<00:03:43.870> we<00:03:44.870> grab<00:03:45.109> our

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
hook on the o-ring on there we grab our

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
hook on the o-ring on there we grab our
bars<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:46.630> pull<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.780> round<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:48.769> snaps<00:03:49.069> in

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
bars and pull that round and it snaps in

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.789 
bars and pull that round and it snaps in
place<00:03:49.389> it's<00:03:50.389> a<00:03:50.420> very<00:03:50.630> simple<00:03:50.870> mounting<00:03:51.170> very

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
place it's a very simple mounting very

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.030 
place it's a very simple mounting very
much<00:03:51.920> like<00:03:52.100> all<00:03:52.280> these<00:03:52.549> lights<00:03:52.850> do<00:03:53.090> nowadays

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
much like all these lights do nowadays

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
much like all these lights do nowadays
so<00:03:55.040> that's<00:03:55.190> about<00:03:55.310> it<00:03:55.549> really<00:03:55.700> there's

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
so that's about it really there's

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.400 
so that's about it really there's
nothing<00:03:56.329> really<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.720> report<00:03:56.750> about<00:03:57.200> this
