00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.750 
you guys want to make sure you guys jump
over<00:01:38.350> because<00:01:38.590> if<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:38.830> guys<00:01:38.980> jump<00:01:39.370> into<00:01:39.550> this

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
over because if you guys jump into this

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.180 
over because if you guys jump into this
glitch<00:01:40.120> area<00:01:40.570> where<00:01:40.810> there<00:01:40.930> is<00:01:41.050> no<00:01:41.230> floor<00:01:41.560> yes

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
glitch area where there is no floor yes

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.740 
glitch area where there is no floor yes
will<00:01:42.400> fall<00:01:42.640> underneath<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.240> map<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.660> then

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
will fall underneath the map and then

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.660 
will fall underneath the map and then
spawn<00:01:44.110> back<00:01:44.410> on<00:01:44.620> top<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.070> that's<00:01:45.250> one<00:01:45.460> way<00:01:45.490> of

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
spawn back on top so that's one way of

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.300 
spawn back on top so that's one way of
getting<00:01:46.210> out<00:01:46.600> of<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.870> split<00:01:47.110> so<00:01:47.980> basically

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
getting out of the split so basically

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.100 
getting out of the split so basically
when<00:01:48.460> you<00:01:48.520> guys<00:01:48.610> jump<00:01:48.970> over<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.360> platform<00:01:49.960> you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
when you guys jump over the platform you

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.930 
when you guys jump over the platform you
guys<00:01:50.290> will<00:01:50.500> come<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.040> further<00:01:51.340> part<00:01:51.730> on

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
guys will come to the further part on

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.790 
guys will come to the further part on
the<00:01:52.420> secret<00:01:52.720> room<00:01:52.900> now<00:01:53.080> out<00:01:53.260> of<00:01:53.290> these<00:01:53.470> walls

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
the secret room now out of these walls

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.160 
the secret room now out of these walls
you<00:01:53.980> guys<00:01:54.160> cannot<00:01:54.520> actually<00:01:54.790> shoot<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:56.020> guys

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
you guys cannot actually shoot you guys

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.800 
you guys cannot actually shoot you guys
could<00:01:56.440> only<00:01:56.650> shoot<00:01:57.130> where<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:58.090> guys<00:01:58.300> were<00:01:58.540> in

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
could only shoot where you guys were in

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.840 
could only shoot where you guys were in
the<00:01:58.900> beginning<00:01:59.080> so<00:01:59.770> just<00:02:00.010> stay<00:02:00.190> by<00:02:00.400> this<00:02:00.580> spot

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
the beginning so just stay by this spot

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.820 
the beginning so just stay by this spot
where<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.180> guys<00:02:01.360> went<00:02:01.810> into<00:02:02.380> when<00:02:02.620> you<00:02:02.650> guys

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
where you guys went into when you guys

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.290 
where you guys went into when you guys
got<00:02:03.100> into<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.460> glitch<00:02:03.700> right<00:02:03.880> over<00:02:04.090> here

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
got into the glitch right over here

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.730 
got into the glitch right over here
where<00:02:04.480> I<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.780> guys<00:02:04.900> could<00:02:05.110> shoot<00:02:05.350> this

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
where I and you guys could shoot this

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.770 
where I and you guys could shoot this
wall<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.280> through<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.150> wall<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.660> right

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
wall and through the wall to the right

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.990 
wall and through the wall to the right
when<00:02:08.200> I<00:02:08.289> come<00:02:08.319> closer<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:09.519> this<00:02:09.640> is<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.789> good

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
when I come closer so this is a good

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.590 
when I come closer so this is a good
spot<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.300> stand<00:02:10.869> right<00:02:11.170> over<00:02:11.200> here

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
spot to stand right over here

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.630 
spot to stand right over here
there's<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.200> lot<00:02:12.350> of<00:02:12.380> spot<00:02:12.710> space<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.520> move

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
there's a lot of spot space to move

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.210 
there's a lot of spot space to move
around<00:02:13.700> very<00:02:14.330> easy<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:15.140> kill<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.470> cops<00:02:15.680> now

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
around very easy to kill the cops now

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.190 
around very easy to kill the cops now
you<00:02:16.280> guys<00:02:16.550> could<00:02:16.790> also<00:02:17.000> keep<00:02:17.420> moving<00:02:17.960> down

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
you guys could also keep moving down

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.900 
you guys could also keep moving down
over<00:02:18.650> here<00:02:18.860> it's<00:02:19.100> pretty<00:02:19.250> awesome<00:02:19.490> but<00:02:19.820> the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
over here it's pretty awesome but the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.160 
over here it's pretty awesome but the
only<00:02:20.030> downside<00:02:20.510> is<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:20.750> guys<00:02:20.900> cannot

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
only downside is you guys cannot

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.840 
only downside is you guys cannot
actually<00:02:21.380> shoot<00:02:21.680> at<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.950> wall<00:02:22.160> which<00:02:22.640> pretty

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
actually shoot at the wall which pretty

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.100 
actually shoot at the wall which pretty
much<00:02:22.940> sucks<00:02:23.360> because<00:02:23.480> if<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.750> guys<00:02:23.930> could

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
much sucks because if you guys could

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.810 
much sucks because if you guys could
move<00:02:24.290> down<00:02:24.560> here<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:25.280> know<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.550> would<00:02:25.670> give

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
move down here you know it would give

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.060 
move down here you know it would give
you<00:02:26.000> like<00:02:26.210> more<00:02:26.720> space<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.470> kill<00:02:27.770> players

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
you like more space to kill players

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.280 
you like more space to kill players
online<00:02:28.370> like<00:02:28.910> wherever<00:02:29.120> they<00:02:29.450> are<00:02:29.480> but<00:02:30.170> the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
online like wherever they are but the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.990 
online like wherever they are but the
other<00:02:30.440> spot<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:31.010> pretty<00:02:31.250> crowded<00:02:31.490> with<00:02:31.850> people

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
other spot is pretty crowded with people

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.670 
other spot is pretty crowded with people
as<00:02:32.270> well<00:02:32.450> since<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.870> is<00:02:32.990> really<00:02:33.260> close<00:02:33.410> for

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
as well since it is really close for

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.800 
as well since it is really close for
santos<00:02:34.160> customs<00:02:34.190> but<00:02:35.150> i<00:02:35.270> just<00:02:35.480> wish<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:35.780> guys

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
get to shoot out the walls but

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.130 
get to shoot out the walls but
unfortunately<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:38.180> can't<00:02:38.480> could<00:02:38.780> only<00:02:38.900> shoot

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
unfortunately you can't could only shoot

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.590 
unfortunately you can't could only shoot
out<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.740> that<00:02:40.040> certain<00:02:40.400> area<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:41.210> basically

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
out of that certain area so basically

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.820 
out of that certain area so basically
when<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.780> guys<00:02:41.900> get<00:02:42.110> inside<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:42.560> glitch
