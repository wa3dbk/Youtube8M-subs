just this lovely kind of inclusion of
the<00:01:07.270> originals<00:01:07.990> but<00:01:08.649> then<00:01:08.860> it's<00:01:09.280> halfway

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
the originals but then it's halfway

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.980 
the originals but then it's halfway
through<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.820> movie<00:01:10.149> that<00:01:10.299> we<00:01:10.479> take<00:01:10.720> it<00:01:10.869> in

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
through the movie that we take it in

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.620 
through the movie that we take it in
this<00:01:11.110> entirely<00:01:11.500> new<00:01:11.680> direction<00:01:12.090> which<00:01:13.090> not

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
this entirely new direction which not

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.170 
this entirely new direction which not
only<00:01:13.659> takes<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:14.289> away<00:01:14.500> from<00:01:14.789> the<00:01:15.789> original

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
only takes it away from the original

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.850 
only takes it away from the original
storyline<00:01:16.690> but<00:01:17.020> it<00:01:17.110> kind<00:01:17.350> of<00:01:17.440> makes<00:01:17.710> it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
storyline but it kind of makes it

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.620 
storyline but it kind of makes it
incredibly<00:01:18.130> relevant<00:01:18.789> for<00:01:19.000> today<00:01:19.240> as<00:01:19.420> well

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
incredibly relevant for today as well

until we kind of really meet her so the

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.859 
until we kind of really meet her so the
relationship<00:01:53.200> that<00:01:53.320> they<00:01:53.530> have<00:01:53.830> is<00:01:54.630> very<00:01:55.630> much

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
relationship that they have is very much

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.430 
relationship that they have is very much
a<00:01:55.899> father-daughter<00:01:56.530> relationship<00:01:57.220> but

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
a father-daughter relationship but

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.810 
a father-daughter relationship but
within<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.619> confines<00:01:59.950> of<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.220> fact<00:02:00.399> that<00:02:00.490> he

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
within the confines of the fact that he

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.429 
within the confines of the fact that he
is<00:02:01.000> not<00:02:01.660> a<00:02:01.929> human

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.790 

not<00:02:06.009> only<00:02:06.219> is<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.369> his<00:02:06.640> mission<00:02:06.909> to<00:02:07.800> always

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
not only is it his mission to always

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.830 
not only is it his mission to always
protect<00:02:09.160> Sarah<00:02:09.489> Connor<00:02:09.580> but<00:02:10.479> I<00:02:10.509> think<00:02:10.750> it

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
protect Sarah Connor but I think it

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.470 
protect Sarah Connor but I think it
becomes<00:02:11.200> his<00:02:11.470> duty<00:02:11.890> as<00:02:12.069> an<00:02:12.730> individual<00:02:13.300> as

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
becomes his duty as an individual as

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.190 
becomes his duty as an individual as
well<00:02:13.769> so<00:02:14.769> um<00:02:15.180> yeah<00:02:16.180> Guardian<00:02:16.660> is<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.930> only
