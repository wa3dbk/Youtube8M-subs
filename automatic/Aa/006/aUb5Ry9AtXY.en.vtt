mistake Ben Gibbard often doesn't play

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.730 
mistake Ben Gibbard often doesn't play
the<00:00:14.400> last<00:00:14.580> string<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.330> his<00:00:15.599> songs<00:00:15.870> I'm<00:00:16.379> not

the last string of his songs I'm not

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.230 
the last string of his songs I'm not
sure<00:00:16.920> why<00:00:17.070> maybe<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.640> gives<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.970> clear

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
sure why maybe it gives it a clear

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.929 
sure why maybe it gives it a clear
simple<00:00:18.570> sound<00:00:18.990> but<00:00:19.949> an<00:00:20.010> example<00:00:20.460> would<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.609> a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
simple sound but an example would be a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.660 
simple sound but an example would be a
volume<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> dark<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:23.250> know<00:00:23.400> when<00:00:23.550> he's

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.240 
okay so I'll write the chords down of
course<00:01:22.300> but<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.410> first<00:01:23.650> one<00:01:23.920> is<00:01:24.100> G<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:27.100> just

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
course but the first one is G you just

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.350 
course but the first one is G you just
don't<00:01:27.430> play<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:27.550> left<00:01:27.850> string<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:31.030> next

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.480 
don't play that left string and the next
is<00:01:31.660> I<00:01:31.870> know<00:01:32.230> I<00:01:32.260> guess<00:01:32.500> f-sharp<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:36.130> chord<00:01:36.370> is

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
is I know I guess f-sharp the chord is

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.310 
is I know I guess f-sharp the chord is
to<00:01:36.850> block<00:01:37.480> open<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.970> open<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.210> when<00:01:41.170> you're

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
to block open to open and when you're

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.900 
to block open to open and when you're
here<00:01:41.620> I'd<00:01:41.800> hold<00:01:42.220> it<00:01:42.370> like<00:01:42.460> this<00:01:42.490> with<00:01:42.820> your

here I'd hold it like this with your

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.360 
here I'd hold it like this with your
middle<00:01:43.120> and<00:01:43.240> ring<00:01:43.330> finger<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:44.710> then<00:01:45.280> you're

middle and ring finger and then you're

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.250
