 that are all that gives this flavor 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.730
 that you milk 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.420
 or a little more sugar because I want 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.970
 that the cross is very sweet because the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.020
 cream if it's bitter and then we make a 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.870
 good balance 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.890

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.500
 to add the sugar and these remember that 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.020
 this a dessert that you without 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.540
 regrets 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.950
 a little bit of vanilla extract that 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.830
 I'm also leaving the extract of 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.190
 goya vanilla and a little juice 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:56.380

 lemon zest to give it a 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.190
 good combination we do not want to be 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.080
 mix arrives because chemically makes 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.810
 a very different effect we want it to be 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.360
 integrate the egg white together with the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.550
 sugar the cheese and it does as a baking 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.290
