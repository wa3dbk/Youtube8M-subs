00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.479 
problems he began experimenting with
more<00:02:07.750> solid<00:02:08.200> materials<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.920> get<00:02:09.069> a<00:02:09.099> cleaner

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
more solid materials to get a cleaner

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.790 
more solid materials to get a cleaner
sound<00:02:09.880> so<00:02:10.869> he<00:02:11.050> headed<00:02:11.290> for<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.620> railroad

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
sound so he headed for the railroad

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.820 
sound so he headed for the railroad
track<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.819> see<00:02:13.000> which<00:02:13.209> work<00:02:13.420> best<00:02:13.780> wood<00:02:14.380> or

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
steel how do you find out watch I live

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.050 
steel how do you find out watch I live
right<00:02:19.030> next<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.750> railroad<00:02:20.290> track<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:21.060> just

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
right next to a railroad track I just

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.330 
right next to a railroad track I just
