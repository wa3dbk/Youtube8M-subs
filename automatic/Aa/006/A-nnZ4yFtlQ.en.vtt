00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
dropped down here and have a look in

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.500 
dropped down here and have a look in
that<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.620> turns<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.100> these<00:00:50.250> are

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
that and it turns out that these are

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.119 
that and it turns out that these are
exacerbation<00:00:51.510> contracts<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.829> had<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> little

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
exacerbation contracts so I had a little

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.470 
exacerbation contracts so I had a little
look<00:00:53.309> around<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.910> turns<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.300> they

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
look around and it turns out that they

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.520 
look around and it turns out that they
have<00:00:54.660> no<00:00:54.899> story<00:00:55.770> real<00:00:56.390> thing<00:00:57.390> at<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.500> I

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
have no story real thing at all so I

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.229 
have no story real thing at all so I
think<00:00:58.620> I'm<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.949> give<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> go<00:00:59.340> see<00:01:00.180> how
