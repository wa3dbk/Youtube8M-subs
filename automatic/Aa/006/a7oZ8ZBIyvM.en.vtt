00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
mediocre territory because they don't

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.220 
mediocre territory because they don't
push<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> material<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.360> either<00:00:39.510> direction

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
is that Robert Downey jr. there's almost

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.039 
is that Robert Downey jr. there's almost
no<00:01:44.640> difference<00:01:45.060> between<00:01:45.180> him<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.659> real-life

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049

and<00:01:46.350> Tony<00:01:46.950> Stark<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.939> seems<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.450> have

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and Tony Stark it seems to have

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.149 
and Tony Stark it seems to have
developed<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:49.170> way<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.380> ever<00:01:49.740> thought<00:01:50.009> of

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
developed that way I ever thought of

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.399 
developed that way I ever thought of
Robert<00:01:50.430> Downey<00:01:50.520> jr.<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.540> until<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
Robert Downey jr. as that until the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.929 
Robert Downey jr. as that until the
first<00:01:52.619> Iron<00:01:52.799> Man<00:01:53.009> movie<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.610> seems<00:01:53.820> like

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
first Iron Man movie and it seems like

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.760 
first Iron Man movie and it seems like
he's<00:01:54.090> sort<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.509> real<00:01:54.720> life<00:01:54.960> morphed<00:01:55.500> into

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
he's sort of in real life morphed into

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.830 
he's sort of in real life morphed into
that<00:01:56.040> character<00:01:56.369> yeah<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.479> that's<00:01:57.659> what

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
that character yeah and that that's what

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.840 
that character yeah and that that's what
makes<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.079> fun<00:01:58.320> too<00:01:58.560> because<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.159> kind<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.490> it

Robert Downey jr. will return as Iron
Man<00:02:19.540> III<00:02:20.540> think<00:02:20.780> they<00:02:21.050> would<00:02:21.170> be<00:02:21.290> making<00:02:21.470> a

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
Man III think they would be making a

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.539 
Man III think they would be making a
huge<00:02:22.069> mistake<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.940> not<00:02:23.180> have<00:02:23.450> him<00:02:23.599> continue

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
huge mistake to not have him continue

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.559 
huge mistake to not have him continue
they'll<00:02:25.549> have<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.760> pay<00:02:25.910> out<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.030> ass<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.540> think

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
they'll have to pay out the ass I think

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.900 
they'll have to pay out the ass I think
at<00:02:26.870> this<00:02:26.989> point<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.680> don't<00:02:28.099> know<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.670> would

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
at this point I I don't know I would

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.550 
at this point I I don't know I would
guess<00:02:29.090> he<00:02:29.299> had<00:02:29.450> some<00:02:29.690> sort<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.959> a

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
guess he had some sort of a

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.110 
guess he had some sort of a
three-picture<00:02:31.160> deal

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
three-picture deal

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.979 
three-picture deal
The<00:02:32.510> Avengers<00:02:32.629> wasn't<00:02:33.170> included<00:02:33.410> he<00:02:33.860> made<00:02:34.069> a

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
The Avengers wasn't included he made a

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.809 
The Avengers wasn't included he made a
hundred<00:02:35.989> billion<00:02:36.440> dollars<00:02:37.129> for<00:02:37.400> being<00:02:37.549> in<00:02:37.730> the

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
hundred billion dollars for being in the

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.240 
hundred billion dollars for being in the
Avengers<00:02:38.349> so<00:02:39.349> I<00:02:39.680> don't<00:02:39.860> know<00:02:39.920> these<00:02:40.099> movies

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
Avengers so I don't know these movies

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.550 
Avengers so I don't know these movies
make<00:02:40.549> a<00:02:40.579> shitload<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.030> money<00:02:41.150> so<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:41.989> can't

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
make a shitload of money so I can't

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.199 
make a shitload of money so I can't
imagine<00:02:42.650> watching<00:02:43.069> an<00:02:43.519> Iron<00:02:43.790> Man<00:02:43.819> movie

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
imagine watching an Iron Man movie

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.580 
imagine watching an Iron Man movie
without<00:02:44.390> him<00:02:44.780> in<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.110> role

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
without him in that role

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.729 
without him in that role
yeah<00:02:45.769> I'm<00:02:46.549> assuming<00:02:46.940> for<00:02:47.090> Avengers<00:02:47.569> 2<00:02:47.900> or<00:02:48.319> Iron

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
Man 4 there probably has to be some kind

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.369 
Man 4 there probably has to be some kind
of<00:02:51.069> renegotiation<00:02:52.069> and<00:02:52.840> Robert<00:02:53.840> Downey<00:02:53.930> jr.

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
of renegotiation and Robert Downey jr.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.229 
of renegotiation and Robert Downey jr.
