00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.430 

this<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.039> possibly<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.789> slowest<00:01:00.329> car<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.809> know

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
this is possibly the slowest car I know

this is possibly the slowest car I know
it's<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.769> cult<00:01:02.010> day<00:01:02.160> but<00:01:02.339> this<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.730> inexcusable

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
it's a cult day but this is inexcusable

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.630 
it's a cult day but this is inexcusable
this<00:01:04.019> car<00:01:04.259> is<00:01:04.379> one<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> slowest<00:01:05.220> cars<00:01:05.460> away

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
this car is one of the slowest cars away

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.310 
this car is one of the slowest cars away
from<00:01:05.759> the<00:01:05.970> line<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> think<00:01:06.509> I've<00:01:06.780> ever<00:01:06.960> driven

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
from the line I think I've ever driven

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.469 
from the line I think I've ever driven
the<00:01:07.920> problem<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.399> you<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.759> that<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.060> car<00:01:09.330> has

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the problem is you see that this car has

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.289 
the problem is you see that this car has
the<00:01:09.509> old<00:01:09.780> 2.5<00:01:10.770> turbo<00:01:11.310> diesel<00:01:11.729> engine<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.149> it

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
the old 2.5 turbo diesel engine in it

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.840 
the old 2.5 turbo diesel engine in it
it's<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> modern<00:01:13.259> d5<00:01:13.860> engine<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> boy

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it's not the modern d5 engine and boy

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.270 
it's not the modern d5 engine and boy
does<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.180> show<00:01:15.539> the<00:01:16.170> problem<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.740> made<00:01:16.920> much

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
does it show the problem is made much

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.430 
does it show the problem is made much
worse<00:01:17.310> by<00:01:17.850> an<00:01:17.970> automatic<00:01:18.360> gearbox<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:19.170> never

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
worse by an automatic gearbox that never

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.440 
worse by an automatic gearbox that never
really<00:01:19.830> seems<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.520> fully<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.030> gear<00:01:21.299> until

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
really seems to be fully in gear until

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.320 
really seems to be fully in gear until
you've<00:01:21.659> reached<00:01:21.899> 60<00:01:22.439> miles<00:01:22.649> an<00:01:22.770> hour<00:01:22.920> or<00:01:23.070> so

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
you've reached 60 miles an hour or so

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.920 
you've reached 60 miles an hour or so
I'm<00:01:24.330> doing<00:01:24.689> 40<00:01:25.320> miles<00:01:25.500> now<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.840> don't<00:01:27.840> you

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
I'm doing 40 miles now here I don't you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.440 
I'm doing 40 miles now here I don't you
can<00:01:27.960> hear<00:01:28.229> that

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.270 

I<00:01:31.509> can<00:01:32.110> just<00:01:32.200> keep<00:01:32.320> revving<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.799> car<00:01:33.009> like<00:01:33.159> I'm

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
I can just keep revving the car like I'm

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.310 
I can just keep revving the car like I'm
stuck<00:01:33.460> in<00:01:33.610> neutral<00:01:33.759> I'm<00:01:34.539> supposed<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.170> be<00:01:35.289> a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
stuck in neutral I'm supposed to be a

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.850 
stuck in neutral I'm supposed to be a
drive<00:01:35.710> but<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.759> cars<00:01:37.000> doing<00:01:37.270> anything<00:01:37.600> but<00:01:37.930> on

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
drive but the cars doing anything but on

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.919 
drive but the cars doing anything but on
smaller<00:01:39.340> roads<00:01:39.610> you<00:01:39.759> get<00:01:39.939> a<00:01:39.969> feel<00:01:40.270> for<00:01:40.479> how<00:01:40.630> big

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
smaller roads you get a feel for how big

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.039 
smaller roads you get a feel for how big
this<00:01:41.170> car<00:01:41.469> is<00:01:41.649> it's<00:01:41.890> like<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.100> bloated<00:01:42.579> s60<00:01:43.390> now

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
this car is it's like a bloated s60 now

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.810 
this car is it's like a bloated s60 now
I<00:01:44.110> think<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.469> s60<00:01:45.070> is<00:01:45.100> actually<00:01:45.490> quite<00:01:45.789> a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
I think the s60 is actually quite a

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.120 
I think the s60 is actually quite a
pretty<00:01:46.210> car<00:01:46.570> especially<00:01:47.470> from<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.740> back<00:01:47.950> but

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
pretty car especially from the back but

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.770 
pretty car especially from the back but
even<00:01:48.549> though<00:01:48.789> this<00:01:49.119> is<00:01:49.299> just<00:01:49.329> a<00:01:49.569> bigger

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
even though this is just a bigger

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.450 
even though this is just a bigger
version<00:01:49.869> it<00:01:50.530> seems<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.890> have<00:01:50.979> lost<00:01:51.159> those

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
version it seems to have lost those

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.760 
version it seems to have lost those
pleasing<00:01:51.939> proportions<00:01:52.569> instead<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.590> just

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
pleasing proportions instead it just

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.069 
pleasing proportions instead it just
looks<00:01:53.979> like<00:01:54.069> a<00:01:54.189> bit<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:54.549> a<00:01:54.789> fatty<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:55.420> can't

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
looks like a bit of a fatty you can't

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.690 
looks like a bit of a fatty you can't
feel<00:01:56.350> all<00:01:56.530> that<00:01:56.560> weight<00:01:56.950> pushing<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.460> front

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
feel all that weight pushing the front

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.490 
feel all that weight pushing the front
tires<00:01:58.000> on<00:01:58.240> twisty<00:01:58.569> roads

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
tires on twisty roads

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.529 
tires on twisty roads
it's<00:01:59.770> definitely<00:02:00.520> wrong<00:02:00.729> but<00:02:01.030> I<00:02:01.060> can't<00:02:01.329> really

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
it's definitely wrong but I can't really

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.120 
it's definitely wrong but I can't really
complain<00:02:01.899> or<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:04.450> not<00:02:04.780> sports<00:02:05.200> car<00:02:05.530> it's<00:02:05.950> a

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
complain or it's not sports car it's a

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.699 
complain or it's not sports car it's a
big<00:02:06.369> fat<00:02:06.670> Volvo<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.869> outside<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.500> car

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
big fat Volvo the outside of the car

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.380 
big fat Volvo the outside of the car
then<00:02:08.920> is<00:02:09.099> massive<00:02:09.610> which<00:02:09.880> begs<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.299> question

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
then is massive which begs the question

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.569 
then is massive which begs the question
when<00:02:10.929> you're<00:02:11.079> sitting<00:02:11.380> inside<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.769> where<00:02:12.430> did

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
when you're sitting inside it where did

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.789 
when you're sitting inside it where did
all<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.700> space<00:02:13.180> go<00:02:13.599> I<00:02:13.930> don't<00:02:14.380> have<00:02:14.470> evolved

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
all that space go I don't have evolved

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.229 
all that space go I don't have evolved
or<00:02:14.980> managed<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.489> but<00:02:15.519> actually<00:02:15.760> feel<00:02:16.060> quite

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
or managed it but actually feel quite

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.300 
or managed it but actually feel quite
claustrophobic<00:02:16.690> in<00:02:17.440> here<00:02:17.470> even<00:02:18.130> though<00:02:18.190> this
