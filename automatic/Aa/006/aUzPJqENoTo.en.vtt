00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.020 
and actually we're going to show you how
we<00:00:08.040> actually<00:00:08.820> make<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:10.110> we<00:00:10.679> have<00:00:11.030> canvas

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
we actually make it and we have canvas

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.499 
we actually make it and we have canvas
and<00:00:12.450> we<00:00:12.840> still<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.769> not<00:00:13.889> know<00:00:13.950> if<00:00:14.549> we<00:00:14.910> should<00:00:15.389> do

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
and we still do not know if we should do

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.790 
and we still do not know if we should do
it<00:00:15.630> long<00:00:15.960> ways<00:00:15.990> or<00:00:17.600> top<00:00:18.600> whatever<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.680> wanna

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
it long ways or top whatever you wanna

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.279 
it long ways or top whatever you wanna
call<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.240> think<00:00:21.330> top<00:00:21.869> because

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
call that but I think top because

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.349 
call that but I think top because
there's<00:00:22.529> not<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> lot<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.490> Blues<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.029> these

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.899 
perfect so now that we know whoops that
all<00:01:52.680> those<00:01:52.890> are<00:01:53.070> going<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> fit<00:01:53.490> perfectly

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
all those are going to fit perfectly
