again<00:02:24.880> my<00:02:25.060> screen<00:02:25.360> turned<00:02:25.599> black<00:02:25.870> but<00:02:26.140> instead

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
again my screen turned black but instead

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.759 
again my screen turned black but instead
of<00:02:26.470> eyes<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:27.579> volcano<00:02:28.000> appeared<00:02:28.769> looking

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
of eyes the volcano appeared looking

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.289 
of eyes the volcano appeared looking
much<00:02:30.130> like<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.459> did<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.790> background

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
much like it did in the background

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.259 
much like it did in the background
except<00:02:31.599> a<00:02:31.660> larger<00:02:32.019> I<00:02:32.670> soon<00:02:33.670> found<00:02:33.819> that<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.120> can

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
except a larger I soon found that I can

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.640 
except a larger I soon found that I can
move<00:02:34.360> my<00:02:34.420> character<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:35.079> can<00:02:35.230> move<00:02:35.440> in<00:02:35.530> every

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650

directions except backwards

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.760 
directions except backwards
so<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.630> slowly<00:02:39.870> proceeded<00:02:40.440> towards<00:02:40.710> the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
so I slowly proceeded towards the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.560 
so I slowly proceeded towards the
volcano<00:02:40.860> no<00:02:41.490> phantoms<00:02:41.910> are<00:02:42.060> shooting<00:02:42.360> out<00:02:42.480> of

volcano no phantoms are shooting out of
it<00:02:42.690> which<00:02:42.960> meant<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.410> game<00:02:43.620> was<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.890> being<00:02:44.780> soon

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780

it which meant the game was a being soon
I<00:02:46.020> was<00:02:46.140> at<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.380> base<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.770> volcano<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
I was at the base of the volcano the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.150 
I was at the base of the volcano the
lava<00:02:47.610> was<00:02:48.060> warm<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.630> strangely<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.320> purplish
