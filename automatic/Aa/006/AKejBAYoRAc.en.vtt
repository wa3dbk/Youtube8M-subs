00:00:00.623 --> 00:00:01.554
 Fruits ... 

00:00:01.847 --> 00:00:03.642
 Can I? 

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:06.120
 Maybe. But first eat the octopus gnocchi (dumplings). 

00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:11.836
 Okay, Mommy, then. It's not a true octopus, is it? 

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:12.672
 No. 

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:17.890
 All right. He does not speak or have a head, is it? 

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:19.898
 Where's his head? 

00:00:20.113 --> 00:00:24.482
 He has no head. These are only his tentacles cut. 

00:00:24.744 --> 00:00:28.075
 Ah ... and is his head in the sea? 

00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:30.683
 It is with fishermen. 

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:36.275
 So the man cut him off, is not he? 

00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:37.486
 Yes. 

00:00:37.548 --> 00:00:38.562
 Why? 

00:00:38.653 --> 00:00:40.820
 So we can eat it, otherwise we have to swallow it all. 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.116
 But why? 

00:00:45.623 --> 00:00:49.023
 So that we can eat it, my love, just as the calves are cut, the chickens ... 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.895
 Please? Chickens? No one eats chickens. 

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:54.582
 No one eats chickens? 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.669
 No ... they are animals ... 

00:00:56.826 --> 00:00:57.484
 Really? 

00:00:57.684 --> 00:00:59.160
 Yes. 

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:04.972
 Now will you eat the dumplings? And then the potatoes. 

00:01:05.172 --> 00:01:07.259
 Only potatoes and rice. 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.323
 All right. 

00:01:09.093 --> 00:01:11.427
 Octopuses are animals. 

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:12.895
 That's right. 

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.307
 They are all animals. 

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:19.437
 Fish are animals ... 

00:01:19.437 --> 00:01:21.937
 Octopuses are animals. 

00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:24.938
 Chickens are animals ... 

00:01:24.938 --> 00:01:28.153
 Cows are animals ... 

00:01:28.153 --> 00:01:30.531
 Pigs are animals ... 

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:31.899
 That's right... 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.076
 So when we eat animals, they die! 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:39.924
 Yes. 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.438
 Why? 

00:01:41.607 --> 00:01:43.551
 So we can eat, my love. 

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:45.387
 Why should they die? 

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:49.611
 I do not like that they're dying. 

00:01:50.103 --> 00:01:54.649
 I love them when they are alive. Happy. 

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:58.277
 Well I agree. We will not eat them anymore, will we? 

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.194
 OK. 

00:02:01.994 --> 00:02:06.955
 We must take care of the animals, not eat them! 

00:02:09.847 --> 00:02:14.087
 You are right, son. Just eat only potatoes and rice. 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.335
 All right. Why are you crying? 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.926
 I'm not crying. It just disturbs me. 

00:02:22.418 --> 00:02:25.618
 I see you have tears! 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.580
 Eat, you do not need to eat octopus, do you? 

00:02:29.718 --> 00:02:33.805
 All right. The octopus is an animal. 

00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:35.066
 Yes? 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.790
 That looks like ... Aah! I bite my tongue ...
