on the canal look for some likely spots
in<00:01:04.680> other<00:01:04.830> words<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.280> there<00:01:05.729> are<00:01:05.880> car<00:01:06.210> paneer

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
in other words if there are car paneer

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.870 
in other words if there are car paneer
then<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.290> where<00:01:07.409> there<00:01:07.590> will<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:08.070> came

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
then this is where there will be I came

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.330 
then this is where there will be I came
across<00:01:09.030> them<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> caught<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.409> or<00:01:10.530> two<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.920> did

the fish not a big one as I said didn't
wait<00:03:45.579> but<00:03:46.239> certainly<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:47.290> great<00:03:47.949> fish<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:49.199> caught

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
wait but certainly a great fish I caught

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:54.210 
wait but certainly a great fish I caught
that<00:03:50.260> fish<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.919> carp<00:03:51.220> on<00:03:51.459> an<00:03:52.060> SBS<00:03:52.530> m2<00:03:53.530> boilie

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
that fish that carp on an SBS m2 boilie

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.520 
that fish that carp on an SBS m2 boilie
so<00:03:54.669> it's<00:03:54.819> an<00:03:54.910> instant<00:03:55.060> bait<00:03:55.449> because<00:03:55.959> no<00:03:56.319> one's
