00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.910
 so hello everyone dear friends with you 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.969
 pav this tips and tricks on the line 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.480
 key card 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:23.369
 so guys boxes culture 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.890
 jump something like this so it is a shell 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.060
 shoots the rest 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:37.219
 and as sewn 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:37.219
 see so the position solely on the check 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:46.440
 somehow so you can see the head squat 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.290
 Well, tell infu your team so in 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.440
 principle is not useful such 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:55.860
 landing as if you can use under 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.670
 cars can be poured here on iron but 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.909
 later you can jump here 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.710
 defend for example beetle or pate 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:08.040
 so many did not know about such a thing 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.130
 here you can sit down afterwards 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.820
 well and here 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:18.630
 something like this is a small bug texture 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.790
 that is, you can jump here 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:28.220
 here it is impossible that only here only 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.850
 here only here on this box 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.340
 can principle 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.340
 smoke closure shut in principle 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.770
 so for this how to say a bug or such 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.329
 podsadochku thank mains and which 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.210
 prompted me to jump here 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:51.409
 here it is also possible in this way 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:55.899
 watch mid or well there about or 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:58.399
 stay here just like 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.829
 also many do not know about what is possible in 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.159
 principle for coming here well 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.409
 later here later on the lights then 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.410
 the next lantern 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:13.760
 the next lantern until the next night like 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:19.099
 that is not very useful, of course, but 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:22.790
 no matter how I have it I did not show you either 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:28.540
 there is some kind of help from one 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:32.690
 man here as if can read them 1b 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:36.650
 Well, not very useful so I think the general 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.989
 language so for general reference so 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.209
 this way you can check out 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:46.269
 b you can not see you merge with the wall 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:49.519
 Well, you naturally see running 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.910
 visible principle head sailing there 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.920
 You can also throw flash drives that 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.280
 unexpected can basically go out 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:03.079
 can play such yourself on the move and 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.930
 so go round 1 so you can 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.950
 way to open the valve open 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.629
 win sambo 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.489
 naturally the terrorists will come to life 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.040
 Vasu either from below or not at all 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.780
 expect new sister under unexpected under 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.260
 sly principle can take with them and 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.109
 this position so flash drive for 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.969
 prevent rush aids 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:31.459
 on the easy to throw it easy to hear 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:33.500
 all who pursue you can also 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:39.280
 fasten a little of that type 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:43.010
 example c. so another position 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.780
 jump box click here well and we stand 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:53.319
 either check here or check the door somehow 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:59.900
 so and so could prevail in mid 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:02.409
 it remains so we aim to the shore we 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.409
 we throw 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.920
 something like this 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.750
 so some more savvy zalazim 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:26.330
 this way here somehow 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:26.330
 we throw well and throw 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.110
 who only if to kill 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.880
 this is a substitute 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:48.990
 AIDS do not meet up, and the principle of 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:52.810
 so another smog was captured by car 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:56.280
 I'll pick it up 70 so that you are closed 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.280
 completely this theme we aim here and 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.280
 we throw 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.039
 You can also throw a little 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:16.949
 to the left to completely close the car and 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:22.560
 so defaults could be captured on b 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:22.560
 We aim approximately here give 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.530
 he closes 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.430
 my position which was also spoken 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.880
 if you wish to conclude 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:40.790
 these positions that Malik exploded here well 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:44.150
 and he is basically so good. 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.910
 when it Rasch point, and so it was tips 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.590
 and tricks of the number one place 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.150
 likes subscribe following tips and 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.580
 tricks is still the second part on 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.190
 next week you stay with me 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.190
 also thank you very much 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.850
 playing now helps me in shooting 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:05.380
 this content thanks to him I am with you 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.380
 say goodbye to all bye
