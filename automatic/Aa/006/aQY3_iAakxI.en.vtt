00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
on to the end of your strobe it's just a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.740 
on to the end of your strobe it's just a
really<00:00:21.060> really<00:00:21.570> tight<00:00:22.640> rubber<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:24.449> was<00:00:24.720> a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
really really tight rubber it was a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.210 
really really tight rubber it was a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
little hard to get on but that means

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.470 
little hard to get on but that means
it's<00:00:26.430> going<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.580> be<00:00:26.670> very<00:00:26.849> hard<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.180> get<00:00:27.359> off

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
it's going to be very hard to get off

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.929 
it's going to be very hard to get off
and<00:00:27.689> then<00:00:27.779> once<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.500> there<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.580> mag

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and then once that is on there the mag

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.220 
and then once that is on there the mag
mod<00:00:30.179> comes<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:30.960> these<00:00:31.740> little<00:00:32.780> magnet<00:00:33.780> items

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
mod comes with these little magnet items

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.370 
mod comes with these little magnet items
and<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.760> spot<00:00:36.210> grid<00:00:36.480> right<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.320> we

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
and so you have a spot grid right so we

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.049 
and so you have a spot grid right so we
can<00:00:37.410> put<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> spot<00:00:37.920> grid<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.520> that's<00:00:38.910> going

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
can put a spot grid on and that's going

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.380 
can put a spot grid on and that's going
to<00:00:39.180> be<00:00:39.239> using<00:00:39.570> mostly<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.520> back<00:00:41.879> hair<00:00:42.180> light

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
and then you can also stack them on top

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.529 
and then you can also stack them on top
of<00:00:48.180> each<00:00:48.390> other<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.309> really<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.460> useful<00:00:51.030> if

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
stack I think up to three gels possibly

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.080 
stack I think up to three gels possibly
four<00:01:19.320> together<00:01:19.920> if<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.189> need<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> stack<00:01:20.670> gels

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
four together if you need to stack gels

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.390 
four together if you need to stack gels
on<00:01:21.299> top<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.780> each<00:01:21.900> other<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.380> let's<00:01:23.159> go<00:01:23.280> ahead

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.450 
that let's go ahead and I'm going to
dial<00:01:55.970> in<00:01:56.390> my<00:01:57.350> first<00:01:58.160> flash<00:01:58.880> here<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:01.430> I

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
dial in my first flash here and so I

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.610 
dial in my first flash here and so I
have<00:02:01.550> my<00:02:01.580> first<00:02:01.850> flash<00:02:02.060> set<00:02:02.390> at<00:02:02.570> just<00:02:03.290> zero

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
have my first flash set at just zero

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.190 
have my first flash set at just zero
exposure<00:02:04.130> compensation<00:02:04.750> so<00:02:05.750> let's<00:02:05.960> go<00:02:06.080> ahead

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
exposure compensation so let's go ahead

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.449 
exposure compensation so let's go ahead
and<00:02:06.620> check<00:02:06.950> that

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.910 

so<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:10.659> one<00:02:10.840> was<00:02:10.959> a<00:02:10.989> little<00:02:11.079> underexposed<00:02:11.829> so

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
so that one was a little underexposed so

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.679 
so that one was a little underexposed so
I'm<00:02:11.980> going<00:02:12.129> to<00:02:12.189> bump<00:02:12.370> up<00:02:12.549> my<00:02:12.579> flash<00:02:13.060> my<00:02:13.359> front

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.170

negative<00:02:41.219> one<00:02:41.459> point<00:02:41.700> seven<00:02:42.239> which<00:02:42.359> I<00:02:42.510> think

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
negative one point seven which I think

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:52.160 
negative one point seven which I think
is<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> good<00:02:43.049> starting<00:02:43.500> point

because since we're in the shade

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.160 
because since we're in the shade
exposures<00:03:14.210> not<00:03:14.390> going<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:14.600> change<00:03:14.780> nothing's
