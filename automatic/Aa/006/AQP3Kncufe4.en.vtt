00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hi friends today we have a warm city 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.690
 goes low and we present to your 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.330
 our attention next time to review 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.370
 ninth generation toyota corolla toyota 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.200
 corolla is wearing a generation this is completely 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.759
 the modified model unlike 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.360
 previous changed all the main 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.670
 aggregates 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.220
 This car was produced in 2001 to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.240
 2007 forest the fourth year he 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.910
 restyled 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.250
 Yoshtu and in picking this equipment 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.960
 terra and soul grade cold 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.670
 top of the range is more 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.330
 budget and our car and thousands 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:57.370
 100 year complete sol 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:59.440
 [music] 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.150
 limit your car engine 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.309
 set 3d crash divider 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.690
 this is a 1 6 liter engine principle for 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.140
 the city is enough for him 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.020
 14 I will try a certain engine shine 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.090
 and very reliable oil does not consume 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.820
 naturally in good condition drive 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.130
 timing here chain cliff hryvnia too 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.490
 you can not be afraid well, of course, if at all 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.560
 then run the subsidies will stretch 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.240
 and can skip rapo it will be 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.950
 opposite it needs to be at all 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.770
 notorious nihilists amount to pay 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.479
 attention to only rings years also to 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.820
 wadding system installed 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.570
 the topic is pretty good gives how age 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.610
 bottom classes 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.440
 what can we say about fuel consumption 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.229
 this car but on the highway it 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.930
 78 liters of Greece fit these pro 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.940
 pensioner can worm in the city 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.979
 at about 10 12 it is necessary then in 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.119
 depending on traffic jams 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.850
 car ergonomics for this 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.630
 class at a good level everything is convenient everything 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.180
 at hand 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.740
 to switch the radio are available 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.210
 Multifunction is also not very convenient 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.970
 constantly reaching for the radio 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.390
 legs that the radio does not play mp3 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.000
 discs 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.610
 Well, this is also a problem that can be solved 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.710
 install mp3 adapter or you can 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.190
 install another tape recorder principle 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.770
 easy climate control has them 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.140
 automatic modes are also unlike 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.940
 picking which is poorer here 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.910
 the climate goes on the buttons my looks where 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.120
 more interesting is the seat heating also 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.920
 there are thanks too 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.470
 the panel is installed here 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.140
 optitronnaya is considered very good yes and 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.800
 looks like a principle is also very good 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.420
 our side mirrors go with 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.490
 adjustments and heated cabin 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.040
 auto-dimming mirror 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.420
 spoke in some of the reviews thing 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.420
 pretty useless ass to 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.700
 toned about the convenience of landing 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.980
 In the cabin, well, not to say that it is very convenient 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.200
 many complain that short 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.560
 cushions on which to sit and lumbar 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.020
 emphasis 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.700
 strongly pushed out of them but the principle 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.069
 if you wish, you can sit comfortably 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.660
 rulitsya which also regulated here in two 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.010
 planes which is also quite convenient 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.260
 can customize 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.620
 anyone can even paint hands 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.080
 convenient to drive behind the seat principle too 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.100
 fine 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.630
 what's upsetting me from behind is that 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.760
 armrest well naturally flap like 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.800
 not this, too, in principle, the rear seats 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.650
 add up add up not 40 by 60 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.390
 that the principle of almost flat floor gives 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.180
 but only a small step there 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.610
 principle and the trunk itself, he is pretty 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.360
 volumetric even without it if to compare 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.230
 Salon with the previous Corolla here 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.720
 it felt like 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.440
 car even somehow higher class he 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.180
 it really became bigger and more interesting to the city 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.970
 you can drive easily and 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.580
 casual suspension is enough 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.070
 for city driving if something on the highway 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.650
 the car does not like longitudinal 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.510
 waves for the reason that it starts 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.020
 swing and have to catch it 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.510
 driving also side wind is very good 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.240
 transfers to this understands from the fact that 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.280
 car light suspension on the car 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.340
 principle very simple means and 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.510
 inexpensive to repair 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.260
 Front mounted suspension type 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.660
 mcpherson 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.010
 rear mounted beam rear on 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.750
 Japanese versions that go right hands 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.489
 there are full all-wheel drive versions and 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.440
 therefore independent 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.919
 suspension and steering need a 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.919
 themselves lyric day of the hydraulic booster whether 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.600
 there is an electric rail principle river 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.550
 It is considered quite problematic for the 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.770
 the reason is that even with low mileage 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.540
 starts tapping on small 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.610
 irregularities are you apart from 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.380
 tapping is no more threatening 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.350
 but agree unpleasant ride 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.320
 car which knocks the agenda well 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.980
 and there is a way to solve this too 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.990
 just change the plastic right in 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.390
 sense and about either and cut out such by 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.610
 craftsmen either do it themselves because 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.850
 make it fit and in size 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.410
 then it is a long time to eliminate knock that 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.130
 touches the box on this car 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.169
 She is here automatic 4-speed 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.830
 quite simple and therefore reliable 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.000
 if in time to change the oil filter in it 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.790
 state of course any box can be 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.729
 indicate but if normal to 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.610
 the car has a cold for a very long time 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.660
 and an overdrive system like on almost everyone 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.970
 Japanese cars with a gun 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.650
 what is generally overdrive just 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.730
 you press the button, I turn on 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.530
 last gear 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.510
 and that is it can somehow help there 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.850
 overtaking somewhere on the highway to 100 sq. they 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.090
 here the city of the city in fact it 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.070
 rather useless to summarize 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.090
 for this car as a whole car 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.830
 costs money 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.510
 relatively comfortable strong reliable 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.950
 and inexpensive to maintain 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.170
 in the secondary market ninth generation 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.430
 enjoys steady demand 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.410
 high rankings in reliability ratings 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.360
 used cars and that's quite 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.670
 deserved for the reason that the car 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.710
 practically has no weak points on this 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.820
 we will end subscribe to our channel 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.820
 put the husks bye

 the trees haven't flown by yet I will try salt
