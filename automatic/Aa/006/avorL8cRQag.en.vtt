00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.220
 now 10 times 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.780
 what fun this about the guilt you're 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.200
 of air that you want it to be that something more 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.980
 from the box come vale 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.000
 today I have the microsoft in the box 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.020
 surface 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.740
 rp and also the takeover so here what 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.690
 we have the surface rt in this case it 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.750
 it's about the version that also 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.230
 has the taxco see if we turn it around 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.610
 we know we have a 32 gb 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.449
 therefore this equipment costs 500 79 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.280
 euros 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:53.180
 let's open it we stretch out of the box 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.970
 and the first thing we found 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.980
 is the touch cover that you already know is 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.910
 the touch keyboard 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.910
 we take it out here 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.229
 and we see that in the box he still has 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.509
 something that is this that is the way in the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.470
 which is put on our surface and the 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.470
 instructions 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.680
 we put it back I leave the keyboard here 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.970
 over and then I show you we're going to 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.970
 open the surface box 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.300
 it opens up like a book and 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.090
 tachÃ¡n 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.700
 we find the surface 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.310
 we're going to take it out and I'll save it for 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.890
 and then we see it and under it I take it out and it's 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.069
 a quick guide to use a few first 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.469
 steps and a little guide of things 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:57.000
 what is your surface how to place besides 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:59.800
 the tax cover here we have a few 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.790
 instructions for use 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.550
 this cable if we pull it 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.560
 goes to the power adapter for this 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.149
 part would have the connection that goes to 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.210
 surface that you see is a connection 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.120
 magnetic owner and that will be the one 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.790
 recharge our device here what 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.500
 that we should place is the charger 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.150
 our country 'here we would have the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.220
 current adapter in this case is 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.730
 the United Kingdom is not worth it but it 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.730
 I would place 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.220
 So, now we're leaving with the 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.660
 surface and we have it 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.660
 we throw the plastic 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.480
 and crossed out 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.010
 you already know that he has the kick stand that is 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.500
 to be able to keep it in this position 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.190
 in a lectern mode under the lectern 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.890
 we have a slot for microsd cards 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.460
 we also have a micro hdmi connection 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.020
 and a USB 2.0 port and in this part of 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.550
 here we have the magnetic connection for 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.360
 can recharge it at the bottom 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.220
 we have a connector for accessories and in 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.200
 this side we have control of 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.210
 volume the minijack connection for ones 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.580
 headphones and top 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.020
 we have the power button turned off 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.400
 It has two cameras one front and 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:25.090
 another back that are at 720p ie hd 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.090
 we turn it on 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.440
 and while I turn on I am teaching you the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.380
 touch cover which is this keyboard case 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.180
 touch that comes with the kit that I have 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.390
 taught you can also buy it from 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.950
 separate way ahead from behind 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.830
 it is soft and it is placed in the part of 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.520
 below is a magnetic fixation that is 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.540
 very strong but I also teach you before 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.550
 the takeover that is this keyboard case 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.930
 that I should be touch like the touch cover 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:06.280
 what you have are physical buttons to the 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.750
 that pounding we take them out here we see that 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.420
 have 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.780
 the same instructions as before and 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.910
 it looks very similar to the task 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.650
 over at least outside and this is 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.049
 on the part of the keys it is obvious that 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.260
 they have their differences although both 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.140
 they have touchpad so this has 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.310
 been the unboxing of the surface rt in brief 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.450
 we will have the videogram 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.450
 until the next unboxing
