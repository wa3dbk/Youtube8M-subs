touched down on the hillside to the west

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.120 
touched down on the hillside to the west
of<00:01:08.010> Farmington<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.439> that<00:01:10.439> would<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.770> with<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
of Farmington and that would be with the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.370 
of Farmington and that would be with the
same<00:01:11.549> cell<00:01:12.060> now<00:01:12.390> we've<00:01:12.900> been<00:01:12.930> looking<00:01:13.260> at

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
same cell now we've been looking at

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.109 
same cell now we've been looking at
velocity<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.549> from<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> couple<00:01:15.060> of

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
velocity on this from a couple of

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.080 
velocity on this from a couple of
different<00:01:15.740> angles<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
different angles here and the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.850 
different angles here and the
interesting<00:01:18.240> thing<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.590> dry

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
interesting thing with this is the dry

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.969 
interesting thing with this is the dry
slot<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.939> between<00:01:21.530> images<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:22.860> we're

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
slot we see in between images here we're

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.740 
slot we see in between images here we're
not<00:01:23.159> seeing<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> red<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.880> green<00:01:23.970> mixing<00:01:24.600> like

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
not seeing the red and green mixing like

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.570 
not seeing the red and green mixing like
we<00:01:24.869> normally<00:01:24.990> do<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.830> fairly<00:01:26.220> close

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
we normally do but this is fairly close

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.660 
we normally do but this is fairly close
to<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> radar<00:01:27.090> site<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.320> again<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.280> angle

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
to the radar site and again that angle

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.850 
to the radar site and again that angle
could<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> factor<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.320> went<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
could be a factor here but I went up a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460 
could be a factor here but I went up a
little<00:01:32.070> higher<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.299> elevation<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
little higher on elevation and it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.319 
little higher on elevation and it
definitely<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.250> over<00:01:35.490> there<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:36.180> an

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
definitely is over there is an

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.080 
definitely is over there is an
interesting<00:01:36.780> looking<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.619> sell<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.820> could

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
interesting looking to sell this could

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.830 
interesting looking to sell this could
be<00:01:39.210> producing<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.990> Toyota<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.840> touching

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
be producing a Toyota that is touching

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.319 
be producing a Toyota that is touching
down<00:01:43.229> or<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.710> funnel<00:01:44.369> clouds<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.939> spotter

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
down or just funnel clouds a spotter

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.370 
down or just funnel clouds a spotter
reported<00:01:45.829> in<00:01:46.829> Farmington<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.729> funnel<00:01:48.210> cloud

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
reported in Farmington a funnel cloud

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.170 
reported in Farmington a funnel cloud
again<00:01:49.380> with<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> storm<00:01:50.130> about<00:01:50.460> five<00:01:50.850> minutes

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
again with the storm about five minutes

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.020 
again with the storm about five minutes
ago<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:52.770> now<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.220> would<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.369> east<00:01:53.790> of
