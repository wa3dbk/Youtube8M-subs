00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:11.459 
now the next one we're going to go over

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:13.910 
now the next one we're going to go over
as<00:00:11.670> we've<00:00:11.849> obviously<00:00:12.209> already<00:00:12.719> done<00:00:12.929> RC<00:00:13.440> we're

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
as we've obviously already done RC we're

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.369 
as we've obviously already done RC we're
going<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.219> go<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.400> games<00:00:14.789> now<00:00:15.269> what<00:00:15.570> games<00:00:15.959> are

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
going to go to games now what games are

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.929 
going to go to games now what games are
is<00:00:17.300> how<00:00:18.300> stable<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.410> how<00:00:19.619> reactive<00:00:20.040> the<00:00:20.640> model

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
is how stable and how reactive the model

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.679 
is how stable and how reactive the model
is<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.119> your<00:00:21.509> input<00:00:22.110> control<00:00:22.890> now<00:00:23.700> what<00:00:24.539> I've

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
is to your input control now what I've

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.859 
is to your input control now what I've
done<00:00:25.020> is<00:00:25.680> I've<00:00:26.640> kind<00:00:27.360> of<00:00:27.450> start<00:00:27.630> blinged

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
done is I've kind of start blinged

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.900 
done is I've kind of start blinged
internet<00:00:28.469> and<00:00:28.680> databases<00:00:29.399> for<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.669> best

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
internet and databases for the best

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.359 
internet and databases for the best
gains<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.050> set<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.770> gains<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.219> I've

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
gains so the this set of gains that I've

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.639 
gains so the this set of gains that I've
got<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:33.030> Goods<00:00:33.329> programming<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.110> now<00:00:34.350> are

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
got on Goods programming just now are

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.470 
got on Goods programming just now are
the<00:00:34.739> ones<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.160> use<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> 450<00:00:36.000> that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the ones that we use on the 450 that

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.810 
the ones that we use on the 450 that
work<00:00:36.660> quite<00:00:36.899> well<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.290> 550<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.129> well<00:00:38.370> but

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
work quite well on the 550 as well but

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.520 
work quite well on the 550 as well but
there's<00:00:39.030> simply<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.390> starting<00:00:39.930> point<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.410> you

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
there's simply a starting point and you

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.009 
there's simply a starting point and you
can<00:00:40.770> mess<00:00:41.429> about<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.730> these<00:00:41.999> gains<00:00:42.269> to<00:00:42.870> get

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
can mess about with these gains to get

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.200 
can mess about with these gains to get
the<00:00:43.109> model<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.530> fly<00:00:43.769> exactly<00:00:44.280> how<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.550> want<00:00:44.999> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the model to fly exactly how you want it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.270 
the model to fly exactly how you want it
but<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.870> gains<00:00:46.109> the<00:00:46.350> way<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.710> they<00:00:46.829> work<00:00:47.039> is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
but the gains the way that they work is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.130 
but the gains the way that they work is
your<00:00:47.460> basic<00:00:47.909> gains<00:00:48.149> that's<00:00:48.449> the<00:00:48.659> top<00:00:48.899> ones

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
your basic gains that's the top ones

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.899 
your basic gains that's the top ones
along<00:00:49.469> here<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.429> your<00:00:50.550> different

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
along here that's all your different

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:53.270 
along here that's all your different
directions<00:00:51.449> or<00:00:51.600> pitching<00:00:52.109> basically<00:00:53.100> means

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
directions or pitching basically means

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.610 
directions or pitching basically means
when<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> models<00:00:53.909> flying<00:00:54.539> if<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.230> red<00:00:55.379> legs

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
when the models flying if the red legs

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.680 
when the models flying if the red legs
are<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> front<00:00:56.159> pitching<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.850> forward<00:00:57.569> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
are the front pitching is forward and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.829 
are the front pitching is forward and
backwards<00:00:58.399> ruling<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.730> obviously<00:01:00.149> sideways

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
backwards ruling is obviously sideways

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.310 
backwards ruling is obviously sideways
your<00:01:01.679> is<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.460> twisting<00:01:03.030> action<00:01:03.269> and<00:01:03.839> then

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
your is the twisting action and then

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.040 
your is the twisting action and then
vertical<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.220> actually<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.600> down<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:09.050> the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
vertical is actually up and down so the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.590 
vertical is actually up and down so the
basic<00:01:10.560> things<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.130> how<00:01:11.670> stable<00:01:12.120> it<00:01:12.420> is

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
basic things that is how stable it is

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.389 
basic things that is how stable it is
when<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.140> hovering<00:01:13.439> when<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.189> not

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
when it's hovering when you are not

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.310 
when it's hovering when you are not
controlling<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:16.079> doesn't

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
controlling it now it doesn't

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.340 
controlling it now it doesn't
necessarily<00:01:16.560> mean<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.820> higher<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.420> gain<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
necessarily mean the higher the gain the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.959 
necessarily mean the higher the gain the
better<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.860> will<00:01:20.040> fly<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:20.549> sometimes

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
better it will fly because sometimes

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.330 
better it will fly because sometimes
become<00:01:21.299> become<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.079> bit<00:01:22.229> too<00:01:22.380> locked<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
become become a bit too locked on and a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.270 
become become a bit too locked on and a
little<00:01:23.549> bit<00:01:23.820> too<00:01:24.560> sensitive<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.159> get

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
little bit too sensitive and you can get

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.480 
little bit too sensitive and you can get
a<00:01:26.310> lot<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.490> wobble<00:01:26.939> problems<00:01:27.570> also<00:01:28.490> another

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
a lot of wobble problems also another

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.840 
a lot of wobble problems also another
one<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.299> watch<00:01:30.479> out<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.170> has<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:32.640> you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
one to watch out for it has and if you

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.600 
one to watch out for it has and if you
have<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> high<00:01:33.360> basic<00:01:34.110> game<00:01:34.409> your<00:01:35.009> attitude

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
have a high basic game your attitude

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.819 
have a high basic game your attitude
gain<00:01:35.850> tends<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> bit<00:01:37.049> lower<00:01:37.259> they<00:01:37.469> almost

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
gain tends to be a bit lower they almost

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.219 
gain tends to be a bit lower they almost
balance<00:01:38.369> each<00:01:38.490> other<00:01:38.789> like<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> sort<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.509> seesaw

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
balance each other like a sort of seesaw

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.929 
balance each other like a sort of seesaw
so<00:01:40.859> the<00:01:40.979> gains<00:01:41.159> I'm<00:01:41.310> going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.520> put<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.759> just

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
so the gains I'm going to put in just

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.249 
so the gains I'm going to put in just
now<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> say<00:01:42.479> these<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.840> ones<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.079> I've

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
now as I say these are ones that I've

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.830 
now as I say these are ones that I've
kind<00:01:43.469> of<00:01:43.530> gleamed<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.159> there<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.840> building

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
kind of gleamed on in there and building

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.539 
kind of gleamed on in there and building
a<00:01:45.960> lot<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> models<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.859> test<00:01:47.039> buying<00:01:47.340> them

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
a lot of models and test buying them

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.980 
a lot of models and test buying them
these<00:01:47.700> ones<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.119> feel<00:01:48.359> they're<00:01:48.539> very<00:01:48.570> good

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
these ones I feel they're very good

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.560 
these ones I feel they're very good
starting<00:01:49.530> point<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.009> there<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:51.149> oops

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
starting point so there is one oops

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:00.109 
starting point so there is one oops
wrong<00:01:53.359> is<00:01:54.359> one<00:01:54.780> six<00:01:55.530> five<00:01:56.840> four<00:01:57.840> pitch<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:59.119> six

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
wrong is one six five four pitch one six

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:08.779 
wrong is one six five four pitch one six
five<00:02:00.420> four<00:02:00.750> roll<00:02:01.549> then<00:02:03.619> 150<00:02:05.929> then<00:02:07.460> 150<00:02:08.460> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
five four roll then 150 then 150 and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.510 
five four roll then 150 then 150 and
then<00:02:09.570> your<00:02:09.780> attitude<00:02:09.990> gains<00:02:10.679> know<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.280> it's

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
then your attitude gains know that it's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.550 
then your attitude gains know that it's
against<00:02:11.820> what<00:02:12.060> they're<00:02:12.270> for<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.960> how<00:02:13.500> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
against what they're for is is how the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.460 
against what they're for is is how the
model<00:02:13.890> reacts<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.640> your<00:02:14.820> actual<00:02:15.060> input<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:16.020> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
model reacts to your actual input on the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.280 
model reacts to your actual input on the
controller<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:17.849> have<00:02:18.300> these<00:02:18.480> down<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:18.930> one

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
controller so I have these down at one

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.630 
controller so I have these down at one
hundred<00:02:19.620> these<00:02:19.739> are<00:02:19.920> very<00:02:20.040> good<00:02:20.189> for<00:02:20.400> starting

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
hundred these are very good for starting

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.910 
hundred these are very good for starting
if<00:02:21.120> you're<00:02:21.269> new<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.659> it<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:22.200> don't<00:02:22.409> want<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.799> be

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
if you're new to it you don't want to be

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.380 
if you're new to it you don't want to be
over<00:02:23.280> controlling<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.909> they're<00:02:24.060> also<00:02:24.180> very

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
over controlling it they're also very

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.179 
over controlling it they're also very
good<00:02:24.510> for<00:02:24.810> doing<00:02:24.930> aerial<00:02:25.200> photography<00:02:25.950> and

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
good for doing aerial photography and

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.910 
good for doing aerial photography and
now<00:02:26.909> as<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.329> see<00:02:27.480> they're<00:02:27.629> all<00:02:27.750> red<00:02:28.019> so<00:02:28.469> we've

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
now as you see they're all red so we've

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.470 
now as you see they're all red so we've
put<00:02:29.069> them<00:02:29.189> all<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.549> we<00:02:29.909> want<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.090> press<00:02:30.299> return

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
put them all in we want to press return

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.330 
put them all in we want to press return
and<00:02:30.930> then<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.469> old<00:02:31.560> will<00:02:31.769> black<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.250> that's

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
and then the old will black and that's

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.089 
and then the old will black and that's
them<00:02:32.609> written<00:02:33.120> em<00:02:33.510> now<00:02:34.379> you'll<00:02:34.590> also<00:02:34.739> notice

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
them written em now you'll also notice

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.160 
them written em now you'll also notice
these<00:02:35.370> little<00:02:35.430> drop<00:02:35.909> down<00:02:36.150> here<00:02:36.180> this<00:02:36.959> is<00:02:37.140> a

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
little bit of an advanced setting what

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.119 
little bit of an advanced setting what
this<00:02:39.060> says<00:02:39.329> is<00:02:39.599> if<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:40.349> want<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.680> sort<00:02:40.829> of<00:02:40.920> muck

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
this says is if you want to sort of muck

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.460 
this says is if you want to sort of muck

about with your games and a handy way to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.289 
about with your games and a handy way to
do<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.129> you<00:02:44.459> can<00:02:44.609> imagine<00:02:44.700> it'd<00:02:45.150> be<00:02:45.269> very

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
do it is you can imagine it'd be very

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.720 
do it is you can imagine it'd be very
awkward<00:02:45.659> -<00:02:46.019> every<00:02:46.260> time<00:02:46.439> you<00:02:46.560> made<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.769> game<00:02:47.220> to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
awkward - every time you made a game to

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.699 
awkward - every time you made a game to
have<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:48.000> land<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.420> model<00:02:48.840> plug<00:02:49.379> into<00:02:49.560> your

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
have to land the model plug into your

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.920 
have to land the model plug into your
computer<00:02:49.829> make<00:02:50.549> an<00:02:50.700> adjustment<00:02:50.790> fly<00:02:51.540> line

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
computer make an adjustment fly line

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.869 
computer make an adjustment fly line
that<00:02:52.170> plug<00:02:52.349> into<00:02:52.500> computer<00:02:53.099> so<00:02:53.609> what<00:02:53.730> these

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
that plug into computer so what these

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.879 
that plug into computer so what these
are<00:02:54.120> these<00:02:54.239> are<00:02:54.269> remote<00:02:54.780> gain<00:02:55.049> adjustments<00:02:55.739> so

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
are these are remote gain adjustments so

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.580 
are these are remote gain adjustments so
for<00:02:56.099> example<00:02:56.670> your<00:02:57.299> x1<00:02:57.840> channel<00:02:58.349> on<00:02:58.470> your

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
for example your x1 channel on your

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.289 
for example your x1 channel on your
radio<00:02:59.010> which<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.549> know<00:02:59.669> as<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.819> trimmer

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
radio which is you know as a trimmer

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.119 
radio which is you know as a trimmer
here<00:03:00.599> now<00:03:01.139> this<00:03:01.319> could<00:03:01.470> be<00:03:01.530> like<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:01.799> trimmer

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
here now this could be like a trimmer

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.940 
here now this could be like a trimmer
knob<00:03:02.400> on<00:03:02.639> another<00:03:03.359> aftermarket<00:03:04.200> radio<00:03:04.379> and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
knob on another aftermarket radio and

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.319 
knob on another aftermarket radio and
what<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.459> can<00:03:05.639> do<00:03:05.819> is<00:03:05.939> you<00:03:06.060> can<00:03:06.209> actually

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
what you can do is you can actually

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.309 
what you can do is you can actually
assign<00:03:07.109> a<00:03:07.470> channel<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:09.239> basically<00:03:09.659> act<00:03:10.019> as<00:03:10.260> a

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
assign a channel to basically act as a

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.490 
assign a channel to basically act as a
gain<00:03:10.980> adjustment<00:03:11.879> so<00:03:12.629> as<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:12.959> can<00:03:13.079> see<00:03:13.139> there

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
gain adjustment so as you can see there

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.500 
gain adjustment so as you can see there
I'm<00:03:13.739> now<00:03:13.919> moving<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.310> lever<00:03:14.579> and<00:03:15.090> see<00:03:15.419> the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
I'm now moving the lever and see the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.349 
I'm now moving the lever and see the
gains<00:03:15.750> moving<00:03:16.560> now<00:03:16.889> they're<00:03:17.099> moving<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.760> huge

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
gains moving now they're moving a huge

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.539 
gains moving now they're moving a huge
amount<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.930> should<00:03:19.049> actually<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.889> you<00:03:20.280> still

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
amount you should actually you you still

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.610 
amount you should actually you you still
need<00:03:20.730> move<00:03:21.329> your<00:03:21.599> gains<00:03:21.840> by<00:03:22.049> about<00:03:22.230> 10<00:03:22.590> percent

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
need move your gains by about 10 percent

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.610 
need move your gains by about 10 percent
at<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.400> time<00:03:23.879> so<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.150> idea<00:03:24.479> is<00:03:24.629> is<00:03:24.810> as<00:03:25.079> you<00:03:25.349> fly

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
at a time so the idea is is as you fly

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.920 
at a time so the idea is is as you fly
you<00:03:26.069> can<00:03:26.220> adjust<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.699> game<00:03:26.879> get<00:03:27.359> exactly

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
you can adjust the game get exactly

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.930 
you can adjust the game get exactly
where<00:03:28.169> you<00:03:28.349> want<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.859> and<00:03:29.010> then<00:03:29.069> basically

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
where you want it and then basically

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.819 
where you want it and then basically
lock<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.359> down<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.870> can<00:03:31.049> do<00:03:31.199> that<00:03:31.379> on<00:03:31.560> both

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
lock it down and you can do that on both

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.330 
lock it down and you can do that on both
your<00:03:32.729> remote<00:03:33.569> gain<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.079> you<00:03:34.290> would<00:03:34.409> just<00:03:34.440> do

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
your remote gain so you would just do

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.309 
your remote gain so you would just do
all<00:03:35.430> these<00:03:35.579> donuts<00:03:36.030> see<00:03:36.150> one<00:03:36.449> for<00:03:36.750> example<00:03:37.199> so

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
all these donuts see one for example so

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.020 
all these donuts see one for example so
you<00:03:37.349> do<00:03:37.590> all<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.859> your<00:03:38.099> pitch<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.549> roll<00:03:38.699> first

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
you do all you your pitch and roll first

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.270 
you do all you your pitch and roll first
then<00:03:39.540> go<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.870> do<00:03:39.989> your<00:03:40.019> yarn<00:03:40.409> vertical<00:03:41.099> and

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
then go and do your yarn vertical and

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.280 
then go and do your yarn vertical and
then<00:03:41.609> do<00:03:41.819> your<00:03:41.940> attitude<00:03:42.599> gains<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.199> then

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
then do your attitude gains and then

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.599 
then do your attitude gains and then
when<00:03:43.409> you're<00:03:43.530> happy<00:03:43.680> where<00:03:43.949> they<00:03:44.099> are<00:03:44.129> you

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
when you're happy where they are you

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.059 
when you're happy where they are you
just<00:03:44.849> inhibit<00:03:45.329> those<00:03:45.510> controls<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:46.680> let's

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
just inhibit those controls so let's
