00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:14.469
 hello to all lovers of video and gorses in the address 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.910
 new a mechanic and special edition 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.810
 china pen programs 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.490
 who will praise the fadin of the year to the fastest bank 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.410
 according to the pen of the rank in it i will introduce you 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.170
 games of the genre to pull 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.830
 who have postponed my imprint my case with 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.690
 that heart 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.510
 some positive what 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.400
 then negative but they all share 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.760
 one platform on which they lived 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.450
 an interest that did not discover 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.450
 perhaps I'll start from the very end 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.950
 to 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.299
 the first game which will be discussed 

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:52.920
 dollars to 2 ob 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.610
 for the game released in 1997 when 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.100
 arcade machines already with might and main rules ball 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.700
 then 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.750
 it would be great to offer players 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.810
 does it mean anything 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.900
 competitors 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.070
 what traditionally is askue 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.340
 of course in Japanese apogee 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.200
 so they decided to add besides 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.460
 arcade mode cbs mode 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.320
 revolution you ask 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.150
 terrible became a tour distract you guys 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.900
 offer to choose all the same characters 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.520
 which are available in portrait mode 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.510
 and run around the world performing stupid 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.320
 quests and killing scary enemies 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.930
 who resemble each other like siamese 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.850
 twins even have a bubble from the text 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.200
 brings associations with the games of the n9 series 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.580
 at the expense of state funds 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.550
 The developer apparently was lazy and 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.020
 adapt management 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.810
 and in the end you fight carried 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.240
 cannon penguins 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.619
 and with your own gamepad for the rest 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.870
 everything is pretty boring children of enemies collect 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.240
 bottles and items 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.409
 these questions 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.409
 fall asleep 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.450
 what it is and also turn around the torpedo 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.259
 regime 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.119
 everything is much more familiar 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.869
 several fighters to choose from and go 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.409
 anna nova all characters identical gloves 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.129
 Morocco 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.500
 probably in the same shop where they were bought 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.970
 it's strange because at least two 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.520
 costume for each fighter developers 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.170
 still not stingy 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.880
 Yes, and they look more or less decent 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.139
 true their design is nothing outstanding 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.230
 is not different 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.769
 and something like the characters of the series to 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.569
 about this 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.439
 Stanislav after playing a friend even 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.389
 one 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:34.490
 I will remember 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.920
 but remember how to create foul language 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.569
 crumpling on the joystick 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.659
 vain attempts how to get sick 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.489
 some kind of computer opponent 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.099
 besides jokes it's easier to play with real 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.879
 man rather than artificial 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.760
 intellect who does not know such 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.719
 expressions like a fair fight and being caught alone 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.120
 times for one of the hated 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.359
 combinations can safely put a cross 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.849
 all round 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.409
 should mention the rules they are 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.669
 are a square around the edges 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.430
 which is in the abyss and background for 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.459
 of all this magnificence serves 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.629
 static picture of children and how is it 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.120
 for each character there is a reverse 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.499
 network quality video 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.059
 as a rule according to which it serves and 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:17.229
 except as if he 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.329
 previously they can not offer anything 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.850
 he denied it 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.819
 I frankly say myself 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.349
 it’s also that you’ll have to start it 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.879
 about thirteen opponents about one 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.189
 of them worth telling 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.979
 in more detail do you see him 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.249
 although it exceeds the dimensions of any of 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:35.250
 characters 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.479
 and therefore they take June 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.729
 don't be surprised when all your hits will be 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.189
 walk past him here it's okay 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.549
 of things 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.089
 you do not suffer nervous 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:47.749
 drank in frustration and did not blink 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:49.599
 passing by you guides on the very 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.099
 complex 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.969
 major 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.950
 opal 2 game for you 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.010
 with her you will plunge into the unknown world 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.099
 becomes and psychological 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.099
 discomfort 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.269
 to 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.530
 the next game on my list 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.129
 also hell software 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.719
 and called Anapa much blake 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:18.369
 after viewing the introductory 

00:04:18.369 --> 00:04:20.489
 video starts hoping for at least 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.509
 good game 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.180
 there are so many samurai blood and weapons 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.469
 the fact that the game was not transferred to 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:28.969
 English itself about something yes 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:31.199
 says usually this is either not 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.180
 recognized masterpiece of market criticism 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.850
 March 3, a rare shit from which 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.670
 worth staying away 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.000
 in our case as they say neither fish nor 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.980
 meat entourage japan samurai and other 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.390
 representatives of the warlike 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.780
 population it is of course good in the game even 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.900
 there is a pro pimping woman 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.450
 pulls down try this to overcome his 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.520
 person given 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.080
 in general, the reserve will win not weak 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.740
 but could or developers 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.680
 I use it completely 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.210
 forced to upset you 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.940
 from last place in my pirate parade 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.470
 Bushido blade2 saves only what it does not 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.940
 causes self-loathing work 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.060
 fighters for their time hold on 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.180
 due level 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.789
 true again and stock design 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.889
 intermediate opponents cannot 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.500
 look the same except the colors of them 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.650
 different don't kill them usually need 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.300
 several times the plot character 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.830
 one thing is enough 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.250
 try to make it neither experienced 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.220
 to the player who first launches the game 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.059
 generally seem strange 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.389
 that the game belongs to the genre of fingers 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.210
 no strips of life 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.949
 no time reference 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.290
 and nothing at all 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.259
 except the sparsely furnished arena 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.819
 and couples fighters stupidly holding their 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:46.289
 balls overhead 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.779
 remember i said that in stomped pompon 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:50.830
 the case of a static picture is not the most 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.330
 better quality 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.950
 here the developers took this into account 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.849
 got rid of the disease 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.949
 it is simple 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.900
 around for example vigorously gaping emptiness 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.220
 but you can do illegal logging and 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.009
 bamboo 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.099
 some arenas have leg level 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:09.169
 carry it that way 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.300
 plus or minus is the case of everyone who 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.139
 ever in this group personally seems to me 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.580
 funny opportunity to wait until the project 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.270
 or the very bottom of the runners to you and then 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.599
 push him from the top 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.180
 that was the beauty of bushido and 2 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.250
 the player himself is looking for differences 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.650
 who have provided 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.960
 developers 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.020
 after character selection screen 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.690
 every time he offers to choose 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.310
 weapons katsavu to receive a two-handed sword 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.600
 and so on 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.940
 but for some reason the gun mentioned above 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.740
 choose a sort of challenger 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.229
 the game has no complicated club or 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:45.680
 something similar 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.620
 two buttons are responsible for hitting 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.189
 forget the rest 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:50.909
 having actions for example can 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:52.979
 get two balls and password at once 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.860
 hateful foe into small 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.650
 pieces intro video 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.650
 all pledged there we were promised a liter of blood 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.970
 where we have to retreat from 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.509
 not special effects 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:06.279
 characters move like tired shatura 

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:07.479
 after the shift 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:09.449
 useless button responsiveness 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.800
 only adds color 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.300
 Well, not surprising that when well 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.620
 calculated beat 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.710
 the enemy immediately goes to bed 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.919
 with this poll your ball towards 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:21.139
 getting sick of all enemies and seeing the secret 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:23.289
 the scenes are clear and silly phrases 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:23.910
 like 

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.840
 on my brother and why came there dangerous 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.449
 no, I'm coming with you, mom sent me 

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:31.509
 we are good 

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:34.509
 just be careful you can be killed 

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:39.169
 do you get davos kill her 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:42.040
 will consider such tracks and all over again 

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.610
 if i was allowed is sensible 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.270
 dictionary then after the word boredom i would 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.379
 wrote 

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:50.379
 not always 

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:53.430
 Here comes the end of the first part of the issue 

00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:55.969
 in the second part I will introduce you to 

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:58.330
 all three games so for the first 

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.889
