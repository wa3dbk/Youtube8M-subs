going to be playing the root note of the
chord<00:00:12.480> that's<00:00:12.719> written<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:14.190> bass<00:00:14.370> clef

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
chord that's written in the bass clef

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.880 
chord that's written in the bass clef
with<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> left<00:00:15.179> hand<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.320> right<00:00:16.590> hand

with the left hand and in the right hand

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.010 
with the left hand and in the right hand
I'm<00:00:17.100> instead<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.730> playing<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.060> typical<00:00:18.480> major

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
I'm instead of playing the typical major

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.650 
I'm instead of playing the typical major
chord<00:00:19.380> I'm<00:00:19.500> going<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.800> add<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.820> second<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.510> it

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
chord I'm going to add the second to it

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.250 
chord I'm going to add the second to it
so<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:21.960> got<00:00:22.730> we're<00:00:23.730> going<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.910> play<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.810> second

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
so we got we're going to play the second

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.920 
so we got we're going to play the second
third<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.680> fifth<00:00:26.099> together<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.029> then<00:00:27.660> move

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
third and fifth together and then move

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.550 
third and fifth together and then move
down<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> first<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.880> simple<00:00:30.750> 8<00:00:31.170> note

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
down to the first in a simple 8 note

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.930

00:00:43.740 --> 00:01:08.480 
song away in the manger and I'll be
playing<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> key<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.210> F

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.080
