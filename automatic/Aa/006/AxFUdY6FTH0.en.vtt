tutorial<00:00:05.940> on<00:00:06.450> my<00:00:06.899> backflip<00:00:07.830> jump<00:00:08.960> see<00:00:10.280> so<00:00:11.280> far

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
tutorial on my backflip jump see so far

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.340 
tutorial on my backflip jump see so far
it<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.420> kind<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.349> beta<00:00:13.740> jump<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:15.109> this<00:00:16.109> one

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
it is a kind of beta jump it this one

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.109 
it is a kind of beta jump it this one
works<00:00:16.650> all<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.920> time<00:00:17.010> because<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.850> took<00:00:17.970> me

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
works all the time because it took me

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.050 
works all the time because it took me
like<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.359> few<00:00:18.660> hours<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.140> make<00:00:19.560> but<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.609> will<00:00:20.880> run

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
like a few hours to make but I will run

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.060 
like a few hours to make but I will run
down<00:00:21.240> how<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> make<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.380> jump<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.920> guys

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
down how I make this jump so you guys

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.460 
down how I make this jump so you guys
can<00:00:23.250> try<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.699> make<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.850> out<00:00:24.090> well<00:00:24.750> first

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
can try it and make it out well first

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.529 
can try it and make it out well first
off<00:00:25.650> let<00:00:25.980> me<00:00:26.010> remove<00:00:26.539> these<00:00:28.609> ok<00:00:29.609> basically<00:00:29.849> you

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
off let me remove these ok basically you

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.630 
off let me remove these ok basically you
got<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.779> get<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> straight<00:00:31.470> path<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.279> start<00:00:32.520> off

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
got to get a straight path to start off

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.940 
got to get a straight path to start off
for<00:00:32.880> practicing<00:00:33.480> making<00:00:33.630> them<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.350> good<00:00:34.590> 90

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
for practicing making them so good 90

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.400 
for practicing making them so good 90
degrees<00:00:35.430> um<00:00:36.210> straight<00:00:36.809> off<00:00:36.899> from<00:00:37.050> here<00:00:37.260> would

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
degrees um straight off from here would

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.310 
degrees um straight off from here would
work<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.450> start<00:00:39.450> off<00:00:39.540> with<00:00:39.690> wall<00:00:39.960> curves

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
work and start off with wall curves

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.690 
work and start off with wall curves
first<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.579> need<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:42.210> wall<00:00:43.110> curve<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:44.160> you

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
first you need a wall curve that you

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.510 
first you need a wall curve that you
switched<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.360> about<00:00:45.539> 40<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.410> 90<00:00:46.920> degrees<00:00:47.219> up

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
switched to about 40 for 90 degrees up

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.049 
switched to about 40 for 90 degrees up
and<00:00:47.760> down<00:00:48.590> you<00:00:49.590> want<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.860> put<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.129> 15<00:00:50.700> degrees

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
and down you want to put it 15 degrees

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.910 
and down you want to put it 15 degrees
back<00:00:51.570> from<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.899> put<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:54.930> right<00:00:55.140> about

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
back from that and put it right about

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.470 
back from that and put it right about
here<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:57.210> would<00:00:57.539> say<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:59.210> what<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.270> would<00:01:00.359> do

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
here I would say and what you would do

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.310 
here I would say and what you would do
is<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.660> spawn<00:01:01.079> another<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:03.960> would<00:01:04.140> go

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
is you spawn another one and it would go

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:13.910 
is you spawn another one and it would go
about<00:01:06.049> from<00:01:07.049> flat<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.220> would<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:09.350> about<00:01:12.590> 20<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
about from flat it would be about 20 to

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.090 
about from flat it would be about 20 to
30<00:01:14.159> degree<00:01:15.060> angle<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:18.560> sorry<00:01:19.560> having<00:01:19.920> some

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
30 degree angle so sorry having some

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.320 
30 degree angle so sorry having some
technical<00:01:20.220> difficulties<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:21.780> um<00:01:23.000> 30<00:01:24.000> degree

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
technical difficulties but um 30 degree

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.859 
technical difficulties but um 30 degree
angle<00:01:24.360> up<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.619> first<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:27.360> you'd<00:01:27.570> go

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
angle up to it first and then you'd go

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.630 
angle up to it first and then you'd go
for<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.229> third<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.920> only<00:01:29.040> takes<00:01:29.250> three

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
for the third one it only takes three

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.030 
for the third one it only takes three
Walters<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:32.130> last<00:01:32.400> one<00:01:32.729> goes<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.420> about

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
Walters and the last one goes to about

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.450 
Walters and the last one goes to about
arm<00:01:35.479> up<00:01:37.220> about<00:01:38.220> 20<00:01:38.670> degree<00:01:39.270> angle<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.140> it

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
arm up about 20 degree angle up to it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.340 
arm up about 20 degree angle up to it
see<00:01:41.460> what<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.790> want<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:43.009> though<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.490> edges<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
see what you want is though the edges of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.990 
see what you want is though the edges of
this<00:01:46.820> just<00:01:47.820> barely<00:01:48.659> sticking<00:01:49.259> out<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.000> it'll

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
this just barely sticking out and it'll

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.719 
this just barely sticking out and it'll
show<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.720> almost<00:01:51.990> there<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.430> got

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
show that it's almost there so you got

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.520 
show that it's almost there so you got
to<00:01:53.820> keep<00:01:53.850> when<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.750> start<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.350> got<00:01:55.500> to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
to keep when you start this you got to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.249 
to keep when you start this you got to
keep<00:01:55.680> adjusting<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.490> until<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.909> works<00:01:57.259> when

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
keep adjusting this until it works when

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.109 
keep adjusting this until it works when
you<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.469> all<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.680> together<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.640> go<00:01:59.820> into

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
you get all that together you go into

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.209 
you get all that together you go into
gadgets<00:02:00.680> and<00:02:02.509> cannon<00:02:03.509> man<00:02:03.840> cannons<00:02:04.259> take<00:02:05.040> out

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
gadgets and cannon man cannons take out

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.180 
gadgets and cannon man cannons take out
a<00:02:05.250> grav<00:02:05.759> lift<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:07.020> would<00:02:07.200> put<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.409> right

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
a grav lift and I would put it right

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.029 
a grav lift and I would put it right
about<00:02:08.429> where<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.970> level<00:02:09.360> thing<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:10.080> little

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
about where this level thing is a little

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.030 
about where this level thing is a little
bit<00:02:11.160> higher<00:02:11.400> maybe<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.120> put<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.810> five<00:02:13.379> degree

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
bit higher maybe and put it five degree

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.100 
bit higher maybe and put it five degree
is<00:02:14.099> backwards<00:02:14.849> heading<00:02:15.239> away<00:02:15.360> from<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.750> jump

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
is backwards heading away from the jump

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.009 
is backwards heading away from the jump
and<00:02:16.939> then<00:02:17.939> what<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.299> would<00:02:18.390> do<00:02:18.569> is<00:02:18.810> you'd

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
and then what you would do is you'd

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.390 
and then what you would do is you'd
start<00:02:19.349> testing<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:21.019> see<00:02:22.019> most<00:02:22.769> of<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.010> time<00:02:23.159> it

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
start testing it see most of the time it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.550 
start testing it see most of the time it
takes<00:02:23.609> a<00:02:23.909> certain<00:02:24.269> speed<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:25.049> hit<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.349> right<00:02:25.500> at

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
takes a certain speed to hit it right at

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.860 
takes a certain speed to hit it right at
first<00:02:25.980> but<00:02:26.310> if<00:02:26.609> you<00:02:26.879> keep<00:02:27.090> working<00:02:27.359> at<00:02:27.659> it<00:02:27.689> you

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
first but if you keep working at it you

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.059 
first but if you keep working at it you
can<00:02:27.900> make<00:02:28.049> it<00:02:28.260> better<00:02:28.349> see<00:02:28.590> mine<00:02:28.799> right<00:02:29.040> now

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
can make it better see mine right now

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.640 
can make it better see mine right now
sloppy<00:02:29.609> but<00:02:30.090> as<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.329> see<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.959> gets<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.260> basic

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
sloppy but as you see it gets the basic

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.360 
sloppy but as you see it gets the basic
rotation<00:02:32.250> down<00:02:32.599> so<00:02:33.769> basically<00:02:34.769> I'm<00:02:35.010> going<00:02:35.250> to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
rotation down so basically I'm going to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.129 
rotation down so basically I'm going to
even<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:35.909> out<00:02:36.090> now<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:38.299> hopefully<00:02:39.299> get<00:02:39.930> this

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
even this out now and hopefully get this

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.379 
even this out now and hopefully get this
to<00:02:40.470> work<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.799> bit<00:02:40.950> better<00:02:41.250> see<00:02:41.970> all<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.180> gotta

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
to work a bit better see all you gotta

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.750 
to work a bit better see all you gotta
do<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.540> keep<00:02:42.750> on<00:02:42.930> editing<00:02:43.409> the<00:02:44.040> jump<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.519> way

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
do is keep on editing the jump this way

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.259 
do is keep on editing the jump this way
um<00:02:45.980> usually<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.010> find<00:02:47.099> it's<00:02:47.489> easier<00:02:47.609> when<00:02:48.090> the

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
um usually I find it's easier when the

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.289 
um usually I find it's easier when the
jump<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.689> more<00:02:48.930> compact<00:02:49.560> because<00:02:49.889> it<00:02:50.670> helps

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
jump is more compact because it helps

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.789 
jump is more compact because it helps
with<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:53.180> making<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.389> better<00:02:54.599> spin<00:02:55.049> like<00:02:55.560> I

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
with the making a better spin like I

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.949 
with the making a better spin like I
found<00:02:56.280> out<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.669> more<00:02:56.819> compact<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.450> make<00:02:57.720> it

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
found out the more compact you make it

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.909 
found out the more compact you make it
the<00:02:58.790> faster<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.970> spin<00:03:00.329> will<00:03:00.510> be<00:03:00.629> and<00:03:00.989> more

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
the faster the spin will be and more

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.849 
the faster the spin will be and more
like<00:03:02.340> how<00:03:02.489> far<00:03:02.730> their<00:03:02.970> you'll<00:03:03.120> make<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:03.419> around

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
like how far their you'll make it around

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.170 
like how far their you'll make it around
currently<00:03:04.859> working<00:03:05.040> on<00:03:05.250> making<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.760> double

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
currently working on making a double

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.740 
currently working on making a double
backflip<00:03:06.720> jump<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.209> pretty<00:03:09.480> hard<00:03:09.629> to

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
backflip jump and it is pretty hard to

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.690 
backflip jump and it is pretty hard to
make<00:03:09.989> but<00:03:10.260> if<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.739> can<00:03:10.980> make<00:03:11.099> it<00:03:11.159> I<00:03:11.430> will<00:03:11.549> put<00:03:11.669> a

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
make but if I can make it I will put a

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.599 
make but if I can make it I will put a
tutorial<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:12.389> how<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.599> make<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.019> as<00:03:13.230> well<00:03:13.609> see

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
tutorial on how to make that as well see

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.530 
tutorial on how to make that as well see
for<00:03:14.939> this<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.359> would<00:03:15.959> say<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:17.310> has<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.819> be<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.479> a

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
for this I would say it has to be like a

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.629 
for this I would say it has to be like a
good<00:03:18.780> tiny<00:03:19.229> little<00:03:19.470> crack<00:03:19.859> between<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.519> other

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
good tiny little crack between the other

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.339 
good tiny little crack between the other
two<00:03:20.790> piece<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.449> get<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.870> start<00:03:22.079> spinning

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
two piece to get it to start spinning

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.909 
two piece to get it to start spinning
good<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.400> if<00:03:23.639> this<00:03:23.879> also<00:03:24.419> could<00:03:24.989> affect<00:03:25.349> it<00:03:25.560> so

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
good and if this also could affect it so

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:30.439 
good and if this also could affect it so
I<00:03:26.220> recommend<00:03:27.150> trying<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:28.109> so<00:03:28.729> I<00:03:29.729> all<00:03:30.209> it

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
I recommend trying that so I all it

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.129 
I recommend trying that so I all it
takes<00:03:30.659> is<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.870> long<00:03:31.290> time<00:03:31.889> to<00:03:32.159> place<00:03:32.669> together

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
takes is a long time to place together

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.789 
takes is a long time to place together
all<00:03:34.139> you<00:03:34.349> gotta<00:03:34.500> do<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.620> remember<00:03:34.919> is<00:03:35.340> um<00:03:36.799> to

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
all you gotta do is remember is um to

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.559 
all you gotta do is remember is um to
put<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.419> 90<00:03:39.419> degree<00:03:39.720> or<00:03:40.199> the<00:03:40.440> first<00:03:41.209> first<00:03:42.209> wall

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
put it 90 degree or the first first wall

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.800 
put it 90 degree or the first first wall
curved<00:03:43.049> goes<00:03:43.650> 90<00:03:44.159> degrees<00:03:44.489> up<00:03:44.849> and<00:03:45.090> down<00:03:45.269> then

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
curved goes 90 degrees up and down then

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.649 
curved goes 90 degrees up and down then
you<00:03:45.900> move<00:03:46.049> it<00:03:46.169> 15<00:03:46.650> degrees<00:03:47.040> back<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:48.120> next<00:03:48.389> one

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
you move it 15 degrees back the next one

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.069 
you move it 15 degrees back the next one
is<00:03:48.900> 30<00:03:49.590> degrees<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.940> last<00:03:51.180> one<00:03:51.389> is<00:03:51.419> 20

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
is 30 degrees and the last one is 20

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.399 
is 30 degrees and the last one is 20
degrees<00:03:52.229> or<00:03:52.889> 25<00:03:53.400> degrees<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.180> what<00:03:55.169> you<00:03:55.260> got

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
degrees or 25 degrees and what you got

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.349 
degrees or 25 degrees and what you got
to<00:03:55.470> do<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.650> make<00:03:55.859> it<00:03:55.889> in<00:03:56.159> this<00:03:56.370> shape<00:03:57.000> or

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
to do is make it in this shape or

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.339 
to do is make it in this shape or
fashion<00:03:57.900> whatever<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.829> want<00:03:58.979> to<00:03:59.069> do<00:03:59.310> and<00:04:00.349> all

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
fashion whatever you want to do and all

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.379 
fashion whatever you want to do and all
you<00:04:01.739> do<00:04:01.889> is<00:04:01.979> keep<00:04:02.159> editing<00:04:02.639> it<00:04:02.819> until<00:04:03.150> it

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
you do is keep editing it until it

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.179 
you do is keep editing it until it
starts<00:04:03.659> working<00:04:03.840> like<00:04:04.260> this<00:04:04.470> one<00:04:04.709> works

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
starts working like this one works

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.860 
starts working like this one works
pretty<00:04:05.459> accurately<00:04:06.650> for<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.709> most<00:04:07.919> part<00:04:08.870> so

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
pretty accurately for the most part so

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.860 
pretty accurately for the most part so
it<00:04:10.290> took<00:04:10.500> me<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:11.009> feel<00:04:11.639> not<00:04:12.180> too<00:04:12.359> long<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.599> make

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
it took me I feel not too long to make

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.750 
it took me I feel not too long to make
right<00:04:13.079> here

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.350 

so<00:04:18.760> let<00:04:19.030> me<00:04:19.060> show<00:04:19.359> you<00:04:19.390> one<00:04:19.780> last<00:04:19.930> time<00:04:20.130> on<00:04:21.360> how

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
so let me show you one last time on how

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.900 
so let me show you one last time on how
this<00:04:22.570> would<00:04:22.750> be<00:04:22.960> Oh<00:04:24.360> God<00:04:26.070> let's<00:04:27.070> see<00:04:27.220> it'll

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
this would be Oh God let's see it'll

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.060 
this would be Oh God let's see it'll
either<00:04:28.030> make<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.420> do<00:04:28.660> barrel<00:04:29.020> rolls<00:04:29.170> or<00:04:29.680> other

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
either make you do barrel rolls or other

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.640 
either make you do barrel rolls or other
things<00:04:30.870> but<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:31.960> just<00:04:32.080> got<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.260> keep<00:04:32.440> on

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
things but you just got to keep on

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.340 
things but you just got to keep on
editing<00:04:33.100> this<00:04:33.580> main<00:04:34.030> lip<00:04:34.390> reading<00:04:34.900> these

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
editing this main lip reading these

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.590 
editing this main lip reading these
don't<00:04:36.070> like<00:04:36.490> change<00:04:36.790> it<00:04:37.060> but<00:04:37.240> not<00:04:37.450> all<00:04:37.570> that

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
don't like change it but not all that

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.630 
don't like change it but not all that
much<00:04:37.840> like<00:04:38.350> because<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.740> basics<00:04:39.160> is<00:04:39.370> you

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
much like because the basics is you

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.820 
much like because the basics is you
drive<00:04:39.910> up<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.270> starts<00:04:40.360> curving<00:04:40.780> you<00:04:41.050> this<00:04:41.620> will

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
drive up it starts curving you this will

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.980 
drive up it starts curving you this will
pick<00:04:42.040> you<00:04:42.190> up<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.640> then<00:04:42.670> hit<00:04:43.270> you<00:04:43.390> off<00:04:43.540> of<00:04:43.780> this

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
pick you up and then hit you off of this

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:52.540 
pick you up and then hit you off of this
and<00:04:44.290> continue<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:45.010> motion
