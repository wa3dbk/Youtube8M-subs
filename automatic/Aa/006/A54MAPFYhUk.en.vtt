00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
we're going to work the biceps in

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.150 
we're going to work the biceps in
different<00:03:24.660> angle<00:03:25.050> seven<00:03:25.440> repetitions<00:03:26.010> each

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
different angle seven repetitions each

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.920 
different angle seven repetitions each
all<00:03:26.490> right<00:03:26.640> we're<00:03:27.000> going<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.150> go<00:03:27.300> all<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.660> way

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
up and all the way down we got it seven

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.170 
up and all the way down we got it seven
times<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:32.460> what<00:03:32.640> we<00:03:32.730> want<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:32.970> think<00:03:33.120> about

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
times and what we want to think about

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.300 
times and what we want to think about
here<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.660> keeping<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.080> collarbone<00:03:34.710> wide<00:03:35.010> and

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
here is keeping the collarbone wide and

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.450 
here is keeping the collarbone wide and
down<00:03:35.490> nice<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:35.850> open<00:03:37.130> shoulders<00:03:38.130> away<00:03:38.310> from

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
down nice and open shoulders away from

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.630 
down nice and open shoulders away from
ears<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.330> belly<00:03:40.290> lifted<00:03:41.010> now<00:03:41.340> we're<00:03:41.490> going<00:03:41.580> to

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
ears and belly lifted now we're going to

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.820 
ears and belly lifted now we're going to
come<00:03:41.790> halfway<00:03:42.090> up<00:03:42.360> and<00:03:42.750> all<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.380> way<00:03:43.440> down<00:03:43.500> and

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
time I lift up my arms I think about

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.560 
time I lift up my arms I think about
lifting<00:03:50.070> my<00:03:50.340> pelvic<00:03:50.760> floor<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.180> I'm<00:03:51.270> really

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
lifting my pelvic floor so I'm really

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.470 
lifting my pelvic floor so I'm really
exercising<00:03:52.230> my<00:03:52.500> abdominals<00:03:52.970> while<00:03:53.970> I'm

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
exercising my abdominals while I'm

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.320 
exercising my abdominals while I'm
exercising<00:03:55.140> my<00:03:55.500> biceps<00:03:56.040> one<00:03:56.370> more<00:03:56.670> okay<00:03:57.030> and

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
exercising my biceps one more okay and

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.290 
exercising my biceps one more okay and
hold<00:03:58.020> now<00:03:58.620> they're<00:03:58.800> getting<00:03:58.920> tired<00:03:59.220> right<00:03:59.520> all

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
hold now they're getting tired right all

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.560 
hold now they're getting tired right all
the<00:04:00.630> way<00:04:00.750> up<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.080> halfway<00:04:01.920> down<00:04:02.250> stuff<00:04:02.820> good

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
the way up and halfway down stuff good

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.410 
the way up and halfway down stuff good
all<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.320> way<00:04:04.410> up<00:04:04.560> half<00:04:05.070> way<00:04:05.400> done<00:04:05.850> so<00:04:06.240> you're

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
all the way up half way done so you're

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.830 
all the way up half way done so you're
really<00:04:06.630> taking<00:04:06.930> out<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.380> vice

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
really taking out the vice

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.770 
really taking out the vice
at<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.470> most<00:04:08.830> difficult<00:04:09.459> angle<00:04:10.000> right<00:04:10.540> and

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
at the most difficult angle right and

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.020 
at the most difficult angle right and
holding<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.709> there<00:04:11.920> for<00:04:12.160> just<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.400> millisecond

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
holding it there for just a millisecond

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.970 
holding it there for just a millisecond
we're<00:04:13.629> really<00:04:13.810> trained<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.290> bicep<00:04:14.620> muscle<00:04:14.920> i

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
we're really trained the bicep muscle i

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.439 
we're really trained the bicep muscle i
think<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.340> biceps<00:04:15.700> are<00:04:15.849> cranky<00:04:16.239> and

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
think that biceps are cranky and

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.420 
think that biceps are cranky and
difficult<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.410> train<00:04:17.680> because<00:04:17.979> they're<00:04:18.280> big

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
difficult to train because they're big

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.370 
difficult to train because they're big
and<00:04:18.639> they're<00:04:18.699> strong<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:19.600> we<00:04:19.690> can<00:04:19.840> really<00:04:19.989> tax

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
and they're strong so we can really tax

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.020 
and they're strong so we can really tax
them<00:04:21.660> one<00:04:22.660> more<00:04:22.690> all<00:04:23.320> right<00:04:23.440> yep<00:04:23.830> okay<00:04:24.430> next

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
them one more all right yep okay next

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.390 
them one more all right yep okay next
small<00:04:25.990> but<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:26.410> very<00:04:26.710> important<00:04:27.130> muscle

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
small but the very important muscle

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.530 
small but the very important muscle
group<00:04:27.550> we're<00:04:27.639> going<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.820> hit<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:27.970> shoulders

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
group we're going to hit the shoulders

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.189 
group we're going to hit the shoulders

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
right so arms up laps down belly tight

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.930 
right so arms up laps down belly tight
and<00:04:32.650> all<00:04:32.889> we're<00:04:33.100> going<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.250> do<00:04:33.370> is<00:04:33.460> an<00:04:33.550> overhead

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
and all we're going to do is an overhead

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.170 
and all we're going to do is an overhead
press<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.979> back<00:04:35.979> down<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.430> this<00:04:36.520> 90<00:04:36.910> degrees

press and back down to this 90 degrees
overhead<00:04:37.750> press<00:04:38.110> now<00:04:38.740> it<00:04:38.860> doesn't<00:04:39.160> mean<00:04:39.280> that

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
overhead press now it doesn't mean that

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.610 
overhead press now it doesn't mean that
if<00:04:39.669> it<00:04:39.820> goes<00:04:40.000> down<00:04:40.060> here<00:04:40.570> it's<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.780> bad<00:04:40.960> thing<00:04:41.260> in

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
if it goes down here it's a bad thing in

if it goes down here it's a bad thing in
all<00:04:41.830> honesty<00:04:42.370> it's<00:04:42.490> a<00:04:42.550> little<00:04:42.760> bit<00:04:42.880> more<00:04:43.210> work

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
all honesty it's a little bit more work

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.540 
all honesty it's a little bit more work
for<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:43.960> shoulders<00:04:44.440> if<00:04:44.950> you<00:04:45.130> go<00:04:45.310> lower

so if we do this three sets of 10 to 15

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.940 
so if we do this three sets of 10 to 15
reps<00:06:18.390> again<00:06:19.170> nine<00:06:19.380> minutes<00:06:19.680> you<00:06:19.800> have<00:06:19.830> a
