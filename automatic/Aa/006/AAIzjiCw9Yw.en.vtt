00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
tennis lesson addressing today how much

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.540 
tennis lesson addressing today how much
topspin<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.530> guys<00:00:10.710> should<00:00:10.950> be<00:00:10.980> hitting<00:00:11.309> from

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
topspin you guys should be hitting from

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.730 
topspin you guys should be hitting from
the<00:00:11.700> baseline<00:00:12.170> we're<00:00:13.170> going<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.349> look<00:00:13.469> at<00:00:13.590> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
the baseline we're going to look at the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.109 
the baseline we're going to look at the
forehand<00:00:14.130> side<00:00:14.429> today<00:00:14.900> I<00:00:16.520> love<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.699> idea<00:00:18.060> that

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
forehand side today I love the idea that

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.150 
forehand side today I love the idea that
you<00:00:18.359> guys<00:00:18.539> need<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.410> good<00:00:20.100> idea<00:00:20.850> number<00:00:21.480> one<00:00:21.720> of

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
you guys need a good idea number one of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.640 
you guys need a good idea number one of
what<00:00:23.160> type<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.430> swing<00:00:23.939> path<00:00:24.240> produces<00:00:25.080> topspin

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
what type of swing path produces topspin

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.140 
what type of swing path produces topspin
I<00:00:26.340> still<00:00:27.119> tend<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.570> see<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> lot<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> people

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
I still tend to see a lot of people

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.179 
I still tend to see a lot of people
trying<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.269> hit<00:00:30.539> topspin<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.410> trying<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.009> do

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
trying to hit topspin but trying to do

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.750 
trying to hit topspin but trying to do
it<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> very<00:00:33.180> level<00:00:33.950> swing<00:00:34.950> path<00:00:35.190> meaning

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
it with a very level swing path meaning

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.180 
it with a very level swing path meaning
the<00:00:35.850> racket<00:00:36.360> sets<00:00:36.750> directly<00:00:37.469> behind<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the racket sets directly behind the

the racket sets directly behind the
tennis<00:00:38.489> ball<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.200> move<00:00:40.200> straight<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
tennis ball and move straight on the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
tennis ball and move straight on the
back<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.940> ball<00:00:42.090> that's<00:00:42.329> really<00:00:42.420> never

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
back of the ball that's really never

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.090 
back of the ball that's really never
going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.350> produce<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:44.160> lot<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> topspin<00:00:46.100> so

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
going to produce a lot of topspin so

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.549 
going to produce a lot of topspin so
kind<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:48.120> understanding<00:00:48.410> that<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
kind of really understanding that the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.830 
kind of really understanding that the
racket<00:00:50.010> needs<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.520> get<00:00:50.700> below<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.239> tennis

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
racket needs to get below the tennis

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.389 
racket needs to get below the tennis
ball<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.440> work<00:00:53.190> upwards<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:56.129> main

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
ball and work upwards on it is the main

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.630 
ball and work upwards on it is the main
key<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.090> guys<00:00:57.270> now<00:00:58.219> there's<00:00:59.219> kind<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
key for you guys now there's kind of a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.319 
key for you guys now there's kind of a
scale<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.660> topspin<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.590> guys<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:02.070> use<00:01:02.489> to

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
scale of topspin you guys can use to

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.780 
scale of topspin you guys can use to
help<00:01:03.570> judge<00:01:04.019> how<00:01:04.470> much<00:01:04.769> topspin<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.610> guys

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
help judge how much topspin you guys

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.950 
help judge how much topspin you guys
should<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.240> hitting<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.460> 11<00:01:09.390> being<00:01:09.810> as

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
should be hitting you know 11 being as

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.870 
should be hitting you know 11 being as
flat<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.890> hit<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.460> guys<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.820> see

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
flat as I can hit so you guys can see

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.640 
flat as I can hit so you guys can see
I'm<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> set<00:01:12.630> my<00:01:12.659> racket<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> height

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
I'm going to set my racket at the height

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
I'm going to set my racket at the height
of<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.890> ball<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:15.049> my<00:01:16.049> strings<00:01:16.530> went<00:01:17.250> very

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
of the ball and my strings went very

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.230 
of the ball and my strings went very
level<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.270> ball<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.409> flat<00:01:20.369> now<00:01:20.939> so

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
level at the ball so that is flat now so

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.039 
level at the ball so that is flat now so
if<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.509> start<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.900> drop<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.229> little<00:01:22.560> bit<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:24.049> just

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
if I start to drop a little bit I just

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.170 
if I start to drop a little bit I just
started<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.740> produce<00:01:25.950> some<00:01:26.310> topspin<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:27.030> I

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
started to produce some topspin if I

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.520 
started to produce some topspin if I
drop<00:01:27.509> lower<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:29.570> started<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> produce<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.140> lot<00:01:31.350> of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
drop lower I started to produce a lot of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.859 
drop lower I started to produce a lot of
topspin<00:01:32.009> now<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.180> actually<00:01:33.600> go<00:01:33.810> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
topspin now we can actually go to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.569 
topspin now we can actually go to
extreme<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.390> start<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> work<00:01:36.890> too<00:01:37.890> much<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
extreme and start to work too much and

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.899 
extreme and start to work too much and
now<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.570> ball<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.159> barely<00:01:41.159> getting<00:01:41.579> over<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
now this ball is barely getting over the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.460 
now this ball is barely getting over the
net<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.659> there's<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.619> happy<00:01:44.189> middle<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.970> there

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
net so there's a happy middle in there

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.819 
net so there's a happy middle in there
for<00:01:46.470> all<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.040> guys<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.520> girls<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.869> terms<00:01:49.649> of

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
what swing path to use to to be able to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.760 
what swing path to use to to be able to
get<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> right<00:01:54.149> amount<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.810> topspin<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:55.649> your

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
get the right amount of topspin for your

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.940 
get the right amount of topspin for your
game<00:01:56.119> so<00:01:57.119> what<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> would<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.990> guys<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.500> do

game so what I would like you guys to do

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.780 
game so what I would like you guys to do
is<00:01:59.509> have<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> much<00:02:00.930> better<00:02:01.259> understanding<00:02:01.790> of

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
is have a much better understanding of

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.690 
is have a much better understanding of
where<00:02:03.149> your<00:02:03.420> racket<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.590> terms<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.460> being

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
where your racket is in terms of being

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.190 
where your racket is in terms of being
below<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.570> ball<00:02:06.860> before<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.310> hit<00:02:09.020> like<00:02:10.020> I

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
below the ball before you hit like I

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.930 
below the ball before you hit like I
said<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.500> think<00:02:10.830> all<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.430> are<00:02:11.459> attempting

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
said I think all of you are attempting

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.880 
said I think all of you are attempting
some<00:02:12.360> topspin<00:02:12.870> but<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.200> still<00:02:13.560> don't

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
some topspin but you still don't

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.980 
some topspin but you still don't
know<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.310> you're<00:02:14.430> staying<00:02:14.819> very<00:02:15.150> level<00:02:15.810> with

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
know that you're staying very level with

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.620 
know that you're staying very level with
the<00:02:16.110> ball<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.980> start<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.520> test<00:02:17.790> yourself<00:02:18.000> start

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
the ball so start to test yourself start

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.830 
the ball so start to test yourself start
to<00:02:18.750> let<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.200> racket<00:02:19.830> drop<00:02:20.600> farther<00:02:21.600> below

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
to let that racket drop farther below

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.860 
to let that racket drop farther below
the<00:02:22.200> ball<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.760> when<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.910> start<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.390> see<00:02:24.600> more

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the ball and when you start to see more

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.890 
the ball and when you start to see more
spin<00:02:25.500> coming<00:02:26.100> off<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:27.420> you're<00:02:27.600> still

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
spin coming off but you're still

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.020 
spin coming off but you're still
producing<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.650> good<00:02:28.890> amount<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.340> height<00:02:29.730> and

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
producing a good amount of height and

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.120 
producing a good amount of height and
depth<00:02:30.630> which<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.200> really<00:02:31.500> important<00:02:32.010> we<00:02:32.100> don't

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
depth which is really important we don't

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.180 
depth which is really important we don't
want<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.520> just<00:02:32.580> be<00:02:32.880> spinning<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.630> ball<00:02:33.810> and

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
want to just be spinning the ball and

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.470 
want to just be spinning the ball and
having<00:02:35.190> our<00:02:35.280> opponents<00:02:35.850> run<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.300> because

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
having our opponents run in because

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.500 
having our opponents run in because
we're<00:02:36.780> landing<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.350> so<00:02:37.560> short<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.820> know<00:02:38.970> start

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
we're landing it so short you know start

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.320 
we're landing it so short you know start
to<00:02:39.630> start<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.080> work<00:02:40.350> below<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.890> ball<00:02:41.330> continue

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
to start to work below the ball continue

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.070 
to start to work below the ball continue
to<00:02:42.450> get<00:02:42.570> height<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.140> depth<00:02:43.580> but<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:45.780> main

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
to get height and depth but the main

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.430 
to get height and depth but the main
ideas<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.100> much<00:02:47.580> better<00:02:48.000> understanding

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
ideas have a much better understanding

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.690 
ideas have a much better understanding
of<00:02:49.520> what<00:02:50.520> level<00:02:51.270> your<00:02:51.720> racket<00:02:52.350> is<00:02:52.700> moving

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
of what level your racket is moving

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.280 
of what level your racket is moving
through<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.090> ball<00:02:54.390> out<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.019> think

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
through the ball out and I think

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.100 
through the ball out and I think
generally<00:02:55.830> most<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.519> will<00:02:57.180> need<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.780> start

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
generally most of you will need to start

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.290 
generally most of you will need to start
to<00:02:58.290> test<00:02:58.590> yourselves<00:02:59.070> in<00:02:59.340> terms<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.820> letting

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
to test yourselves in terms of letting

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.259 
to test yourselves in terms of letting
the<00:03:00.330> racket<00:03:00.870> drop<00:03:01.170> lower<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:02.610> start<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.090> get

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
the racket drop lower to start to get

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.199 
the racket drop lower to start to get
yourselves<00:03:03.840> more<00:03:04.080> topspin<00:03:04.680> okay<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:06.030> that's

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
yourselves more topspin okay so that's

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.300 
yourselves more topspin okay so that's
all<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.420> got<00:03:06.660> for<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:06.989> guys<00:03:07.019> today<00:03:07.310> please
