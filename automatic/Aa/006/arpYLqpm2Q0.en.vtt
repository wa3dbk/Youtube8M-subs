00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.939
 how about youtube friends we here another 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.449
 time to teach them how to do the trick of 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:14.180
 wire wire to get credit 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:16.789
 to the electronic wallets of the 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.950
 oriental pearl machines or machines 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.410
 luck 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.980
 in fact I had already made a video in 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.660
 which one 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.419
 I used to implement that wire to be able to 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.689
 take credits to the machines that type 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:36.100
 of good machines the materials that 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:40.580
 let's use they are going to be a hook 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.329
 clothes metal hook is not very 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:49.199
 hard to get it 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.199
 right away we will use a wire 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.980
 I think it's number 22 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.469
 approximately unfortunately it is 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.540
 wire that is used is a little bit 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.059
 hard to get the truth is a 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.610
 little hard to get but can 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.490
 implement what is the wire 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.729
 of the flowers of the plastic flowers 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.040
 it's wire also serves the detail with 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.190
 that wire is an actor that is a 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.200
 bit 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.840
 and the other and the other tool that 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.230
 let's use are a pair of tweezers 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.230
 tip 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.090
 nothing more good 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.899
 Now what we are going to do is grab 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.899
 our wire 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.280
 and in the bottom part we are going to fold it 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.500
 approximately 5 centimeters 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.500
 we are going to fold it up 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.080
 must stay in this position 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.929
 here it is very important that you follow these 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.420
 steps in fact I will do what is the 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.179
 diagram on a sheet so that you 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.280
 based on how I am as how I can 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.909
 do it the exact measurements to be able to 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.009
 do it already once it is folded you 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.330
 let's give what is going to be the curvature 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.700
 the curvature which will be actuated 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.650
 to be contact forgiveness with the filaments 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.160
 of the electronic purse to give 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.780
 credit 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.110
 approximately from where the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.630
 curvature that will be centimeters and a half 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.630
 there will be another curvature 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.440
 this will be something like this 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.280
 ok there immediately say where the 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.280
 another curvature 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.730
 more or less what is a centimeter 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.360
 approximately we will give you another 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.610
 more coverage we're going to fold again 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.100
 At the end 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.100
 it has to be this way 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.860
 in this way we have to stay 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.280
 our wire and thus it 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.250
 we are going to be able to take credits 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.310
 to the purse is this part that I did 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.590
 is the most important because if you do not have 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.490
 the curvature that must have therefore not 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.520
 will serve absolutely nothing 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.400
 later 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.610
 from here from the coverage of the 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.750
 coverage that we did first 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.990
 what is going to be the tail of the wire 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.990
 they are approximately 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.310
 they are 10 11 centimeters 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.180
 and this is where we are going to give it to 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.489
 do the tail 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.489
 will be able to grab the wire 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.579
 this must be something like this 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.610
 okay 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.810
 and then we ended up cutting the 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.810
 our wire 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.400
 so it has to be 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.660
 I put it on the table so they can 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.660
 check well 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.640
 that's how it needs to be 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:29.750
 ours to hunger subsequently what 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.550
 let's do is cut the wire 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.580
 This metal hook 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.240
 we cut it from any part of 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.810
 anywhere 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.810
 i 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.650
 we cut nothing else a piece is what 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.650
 We are going to use 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:49.779
 the others we discard 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.449
 this wire is also important 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.629
 since in one way or another we are going to 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:03.169
 serve to raise an insurance that has the 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.169
 electronic purse 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.210
 This is our electronic purse 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.500
 good 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.150
 the ones as I was saying is the scope 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.270
 It is also important because with this 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.880
 we are going to raise an insurance that has 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.220
 here inside 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.620
 that if we do not raise it, it's not going to 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.750
 enter our wire and we're going to 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.940
 fail practically in our attempt 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.360
 to be able to take it out that in fact to the 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.360
 machine 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.710
 and we make a small fold of a 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.440
 centimeter 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.240
 here 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.660
 we counted another centimeter 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.100
 we make other doubles 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:58.300
 and other centimeters we make another doubles 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.300
 so that we have something like that 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.840
 this little picture we made him is 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:08.580
 to be able to put the finger and to be able 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.580
 lift the insurance 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.220
 there is too long to cut one 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.620
 bit 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.690
 more or less you have to this 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.220
 They have to see how much is what 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.220
 they have to cut 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.010
 this way we should stay 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.560
 well there we have our material 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:35.040
 so to be able to get credit to 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.040
 our machines 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.530
 already when we have everything then if 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.370
 we put what is the insurance we raise 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.370
 the insurance sorry 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:50.449
 and then we put our wire to 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.699
 can take credit to the machine and 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:54.979
 being inside the wire there is no 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.689
 problem we can remove the insurance the 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.220
 black the first the alan first the 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:01.910
 black 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:06.190
 and we started to activate so that 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.190
 start giving credits the machine 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:12.199
 This is how good I have been 

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:15.059
 implemented and this has worked 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:17.029
 pretty good, well, it's the 

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:20.029
 I thank you very much, I hope you serve them 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:20.029
 Thank you
