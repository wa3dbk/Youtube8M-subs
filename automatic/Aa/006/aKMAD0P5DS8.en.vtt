00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 yes 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.920
 best friends say that as they are 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.360
 I hope you're as best and as 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.970
 good this time with a new video 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.730
 Well, this time it's going to be a 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.420
 video to be able to move your applications 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.619
 to what would be the memory card already 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.199
 that I have elche el 70 and how 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.420
 those who have this 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.570
 device does not have much memory 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.180
 internal and well then this is a bit 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.030
 difficult to install applications with 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.309
 only from kroes a guide and a half of 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.440
 internal memory so well good them 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.710
 I'm going to teach some little one a little 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.620
 this tutorial on how to move them 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.000
 this time we are going to move a 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.280
 application I will not teach you from 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.170
 right now so that you can see 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.220
 that can not be moved to what is the 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.830
 memory card this time 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.840
 is going to be whatsapp and how will you know this 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.050
 application can not be moved to the micro 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.360
 sd or external memory card and then 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.540
 good as you can not find out here 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.380
 it tells me to move to the sd but the option does not 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.180
 is enabled only only says so and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.729
 well then what we are going to do 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.210
 is going to be going to the play history download 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.910
 the application link 2 sd obviously for 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.490
 this is going to need to be root and then 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.440
 well once downloaded what we're going to 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.759
 do is going to be open on this occasion 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.330
 that state of every I will not put by 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.100
 here part 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.070
 sorry I'm going to put on the every time 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.750
 let me 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.649
 I'm going to put here here is the application 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.579
 we are going to open it and what we are going to do 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.710
 it will be 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:02:00.039
 go to the three little dots that are still 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.880
 to the corner let's go let's go play 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:06.130
 there's a good thing we can do so 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.819
 we can open what the options would be 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.590
 or configurations and well let's go 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.290
 to go we go to adjustments 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.310
 and we will go all the way down to the bottom 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.610
 down and there will be a adjustments 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.620
 native of apps is going to say location of 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.340
 installation here what I'm going to do is going to 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.650
 be press 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.769
 and they will appear three options 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.849
 of external internal automatic this is what 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.420
 what they are going to do is going to be 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.440
 external 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.060
 and we would leave today maybe you guys 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.340
 when they come external they will ask 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.310
 permissions of road users go to 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.069
 allow and well then once done that 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.540
 the truth that we can not move anything and 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.560
 we try to move what would be a 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:59.010
 application we will not be able to because 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.819
 not everything does not move it I do not know how because 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.370
 let's move the sd card we're going to 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.920
 wait 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.220
 and how they can realize good failure 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.750
 it's a little publicity to they were saying 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.400
 abdo cc is not supported in your 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.549
 devices because your device 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.970
 account as with primary storage 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.040
 external which is which is molado but 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.590
 well once we do this now we 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.120
 let's go to the settings again 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.630
 we are going to go back to the 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.640
 Applications 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.870
 and let's wait for it to load all 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.230
 our applications 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.739
 Well, as I had already taught you 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.739
 before 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.250
 you could not move the application from 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.450
 whatsapp and with what we did now it 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.489
 have that can move 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.560
 and how can they realize that 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.800
 we have the option to move to 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.430
 the micro sd the truth is pretty 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.830
 pretty good so to speak this this 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.760
 small as now yes that trick or something 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.500
 A) Yes 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.310
 we have now only enabled 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.550
 touch to move the micro sd and only 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.250
 Just wait for this to end 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.470
 your procedure so let's wait 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.019
 to finish and you can move the 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.450
 applications to what would be the card 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.780
 from memory this we can say with 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.130
 all applications the truth yes 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.410
 well I in this case I have the truth 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.320
 I have all the sd card I do not have 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.900
 one in the internal good if I have some 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.760
 but not all and so good 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.080
 just doing this little trick 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.400
 they will be able to have a bit of 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.710
 storage you can give 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.040
 mind that here tells me that I have only 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.410
 245 megas free but you can already give 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.290
 count the amount of things I have and 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.729
 some games that are somewhat heavy like 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:55.169
 this one that is 2 gigs 63 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:56.969
 and this the gang starr there 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.729
 supposedly it seems to me that they are only 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:02.430
 a few megabytes but which weighs much more 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.050
 then well, as I say, may 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.120
 do this procedure with all the 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.490
 applications that want and well then 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.809
 basically this has been all I hope that 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.029
 you liked the video that you have 

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:13.830
 served if it was like that they hit a good like 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.389
 and well, if you are not subscribed 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.889
 I invite you to do it and well then 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.389
 thanks for watching this video we will see 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.569
 until next 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.569
 bye
