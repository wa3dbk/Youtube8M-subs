00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.640
 so we've been a little short 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.469
 has won the time but we are going to 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.709
 present to the girls that are going to 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.629
 represent in the platinum rating other 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.340
 in the selected ones that are lent 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.860
 to dress the rojiblanca in the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.679
 first Bolivarian beach games 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.109
 Lima 2012 are the beach rugby girls 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.570
 they are very committed and expect 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.640
 to be able to make history in this tournament 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.919
 they have been training as a selection already 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.420
 three months the process of preparing 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.040
 the players are from the whole year but 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.450
 for these games as a selection we are 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.090
 working about three months ago or 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.000
 less maybe a little more we have made a 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.070
 physical work base that included 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.290
 gym that included track work or 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.850
 be career and we also had the support 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.090
 of cross and peru we are being cross and 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.710
 It is also this new method of work 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.810
 and that if I the first three months 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.220
 much physical in the sand you will have given 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.350
 account in a short time that he was with 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.110
 we are very heavy then we have to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.700
 have also to stop running is a 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.559
 very physical issue long ago left physical 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.990
 important the first the first 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.729
 weeks of first months and now I'm 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.290
 watching a lot of radio and lots of sand 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.390
 adaptation process has cost them 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.340
 work since much more is required 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.860
 dexterity and strength at the time of 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.780
 move in the sand the transition 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.490
 physics is strong if one has a good 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.140
 level of physical preparation is less 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.869
 difficult everyone has good level of 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.580
 force then in fact the transit there 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.020
 to adapt the transit is a 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.729
 unstable surface I think that's what 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.070
 more complicated and the solution 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.380
 set all the stars with the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.330
 same quality that you do them in a 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.280
 surface that is stable not in the grass 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.320
 or anywhere then that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.759
 work is entered into the adaptation has 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.680
 been complicated and we have tried to 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.940
 do it as long as possible does not know 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.830
 start in the arena we start in the 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.500
 sand does we already have a sand of more than 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.910
 a month two months maybe then a little 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.649
 but we see increasing the volume of 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.759
 sand well working intensely to 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.200
 jimena that is known about rivals 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.000
 direct that Peru has we know that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.390
 come quite tough selections that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.190
 your 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.840
 they know they are not new they are not going to 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.240
 see for the first time there are no people that 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.040
 we know there are players in the national team 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.800
 of this year female who have a 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.750
 experience design I already have enough 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.880
 years when radio then are players 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.540
 that even we do not know them yet 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.760
 the tournaments and the international face 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.010
 is venezuela which is a very selective 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.510
 strong that aside is a bit 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.010
 indecipherable you really truth and years 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.360
 that come very strong with a very game 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.400
 good goal but it's very technical 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.930
 fast then it 's a rival that the one that 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.239
 you always have to have him 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.190
 I respect everyone and the chile 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.440
 that male female chile or what 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.300
 it is a very strong game the Chileans 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.130
 they did not unravel others 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.410
 sports but here they come and they collide and they are 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.330
 very big people very strong then it is 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.160
 this is our realities 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.830
 selected have been training under the 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.320
 Address of Carlos Cobo Experienced 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.850
 coach of Argentine nationality is 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.320
 coach is an Argentine professor of 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.530
 many my experience is called carlos co 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.330
 and the physical trainer that davis endorsed 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.730
 we have lord support besides jaime 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.290
 rear cross and cross and Peru and 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.240
 good is a little the technical team and 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.680
 good the general management of the project 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.120
 real and feminine supported by the 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.400
 federation to narrate well is vanessa 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.440
 guevara not they also emphasize 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.870
 on the importance of making you feel that 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.150
 we play from locals there are people who do not know 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.620
 in the year last year the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.739
 flag of the games the mayor's office 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.959
 received the flag the games this year 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.940
 begins a series of sporting events 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.209
 you will know odesur games and so on 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.590
 then feel the locality we wait for the 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.510
 public support because we expect it 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.459
 but also because there are many sports and 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.720
 many individual athletes that 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.390
 come with many possibilities of 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.580
 get on the podium then that extra 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.900
 you have to put that extra that we are in 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.340
 the house that not enabling the Chilean 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.630
 more than us that is important 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.200
 we hope all the public supports us that 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.200
 I know what to do
