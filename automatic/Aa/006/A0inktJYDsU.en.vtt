ordered<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.090> this<00:00:18.090> programming<00:00:18.750> card

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
ordered this and this programming card

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.740 
ordered this and this programming card
at<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.350> same<00:00:19.560> time<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.609> they<00:00:21.150> took<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
at the same time but they took like a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.230 
at the same time but they took like a
week<00:00:21.810> difference<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.619> get<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.150> don't<00:00:24.150> know

decent thing on it it's it's pretty good
it<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.809> mean<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.620> seems<00:00:37.890> pretty<00:00:37.980> powerful<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.760> I

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
it I mean it seems pretty powerful and I

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.580 
it I mean it seems pretty powerful and I
just<00:00:39.239> plugged<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> try<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.500> it

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
just plugged in just to try it and it

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.200 
just plugged in just to try it and it
seems<00:00:40.770> pretty<00:00:40.860> powerful<00:00:41.690> but<00:00:42.690> um<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.940> have

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
seems pretty powerful but um you have

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.250 
seems pretty powerful but um you have
your<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.750> off<00:00:45.960> switch<00:00:46.020> right<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:48.260> me

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
your on and off switch right here me

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.560 
your on and off switch right here me
particularly<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.610> don't<00:00:50.789> care<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.239> it

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
particularly I really don't care for it

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.830 
particularly I really don't care for it
it's<00:00:51.690> really<00:00:51.870> kind<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.320> crappy<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.660> don't<00:00:54.660> like

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
it's really kind of crappy I don't like

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.700 
it's really kind of crappy I don't like
it<00:00:54.989> too<00:00:55.110> much<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.640> what<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.710> already

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it too much but it is what it is already

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.619 
it too much but it is what it is already
a<00:00:58.859> your<00:00:59.129> wire<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.730> closings<00:01:00.149> here<00:01:00.329> this

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
a your wire the closings here this

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.200 
a your wire the closings here this
either<00:01:01.280> really<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.370> doesn't<00:01:02.609> look<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:02.879> this

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
either really it doesn't look like this

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.640 
either really it doesn't look like this
I<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.930> programming<00:01:04.409> card

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
I just have the programming card

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.300 
I just have the programming card
attached<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:06.229> but<00:01:07.229> um<00:01:07.439> then<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.850> your

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
attached to it but um then you have your

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.300 
attached to it but um then you have your
wires<00:01:11.310> over<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.350> your<00:01:13.380> two

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
wires over here you have your two

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
wires over here you have your two
battery<00:01:14.790> ones<00:01:15.119> right<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:16.759> this<00:01:17.759> red<00:01:18.270> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
battery ones right here this red and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.070 
battery ones right here this red and
black<00:01:18.659> one<00:01:18.990> those<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.189> battery<00:01:20.520> ones

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
black one those are your battery ones

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.480 
black one those are your battery ones
and<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:22.590> motor<00:01:22.799> wires<00:01:23.159> right

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and then you have your motor wires right

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.910 
and then you have your motor wires right
here<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.880> plug<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.590> goes

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
here and just plug it in if it goes

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.499 
here and just plug it in if it goes
backwards<00:01:29.189> or<00:01:29.520> something<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.030> switch<00:01:30.299> any

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
backwards or something just switch any

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.140 
backwards or something just switch any
three<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.040> that's<00:01:32.250> only<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.729> only<00:01:32.909> if

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
three that is that's only it's only if

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.940 
three that is that's only it's only if
the<00:01:33.750> wires<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.229> your<00:01:34.259> murderer<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.710> different

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the wires on your murderer of different

the wires on your murderer of different
colors<00:01:35.540> but<00:01:36.540> um<00:01:37.280> one<00:01:38.280> thing<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.610> don't<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.420> too

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
colors but um one thing I don't like too

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.789 
colors but um one thing I don't like too
much<00:01:39.900> about<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.320> besides<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:41.100> switch<00:01:41.460> is

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
much about this besides that switch is

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.130 
much about this besides that switch is
the<00:01:43.799> power<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.840> fan<00:01:47.659> personally<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.020> do

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the power for the fan personally I do

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.149 
the power for the fan personally I do
not<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:50.009> how<00:01:50.310> they<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.790> set<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.799> but<00:01:52.799> I

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
some way to melt it somewhere but it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.920 
some way to melt it somewhere but it
will<00:01:58.829> work<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.189> Traxxas<00:01:59.729> cars<00:02:00.090> I'm<00:02:00.479> gonna<00:02:00.659> try

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
will work on Traxxas cars I'm gonna try

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.630 
will work on Traxxas cars I'm gonna try
to<00:02:00.990> put<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.409> even<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.799> stampede<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.520> my

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
to put it on even or stampede on my

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.819 
to put it on even or stampede on my
flash<00:02:05.570> later<00:02:06.570> I'll<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> video<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.710> on

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
flash later I'll do a video of it on

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.270 
flash later I'll do a video of it on
there<00:02:08.129> but

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
there but

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.910 
there but
and<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.609> don't<00:02:11.849> care<00:02:12.269> for<00:02:12.329> that<00:02:12.920> power

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and I just don't care for that power

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:20.639 
thing but you know it's it can handle a

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:24.080 
thing but you know it's it can handle a
two<00:02:21.299> to<00:02:21.780> three<00:02:22.049> cell<00:02:22.379> lipo<00:02:22.739> or<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.280> four<00:02:23.609> to<00:02:23.849> ten
