the<00:00:10.889> memory

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
the memory

the memory
many<00:00:12.299> from<00:00:12.840> our<00:00:13.290> tribe<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.340> compact<00:00:14.849> class<00:00:16.580> now

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
many from our tribe to compact class now

many from our tribe to compact class now
only<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:19.920> particular<00:00:20.460> case<00:00:20.700> that<00:00:21.029> was

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
only in this particular case that was

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.140 
only in this particular case that was
quite<00:00:22.410> easy<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:24.060> piano<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.570> same

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
quite easy to do the piano is the same

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.700 
quite easy to do the piano is the same
but<00:00:27.150> since<00:00:27.450> it<00:00:27.570> has<00:00:27.599> been<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.020> popular<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.680> has

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
but since it has been so popular it has

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.150 
but since it has been so popular it has
been<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.130> front<00:00:29.880> page<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.059> big<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:31.800> gets<00:00:32.009> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
been on front page of big and gets it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.900 
been on front page of big and gets it
for<00:00:32.279> instance<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.910> thought<00:00:33.690> well<00:00:34.730> how<00:00:35.730> about

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
for instance I thought well how about

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.270 
for instance I thought well how about
the<00:00:36.750> normal<00:00:37.250> normal<00:00:38.250> iPod<00:00:39.620> this<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> 4G

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the normal normal iPod this is a 4G

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.979 
the normal normal iPod this is a 4G
photo<00:00:42.110> and<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.770> has<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.039> harddrive<00:00:44.690> like<00:00:45.690> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
photo and this has a harddrive like this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.860 
photo and this has a harddrive like this
inside<00:00:46.730> I've<00:00:47.730> been<00:00:47.999> investigating<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:50.870> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
inside I've been investigating this and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.049 
inside I've been investigating this and
the<00:00:52.289> pinout<00:00:52.530> isn't<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> same<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.699> can't

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the pinout isn't the same so you can't

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.540 
the pinout isn't the same so you can't
put<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.570> compact<00:00:55.050> class<00:00:55.199> card<00:00:55.499> just<00:00:55.949> straight

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
put a compact class card just straight

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.520 
put a compact class card just straight
in<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.510> would<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.809> wonderful<00:00:58.589> if<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.429> still

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
in but it would be wonderful if we still

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.569 
in but it would be wonderful if we still
could<00:01:01.530> put<00:01:01.710> some<00:01:02.010> kind<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.309> flash<00:01:02.550> memory

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
could put some kind of flash memory

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.600 
could put some kind of flash memory
inside<00:01:03.390> these<00:01:04.260> iPods<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.100> mean<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.370> lot<00:01:05.580> of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
inside these iPods I mean a lot of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.280 
inside these iPods I mean a lot of
people<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:06.090> these<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.600> form<00:01:06.840> factor<00:01:07.020> is

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
people have these the form factor is

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.080 
people have these the form factor is
great<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.970> it's<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.300> iPod<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.680> guess<00:01:12.500> and

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
great it's it's the iPod I guess and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.539 
great it's it's the iPod I guess and
there's<00:01:15.090> still<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.990> lot<00:01:16.259> around<00:01:16.469> only<00:01:17.340> hard

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
there's still a lot around only hard

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.480 
there's still a lot around only hard
drives<00:01:17.790> break<00:01:18.240> down<00:01:19.040> because<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.399> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
drives break down because it's a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.160 
drives break down because it's a
mechanical<00:01:20.759> thing<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.600> has<00:01:21.780> moving<00:01:22.110> parts

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
mechanical thing it has moving parts

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.289 
mechanical thing it has moving parts
inside<00:01:22.759> so

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.410 

so<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.320> this<00:01:27.770> aesthetic<00:01:28.219> memory<00:01:28.640> this

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
so and this aesthetic memory this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.050 
so and this aesthetic memory this
doesn't<00:01:29.780> have<00:01:29.899> any<00:01:30.109> moving<00:01:30.200> parts<00:01:30.380> inside<00:01:31.060> now

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
doesn't have any moving parts inside now

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.740 
doesn't have any moving parts inside now
I've<00:01:32.390> been<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.960> I've<00:01:33.679> been<00:01:33.859> busy<00:01:34.009> with<00:01:34.280> this

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
I've been and I've been busy with this

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.279 
I've been and I've been busy with this
quite<00:01:35.750> some<00:01:35.960> days<00:01:36.110> now<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.649> I<00:01:37.490> can<00:01:37.670> show<00:01:37.850> you

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
another 4G I thought now it's this one I

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:52.969 
another 4G I thought now it's this one I
will<00:01:43.700> show<00:01:43.789> it<00:01:44.090> on<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.329> camera

try<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.079> show<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> inside<00:01:58.860> now<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:02.490> has

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
try to show the inside now this has

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.770 
try to show the inside now this has
taken<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.210> lot<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.539> time<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.990> make

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780

well as you can see there's a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.260 
well as you can see there's a
contactless<00:02:14.570> card<00:02:14.930> inside<00:02:15.490> now<00:02:16.490> it's<00:02:16.700> for<00:02:17.030> gig

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
contactless card inside now it's for gig

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.500 
contactless card inside now it's for gig
but<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.570> could<00:02:17.780> be<00:02:17.900> anything<00:02:18.170> up<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.310> 128<00:02:20.150> gigs

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
but it could be anything up to 128 gigs

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.800 
but it could be anything up to 128 gigs
just<00:02:20.930> like<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.230> iPod<00:02:21.560> mini<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:22.480> well<00:02:23.480> just<00:02:23.510> to

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
there's a harddrive inside this one only

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.220 
there's a harddrive inside this one only
thing<00:02:32.630> is<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.650> isn't<00:02:34.160> very<00:02:34.610> easy<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.180> do<00:02:35.330> now

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
thing is this isn't very easy to do now

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.110 
thing is this isn't very easy to do now
I<00:02:36.260> won't<00:02:36.590> accelerate<00:02:36.950> my<00:02:37.430> own<00:02:37.550> skills<00:02:37.910> or

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120

I won't accelerate my own skills or
anything<00:02:38.360> but<00:02:39.110> this<00:02:39.260> has<00:02:39.470> taken<00:02:39.650> me<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.040> long

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
anything but this has taken me a long

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.120 
anything but this has taken me a long
time<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.820> make<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:42.850> 288<00:02:44.800> hand<00:02:45.800> soldered

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
time to make and 288 hand soldered

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.780 
time to make and 288 hand soldered
connections<00:02:47.470> very<00:02:48.470> tiny<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:49.130> get<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.430> inside

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
connections very tiny to get it inside
