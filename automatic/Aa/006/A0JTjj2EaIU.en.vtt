hey<00:00:03.090> guys<00:00:03.330> Rob<00:00:03.629> with<00:00:03.840> aim<00:00:04.050> we<00:00:04.649> just<00:00:04.830> wanted<00:00:05.040> to

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
hey guys Rob with aim we just wanted to

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.000 
hey guys Rob with aim we just wanted to
discuss<00:00:05.580> in<00:00:06.210> with<00:00:06.630> the<00:00:06.720> aim<00:00:06.900> company<00:00:07.470> what<00:00:07.859> we

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
discuss in with the aim company what we

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.680 
discuss in with the aim company what we
do<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.430> break<00:00:08.610> swimming<00:00:09.030> down<00:00:09.180> into<00:00:09.420> four

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
do is we break swimming down into four

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.180 
do is we break swimming down into four
dominoes<00:00:10.230> okay

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
dominoes okay

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.589 
dominoes okay
Domino<00:00:11.730> number<00:00:12.000> one<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.330> we're<00:00:12.420> going<00:00:12.540> to

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
Domino number one that we're going to

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.910 
Domino number one that we're going to
talk<00:00:12.780> about<00:00:12.809> today<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.620> law<00:00:13.769> of

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
talk about today is the law of

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.760 
talk about today is the law of
hydrodynamics<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.660> not<00:00:15.870> complicate

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
hydrodynamics and to not complicate

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.980 
hydrodynamics and to not complicate
things<00:00:17.310> just<00:00:17.940> keep<00:00:18.119> everything<00:00:18.359> top-line

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
things just keep everything top-line

what I want you to be able to do is take

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.830 
what I want you to be able to do is take
this<00:00:20.520> information<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.210> take<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.539> apply<00:00:21.810> to

the pool immediately the one thing one
of<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.900> biggest<00:00:25.199> frustrations<00:00:25.710> we<00:00:25.859> hear<00:00:26.100> with

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
of the biggest frustrations we hear with

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.250 
of the biggest frustrations we hear with
new<00:00:26.490> swimmers<00:00:26.939> as<00:00:27.090> well<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.720> experienced

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
new swimmers as well as experienced

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.259 
new swimmers as well as experienced
swimmers<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:29.279> they<00:00:29.699> don't<00:00:29.820> go<00:00:30.000> anywhere

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
swimmers is that they don't go anywhere

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.759 
swimmers is that they don't go anywhere
in<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> water<00:00:30.720> feels<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.349> harder<00:00:31.650> they

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
in the water feels like the harder they

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.729 
in the water feels like the harder they
try<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.099> slower<00:00:32.519> they<00:00:32.760> go<00:00:32.970> okay<00:00:33.570> simply<00:00:34.500> put

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
try the slower they go okay simply put

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.470 
try the slower they go okay simply put
that's<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.130> lot<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.309> hydrodynamics<00:00:35.760> working

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
that's a lot of hydrodynamics working

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.900 
that's a lot of hydrodynamics working
against<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.200> okay<00:00:37.739> when<00:00:38.280> you're<00:00:38.399> out<00:00:38.520> running

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
against you okay when you're out running

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.340 
against you okay when you're out running
or<00:00:38.969> when<00:00:39.090> you're<00:00:39.239> out<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.540> bike<00:00:39.780> we're

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
or when you're out on the bike we're

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.420 
or when you're out on the bike we're
very<00:00:40.590> familiar<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> law<00:00:41.280> of

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
very familiar with the law of

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.000 
very familiar with the law of
aerodynamics<00:00:42.410> especially<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> bicycle

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
aerodynamics especially on the bicycle

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.319 
aerodynamics especially on the bicycle
but<00:00:44.129> when<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.340> get<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.640> water<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.059> tend<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
but when we get in the water we tend to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.639 
but when we get in the water we tend to
forget<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.750> there's<00:00:46.079> an<00:00:46.200> incredible

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
forget that there's an incredible

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.459 
forget that there's an incredible
density<00:00:47.100> factor<00:00:47.789> associated<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.390> water<00:00:48.719> for

density factor associated with water for

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.959 
density factor associated with water for
example<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> double<00:00:50.340> your<00:00:50.460> speed<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
example to double your speed in the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.580 
example to double your speed in the
water<00:00:51.149> takes<00:00:51.510> eight<00:00:51.780> times<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.289> amount<00:00:52.320> of

water takes eight times the amount of

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.830 
water takes eight times the amount of
energy<00:00:52.710> okay<00:00:53.640> well<00:00:54.090> why<00:00:54.270> does<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> happen

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
energy okay well why does that happen

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.959 
energy okay well why does that happen
well<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> water<00:00:55.620> never<00:00:55.980> leaves<00:00:56.280> your<00:00:56.520> body<00:00:56.579> in

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
well the water never leaves your body in

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.700 
well the water never leaves your body in
an<00:00:57.270> aerodynamic<00:00:57.510> position<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.590> get

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
an aerodynamic position you can get

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.229 
an aerodynamic position you can get
streamlined<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.670> cut<00:00:59.850> down<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
streamlined and you can cut down on the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.540 
streamlined and you can cut down on the
frontal<00:01:00.539> drag<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:01.289> makes<00:01:01.530> sense<00:01:01.859> whether

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
frontal drag that makes sense whether

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.100 
frontal drag that makes sense whether
you<00:01:02.730> associated<00:01:03.239> with<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> bicycle<00:01:03.780> an

you associated with a bicycle an
automobile<00:01:04.739> whatever<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.399> okay

automobile whatever it is okay

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.120 
automobile whatever it is okay
however<00:01:06.869> when<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.290> into<00:01:07.409> water<00:01:07.590> most<00:01:08.010> of

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
however when we get into water most of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.830 
however when we get into water most of
the<00:01:08.220> time<00:01:08.369> we<00:01:08.549> tend<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.790> forget<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.180> there<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the time we tend to forget that there is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.870 
the time we tend to forget that there is
a<00:01:10.049> law<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.650> physics<00:01:10.680> that's<00:01:11.189> associated<00:01:11.490> with

a law of physics that's associated with

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
it and that's what we want to talk about

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.230 
it and that's what we want to talk about
today<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.189> very<00:01:14.400> first<00:01:14.640> thing<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.000> have

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
today the very first thing that you have

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.490 
today the very first thing that you have
to<00:01:15.360> understand<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.930> want<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.439> to

to understand and I want you to go to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.350 
to understand and I want you to go to
the<00:01:16.650> pool<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.250> want<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> try<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the pool and I want you to try this and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.330 
the pool and I want you to try this and
that<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.140> want<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.470> push<00:01:19.710> off<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.950> wall

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that is I want you to push off the wall

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.310 
that is I want you to push off the wall
but<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.119> want<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.479> keep<00:01:21.689> your<00:01:21.840> hands<00:01:22.080> by

but I want you to keep your hands by

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.899 
but I want you to keep your hands by
your<00:01:22.350> side<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.280> simply<00:01:23.610> want<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.820> to

you're<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> travel<00:01:55.229> well<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:55.860> you're

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
you're going to travel well if you're

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.380 
you're going to travel well if you're
already<00:01:56.130> close<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.490> six<00:01:56.820> feet<00:01:57.000> tall<00:01:57.180> that's

already close to six feet tall that's

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.060 
already close to six feet tall that's
great<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.869> add<00:01:58.020> another<00:01:58.259> three<00:01:58.619> feet<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.950> your

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
great you add another three feet of your

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.039 
great you add another three feet of your
arms<00:01:59.310> you're<00:01:59.430> nearly<00:01:59.610> nine<00:01:59.880> feet<00:02:00.119> tall<00:02:00.149> where

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
arms you're nearly nine feet tall where

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.420 
arms you're nearly nine feet tall where
it<00:02:01.110> becomes<00:02:01.290> detrimental<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.070> if<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.310> get

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
it becomes detrimental is if you get

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.429 
it becomes detrimental is if you get

you're already starting at a deficit in
the<00:02:06.600> water<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.469> staying<00:02:07.799> tall<00:02:08.100> in<00:02:08.310> the

the water so you staying tall in the
water<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:08.970> number<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.539> thing<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.840> need

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
water is the number one thing you need

that<00:02:13.730> word<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:14.030> lot<00:02:14.380> okay<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:16.010> when<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.220> go<00:02:16.340> to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
that word a lot okay so when you go to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.740 
that word a lot okay so when you go to
the<00:02:16.550> pool<00:02:16.730> if<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:16.940> want<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.240> see<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.540> law<00:02:17.690> of
