in<00:00:01.770> Excel<00:00:03.230> 2003<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.650> earlier<00:00:05.069> versions<00:00:05.130> if

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
in Excel 2003 and earlier versions if

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.700 
in Excel 2003 and earlier versions if
you<00:00:06.240> want<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.600> count<00:00:06.930> things<00:00:07.230> based<00:00:07.560> on

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
you want to count things based on

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.589 
you want to count things based on
criteria<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:08.790> can<00:00:09.000> use<00:00:09.150> count<00:00:09.510> if<00:00:10.040> in<00:00:11.040> Excel

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
criteria you can use count if in Excel

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.900 
criteria you can use count if in Excel
2007<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.990> later<00:00:13.019> versions<00:00:13.349> there's<00:00:14.190> also<00:00:14.429> a

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
2007 and later versions there's also a

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.160 
2007 and later versions there's also a
new<00:00:15.269> function<00:00:15.839> called<00:00:16.139> count<00:00:16.590> ifs<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:18.170> with

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
new function called count ifs and with

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.040 
new function called count ifs and with
this<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.609> do<00:00:20.880> some<00:00:21.510> things<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.900> little

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
this you can do some things a little

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.000 
this you can do some things a little
more<00:00:22.289> easily<00:00:22.789> so<00:00:23.789> if<00:00:24.060> we<00:00:24.240> wanted<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.720> count

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
more easily so if we wanted to count

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.000 
more easily so if we wanted to count
items<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.730> quantity<00:00:27.619> that's<00:00:28.619> between

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
items that have quantity that's between

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.799 
items that have quantity that's between
5<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.640> 10<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.230> old<00:00:31.439> version<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:32.070> had<00:00:32.279> to

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
5 and 10 in the old version we had to

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.900 
5 and 10 in the old version we had to
combine<00:00:33.809> two<00:00:34.290> different<00:00:34.370> countifs<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.760> get

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
combine two different countifs to get

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.799 
combine two different countifs to get
our<00:00:36.059> answer<00:00:36.829> with<00:00:37.829> count<00:00:38.160> ifs<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:38.969> create<00:00:39.360> one

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
our answer with count ifs we create one

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.160 
our answer with count ifs we create one
formula<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.489> put<00:00:41.850> different<00:00:42.450> sets<00:00:42.930> of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
formula and we can put different sets of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.670 
formula and we can put different sets of
ranges<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.809> criteria<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.500> up

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
ranges and criteria and we can have up

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.360 
ranges and criteria and we can have up
to<00:00:47.210> 127<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.629> those<00:00:48.899> combinations<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.160> get

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
to 127 of those combinations so we get

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.180 
to 127 of those combinations so we get
quite<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> bit<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.000> flexibility<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.890> case

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
quite a bit of flexibility in this case

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.810 
quite a bit of flexibility in this case
we've<00:00:53.610> got<00:00:53.690> count<00:00:54.690> ifs<00:00:55.250> where<00:00:56.250> we're<00:00:56.430> looking

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
we've got count ifs where we're looking

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.529 
we've got count ifs where we're looking
at<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.780> range<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.289> cells<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.070> saying<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.930> want

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
at this range of cells and saying I want

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.660 
at this range of cells and saying I want
quantities<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:04.199> greater<00:01:05.159> than<00:01:05.460> or

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
quantities that are greater than or

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
quantities that are greater than or
equal<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.930> number<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.610> efore<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.590> they

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
equal to the number in efore and they

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.130 
equal to the number in efore and they
also<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.640> less<00:01:12.270> than<00:01:12.570> or<00:01:12.720> equal<00:01:12.869> to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
also have to be less than or equal to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.850 
also have to be less than or equal to
the<00:01:13.799> number<00:01:14.189> that's<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.610> g4<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:16.680> we've

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the number that's in g4 so we've

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.130 
the number that's in g4 so we've
combined<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> two<00:01:17.670> criteria<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.689> when<00:01:19.020> we

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
combined the two criteria and when we

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.020 
combined the two criteria and when we
press<00:01:19.380> ENTER<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.820> 6<00:01:21.360> as<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.689> result<00:01:22.820> we<00:01:23.820> can

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
press ENTER we get 6 as a result we can

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.249 
press ENTER we get 6 as a result we can
add<00:01:24.299> more<00:01:24.750> criteria<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.770> well<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.570> in<00:01:27.570> this

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
add more criteria as well and in this

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.910 
add more criteria as well and in this
case<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:29.009> could<00:01:29.310> look<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.659> items<00:01:31.290> where

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
case we could look for items where

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.080 
case we could look for items where
there's<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.220> pen<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.930> order<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.610> I've<00:01:35.880> added

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
there's a pen in the order so I've added

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.990 
there's a pen in the order so I've added
another<00:01:36.630> set<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.259> criteria<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> third<00:01:38.670> set

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
another set of criteria so the third set

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.810 
another set of criteria so the third set
is<00:01:39.030> looking<00:01:39.630> at<00:01:39.810> range<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.979> 2<00:01:41.040> 2<00:01:41.909> 8<00:01:42.180> 10<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
is looking at range a 2 2 8 10 and

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.950 
is looking at range a 2 2 8 10 and
finding<00:01:44.820> items<00:01:45.180> where<00:01:45.420> there's<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.659> pen<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
finding items where there's a pen and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.649 
finding items where there's a pen and
when<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.079> press<00:01:49.290> ENTER<00:01:49.850> there<00:01:50.850> are<00:01:51.000> only<00:01:51.119> two

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
when we press ENTER there are only two

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.170 
when we press ENTER there are only two
now<00:01:51.960> where<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> quantity<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.100> between<00:01:53.490> 5<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
now where the quantity is between 5 and

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
now where the quantity is between 5 and
10<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.350> item<00:01:55.710> sold<00:01:56.009> was<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> pen<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:58.170> can

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
10 and the item sold was a pen you can

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.760 
10 and the item sold was a pen you can
also<00:01:58.469> use<00:01:58.939> wildcards<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.170> formula

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
also use wildcards and in this formula

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.120 
also use wildcards and in this formula
instead<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.460> typing<00:02:02.909> pen<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:04.259> typed<00:02:04.619> pen

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
instead of just typing pen we typed pen

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.510 
instead of just typing pen we typed pen
with<00:02:05.670> an<00:02:05.820> asterisk<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:07.950> get<00:02:08.129> anything

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
with an asterisk so that we get anything

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.740 
with an asterisk so that we get anything
that<00:02:08.819> starts<00:02:09.270> with<00:02:09.709> PE<00:02:10.709> n<00:02:11.190> sum<00:02:12.150> now<00:02:12.390> there<00:02:12.629> are

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
that starts with PE n sum now there are

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.790 
that starts with PE n sum now there are
4<00:02:13.110> because<00:02:13.500> we're

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
4 because we're

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.300 
4 because we're
getting<00:02:13.980> pen<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.700> pencil<00:02:15.770> items<00:02:16.770> where<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
getting pen and pencil items where the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.470 
getting pen and pencil items where the
quantity<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:18.030> between<00:02:18.420> five<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.020> ten
