takes<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.780> picture<00:04:38.110> it's<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.620> exact<00:04:38.889> same

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
takes the picture it's the exact same

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.230 
takes the picture it's the exact same
versions<00:04:39.490> of<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:39.699> honeycomb<00:04:40.680> 321<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:42.520> they

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
versions of a honeycomb 321 so they

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.719 
versions of a honeycomb 321 so they
share<00:04:43.479> a<00:04:43.509> lot<00:04:43.690> of<00:04:43.780> things<00:04:43.870> in<00:04:44.080> common<00:04:44.639> one<00:04:45.639> of

the<00:04:45.789> reasons<00:04:46.030> I<00:04:46.090> bought<00:04:46.300> this<00:04:46.509> tablet<00:04:46.930> is

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
the reasons I bought this tablet is

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.600 
the reasons I bought this tablet is
because<00:04:47.410> of<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.560> gaming<00:04:47.860> potential<00:04:48.340> now<00:04:48.580> I

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
because of the gaming potential now I

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.010 
because of the gaming potential now I
don't<00:04:48.699> have<00:04:48.910> any<00:04:49.090> games<00:04:49.270> on<00:04:49.449> here<00:04:49.630> I<00:04:49.660> only<00:04:49.840> have

don't have any games on here I only have

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.730 
don't have any games on here I only have
a<00:04:50.050> technology<00:04:50.560> demo<00:04:51.009> which<00:04:51.759> is<00:04:51.970> global<00:04:52.740> I'm

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.879 
level so you can see as I move this ball
around<00:05:06.789> I'll<00:05:07.180> try<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:07.419> get<00:05:07.630> in<00:05:07.720> here<00:05:07.930> this<00:05:08.740> is

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
to focus the camera and then we'll go

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.839 
to focus the camera and then we'll go
back<00:05:13.539> to<00:05:13.599> plain<00:05:14.080> so<00:05:14.860> you'll<00:05:15.130> notice<00:05:15.400> as<00:05:15.550> i<00:05:15.639> move

it around you can see all these lighting

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.969 
it around you can see all these lighting
effects<00:05:17.880> transparencies<00:05:19.050> reflections<00:05:20.050> it's

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979

the<00:05:21.130> first<00:05:21.250> time<00:05:21.520> ever<00:05:21.729> on<00:05:21.970> a<00:05:22.000> tablet<00:05:22.479> that

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
the first time ever on a tablet that

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.140 
the first time ever on a tablet that
they've<00:05:22.750> tried<00:05:22.960> this<00:05:23.110> many<00:05:23.380> dynamic<00:05:24.150> lighting

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
they've tried this many dynamic lighting

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.620 
they've tried this many dynamic lighting
effects<00:05:25.599> in<00:05:25.870> a<00:05:26.169> scene<00:05:26.889> and<00:05:27.300> it's<00:05:28.300> actually

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
effects in a scene and it's actually

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.960 
effects in a scene and it's actually
very<00:05:28.659> smooth<00:05:29.139> it<00:05:29.289> works<00:05:29.440> very<00:05:29.680> well<00:05:29.970> except

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
very smooth it works very well except

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.249 
very smooth it works very well except
when<00:05:31.150> it<00:05:31.240> throws<00:05:31.449> me<00:05:31.659> off<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:31.990> side<00:05:32.199> like<00:05:32.470> that

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
when it throws me off the side like that

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.860 
when it throws me off the side like that
anyway<00:05:35.259> uh<00:05:35.440> I<00:05:36.150> wanted<00:05:37.150> to<00:05:37.210> definitely<00:05:37.630> show

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
anyway uh I wanted to definitely show

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.810 
anyway uh I wanted to definitely show
that<00:05:38.110> a<00:05:38.289> few<00:05:38.560> other<00:05:38.710> things<00:05:38.800> one<00:05:39.460> of<00:05:39.580> the<00:05:39.639> thing

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
that a few other things one of the thing

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.279 
that a few other things one of the thing
about<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:40.240> zoom<00:05:40.539> that<00:05:40.780> I<00:05:40.810> really<00:05:41.110> liked

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
about the zoom that I really liked

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.219 
about the zoom that I really liked
better<00:05:41.560> is<00:05:42.090> just<00:05:43.090> in<00:05:43.300> this<00:05:43.419> is<00:05:43.570> trivial<00:05:44.020> again

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
better is just in this is trivial again

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:45.779 
better is just in this is trivial again
personal<00:05:44.620> preference<00:05:44.949> was<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:45.370> location<00:05:45.490> of

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
personal preference was the location of

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.120 
personal preference was the location of
a<00:05:45.880> power<00:05:46.030> button<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.479> I<00:05:47.080> seuss<00:05:47.710> the<00:05:47.979> power

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
a power button and I seuss the power

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.060 
a power button and I seuss the power
buttons<00:05:48.460> up<00:05:48.699> here<00:05:49.169> which<00:05:50.169> means<00:05:50.380> when<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:50.919> I'm

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
buttons up here which means when and I'm

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.379 
buttons up here which means when and I'm
just<00:05:51.250> not<00:05:51.370> used<00:05:51.430> to<00:05:51.699> it<00:05:51.789> yet<00:05:51.880> but<00:05:52.120> you<00:05:52.240> can<00:05:52.270> I

just not used to it yet but you can I
got<00:05:52.599> to<00:05:52.690> reach<00:05:52.810> up<00:05:53.020> and<00:05:53.139> put<00:05:53.320> the<00:05:53.580> press<00:05:54.580> it<00:05:54.759> not

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
got to reach up and put the press it not

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.249 
got to reach up and put the press it not
a<00:05:55.780> big<00:05:55.990> deal<00:05:56.139> um<00:05:56.800> this<00:05:57.729> guy<00:05:57.969> the<00:05:58.719> power<00:05:58.900> buttons

00:05:59.249 --> 00:05:59.259 
a big deal um this guy the power buttons

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.050 
a big deal um this guy the power buttons
like<00:05:59.380> right<00:05:59.650> under<00:05:59.949> your<00:06:00.070> hand<00:06:00.400> so<00:06:00.789> when<00:06:00.940> you

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
like right under your hand so when you

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.270 
like right under your hand so when you
turn<00:06:01.300> it<00:06:01.419> on<00:06:01.650> then<00:06:02.650> the<00:06:02.770> other<00:06:02.889> hand<00:06:03.130> can

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
turn it on then the other hand can

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.939 
turn it on then the other hand can
unlock<00:06:03.610> it's<00:06:03.849> like<00:06:04.030> just<00:06:04.389> perfect<00:06:05.080> and<00:06:05.229> the

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
unlock it's like just perfect and the

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.529 
unlock it's like just perfect and the
power<00:06:06.099> button<00:06:06.340> is<00:06:06.490> kind<00:06:06.729> of<00:06:06.820> recessed<00:06:07.180> so<00:06:07.419> you

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
power button is kind of recessed so you

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.480 
power button is kind of recessed so you
don't<00:06:07.710> accidentally<00:06:08.710> like<00:06:08.949> bump<00:06:09.219> it<00:06:09.370> or

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
don't accidentally like bump it or

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.670 
don't accidentally like bump it or
anything<00:06:09.669> I<00:06:10.030> should<00:06:10.570> refocus<00:06:10.900> on<00:06:11.259> this<00:06:11.289> too

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
anything I should refocus on this too

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.820 
anything I should refocus on this too
while<00:06:11.860> I'm<00:06:11.979> at<00:06:12.070> it<00:06:12.810> I'm<00:06:13.810> shooting<00:06:14.500> this<00:06:14.530> with<00:06:14.800> a

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
while I'm at it I'm shooting this with a

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.080 
while I'm at it I'm shooting this with a
nikon<00:06:15.570> d7000<00:06:17.550> so<00:06:18.550> it's<00:06:18.639> a<00:06:18.729> little<00:06:18.940> awkward

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
nikon d7000 so it's a little awkward

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.379 
nikon d7000 so it's a little awkward
it's<00:06:19.479> not<00:06:19.659> really<00:06:20.080> made<00:06:20.500> for<00:06:20.530> doing<00:06:20.830> movies

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
it's not really made for doing movies

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:27.330 
it's not really made for doing movies
but<00:06:22.389> will<00:06:22.690> do<00:06:22.960> in<00:06:23.169> a<00:06:23.259> pinch<00:06:23.610> what<00:06:24.610> else<00:06:26.099> that<00:06:27.099> is

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
but will do in a pinch what else that is

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.390 
but will do in a pinch what else that is
probably<00:06:28.229> gift
