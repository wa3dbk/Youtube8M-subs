this<00:01:46.110> most<00:01:46.409> likely<00:01:46.799> isn't<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.610> Java<00:01:48.090> version

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
this most likely isn't your Java version

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.350 
this most likely isn't your Java version
so<00:01:49.680> you're<00:01:49.890> gonna<00:01:49.979> want<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> change<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> re<00:01:51.000> to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
so you're gonna want to change the re to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.530 
so you're gonna want to change the re to
your<00:01:51.509> JDK<00:01:52.140> version<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:53.340> find<00:01:53.579> out<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.970> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
your JDK version to find out that you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.670 
your JDK version to find out that you
want<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.780> go<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> start<00:01:55.890> computer<00:01:57.439> C<00:01:58.439> Drive

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
want to go to start computer C Drive

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.359 
want to go to start computer C Drive

and<00:02:02.610> then<00:02:02.970> go<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.240> Java<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.110> there<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.630> if

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
and then go to Java and there it is if

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.320 
and then go to Java and there it is if
you<00:02:06.840> don't<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.520> download<00:02:08.640> Java

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
you don't have it you can download Java

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.110 
you don't have it you can download Java
comm<00:02:09.899> it'll<00:02:10.739> most<00:02:11.190> likely<00:02:11.250> go<00:02:11.790> into<00:02:12.000> this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
comm it'll most likely go into this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.110 
comm it'll most likely go into this
folder<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.900> you'll<00:02:13.560> have<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.770> just<00:02:14.730> copy<00:02:15.000> that

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
folder and you'll have it just copy that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.280 
folder and you'll have it just copy that
and<00:02:15.450> replace<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.260> here<00:02:16.940> after<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.330> exit<00:02:18.989> save

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
and replace it here after that exit save

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.040 
and replace it here after that exit save
and<00:02:19.560> do<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.800> for<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.069> compiler<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.880> here<00:02:21.840> and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
and do that for the compiler on here and

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.520 
and do that for the compiler on here and
on<00:02:22.920> your<00:02:23.069> client<00:02:26.810> after<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.230> you're<00:02:28.410> going

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
on your client after that you're going

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.320 
on your client after that you're going
to<00:02:28.560> want<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.769> run<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.160> source<00:02:29.430> because<00:02:30.150> you

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
to want to run the source because you

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.199 
to want to run the source because you
need<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.660> run<00:02:30.840> net<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.530> start<00:02:31.800> logging<00:02:32.700> onto

need the run net to start logging onto

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.320 
need the run net to start logging onto
your<00:02:33.510> client<00:02:34.430> once<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.489> get<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.760> client<00:02:36.150> do

your client once you get to client do
the<00:02:36.450> two<00:02:36.600> things<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.019> said<00:02:37.080> just<00:02:38.069> replace<00:02:38.370> them

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
the two things I said just replace them

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.820 
the two things I said just replace them
because<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.180> need<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:41.180> 6<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.630> then<00:02:43.230> JDK

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
because you need to 6 and then JDK

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.020 
because you need to 6 and then JDK
alright<00:02:46.830> once<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.430> do<00:02:47.549> that<00:02:47.580> you're<00:02:47.880> going<00:02:48.000> to

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
alright once you do that you're going to

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.000 
alright once you do that you're going to
want<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.299> run<00:02:48.510> your<00:02:48.690> client<00:02:49.140> we're<00:02:49.709> gonna<00:02:49.799> make

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
want to run your client we're gonna make

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.520 
want to run your client we're gonna make

world<00:03:11.060> once<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.180> log<00:03:12.359> in<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.780> will<00:03:12.959> create<00:03:13.200> a

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
world once you log in this will create a

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.860 
world once you log in this will create a
file<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.620> your<00:03:14.040> source<00:03:14.310> files<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:15.480> log<00:03:15.720> it

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
file and your source files just log it

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.599 
file and your source files just log it
back<00:03:16.019> out<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.470> just<00:03:16.500> creates<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.070> file<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.519> you

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
back out it just creates a file so you

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.000 
back out it just creates a file so you
so<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.180> can<00:03:18.359> find<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.780> first<00:03:19.620> go<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.829> your

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
so you can find it first go to your

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.809 
so you can find it first go to your
source<00:03:20.340> go<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.269> data<00:03:21.769> characters<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.130> then

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
source go to data characters and then

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.949 
source go to data characters and then
find<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.329> name<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.750> your<00:03:25.079> file<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.739> open<00:03:26.489> it

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
find the name of your file and open it

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.479 
find the name of your file and open it
you'll<00:03:27.959> find<00:03:28.170> character<00:03:28.769> rights<00:03:28.980> near<00:03:29.370> the

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
you'll find character rights near the

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.170 
you'll find character rights near the
top<00:03:29.730> it'll<00:03:30.720> most<00:03:31.019> likely<00:03:31.079> say<00:03:31.560> 0<00:03:32.400> change<00:03:32.850> that

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
top it'll most likely say 0 change that

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.250

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
all compiling is is basically just

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.140 
all compiling is is basically just
saving<00:05:22.990> the<00:05:23.320> progress<00:05:23.740> you<00:05:23.890> have<00:05:23.920> done<00:05:24.400> even

though you saved in the folder I mean

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.620 
though you saved in the folder I mean
the<00:05:27.220> file<00:05:27.430> just<00:05:28.390> you<00:05:28.780> just<00:05:28.900> got<00:05:29.050> a<00:05:29.110> compile

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
the file just you just got a compile

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.780 
the file just you just got a compile
you<00:05:31.630> just<00:05:31.810> have<00:05:31.930> to<00:05:32.140> do<00:05:32.320> that<00:05:32.410> after<00:05:35.760> sorry<00:05:36.760> I
