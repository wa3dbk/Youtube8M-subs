00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.490 
like I don't know if I could actually do
I<00:01:45.939> probably<00:01:46.240> could<00:01:46.539> if<00:01:46.569> it<00:01:46.780> was<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:46.899> job<00:01:47.229> you

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500

know<00:01:47.590> I<00:01:47.619> could<00:01:47.920> do<00:01:48.069> it<00:01:48.189> but<00:01:48.360> it'd<00:01:49.360> be<00:01:49.390> difficult

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
know I could do it but it'd be difficult

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.600 
know I could do it but it'd be difficult
for<00:01:49.929> me<00:01:50.140> I'd<00:01:50.259> be<00:01:50.289> difficult<00:01:50.709> meet<00:01:50.829> us<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.250> speak

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
it I wouldn't i probably would start off

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.990 
it I wouldn't i probably would start off
in<00:01:53.679> that<00:01:53.799> voice<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:54.220> once<00:01:54.399> i<00:01:54.489> got<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.670> following

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
in that voice and once i got a following

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.550 
in that voice and once i got a following
i<00:01:55.149> would<00:01:55.270> just<00:01:55.360> drop<00:01:55.599> the<00:01:55.780> voice<00:01:55.959> that's

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
i would just drop the voice that's

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.749 
i would just drop the voice that's
probably<00:01:56.860> what<00:01:56.979> would<00:01:57.099> happen<00:01:57.369> if<00:01:57.459> I<00:01:57.520> got<00:01:57.670> the

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759
