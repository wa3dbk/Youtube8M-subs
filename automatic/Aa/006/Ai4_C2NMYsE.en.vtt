science mix with actually selling
something<00:00:56.769> that<00:00:57.280> you've<00:00:57.670> created<00:00:58.030> and

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
something that you've created and

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.209 
something that you've created and
invented<00:00:58.899> which<00:00:59.469> I<00:00:59.589> think<00:00:59.859> some<00:01:00.070> of<00:01:00.100> these

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
invented which I think some of these

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.619 
invented which I think some of these
people<00:01:00.429> that<00:01:00.609> have<00:01:00.789> this<00:01:00.879> infomercial<00:01:01.480> some

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
people that have this infomercial some

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.509 
people that have this infomercial some
of<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.749> stuff<00:01:01.929> they<00:01:02.050> think<00:01:02.079> of<00:01:02.440> is<00:01:02.739> so<00:01:03.010> crazy

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
of the stuff they think of is so crazy

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.910 
of the stuff they think of is so crazy
but<00:01:04.030> it's<00:01:04.449> creative<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:05.350> lot<00:01:05.500> of<00:01:05.530> itself

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
but it's creative and a lot of itself

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.150 
but it's creative and a lot of itself
everything<00:01:06.810> other<00:01:07.810> than<00:01:07.990> maybe<00:01:08.320> one<00:01:08.800> or<00:01:08.950> two

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
everything other than maybe one or two

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.290 
everything other than maybe one or two
things<00:01:09.370> that<00:01:09.580> I've<00:01:09.700> purchased<00:01:09.910> from<00:01:10.150> an

things that I've purchased from an

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.330 
things that I've purchased from an
infomercial<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:11.020> really<00:01:11.380> love<00:01:11.620> I<00:01:11.920> actually

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
infomercial I really love I actually

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.190 
infomercial I really love I actually
still<00:01:12.910> have<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.270> lot<00:01:13.510> of<00:01:13.600> things<00:01:13.810> I've<00:01:13.990> kept

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
work so I really am NOT down on

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.400 
work so I really am NOT down on
infomercials<00:01:19.450> I<00:01:19.570> really<00:01:19.810> think<00:01:20.050> some<00:01:20.230> of<00:01:20.290> the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
infomercials I really think some of the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.740 
infomercials I really think some of the
stuff<00:01:20.620> that<00:01:21.100> they<00:01:21.220> do<00:01:21.280> sell<00:01:21.640> actually<00:01:22.420> is

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
stuff that they do sell actually is

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.230 
stuff that they do sell actually is
pretty<00:01:23.440> good<00:01:23.650> one<00:01:24.340> of<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.520> things<00:01:24.790> I<00:01:24.970> recently

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
pretty good one of the things I recently

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.840 
pretty good one of the things I recently
got<00:01:25.630> that<00:01:25.900> I<00:01:26.080> am<00:01:26.170> so<00:01:27.010> in<00:01:27.520> love<00:01:27.580> with

got that I am so in love with

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.540 
got that I am so in love with
head-over-heels<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:29.650> is<00:01:29.860> probably<00:01:30.340> one<00:01:30.520> of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
head-over-heels this is probably one of

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.970 
head-over-heels this is probably one of
the<00:01:30.850> best<00:01:31.180> gadgets<00:01:31.930> that<00:01:32.020> I<00:01:32.140> own<00:01:32.380> right<00:01:32.710> now

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
the best gadgets that I own right now

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.950 
the best gadgets that I own right now
other<00:01:33.340> than<00:01:33.490> my<00:01:33.580> spin<00:01:33.820> gym<00:01:34.060> which<00:01:34.450> I<00:01:34.600> do<00:01:34.660> use

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
other than my spin gym which I do use

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.110 
other than my spin gym which I do use
every<00:01:35.410> day<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:35.830> I<00:01:35.950> absolutely<00:01:36.280> love<00:01:36.880> that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
every day and I absolutely love that

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.550 
every day and I absolutely love that
thing<00:01:37.420> but<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.830> micro<00:01:39.610> teddy<00:01:40.270> this<00:01:41.230> is<00:01:41.380> what

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
thing but the micro teddy this is what

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.010 
thing but the micro teddy this is what
it<00:01:41.650> looks<00:01:41.860> like<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.400> I<00:01:42.790> think<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.540> sold

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
it looks like and I think this is sold

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.090 
it looks like and I think this is sold
from<00:01:44.290> a<00:01:44.410> company<00:01:44.860> called<00:01:44.890> Emma<00:01:45.550> Joy<00:01:46.090> e/m<00:01:47.080> J<00:01:47.800> oh

from a company called Emma Joy e/m J oh

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.460 
from a company called Emma Joy e/m J oh
I<00:01:48.430> I'm<00:01:48.910> pretty<00:01:49.450> sure<00:01:49.750> that's<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.170> company

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
I I'm pretty sure that's the company

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.320 
I I'm pretty sure that's the company
that<00:01:50.530> actually<00:01:50.800> sells<00:01:51.220> this<00:01:51.550> when<00:01:52.300> I

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
that actually sells this when I

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.270 
that actually sells this when I
