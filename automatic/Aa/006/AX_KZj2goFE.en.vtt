00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
try different varieties as well so I'm

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.340 
try different varieties as well so I'm
going<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.090> zoom<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.659> talk<00:01:15.869> about<00:01:16.020> some<00:01:16.320> of

the methods that I've kind of come to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.859 
the methods that I've kind of come to
use<00:01:18.810> for<00:01:19.110> germinating<00:01:19.909> for<00:01:20.909> both<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
use for germinating for both the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.390 
use for germinating for both the
hydroponic<00:01:22.350> system<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> starts<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
hydroponic system and the starts in the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.219 
hydroponic system and the starts in the
spring<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.850> course<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.570> scale<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
starts in the spring is going to be much

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.499 
starts in the spring is going to be much
greater<00:01:26.670> because<00:01:26.880> I'm<00:01:27.119> producing

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
greater because I'm producing

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.289 
greater because I'm producing
considerably<00:01:28.049> more<00:01:28.259> plants<00:01:29.030> but<00:01:30.030> they<00:01:30.150> can

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
considerably more plants but they can

then<00:03:18.810> they<00:03:18.930> got<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.110> little<00:03:19.230> spot<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.920> top

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
then they got a little spot in the top

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.890 
then they got a little spot in the top
where<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.400> can<00:03:20.550> poke<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.760> seed<00:03:21.060> down<00:03:21.239> in<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.750> go

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
where you can poke a seed down in and go

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.090 
where you can poke a seed down in and go
from<00:03:22.140> there<00:03:23.180> very<00:03:24.180> cheap<00:03:24.510> God<00:03:25.500> replacement

bit<00:03:28.650> messy<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.250> guess<00:03:29.730> if<00:03:29.970> you're<00:03:30.120> going<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.390> put

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
bit messy I guess if you're going to put

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.010 
bit messy I guess if you're going to put
them<00:03:30.750> into<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:31.590> would<00:03:32.489> not<00:03:32.670> put<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:33.180> peat<00:03:33.660> pellet

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
them into I would not put a peat pellet

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.040 
them into I would not put a peat pellet
into<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.970> hydroponic<00:03:35.970> system<00:03:36.330> because<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:36.660> don't

into a hydroponic system because I don't

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.510 
into a hydroponic system because I don't
want<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.290> dirt<00:03:37.500> clogging<00:03:37.950> up<00:03:38.070> pumps<00:03:38.400> and

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
want that dirt clogging up pumps and

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.820 
want that dirt clogging up pumps and
everything<00:03:38.580> else<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.690> wanted<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.470> remain

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
everything else I wanted to remain

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.650 
everything else I wanted to remain
pretty<00:03:41.160> much<00:03:41.370> clean<00:03:41.760> but<00:03:42.090> they're<00:03:42.300> great<00:03:42.510> for

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
pretty much clean but they're great for

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.510 
pretty much clean but they're great for
the<00:03:42.780> garden<00:03:43.110> just<00:03:43.290> when<00:03:43.920> they<00:03:44.040> when<00:03:44.250> they<00:03:44.370> get

growing<00:03:44.790> take<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:46.400> peel<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:48.150> netting

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
growing take the peel the the netting

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.360 
growing take the peel the the netting
off<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.930> roots<00:03:49.140> can<00:03:49.350> really<00:03:49.560> expand<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.160> do

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
off so the roots can really expand I do

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.860 
off so the roots can really expand I do
think<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.940> roots<00:03:51.120> will<00:03:51.239> constrict<00:03:51.750> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
think that the roots will constrict the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.550 
think that the roots will constrict the
netting<00:03:52.230> despite<00:03:52.560> jiffies<00:03:53.040> claim<00:03:53.370> otherwise

but<00:03:55.560> those<00:03:55.739> are<00:03:55.860> really<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.100> three<00:03:56.340> methods

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
but those are really the three methods

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.920 
but those are really the three methods

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
can start moisten drop the seed in and

very quick another technique that I know
a<00:05:37.410> lot<00:05:37.560> of<00:05:37.620> people<00:05:37.740> use<00:05:38.250> is<00:05:38.510> they'll<00:05:39.510> simply

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
a lot of people use is they'll simply

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.500 
a lot of people use is they'll simply
take<00:05:40.200> their<00:05:41.130> germination<00:05:41.669> tray<00:05:42.090> set<00:05:42.330> it<00:05:42.419> on

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
take their germination tray set it on

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.909 
take their germination tray set it on
top<00:05:42.540> of<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:42.810> refrigerator<00:05:42.960> the<00:05:43.530> heat<00:05:43.710> will

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
top of the refrigerator the heat will

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.760 
top of the refrigerator the heat will
provide<00:05:44.280> just<00:05:44.580> enough<00:05:44.669> to<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.630> keep<00:05:45.840> it<00:05:46.050> or<00:05:46.290> to

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
provide just enough to to keep it or to

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.960 
provide just enough to to keep it or to
what<00:05:46.950> to<00:05:47.100> stimulate<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.580> germination

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
what to stimulate the germination

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.420 
what to stimulate the germination
process<00:05:48.440> so<00:05:49.440> really<00:05:49.620> those<00:05:49.950> are<00:05:49.980> those<00:05:50.370> are

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
process so really those are those are

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.980 
process so really those are those are
about<00:05:50.700> the<00:05:50.790> four<00:05:51.030> different<00:05:51.390> methods<00:05:51.750> and<00:05:51.930> the

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
about the four different methods and the

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.150 
about the four different methods and the
four<00:05:52.169> different<00:05:52.470> items<00:05:52.710> that<00:05:52.860> i<00:05:52.950> use<00:05:53.130> to

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
four different items that i use to

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.670 
four different items that i use to
germinate<00:05:53.900> again<00:05:54.900> when<00:05:55.169> it<00:05:55.290> comes<00:05:55.470> to<00:05:55.590> the

germinate again when it comes to the
springtime<00:05:56.130> starts<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.940> majority<00:05:57.390> of<00:05:57.450> what<00:05:57.660> i

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
springtime starts the majority of what i

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.370 
springtime starts the majority of what i
will<00:05:57.930> use<00:05:58.169> will<00:05:58.470> be<00:05:58.620> the<00:05:58.770> peat<00:05:59.360> pellets<00:06:00.380> they

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
will use will be the peat pellets they

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.850 
will use will be the peat pellets they
are<00:06:01.530> so<00:06:01.740> very<00:06:01.950> cheap<00:06:02.220> and<00:06:02.370> really<00:06:03.000> easy<00:06:03.180> to<00:06:03.419> use

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
are so very cheap and really easy to use

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.409 
are so very cheap and really easy to use
next<00:06:04.860> to<00:06:04.950> that<00:06:04.980> is<00:06:05.130> the<00:06:05.310> rock<00:06:05.610> wool<00:06:05.880> and<00:06:06.120> mainly

next to that is the rock wool and mainly
the<00:06:06.510> rock<00:06:06.690> will<00:06:06.900> i'm<00:06:07.050> using<00:06:07.380> now<00:06:07.410> for<00:06:08.030> the

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
the rock will i'm using now for the

just so easy to control and the work so

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.450 
just so easy to control and the work so
