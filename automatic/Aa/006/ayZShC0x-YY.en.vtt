halo and if we add that forwards at the
4<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.060> halo<00:02:23.270> 4<00:02:23.630> we<00:02:24.080> can<00:02:24.230> eight<00:02:24.410> now<00:02:25.010> there<00:02:25.459> are

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
4 and halo 4 we can eight now there are

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.520 
4 and halo 4 we can eight now there are
three<00:02:25.610> other<00:02:25.970> ale<00:02:26.150> games<00:02:26.540> at<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:27.080> three<00:02:27.350> to

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
three other ale games at that three to

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.620 
three other ale games at that three to

the eight and that makes 11 and the
eleventh<00:02:30.170> month<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.769> year<00:02:30.800> is<00:02:32.410> November

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
eleventh month of the year is November

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.440 
eleventh month of the year is November
ah<00:02:33.650> there<00:02:34.310> were<00:02:34.430> more<00:02:34.640> than<00:02:34.700> just<00:02:34.880> three<00:02:35.209> games

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
ah there were more than just three games

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.630 
ah there were more than just three games
don't<00:02:35.959> mess<00:02:36.080> me<00:02:36.290> up<00:02:36.320> oh<00:02:36.620> right<00:02:36.950> I'd<00:02:37.400> hate<00:02:37.580> for

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
don't mess me up oh right I'd hate for

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.030 
don't mess me up oh right I'd hate for
this<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:37.910> get<00:02:38.060> confusing<00:02:38.480> now<00:02:38.930> as<00:02:39.320> we<00:02:39.650> all<00:02:39.769> know

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
this to get confusing now as we all know

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.400 
this to get confusing now as we all know
if<00:02:40.489> we<00:02:40.640> take<00:02:40.820> 11<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.420> subtract<00:02:41.780> five<00:02:42.019> from<00:02:42.050> it

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
if we take 11 and subtract five from it

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.650 
if we take 11 and subtract five from it
we<00:02:42.530> get<00:02:42.709> six<00:02:42.980> that's<00:02:43.670> how<00:02:43.970> we'll<00:02:44.180> remember<00:02:44.420> the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
we get six that's how we'll remember the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.170 
we get six that's how we'll remember the
day<00:02:44.920> november<00:02:45.920> six<00:02:45.950> wait<00:02:46.610> why<00:02:46.940> did<00:02:47.090> you

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
day november six wait why did you

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.030 
day november six wait why did you
subtract<00:02:47.510> five<00:02:47.720> because<00:02:48.170> this<00:02:48.319> is<00:02:48.440> halo<00:02:48.769> 4

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
subtract five because this is halo 4

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.660 
subtract five because this is halo 4
which<00:02:49.760> is<00:02:49.940> was<00:02:50.180> less<00:02:50.569> than<00:02:50.600> 5<00:02:51.050> 11<00:02:51.980> less<00:02:52.190> five<00:02:52.459> or

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
which is was less than 5 11 less five or

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.110 
which is was less than 5 11 less five or
six<00:02:52.970> come<00:02:53.450> on<00:02:53.540> keep<00:02:54.200> up<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.560> think<00:02:54.890> my<00:02:55.160> brain

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
six come on keep up I think my brain

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.850 
six come on keep up I think my brain
just<00:02:56.150> broke<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:56.930> course<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.410> calculate<00:02:57.830> the
