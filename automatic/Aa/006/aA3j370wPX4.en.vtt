out of the way

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.840 
out of the way
okay<00:05:43.690> so<00:05:43.750> I<00:05:43.870> have<00:05:43.960> my<00:05:43.990> Nike<00:05:44.380> football<00:05:44.530> box<00:05:44.979> the

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.659 
okay so I have my Nike football box the
box<00:05:46.060> it<00:05:46.240> came<00:05:46.360> in<00:05:46.419> I<00:05:46.830> think<00:05:47.830> it's<00:05:48.130> a<00:05:48.220> smart<00:05:48.490> idea

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
box it came in I think it's a smart idea

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.760 
box it came in I think it's a smart idea
to<00:05:48.910> ship<00:05:49.240> it<00:05:49.360> back<00:05:49.390> in<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:49.870> box<00:05:50.110> it<00:05:50.289> came<00:05:50.470> from

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
to ship it back in the box it came from

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.469 
to ship it back in the box it came from
so<00:05:51.520> it<00:05:51.610> doesn't<00:05:51.850> look<00:05:51.940> like<00:05:52.060> you're<00:05:52.210> trying<00:05:52.300> to

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
so it doesn't look like you're trying to

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.210 
so it doesn't look like you're trying to
rip<00:05:52.630> them<00:05:52.840> off<00:05:53.020> you<00:05:53.289> see<00:05:53.590> four<00:05:53.979> hundred
