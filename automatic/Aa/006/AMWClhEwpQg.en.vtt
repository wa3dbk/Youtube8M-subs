00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:26.710 
right there the infra red Jumpman inside
you<00:04:09.260> guys<00:04:09.319> gonna<00:04:09.560> see<00:04:09.799> that<00:04:25.210> as<00:04:26.210> far<00:04:26.360> as<00:04:26.570> the

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
you guys gonna see that as far as the

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.469 
you guys gonna see that as far as the
elephant<00:04:27.110> print<00:04:27.380> it's<00:04:28.300> pretty<00:04:29.300> much

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
elephant print it's pretty much

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.100 
elephant print it's pretty much
consistent<00:04:31.270> on<00:04:32.270> like<00:04:33.229> hair<00:04:33.699> okay<00:04:34.699> there's

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
consistent on like hair okay there's

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.870 
consistent on like hair okay there's
very<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.199> same<00:04:36.470> they're<00:04:37.070> not<00:04:37.250> like<00:04:37.639> two

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
very the same they're not like two

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.610 
very the same they're not like two
different<00:04:38.060> prints

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
different prints

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.689 
different prints
take<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.460> look<00:04:40.669> at<00:04:40.910> this<00:04:41.419> other<00:04:41.630> pairs<00:04:42.050> look

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
take a look at this other pairs look

00:04:42.699 --> 00:05:02.290 
take a look at this other pairs look
again<00:04:43.699> the<00:04:44.690> prints<00:04:45.020> are<00:04:45.460> consistent<00:04:46.460> and<00:05:01.300> as

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
again the prints are consistent and as

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.090 
again the prints are consistent and as
far<00:05:02.540> as<00:05:02.630> color<00:05:02.870> wise<00:05:03.169> you<00:05:03.500> know<00:05:03.530> on<00:05:03.830> the

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
far as color wise you know on the

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.900 
far as color wise you know on the
infrared<00:05:04.699> on<00:05:05.030> there<00:05:05.960> is<00:05:06.280> different<00:05:07.280> shades<00:05:07.639> of

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
infrared on there is different shades of

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.810 
infrared on there is different shades of
infrared<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:09.830> know<00:05:09.949> because<00:05:10.220> this<00:05:10.400> one<00:05:10.669> right

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
infrared you know because this one right

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.610 
infrared you know because this one right
here<00:05:11.030> is<00:05:11.210> actually<00:05:11.600> on<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:11.930> box<00:05:12.169> it<00:05:12.380> will<00:05:12.440> say

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
here is actually on the box it will say

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.779 
here is actually on the box it will say
infrared<00:05:13.070> 23<00:05:13.930> which<00:05:14.930> is<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.169> same<00:05:15.410> as

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
infrared 23 which is the same as

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.540 
infrared 23 which is the same as
infrared<00:05:16.789> 23<00:05:17.560> that's<00:05:18.560> on<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:19.190> three<00:05:19.370> line

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
infrared 23 that's on the three line

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.740 
infrared 23 that's on the three line
five<00:05:21.340> but<00:05:22.340> if<00:05:22.460> you<00:05:22.550> take<00:05:22.760> a<00:05:22.789> look<00:05:23.120> at<00:05:23.419> for

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
five but if you take a look at for

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.800 
five but if you take a look at for
example<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:24.820> Georges<00:05:25.820> six<00:05:26.120> infrared<00:05:26.600> of

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
example the Georges six infrared of

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.240 
example the Georges six infrared of
infrared<00:05:28.780> you<00:05:29.780> know<00:05:29.900> which<00:05:30.110> gosh<00:05:30.680> it<00:05:30.889> says<00:05:31.100> it

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
infrared you know which gosh it says it

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.300 
infrared you know which gosh it says it
on<00:05:33.520> focuses<00:05:35.050> on<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:36.169> label<00:05:36.560> as<00:05:36.860> you<00:05:37.010> can<00:05:37.160> see

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
on focuses on the label as you can see

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.550 
on focuses on the label as you can see
it<00:05:37.400> just<00:05:37.580> says<00:05:37.760> infrared<00:05:38.419> then<00:05:39.320> I<00:05:39.350> say

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
it just says infrared then I say

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.180 
it just says infrared then I say
infrared<00:05:40.039> 23<00:05:41.139> so<00:05:42.139> there<00:05:42.350> is<00:05:42.560> a<00:05:42.740> slight

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
infrared 23 so there is a slight

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.450 
infrared 23 so there is a slight
difference<00:05:44.090> as<00:05:44.930> far<00:05:44.960> as<00:05:45.229> color<00:05:45.770> wise<00:05:46.010> you've

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
difference as far as color wise you've

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.360 
difference as far as color wise you've
got<00:05:46.580> that<00:05:46.789> different<00:05:47.360> shade<00:05:47.630> of<00:05:47.840> it<00:05:48.130> but<00:05:49.130> very

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
got that different shade of it but very

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.110 
got that different shade of it but very
minor<00:05:50.200> so<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.470> color<00:05:51.740> might<00:05:52.250> not<00:05:52.430> be<00:05:52.580> exactly

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
minor so the color might not be exactly

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.200 
minor so the color might not be exactly
the<00:05:53.270> same<00:05:53.860> infrared<00:05:54.860> on<00:05:54.979> this<00:05:55.220> view<00:05:55.520> so<00:05:58.210> how

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
the same infrared on this view so how

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.810 
the same infrared on this view so how
are<00:05:59.300> you<00:05:59.419> do<00:05:59.830> you<00:06:00.830> have<00:06:00.919> any<00:06:01.099> questions<00:06:01.490> just

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820
