00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.130
 hi my name is kate clap and today 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.000
 I wanted myself about how much I hate 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.250
 hotels 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.690
 Well, let's start with the fact that every time 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.110
 when and called in a new hotel 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.820
 I always think that it has ghosts and 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.119
 of course like any normal person 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:27.890
 I'm trying to seem in front of him . 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.630
 Yes, but after futile attempts, I still 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.149
 I notice that there is no holding in the room and 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.820
 it happens every time but anyway 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.519
 shy away from temper as you know in normal 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.260
 typical horror films are such a roof 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.789
 don't you know yourself that someone has arisen in 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.090
 mirror and it will be so casserole someday 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.090
 demon 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.120
 in short after all this i'm exactly s2 on 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.310
 All stories with ghosts go to bed 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:24.770
 I think about tomorrow and at two o'clock 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:29.840
 nights the phone rings and at the other end 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:32.450
 of course I calmed down again 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:02:01.760
 went to bed and everything would be fine but from his 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:02:03.620
 him phone something that was me 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.300
 even at the reception did not explain because 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.530
 what not to say that they are constantly ringing 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:13.549
 the phone at night and now I definitely believe 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.900
 that there are behaviors in hotels and 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.480
 hate the hotel because there still 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.400
 feel especially lonely so lonely 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.260
 that even go out of my room in 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.010
 main file and talk to 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.010
 by strangers 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.860
 you do not want 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.209
 the only thing i like in hotels is 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.860
 mini bar and 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.540
 but you know these little fridges 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.370
 rooms where a lot of all goodies 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.799
 which are 10 times more expensive than they really 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.870
 Actually , every time you take water 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:03:02.120
 at least some candy bar myself 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.120
 feel really rockefeller speech kill 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:09.810
 but this time I put a huge check under 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.900
 besides bringing in my room with me 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.310
 there was no minibar instead of a minibar 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.310
 I had a stove 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.629
 I can not cook 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.290
 so you understand how much I can't 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.530
 Cook 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:38.099
 I hate hating chips and of course 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.569
 all leave as this one comes to an end i 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.200
 came home and 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.810

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.370
