00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.340 

now<00:00:05.339> this<00:00:05.609> particular<00:00:05.790> model<00:00:06.270> has<00:00:06.480> two<00:00:07.049> stages

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
now this particular model has two stages

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.669 
now this particular model has two stages
that<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.550> can<00:00:08.700> easily<00:00:08.940> see<00:00:09.269> here<00:00:09.679> same

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
that you can easily see here same

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.999 
that you can easily see here same
shoulder<00:00:11.219> pad<00:00:11.550> same<00:00:12.240> back<00:00:12.450> support<00:00:13.009> but

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
shoulder pad same back support but

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.740 
shoulder pad same back support but
what's<00:00:14.250> really<00:00:14.519> particular<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.630> has

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
what's really particular is that it has

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.750 
what's really particular is that it has
a<00:00:15.780> central<00:00:16.230> joint<00:00:16.560> now<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.010> central<00:00:17.490> joint

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
a central joint now the central joint

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.910 
a central joint now the central joint
allows<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.990> change<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.320> angle<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.800> your

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
allows you to change the angle of your

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.040 
allows you to change the angle of your
camera<00:00:20.310> like<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:21.330> depending<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:21.930> your

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
camera like this so depending on your

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.130 
camera like this so depending on your
needs<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:23.039> can<00:00:23.070> easily<00:00:23.580> shoot<00:00:23.789> sideways<00:00:24.269> you

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
needs you can easily shoot sideways you

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.990 
needs you can easily shoot sideways you
can<00:00:25.320> change<00:00:25.590> obviously<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.369> angle<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.789> both

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
can change obviously the angle on both

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.140 
can change obviously the angle on both
sides<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.439> bring<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.740> back<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.160> this

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
sides and you can bring it back and this

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.290 
sides and you can bring it back and this
central<00:00:30.630> joint<00:00:30.900> allows<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.529> as<00:00:31.679> well<00:00:32.300> to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
central joint allows you as well to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.569 
central joint allows you as well to
bring<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.630> forward<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.829> bring<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.190> backward

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
bring it forward or to bring it backward

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.400 
bring it forward or to bring it backward
like<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> longer

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
like this so you can have a longer

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.450 
like this so you can have a longer
camera<00:00:38.250> rig<00:00:38.600> again<00:00:39.710> chameleon<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.920> chameleon

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
camera rig again chameleon or chameleon

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.720 
camera rig again chameleon or chameleon
to<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.750> comes<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.290> or<00:00:43.530> without<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.070> arm<00:00:44.219> same

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
to it comes with or without the arm same

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.150 
to it comes with or without the arm same
two<00:00:44.910> adjustable<00:00:45.300> grips<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.590> put<00:00:46.770> them<00:00:46.950> at

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
two adjustable grips you can put them at

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.569 
two adjustable grips you can put them at
a<00:00:47.219> lower<00:00:47.460> position<00:00:48.079> you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.260> change<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:50.250> arms

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
a lower position you can change the arms

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.319 
a lower position you can change the arms
position<00:00:51.149> as<00:00:51.300> well<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.079> put<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.410> higher

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
position as well you can put it higher

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.569 
position as well you can put it higher
now<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.539> particular<00:00:54.840> model<00:00:55.250> allows<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.430> to

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
now this particular model allows you to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.170 
now this particular model allows you to
have<00:00:56.699> more<00:00:57.239> freedom<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.989> TV<00:00:58.230> set<00:00:58.699> it<00:00:59.699> has

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
have more freedom on a TV set it has

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.990 
have more freedom on a TV set it has
more<00:01:00.570> adjustable<00:01:01.199> positions<00:01:01.730> again<00:01:02.730> with

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
more adjustable positions again with

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.050 
more adjustable positions again with
holes<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> back<00:01:03.690> holes<00:01:04.470> underneath<00:01:05.060> so

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
holes in the back holes underneath so

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.789 
holes in the back holes underneath so
you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.360> easily<00:01:06.600> put<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.140> camera<00:01:07.380> plate<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.780> I

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
you can easily put a camera plate and I

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.410 
you can easily put a camera plate and I
think<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.920> model<00:01:11.310> will<00:01:11.520> pretty<00:01:12.330> much

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
think this model will pretty much

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.590 
think this model will pretty much
revolutionize<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.860> particular<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.909> would<00:01:14.970> say

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
revolutionize in particular I would say

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.340 
revolutionize in particular I would say
the<00:01:15.930> video<00:01:16.170> clip<00:01:16.590> industry<00:01:17.360> they<00:01:18.360> use<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:19.020> lot

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the video clip industry they use a lot

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.800 
the video clip industry they use a lot
of<00:01:19.590> small<00:01:19.890> cameras<00:01:20.340> they<00:01:21.060> always<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.570> all

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
of small cameras they always have all

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.249 
of small cameras they always have all
these<00:01:21.990> weird<00:01:22.320> angles<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:24.110> would<00:01:25.110> recommend

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
these weird angles and I would recommend

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.690 
these weird angles and I would recommend
it<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:26.430> again<00:01:27.090> very<00:01:27.119> compact<00:01:27.840> very<00:01:27.990> solid

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
it it's again very compact very solid

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.010 
it it's again very compact very solid
you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.820> easily<00:01:30.000> put<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.509> plastic<00:01:30.630> case

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
you can easily put it in a plastic case

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.100 
you can easily put it in a plastic case
as<00:01:31.229> well<00:01:31.579> all<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.790> parts<00:01:32.970> are<00:01:33.210> customizable

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
as well all the parts are customizable

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.780 
as well all the parts are customizable
so<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:35.040> really<00:01:35.220> adapt<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.759> to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
so you can really really adapt it to

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.050 
so you can really really adapt it to
your<00:01:35.909> needs<00:01:37.340> what's<00:01:38.340> very<00:01:38.460> interesting<00:01:38.579> with
