00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.930

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.400
 New Year's nail polishes show her too 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.939
 to easter still in drugstore area 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.470
 could get if she wanted and yes 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:19.390
 So I'll show you something like that 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.789
 personally think that's great on New Year's Eve 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.099
 fits and just me so good 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.499
 celebrated in the beginning really would have the first 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.539
 I'm interested in what are yours 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:30.880
 New Year's nail polishes New Year's Eve colors 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.280
 So what do you like best? 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.500
 New Year's update favorite nail polish 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.360
 or since her son every year in iran 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.010
 I'll say I'll start now 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.090
 believe that there are definitely 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.770
 they are from the bonnie strange l the 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.720
 from manhattan 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.420
 I thought so now the camera like that 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.660
 that the lucky recognizes well so that 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.220
 are for example two pieces of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.430
 Mainhattan from the railway spokesman invites 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.960
 they are still available at the moment and the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.790
 I think that is also very appropriate 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.010
 just such a black with such applies 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.110
 silver effects on it or just such a 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.579
 right help is just something 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.360
 if I just fit very well 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.360
 for New Year's Eve 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.360
 then I find these two very nice 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.420
 here are from p 2 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.980
 there is just this n style lacke there 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.100
 I think everything fits so well because 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.570
 that the linzer spark has effect and me 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.970
 just think of New Year's Eve must be so 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.650
 glitter and sparkle and its 22nd 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.030
 colors which I now but have at home 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.190
 maybe it will be his 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.660
 colors give it but what i find it 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.920
 He is very good fits for example that 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.860
 there is such a purple raging with 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.340
 in addition to beautiful glitter and turn 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.080
 or just really do but gold dealer 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.520
 the sentence is a bit borderline like that 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.830
 would be a good mix for christmas 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.479
 and New Year's Eve for me, the two themselves 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.479
 also very brilliant solid 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.359
 So the here they are not but 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.880
 I thought I show them anyway 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.740
 just totally nice that's mine 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.509
 absolute favorite city for semester the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.189
 So, I have been so last years 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.289
 just think it's beautiful 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.539
 that's you chrome nail polish from 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.099
 patrice is supposed to exist here 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.510
 still from other brands so find that 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.200
 but it fits in his very well 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.629
 color mood so purple and silver green 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.129
 so that is very very nice and this 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.129
 Farbspektakel is how it works 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.800
 then I find everything in the blue 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.050
 direction is absolutely great on New Year's Eve 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.610
 so for example by sally hansen with 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.100
 to find a house of it as well 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.600
 really dark night blue there I can 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.430
 just great a nice flaw of his 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.330
 Idea with sauce was something to it 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.970
 maybe I'll do something there 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.510
 But let's see if I eg the very 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.440
 beautiful 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:51.060
 then I have blue petrol now 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.970
 home of essens the same magic 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.620
 neo magnetik nail polish with the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.239
 its great magnetic effect with 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.220
 sunbeaming effect will be great too 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.020
 very good first fitting then I find 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.970
 I think there is a current rally 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.220
 still if you're lucky that's one 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.410
 I also have beautiful blue tons 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.790
 on it but with over-varnish is the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.800
 actually such a beautiful matte 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.300
 effect which I also very very great 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.050
 So if again such a great blue 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.550
 Ton and I do not know if it is still 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.040
 but I am also very pretty 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.540
 that too blue times to one 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.030
 golden shimmer in it just from 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.980
 patrice and has a bit more 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.980
 solemnly it semester moderate 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.829
 then I have two more 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:36.659
 sand nail polishes so with this 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.670
 end effect that I find easy 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.540
 generally super to fit the new year 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.659
 once from essens is such a 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.819
 insane great dread high with train 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:50.219
 Federal Council with the sparkle pieces in it 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.530
 I think it is also very very much 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:55.290
 fit well and just this 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.450
 more effective just like it and fireworks 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.370
 easy or who says he does not like it 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.959
 just hanging so dark nails have found 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.970
 I also the manhattan as up to date 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.189
 so nice to me recently bought it 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.739
 very, very great with this something 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.599
 I'm totally beautiful there has one as well 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.609
 sandy effect and thorsten glitter 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.609
 shimmer absolutely stylish 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.879
 I have here partly in the the 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.580
 Even if you really want to show theme 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:26.430
 but does not get such a thing maybe 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.830
 that's the silver gold 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.440
 oli shade is and i have it now 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.090
 from maria countess that I know so beautiful 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.860
 not where you would have something but determined 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.569
 somewhere also a draw about the so 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.669
 I find that very suitable for 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.669
 New Year's Eve really a nice color 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.729
 Last but not least 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.889
 missing if so i have to 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.410
 example of color works with such a 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.300
 a blue glitter in there so many 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.090
 hollo klÃ¶tzer effect does not believe that 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.740
 mp2 also so close nail polish has 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:02.560
 Look there a drogerie over 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:04.720
 or just this patrice this effect 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.340
 top so that is perfect for 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.150
 New Year's Eve if I'm really with 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.630
 different colorful spectral colors on it 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.630
 absolutely 5 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.910
 that's as colorful as the like 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.460
 I think it's really good 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.250
 to new year everything fit precisely what so 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.900
 many times or just me 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.850
 perfect for me as this year 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.980
 this style nail polish in the still 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.280
 share shares and just totally beautiful 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.960
 on New Year's Eve Benz has a little bit 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.140
 looks special and I just think 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.200
 the color category is so from silver blue 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.700
 you know what you cold gold so me 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.520
 I would say that it is the last one 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.840
 the last corner of gold itself 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.250
 New Year's Eve is still going on 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.450
 or just stop soo do things chrome 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.580
 So you really can not go wrong 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.260
 So that would be like that, so to speak 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.050
 from my imagination the perfect 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.160
 Nail polishes for the New Year's Eve so 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.990
 maybe I hope for something 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.400
 there is a little excitement and 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.350
 then by saying you're off now and 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.180
 just look place without looking first time to 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.920
 home because I think you usually have one 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.790
 something like that at home a drawer 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.500
 lying around 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.050
 So there you find what's in 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.910
 the direction goes and yes if you want 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.560
 I can still try Mali in the west 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.390
 I'm sorry to do it 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.240
 but not if you want that then please 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:44.990
 I try it and in this sense 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.380
 wish quite a great between phase 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.640
 between christmas and new years eve and 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.990
 my voice completely discolored with 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.530
 my cold here now dear 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:57.710

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.460

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.910
