00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 so hello people and welcome 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.080
 back to a tutorial and would like to 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.760
 I show you this time like you are one 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.599
 sphere as the build we go 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.280
 first in photoshop so in 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.320
 We'll make photoshop easy 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.270
 a new file the image size is in 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.730
 no matter how long it says about me 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.260
 100 times 100 zoom is very close 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.490
 for all have fatter in photoshop 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.220
 no problem at all I have 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.109
 We'll choose something for you 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.539
 here then just after a zoom on 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.059
 the highest level of 3200 percent is very high 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.190
 Just recommend the pencil 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.050
 then there is the rattle and then to 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.360
 Example, a circle diameter of 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.390
 For example, select 14 pixels night 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.280
 that was 47 14 and have one more here 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.870
 or less round circle here 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.829
 perhaps could not quite as nice 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.690
 Just try it a little bit 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.550
 maybe the 15 year is a bit 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.289
 better but of course you can 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.640
 just make sizes with your desire 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.770
 just this one looks a bit 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.520
 round out the bigger the whole course 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.399
 is all according to round it is also 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.470
 in proportion and the smaller you the 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.880
 diameter number less and less 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.340
 is of course the whole thing 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.650
 bring now back to minecraft 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.810
 So we have the dome again 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.340
 and here I have one first 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.840
 built hemisphere already enough 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.549
 for illustrative purposes 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.890
 Basically, but the whole thing is like that 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.900
 of course then just as a whole 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.369
 would be so to speak that one has by the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.159
 shadow actually very nice 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.140
 then the basic form is also marked and 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.700
 for the whole once then structurally 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.770
 We will also explain, for example 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.520
 now once the default format take 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.020
 22 12 2 and I just happened to be 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 Also, I just thought about it 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.530
 an image file still in the video 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.390
 description will pack in the easy 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.119
 all big formats of really very 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.860
 small are already pretty big in it 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.090
 so that all are not photoshop 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.159
 have that also easy fast 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.509
 can download and there it is 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.700
 can not catch up in photoshop 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.259
 definitely have to try it out first 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.820
 if we are now with this order of magnitude 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.990
 to build a sphere is the first 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.670
 what we have to do is do it all 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.860
 Of course four times to pull there for 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.450
 set each right angle, so to speak 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.210
 So here again 2 2 1 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.640
 for two he branches to the next one 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.959
 course and the whole course plays in 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.610
 all four directions can now 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.860
 Of course, that happens 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.000
 I am here while clattering by the way 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.540
 then also installed 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.569
 In any case, our right angle 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.690
 main piece so to speak that from there to there 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.430
 first go here two blocks in one 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.470
 direction until it is one 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.180
 that in turn means ours 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.970
 Sphere that the first one first 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.310
 second piece high must understand that 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.980
 Well, I say little is the simplest 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.060
 mathematics but I had to first 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.160
 just look through it 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.480
 until I so far there had to 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.400
 every case is here 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.870
 continuing at 12 years that is after 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.459
 We here a series earth everywhere tuned 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.709
 have not set though 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.390
 diagonal here and here and me but 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.370
 really only directly to the stones 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.349
 We can do this kind of line as 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.670
 helpfully take and then there 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.430
 just another two row 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.110
 put it on two rows because that around the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.900
 to put a blog here as well 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.290
 two blocks long is put here so 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.819
 also two on it 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.370
 so I also do it again 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.750
 It's not a day here, well, now 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.100
 seems to be good for whatever reason 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.470
 ok and then we set our series completely 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.450
 normal 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.859
 next here is a block 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.769
 that means we only have to go in 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.150
 single blog put that up 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.139
 but then always up here, too 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.450
 complete the corner and then another 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.560
 income and here we are okay now 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.389
 are now basically in this piece 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.209
 arrived that in turn two blocks long 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.190
 however the curve, so to speak 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.530
 even the angle is not anymore 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.910
 tip but is now dulled 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.010
 Whatever that means we are putting 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.269
 our first row on it and the second one 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.319
 row just now not over it 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.030
 but before that 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.769
 Here we have to be careful 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.239
 that we are not here for example 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.790
 Make sure you sit in front of it again 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.990
 not diagonals but the whole 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.630
 just because 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.320
 and then comes our next earnings 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.480
 back on it we have here we have 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.920
 again our two that is also called 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.630
 here come the first row again 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.850
 and the second series is this 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.260
 just use the one blog with it 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.760
 have a quarter of our dome too 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.260
 already done and we can 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.520
 Of course now for the rest of the rest 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.950
 then I will do it for a short time 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.840
 pause and see the whole thing 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.280
 then off when it's done is in now 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.780
 not really that size 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.700
 spectacular but I hope you have that 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.200
 principle if you still have it 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.610
 ask then you just write in 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.590
 the comments I hope that it 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.020
 has been sufficiently explained and how 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.590
 said here you can see, among other things 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.660
 once again the structure is really 2214 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.910
 the two latter was yes because here not 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.800
 wonder that belongs to is part of the 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.150
 Pricing structure basically taken looks 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.190
 one on the inside again 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.410
 better just like here ours 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.820
 two two one two two and two 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.860
 and we have that, for example 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.410
 here too, the area just like them 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.540
 from up here is okay i hope 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.980
 that you are beautiful then your e plus 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.540
 or whatever you build with it 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.190
 could build beautiful or from 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.280
 some companies maybe roofs 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.950
 or of eight do not know there will be yours 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.420
 creativity already has its free rein 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.040
 Guess I guess 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.270
 I hope that he definitely 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.770
 what can start that it is you 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.870
 If you have more 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.580
 I have tutorial ideas to implement that way 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.360
 can also write in the like 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.310
 Comments 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.510
 and otherwise I wish you much more 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.510
 fun in minecraft
