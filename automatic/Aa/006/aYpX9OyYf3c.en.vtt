00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.370 
of just how terrifying any future war
would<00:03:42.849> be<00:03:43.060> which<00:03:43.660> seems<00:03:43.930> like<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.110> perfect

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
would be which seems like the perfect

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.380 
would be which seems like the perfect
opportunity<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:45.310> say<00:03:45.489> give<00:03:45.880> peace<00:03:46.209> a<00:03:46.239> chance

so<00:03:47.380> is<00:03:47.830> this<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.310> kind<00:03:48.489> of<00:03:48.849> thing<00:03:49.090> that<00:03:49.120> planet

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
so is this the kind of thing that planet

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.180 
so is this the kind of thing that planet
Earth<00:03:49.690> should<00:03:49.989> be<00:03:50.140> spending<00:03:50.380> its<00:03:50.620> money<00:03:50.680> on<00:03:50.980> or

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
Earth should be spending its money on or

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.280 
Earth should be spending its money on or
