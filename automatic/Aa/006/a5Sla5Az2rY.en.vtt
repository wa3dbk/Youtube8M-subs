00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.220
 when the milk is ready 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.220
 Incorporated 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.130
 like we put a pinch of salt 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.340
 we use 2 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.890
 of these beater is good for everything 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.850

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.790
 Back to the milk reaches almost 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.950
 boil does not have to boil almost to boil 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.500
 and we are going to incorporate 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.500
 this today we are moving 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.250
 and down 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.600
 and now ready to put the rest of 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.430
 our 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:08.350
 it's almost there and almost comes to the boil 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:12.080
 it's a low boil we're incorporating 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.560
 our mix tendency with egg and the 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.560
 cornstarch 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.439
 controlling little by little 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.470
 we are seeing how it is entering 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.900
 and here we incorporate everything 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.050
 it has to be little by little so that it does not 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.050
 we are going to sew the egg 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:05.139
 here we have been beating until 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:05.139
 feel like the cream gets thick 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.430
 Do not stop moving Do not stop beating 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.340
 since it is thick here you can see 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:29.710
 It's thick and we've already taken it out 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:33.010
 fire we are going to put a dash of 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.570
 butter just so it does not make a 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:41.050
 layer above and ready we have 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:44.590

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:48.610
 we let it cool and cool it moss 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:54.180
