00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.080
 hello how about thank you very much how are you 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.030
 the two 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.920
 thank you let me tell you remember 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.170
 you who talked after the 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.760
 speech about the state of the union and 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.250
 we discuss about the proposals 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.410
 of which the president does not 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.470
 had talked again good today the 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.480
 revived and revived a very ambitious plan 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.489
 it's not as ambitious as it was 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.370
 again it is even more important 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.620
 because it would be to create a map of the 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.870
 human brain and in this is going to put 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.270
 work to the national institutes of 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.580
 health to the national science foundation 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.040
 you hear about this even at 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.320
 department of defense and everything is for 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.960
 create a new map of the human brain 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.660
 that brings advances that will be very 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.970
 important to you for us 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.970
 for those who see us for all 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.850
 to the brain we have a way of seeing it 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.500
 working and still with all the 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.990
 current advances 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.290
 We need to know him even more to know 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.330
 all it does and how it does the 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.700
 Dr. Fabian Sandoval led one of 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.130
 the chapters of clinical studies of 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.290
 system innovates what often happens 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.340
 in our brains and one side is damaged 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.290
 of the brain in another the other part of the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.600
 brain tries to compensate compensate 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.400
 as causes the conversation 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.560
 those are cells that are working from 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.660
 new that they did not work before were not 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.119
 doing that function for that we can 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.920
 see these studies to see how the 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.970
 we are starting again to do 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.740
 a physical activity because of this the 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.320
 President Barack Obama proposes to invest 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.189
 100 million dollars to make a map 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.679
 of the human brain 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.930
 norm is master 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.600
 I saw a 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.700
 the purpose says the president would be 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.010
 unravel some of the mysteries of 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.170
 human brain and how to cure the 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.630
 Alzheimer's disease and others 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.090
 disorders such as autism or 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.550
 epilepsy the current technology uses these 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.040
 implants directly into the skull for 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.320
 regulate precisely the activities 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.900
 irregularities of the brain that cause 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.730
 this woman epileptic seizures what 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.130
 makes emitting electric waves that 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.600
 regulate brain activity and reduce 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.850
 the intensity and frequency of 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.220
 seizures when using these techniques 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.920
 different electric we are 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.530
 interrupting that signal so that 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.880
 send so much signal saying actÃ­vate 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.230
 active activates and those activities 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.630
 they cause us the different levels of 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.450
 of epilepsy 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.240
 even with the help of technology this 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.620
 patient can make his doctors 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.560
 check the operation of your implant 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.020
 long distance the new effort 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.880
 will promote technologies that allow 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.950
 researchers produce images 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.570
 dynamics of the brain in which 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.330
 can be seen as the cells 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.270
 individual and complex circuits 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:13.940
 of neurons interact at speed 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:15.620
 of thought and that is reminiscent of 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.810
 you as the president proposed to do 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.230
 this same in his speech the state of 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.240
 the union this will revolutionize the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.180
 medicine the president is telling us 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.770
 that he sees the future of medicine he sees the 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.800
 future of clinical studies and the 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.760
 importance that there is if we prevent before 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.850
 these causes of more severe events will 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.200
 try to prolong the patient's life 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.390
 notice that as you finish 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.800
 to see the scientists can now 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.930
 insert even wires 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.570
 the brains of animals and it's been done 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.570
 in people also now the question is 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.570
 with this hundreds of 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.300
 messages that the brain is sent from a 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.970
 from one part of the brain to another what 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.970
 it's about doing now is establishing the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.010
 basis of how these messages are sent to 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.500
 great speed at the speed of 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.680
 I thought this as the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.500
 doctor sandoval is something huge is something 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.240
 that will give a lot of fruits and 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.340
 that's why being so important 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.709
 we wanted to practice today 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.799
 what we have in washington see you 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.799
 morning
