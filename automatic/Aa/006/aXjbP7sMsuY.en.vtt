00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
have to say it's the internal frame it's

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.860 
have to say it's the internal frame it's
the<00:01:45.470> first<00:01:45.710> max<00:01:46.250> mission<00:01:46.580> back<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.880> cadet<00:01:47.150> we

we're very happy that we can create a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.790 
we're very happy that we can create a

pack that can hold more weight than our

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.270 
pack that can hold more weight than our
previous<00:01:54.979> packs<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.750> what<00:01:57.710> does<00:01:57.860> that<00:01:57.890> frame

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
previous packs and what does that frame

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.700 
previous packs and what does that frame
do<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.910> support<00:01:59.150> the<00:01:59.510> extra<00:01:59.780> weight<00:02:00.020> is<00:02:00.290> it<00:02:00.470> is

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
do to support the extra weight is it is

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.410 
do to support the extra weight is it is
it<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.890> frame<00:02:01.130> itself<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:01.670> makes<00:02:01.850> it<00:02:02.120> able

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
it the frame itself that makes it able

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.770 
it the frame itself that makes it able
to<00:02:02.570> support<00:02:03.020> extra<00:02:03.620> weight<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:04.430> frame<00:02:04.780> helps

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
to support extra weight the frame helps

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.120 
to support extra weight the frame helps
support<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.260> extra<00:02:06.500> weight<00:02:06.650> because<00:02:07.010> it

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
support the extra weight because it

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.880 
support the extra weight because it
keeps<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.940> bag<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.450> shape<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.140> if<00:02:09.770> you

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
keeps the bag in the shape so if you

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.070 
keeps the bag in the shape so if you
have<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.459> magnet<00:02:11.120> doesn't<00:02:11.390> have<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.510> frame<00:02:11.810> and

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
have a magnet doesn't have a frame and

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.260 
have a magnet doesn't have a frame and
it's<00:02:12.260> all<00:02:12.410> soft<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:13.459> once<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.850> start<00:02:14.090> patting

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
it's all soft and once you start patting

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.790 
it's all soft and once you start patting
stuff<00:02:14.570> in<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.900> everything<00:02:15.170> starts<00:02:15.530> falling

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
stuff in and everything starts falling

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.040 
stuff in and everything starts falling
in<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.950> bottom<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:17.360> back<00:02:17.480> gets<00:02:17.750> pushed

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
in the bottom and the back gets pushed

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.670 
in the bottom and the back gets pushed
out<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.260> shape<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:19.840> basically<00:02:20.840> makes

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
out of shape and that basically makes

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.670 
out of shape and that basically makes
the<00:02:21.770> bag<00:02:21.950> not<00:02:22.370> organ<00:02:22.730> Amish<00:02:23.000> anymore<00:02:23.090> because

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
the bag not organ Amish anymore because

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.390 
the bag not organ Amish anymore because
we<00:02:24.680> designed<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.070> ergonomics<00:02:25.610> with<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
we designed the ergonomics with the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.180 
we designed the ergonomics with the
with<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.390> guess<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.840> assumption<00:02:30.319> that<00:02:30.349> all

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
with the I guess the assumption that all

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.440 
with the I guess the assumption that all
parts<00:02:31.459> of<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:31.610> back<00:02:31.760> would<00:02:31.970> sort<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.239> stay<00:02:32.420> in

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
parts of the back would sort of stay in

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.350 
parts of the back would sort of stay in
