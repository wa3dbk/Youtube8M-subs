00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
that are underneath you're always

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.760 
that are underneath you're always
pulling<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:55.990> one<00:04:56.139> that's<00:04:56.320> ones<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:56.710> are

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
pulling the one that's ones that are

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.159 
pulling the one that's ones that are
underneath<00:04:56.979> back<00:04:57.510> makes<00:04:58.510> it<00:04:58.720> much<00:04:58.870> much

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
underneath back makes it much much

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.310 
underneath back makes it much much
easier<00:04:59.490> and<00:05:00.490> gives<00:05:00.970> the<00:05:01.150> effective<00:05:01.660> a<00:05:01.810> basket

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
easier and gives the effective a basket

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.020 
easier and gives the effective a basket
weave<00:05:02.440> so<00:05:03.070> I<00:05:03.100> think<00:05:03.220> this<00:05:03.490> will<00:05:03.639> be<00:05:03.760> our<00:05:03.790> last

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030
