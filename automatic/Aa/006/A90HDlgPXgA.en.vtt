00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 1 

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.810
 e 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.050
 today we will grind bamboo 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.920
 to go see that goes very well 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.920
 good tips 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.640
 most bamboos are between three 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.640
 four or five lady diana centers 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.180
 see the interesting bamboos as 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.620
 the bamboos are long it gives 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.920
 quickly a lot of chips from 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.920
 grinding 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.510
 ah ah 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:42.280
 you see that goes very well and that makes 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.280
 chips for its purposes 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.299
 so here we are going to stop a little while 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.299
 to watch what it gives 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.880
 we get chips to his ends very 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.959
 wet 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.660
 sometimes there are Corsican tips when 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.069
 bamboos are a bit too old 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.810
 because the only trick to actually grind 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.970
 it's to have young bamboos 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.190
 bamboos that pushed for me in 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.510
 general in the week the bamboos 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.709
 grows very fast and you have to 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.709
 take when they are green and tender 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.370
 Sometimes the roots a bit is blocked 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.550
 better maybe carve them a little better 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.550
 before 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.900
 that's good I finish my trip but I 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.960
 tell you next time thanks to the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.960
 meet again 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.440
 yeah
