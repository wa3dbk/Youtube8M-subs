00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.780
 and then people have learned how to wax the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.540
 dragon and to start we go 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.370
 I woke up our star, I took to 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.620
 make you stay more or less right 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.360
 but still I do not get us now 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.390
 get our ball that we will 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.090
 buy this I bought for a real come 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.430
 easy to full also a party house 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.089
 and first we will start to 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.540
 to paint giving our little star to see 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.850
 in that case we are going to pass the 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.940
 two red hands or up to three 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.970
 be very strong on paper only that passes 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.970
 red and then we got some 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.640
 of glue in case of paper spill 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.750
 was very good and will pass through the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.090
 our hamas ball will be marked not 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.780
 will be marked by the white glue 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.270
 when it dries it becomes transparent and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.970
 people are going to put our little star 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.210
 it is important to expect stars and 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.729
 here we are putting the star in the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.700
 glue will set and will put it on 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.470
 place that we need to put you and 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.450
 I expect making of a star or 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.840
 You want two stars only you see 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.290
 in the image where the stars and 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.380
 position them is there will be this 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.380
 way 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.680
 after that we'll put glue 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.840
 new and will pass in the whole sphere that 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.479
 the two more for those who want to pass 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.759
 glue on the inter sphere is as follows: 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.280
 material that is made to the ball the step 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.409
 so if we pass the acrylic paint 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.619
 of plastic she will not catch very well 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.049
 and for her to catch well this way 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.170
 principle we have to prepare the 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:18.720
 our base with glue and how it had not 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.630
 orange ink now I improvised 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.670
 I mixed yellow red until I got it. 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.579
 I needed orange shades. 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.650
 dragon ball very simple mixed and 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.930
 I started to paint on the inside important 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.950
 from inside but only after the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.380
 cola to dry 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.430
 I advise you to wait 12 hours for 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.140
 cola to dry 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.569
 from within the sphere that 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.239
 have to go from three to four hands 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.640
 understood nothing to give a hand and leave 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.950
 it will not be okay 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.620
 the result very bad very poorly done 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.150
 You can see the inside of it. 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:58.120
 then from 3 to 5 hands there in case I am 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:05.859
 showing only the first hand 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:08.560
 and that's it and after painting it's just unite 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:13.590
 after joining we will now see how 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.590
 stayed our dragon ball 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.850
 Hey guys, this was the video and if you 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.970
 Did you like him? 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.610
 You think it's something that we 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.650
 can do in the next tutorial is in case 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.050
 now the saint brings more 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.720
 simple but further on i will 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:59.250
 put some more elaborate 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.910
 so I like it if I can 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.590
 add to favorites told 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.590
 It's good and until the next
