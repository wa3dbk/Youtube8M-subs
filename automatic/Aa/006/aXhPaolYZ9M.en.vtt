00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.390
 first first this thing that they have to 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.479
 have to be partners have to 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:44.079
 be second root users have the boxee 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:46.239
 box and third have connection to wi fi and 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.430
 fourth have an application that is called 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.710
 auto killer is very easy very simple 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.290
 just follow my steps when we go to 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.510
 go to this one 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.040
 to the play start is the program that 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.950
 we have to have it called auto 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.110
 killer this good let's go to the play 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.400
 start to search for more programs 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.470
 that we will use to be able to 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.330
 do our smartphone or whatever 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.280
 our tablet is faster than this is 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.409
 for android devices 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.369
 we're going to wait for them to carry an apology 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:25.869
 it is very very delayed this this 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.869
 let's find car auto killer 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.840
 auto killer to me already derived me auto 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.880
 killer memory optimizer there are three 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.150
 applications of these there are two that are of 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.650
 pay and one that is free let's use it 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.190
 free as you realize is the bow and 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.290
 the optimal stern root memory optimize 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.750
 there are three applications that we are going to 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.630
 use is the free one that 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.160
 Sincerely, it's also very good for 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.640
 me and you gave me an application that is 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.400
 very complete and what better than since 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.680
 it's free do not be like you realize 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.910
 Well, it's this application they only give 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.100
 the fan install and this I 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.470
 I do not give it to install because the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.239
 I have installed once they owe him 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.790
 install accept the terms them 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.820
 start installing and downloading and 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.390
 Well, be it, we already downloaded this 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.110
 application so now let's find the 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.110
 boxee box app 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.940
 we'll see 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.010
 let's erase this 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.879
 and we are going to look for the other 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.319
 books and I these applications I leave 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.230
 the description of the video if not 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.750
 they understand again X thing so that 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.970
 do not miss this great video 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.900
 good tutorial is this boxee app 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.150
 We only give in box and enter 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.239
 It is also the installation 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.849
 just give him install and accept the 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.450
 terms and it would be the only thing that 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.040
 we would need good already being already 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.739
 having the two applications in their 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.450
 insults blÃ© all in his smartphones then 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.460
 let's go to 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.770
 this 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.960
 to the auto killer application as they are 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.240
 I said they have to be root users if they do not 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.800
 are root users are not going to serve them and 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.680
 they have to have the boxee box app 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.900
 if they do not have them then obviously they do not 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.780
 will serve this only serves to super 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.610
 users because it asks for permits from those 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.890
 users as they realize then there already 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.380
 I got the box that has been 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.560
 granted permission of superuser and 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.780
 we're going to wait 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.660
 if you are some people who 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.700
 like to play a lot because this is also 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.560
 application serves them a lot how they are given 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.780
 account then in here on the screen and the 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.640
 table I already opened the application says the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.280
 kind of android that you have as 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.550
 in my case I have an android 4.0 point 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.739
 4 and it tells me that my phone my tablet 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.959
 is surrounded in the yellow letters that 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.950
 they look on the left side in the part 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.780
 superior and it says boxee box and they say in the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.420
 Green letters says to accept to accept 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.450
 because I have installed them I have there 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.519
 I have rooted the tablet and says accept 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.380
 boxee box to accept because I have the 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.660
 application and this is the good part 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.459
 friends well where it says change and 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.370
 advanced only you give two in 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.160
 where it says to change you are going to 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.560
 come out good let's give it in change 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.520
 if you are a person who only 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.680
 Your tablet has it as for to 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.240
 facebook and social networks or your 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.850
 smartphone is for social networks 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.770
 give optimum optimum where is the 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.470
 third option and if you are a 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.110
 person who really like to play this 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.540
 either games on your tablet or on your 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.470
 denle smartphone where it says 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.750
 aggressive that is 82 90 98 what is it used for 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.050
 this option this option serves to make 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.300
 your tablet or your phone is made 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.120
 faster but if you if you are watching 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.120
 that this application you stay 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.150
 forced closures of applications 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.910
 no longer put him in aggressive put it on 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:16.290
 strict mode so let's do 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.300
 this so that the acceleration of this 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.360
 application is not so much and does not cause 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.010
 the forced closures and good as you 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.770
 I said if you are a person that you play 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.600
 you like to play games a lot 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.760
 on your tablet where a phone then you 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.520
 I recommend that you put it in aggressive 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.010
 but if it gives you as I told you closures and 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.370
 Forced closures, sorry, and put him in 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:41.610
 strict and if you continue to see that 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:44.130
 there were the forced closures this 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.710
 you put the optimum in the third option 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.260
 this me as I am a person who 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.090
 like to play a lot of games this I 'm going 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.280
 to put on aggressive 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.610
 and as you realize then when 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.699
 you select this is it going to 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.740
 change this is these options where 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.199
 says aggressive on the net read letters 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.810
 yellow says something hidden 90's 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.540
 provider and content empty this already 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.940
 change as you realize then this 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.169
 application if it serves for that to 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.169
 Speed Up Your you 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:20.629
 your tablet or your smartphone this and 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.430
 If you are a person that we say no 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:24.289
 since nothing else your phone occupies it for 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.479
 social networks but you want more agile 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:28.849
 in which your phone or your 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.789
 tablet then only put in strict 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:34.490
 in strict that is so that for you 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:37.069
 your tablet accelerates faster and you can 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.360
 this occupy the fastest and good here 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.610
 as they realize, I'm going to 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.050
 put on aggressive because I am a 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.240
 person who likes to play many games 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.909
 well this has been all friends I hope 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.680
 that you liked to look for forgiveness other 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:51.229
 thing then says advanced because it gives you 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:55.360
 an option of you to put the mode to 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:57.800
 how much do you want this one so you can this one 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.360
 you can modify it customize it 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.189
 manually but I do not recommend it 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.050
 because you honestly do not know how much or 

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:04.669
 how much is what you 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.089
 you need you can activate this option 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:11.629
 where it says change all the options 

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:14.659
 entity 3 4 5 6 7 options as I told you 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:17.330
 Well, I select aggressive because 

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:18.889
 I really like games and more 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.650
