00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:06.820
 subscribe to the channel will be a lot 

00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:07.920
 interesting Hello I dug 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:13.240
 workshop 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:16.180
 one of his first say so very 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:21.390
 one of his first computers and that 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:24.190
 who remembers zx spectrum and Leningrad and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.480
 all its likeness in this case 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:33.219
 body of course reasonable 0 1 that is who 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:39.699
 sees who knows who does not see here 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:41.739
 a closer team inside is certainly not his 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.289
 board inside board according to my standard 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:49.420
 Grodskaya narrow tires in this case, he 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:54.459
 was modernized so this is me already 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.199
 was taken see food 12 15 court I 

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:59.530
 I do not remember why it means yellow 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.749
 probably 12 and why not 12 knowing more 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.120
 everyone should be 5 volts I donâ€™t remember 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.920
 guys, I would like to share while he 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.790
 not completely dead it was a video output 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.790
 I have a tulip made 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:19.149
 the processor by the way is not the most sure 1 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.549
 probably here everything is as 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.009
 capacitors were probably released on 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.630
 the market and bought multiple times here 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.939
 green capacitors already all the floors of the body 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.609
 Do I have to do something already? 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.799
 found with capacitor plus microcircuits 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.869
 memory also had all the panels 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.780
 cut species memory flew she 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.079
 loved to fly out at that time 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:47.409
 Respectively already memory Sana sockets 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:48.539
 what else is RAM like a place 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.789
 second bubble 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.000
 what kind of dance is it if you 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.000
 it is seen 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.890
 this is our 61 512 such memory can 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.890
 meet on old motherboards there 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.980
 pentium 1 2 for cache in my processor 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.860
 He was found and speed memory 15 she 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:16.170
 seconds i'm not mistaken or microseconds 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.470
 dynamics it was made like a page who 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.830
 here was made in pzu it was possible 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.170
 team calls suddenly that is, I wrote 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.800
 the code itself will forget whether seconds it was possible 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.459
 copy here and distinguish it 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.070
 I use of course already 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.900
 one here of course me the register of storms on 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.390
 switch off the valve that is on 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.830
 keyboard 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.650
 I could calmly edit myself 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.140
 write code could use memory all 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.390
 basically this whole memory is also numbers 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.010
 page on this part well, that is, on 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.780
 video image she stayed here 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.620
 and the whole page memory is static and 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.120
 when you connect the thread of water about the wild 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.790
 you can see yes as many as three 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.790
 and here from paladin remember that is 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.780
 when you connect the batteries here me 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.580
 the machine code program it remained 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.110
 so here you could write 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.730
 the program for example was there one of 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.890
 class find returned to those who screamed 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:17.040
 billiard principle could this game 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.799
 fill it started by code that is 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.390
 at first it took 32 kilobytes run i 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.560
 even for this was once you Cinderella 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.060
 stitched and pasted here 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.790
 when i had to just play 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.920
 or just her, that is, kapets to 1 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.480
 RAM 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.880
 memory and just ran it by code 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.360
 here 64 kilobytes just pirate dough 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:40.230
 which is minus 16 kilobytes that is 48th 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.519
 Well, in principle, what worked 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.790
 of course very much at one time 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.890
 black and white monitor or tv 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.310
 most likely part of the year was the monitor 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.290
 to work guys like this here 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.380
 Volume is not a reset button 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:59.299
 and here we have another super punch and 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.299
 some of them saw something sound 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:07.420
 here is such a nostalgia 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.269
 it was all one of a retro video 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.689
 everybody while registering on the channel wait 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.689
 of news
