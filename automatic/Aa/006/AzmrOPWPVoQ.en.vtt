 come to another video and people of this 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.380
 I'm here in minecraft pocket instead 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.269
 edition and today I'm going to teach you something 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.840
 very interesting, what can we give? 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.840
 do in version 0.12 guys I'll teach 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.239
 for you there is how to make the villagers 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.730
 reproduce first you will 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.010
 need to build a base here 10 per 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.290
 10 nor do I think it can be with any 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.180
 block but I decided to make here stone 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.789
 then you will make a base that 10 per 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.270
 10 forming a square takes a look 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.789
 guys 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.860
 you will make a square 10 by 10 and 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.719
 after you make that base 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.969
 just put doors around 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.879
 Take a look only you will put doors 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.350
 around here everywhere 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.510
 After you do that you will 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.720
 enter this base and will be placing 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.700
 two adult villagers and you will see only 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.460
 What 's happening is not 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.950
 I need this villager, kid, here I go. 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.650
 It's killing us right, we have some. 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.390
 adult and those who have one more 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.860
 a sleepy look that will happen to 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.259
 people look at the old man 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.270
 we stay here spying on him like this 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.369
 suddenly the two begin to 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 chatting will start coming out privately 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.420
 and everything else 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.400
 and look, the guys started here, 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.740
 start talking leya is ours 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.420
 guys the most of this tutorial I saw there 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.820
 on the droid monster channel in case you 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.829
 I want to check his channel, I'll leave it. 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.320
 in the description of the right video 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.240
 Look, they just start talking to 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.290
 the guys and suddenly look what's going 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.360
 to happen 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.909
 Let me look, I do not know if I can not 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.159
 stay close but look what's going 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.049
 the guys will happen they will stay right there 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.469
 exchanging an idea will leave the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.840
 particles and until the guys are leaving 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.610
 a little villager here running child 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.500
 let's take some time have since 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.490
 conversations there lasted about one 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.619
 minute right 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.789
 but it's less like waiting for a 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.450
 bit right 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.840
 Some beauty, they 're talking there and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.760

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.110

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.599
 talking in crowd 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.890
 Caraca looks at the glass, even though the 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.050
 particles 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.330

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.170

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.209
