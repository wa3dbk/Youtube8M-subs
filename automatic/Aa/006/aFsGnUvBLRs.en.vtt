we passed our six-year anniversary and I

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.850 
we passed our six-year anniversary and I
thought<00:04:28.520> if<00:04:29.060> in<00:04:29.270> fact<00:04:29.479> this<00:04:30.080> was<00:04:30.289> successful

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
thought if in fact this was successful

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.339 
thought if in fact this was successful
today<00:04:31.009> but<00:04:31.699> he<00:04:31.880> had<00:04:32.120> no<00:04:32.300> doubt<00:04:32.479> but<00:04:32.900> I<00:04:33.110> probably

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
today but he had no doubt but I probably

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.320 
today but he had no doubt but I probably
had<00:04:33.590> more<00:04:33.740> doubt<00:04:33.979> that<00:04:34.130> anyone<00:04:34.340> but<00:04:35.060> if<00:04:35.210> this

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
had more doubt that anyone but if this

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.839 
had more doubt that anyone but if this
