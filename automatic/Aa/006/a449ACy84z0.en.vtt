00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.990 
have to actually set up your stream key
and<00:03:41.190> stuff<00:03:41.340> like<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.670> if<00:03:41.760> you're<00:03:41.880> using

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
and stuff like that if you're using

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.690 
and stuff like that if you're using
twitch<00:03:42.359> or<00:03:42.989> any<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.290> these<00:03:43.440> um<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.519> can<00:03:44.640> also

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
twitch or any of these um you can also

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.670 
twitch or any of these um you can also
use<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:44.940> custom<00:03:45.180> stream<00:03:45.630> streaming<00:03:46.230> server<00:03:46.530> so

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
use a custom stream streaming server so

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.319 
use a custom stream streaming server so
I'm<00:03:46.739> guessing<00:03:47.100> you<00:03:47.700> would<00:03:47.820> use<00:03:47.940> this<00:03:48.120> if

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
I'm guessing you would use this if

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.770 
I'm guessing you would use this if
you're<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.540> partner<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:48.989> MLG<00:03:49.470> TV<00:03:50.000> but<00:03:51.000> yeah<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:51.540> I

guys really want me to my settings are

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.700 
guys really want me to my settings are
pretty<00:03:56.099> basic<00:03:56.750> they're<00:03:57.750> not<00:03:57.900> like<00:03:58.140> amazing

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
pretty basic they're not like amazing

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.020 
pretty basic they're not like amazing
stuff<00:03:58.980> like<00:03:59.100> that<00:03:59.280> but<00:03:59.460> I<00:03:59.520> mean<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.790> kind<00:04:00.000> of

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
stuff like that but I mean I kind of

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.280

could<00:04:01.440> pause<00:04:01.650> through<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.340> make<00:04:02.820> sure<00:04:02.970> you

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
could pause through and make sure you

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.790 
could pause through and make sure you
got<00:04:03.240> some<00:04:03.480> decent<00:04:03.660> settings<00:04:04.110> going<00:04:04.410> on<00:04:04.560> on
