00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
young so that's what I don't decide just

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.660 
young so that's what I don't decide just
keep<00:01:01.320> washing<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.070> he<00:01:02.190> was<00:01:02.340> me<00:01:02.460> at<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
keep washing so if he was me at the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.280 
keep washing so if he was me at the
thought<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.780> over

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
thought of it's over

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.780 
thought of it's over
how's<00:01:04.530> he<00:01:04.619> doing<00:01:04.799> Ernie<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.100> couple<00:01:05.489> years<00:01:05.670> ago

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
how's he doing Ernie a couple years ago

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.460 
how's he doing Ernie a couple years ago
was<00:01:06.119> such<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> huge<00:01:06.659> blow<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:06.930> because<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.409> think

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
was such a huge blow for because I think

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.600 
was such a huge blow for because I think
she<00:01:07.740> probably<00:01:07.890> would<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.189> made<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> fence

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
she probably would have made the fence

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.300 
she probably would have made the fence
squad<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.450> year<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.290> also<00:01:10.950> nice<00:01:11.130> she's

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
squad that year so it's also nice she's

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.190 
squad that year so it's also nice she's
been<00:01:11.549> given<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.030> opportunity<00:01:12.270> again<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
been given this opportunity again to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.450 
been given this opportunity again to
come<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.560> trials<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.010> actually<00:01:14.250> make<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
come to trials and actually make the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.160 
come to trials and actually make the
phone<00:01:14.610> squad<00:01:14.970> which<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.390> which<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:15.900> huge

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
phone squad which is which is huge

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.870 
phone squad which is which is huge
because<00:01:16.320> she's<00:01:16.560> such<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> natural<00:01:17.250> talent<00:01:17.610> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
because she's such a natural talent and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.789 
because she's such a natural talent and
I<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.750> being<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.140> environment<00:01:19.650> really

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
I think being this environment really

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.260 
I think being this environment really
push<00:01:20.040> her<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.310> make<00:01:20.490> her<00:01:20.520> their<00:01:20.909> much<00:01:21.030> more<00:01:21.060> of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
push her and make her their much more of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.539 
push her and make her their much more of

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
a better player Katarina Cooper is one
