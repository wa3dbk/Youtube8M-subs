00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
but I have added two-factor

but I have added two-factor
authentication<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.860> would<00:00:52.980> recommend<00:00:53.399> anyone

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
authentication I would recommend anyone

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.590 
authentication I would recommend anyone
to<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.379> well<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.969> to<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.120> one<00:00:57.149> more

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
to do that as well just to have one more

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.380 
to do that as well just to have one more
level<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.050> security<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.620> an<00:00:59.489> email<00:00:59.969> account

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
level of security for an email account

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.910 
level of security for an email account
is<00:01:00.570> especially<00:01:00.899> important<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:01.590> that's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
is especially important because that's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.160 
is especially important because that's
where<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.250> get<00:01:02.430> forgotten<00:01:03.300> password<00:01:03.719> sent<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and it's anyway it's highly recommended

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.810 
and it's anyway it's highly recommended
to<00:01:07.710> add<00:01:07.920> some<00:01:08.189> security<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.700> your<00:01:09.000> account<00:01:10.820> so

longer<00:01:52.380> working<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.950> was<00:01:53.070> still<00:01:53.250> running

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
longer working it was still running

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
longer working it was still running
every<00:01:54.030> week<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:54.810> no<00:01:55.110> longer<00:01:55.290> able<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
every week but it was no longer able to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.469 
every week but it was no longer able to
log<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.579> when<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> was<00:01:56.969> creating<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
log in so when I was creating the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.840 
log in so when I was creating the
screencast<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.229> went<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.500> checked<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.250> sure

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
screencast I went and checked and sure

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.700 
screencast I went and checked and sure
enough<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.299> test<00:02:00.750> failed<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.890> created<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.820> an

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
enough the test failed so I created a an

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.990 
enough the test failed so I created a an
application<00:02:04.710> account<00:02:05.250> through<00:02:05.579> Google

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
application account through Google

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.330 
application account through Google
you'll<00:02:06.210> know<00:02:07.170> more<00:02:07.350> about<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.740> once<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.129> set

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
you'll know more about that once you set

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.729 
you'll know more about that once you set
up<00:02:08.450> two-factor<00:02:09.450> authentication<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:10.530> just

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
up two-factor authentication but just

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.680 
up two-factor authentication but just
something<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.099> be<00:02:12.000> reminded<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.480> it's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
something to be reminded of it's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.000 
something to be reminded of it's
probably<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.290> good<00:02:13.379> idea

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
probably a good idea

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.890 
probably a good idea
check<00:02:14.700> your<00:02:14.849> backups<00:02:15.270> every<00:02:15.510> once<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.870> while

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
check your backups every once in a while

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.229 
check your backups every once in a while
just<00:02:16.050> make<00:02:16.440> sure<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.650> they're<00:02:17.239> successfully

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
just make sure that they're successfully

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.970 
just make sure that they're successfully
backing<00:02:18.599> up<00:02:18.720> one<00:02:18.959> thing<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:19.379> pretty<00:02:19.650> easy<00:02:19.860> to

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
backing up one thing it's pretty easy to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.220 
backing up one thing it's pretty easy to
do<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.610> simply<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.510> case<00:02:21.750> think<00:02:21.989> of<00:02:22.140> an

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
do is to simply in this case think of an

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.440 
do is to simply in this case think of an
email<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.769> sent<00:02:23.010> recently<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.640> then<00:02:24.209> go

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
email that you sent recently and then go

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.240 
email that you sent recently and then go
look<00:02:24.629> forward<00:02:24.959> here<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.290> if<00:02:25.709> it's<00:02:25.860> there<00:02:26.010> then

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
look forward here and if it's there then

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.710 
look forward here and if it's there then
your<00:02:26.550> backups<00:02:26.879> are<00:02:26.970> working<00:02:27.269> if<00:02:27.510> not<00:02:27.950> fix<00:02:28.950> it

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
your backups are working if not fix it

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.229 
your backups are working if not fix it
so<00:02:30.720> I'm<00:02:31.050> going<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.500> hide<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.250> away<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.849> show

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
so I'm going to hide this away and show

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.830 
so I'm going to hide this away and show
you<00:02:33.300> how<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.410> add<00:02:34.620> your<00:02:34.739> own<00:02:34.890> account<00:02:35.220> so

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
you how you can add your own account so

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.630 
you how you can add your own account so
there's<00:02:36.840> any<00:02:37.110> number<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.560> different<00:02:37.950> email

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
there's any number of different email

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.360 
there's any number of different email
clients<00:02:39.090> here<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.480> can<00:02:39.660> add<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.920> let's<00:02:41.130> say

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
clients here you can add in so let's say

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.960 
clients here you can add in so let's say
we're<00:02:41.849> Bob<00:02:42.239> at<00:02:42.480> gmail.com<00:02:43.220> then<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.459> start<00:02:44.849> it

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
we're Bob at gmail.com then you start it

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.390 
we're Bob at gmail.com then you start it
and<00:02:45.120> when<00:02:45.629> you<00:02:45.720> enter<00:02:46.019> in<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.230> password<00:02:46.400> it's

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
and when you enter in the password it's

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.979 
and when you enter in the password it's
going<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.670> ask<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.090> for<00:02:48.299> some<00:02:48.510> other<00:02:48.630> things

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
going to ask you for some other things

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.110 
going to ask you for some other things
one<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.470> them<00:02:49.680> being<00:02:49.890> setting<00:02:50.459> your<00:02:50.640> IMAP

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
one of them being setting your IMAP

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.180 
one of them being setting your IMAP
server<00:02:52.049> settings<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.829> can<00:02:52.980> be<00:02:53.069> done

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
server settings and that can be done

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.490 
server settings and that can be done
pretty<00:02:53.760> simply<00:02:54.180> through<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.510> Gmail<00:02:54.870> web

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
pretty simply through the Gmail web

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.069 
pretty simply through the Gmail web
interface<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.340> settings<00:02:56.700> there<00:02:56.959> you<00:02:57.959> can

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
interface and the settings there you can

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.289 
interface and the settings there you can
also<00:02:58.200> manually<00:02:58.829> set<00:02:59.220> your<00:02:59.459> different

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
also manually set your different

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.759 
also manually set your different
settings<00:03:00.690> if<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.900> happen<00:03:01.349> to<00:03:01.380> know<00:03:01.500> them<00:03:01.650> if

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
settings if you happen to know them if

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.610 
settings if you happen to know them if
it's<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:02.069> local<00:03:02.549> server<00:03:02.819> or<00:03:03.030> something<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.620> so

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
it's a local server or something and so

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.280 
it's a local server or something and so
once<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.010> do<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.760> it'll<00:03:06.360> be<00:03:06.690> added<00:03:06.930> down

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
once you do that it'll be added down

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.589 
once you do that it'll be added down
here<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:07.890> then<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.549> can<00:03:08.670> see<00:03:08.849> this<00:03:08.970> run<00:03:09.269> and

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
here and then you can see this run and

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.809 
here and then you can see this run and
that's<00:03:10.019> kind<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.799> simplest<00:03:11.069> process<00:03:11.400> is

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
that's kind of the simplest process is

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.509 
that's kind of the simplest process is
you<00:03:12.090> just<00:03:12.299> add<00:03:12.540> your<00:03:12.569> account<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.200> run<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.560> but

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
you just add your account and run it but

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.610 
you just add your account and run it but
of<00:03:14.610> course<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.910> don't<00:03:15.060> want<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.269> be<00:03:15.620> relying

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
of course you don't want to be relying

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.559 
of course you don't want to be relying
on<00:03:16.799> your<00:03:16.980> memory<00:03:17.310> for<00:03:17.700> backups<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.299> want<00:03:18.480> to

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
on your memory for backups you want to

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.509 
on your memory for backups you want to
automate<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.260> have<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:19.980> be<00:03:20.100> running

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
automate it and have it be running

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.059 
automate it and have it be running
whenever<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.840> even<00:03:22.139> if<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.319> don't<00:03:22.530> think<00:03:22.889> of

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
whenever you even if you don't think of

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.629 
whenever you even if you don't think of
it<00:03:23.190> or<00:03:23.450> remember<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.680> so<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:26.040> can<00:03:26.250> create

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
it or remember it so you can create

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.470 
it or remember it so you can create
shortcut<00:03:27.239> on<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.450> desktop<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:29.209> then<00:03:30.209> if<00:03:30.329> we

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
shortcut on the desktop and then if we

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.300 
shortcut on the desktop and then if we
look<00:03:30.510> in<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.870> desktop<00:03:31.170> we<00:03:31.500> see<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.799> here<00:03:32.160> and

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
look in the desktop we see it here and

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.520 
look in the desktop we see it here and
then<00:03:32.910> right-click<00:03:33.420> on<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.780> with<00:03:33.989> properties

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
then right-click on it with properties

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.670 
then right-click on it with properties
and<00:03:35.180> move<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.299> up<00:03:36.389> here<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.870> can<00:03:37.380> see<00:03:37.560> the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
and move it up here you can see the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.220 
and move it up here you can see the
command<00:03:38.040> that<00:03:38.130> they're<00:03:38.340> running<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:39.230> I

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:01.920 
there's my password again go oh you
didn't<00:05:53.770> get<00:05:54.730> the<00:05:54.880> command<00:05:55.270> let's<00:05:55.720> light<00:05:56.200> it<00:05:56.230> up

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.620 

so<00:06:02.930> we<00:06:03.320> paste<00:06:03.620> that<00:06:03.860> in<00:06:04.070> and<00:06:04.430> now<00:06:04.460> this<00:06:05.270> is<00:06:05.479> the

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
so we paste that in and now this is the

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.820 
so we paste that in and now this is the
command<00:06:05.930> that<00:06:05.990> it's<00:06:06.139> going<00:06:06.290> to<00:06:06.350> run<00:06:06.530> and<00:06:06.800> you

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
command that it's going to run and you

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.580 
command that it's going to run and you
can<00:06:07.070> see<00:06:07.340> that<00:06:08.330> this<00:06:08.570> is<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.900> same<00:06:09.110> command

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
can see that this is the same command

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:20.590 
can see that this is the same command
that<00:06:10.340> I<00:06:10.400> have<00:06:10.729> here<00:06:12.160> very<00:06:13.160> same<00:06:13.430> command<00:06:19.600> C

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
that I have here very same command C

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.379 
that I have here very same command C
portable<00:06:21.380> C<00:06:21.800> archive<00:06:22.130> ID<00:06:22.370> one<00:06:22.610> so<00:06:23.090> that's<00:06:23.210> how

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
portable C archive ID one so that's how

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.870 
portable C archive ID one so that's how
you<00:06:23.449> know<00:06:23.690> what<00:06:24.289> now<00:06:24.800> I<00:06:25.100> don't<00:06:25.430> know<00:06:25.639> for<00:06:25.669> sure

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
you know what now I don't know for sure

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.080 
you know what now I don't know for sure
but<00:06:26.539> I'm<00:06:26.750> guessing<00:06:27.410> the<00:06:28.039> ID<00:06:28.280> is<00:06:28.789> just

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
but I'm guessing the ID is just

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.879 
but I'm guessing the ID is just
referring<00:06:29.479> to<00:06:29.690> what<00:06:30.020> row<00:06:30.229> it<00:06:30.380> is<00:06:30.500> so<00:06:30.710> if<00:06:30.770> you

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
referring to what row it is so if you

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.100 
referring to what row it is so if you
had<00:06:31.070> three<00:06:31.310> or<00:06:31.400> four<00:06:31.430> different<00:06:31.580> emails<00:06:32.110> id-1

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
had three or four different emails id-1

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
had three or four different emails id-1
id2<00:06:33.320> ID<00:06:33.710> three<00:06:34.070> and<00:06:34.280> i<00:06:34.760> don't<00:06:35.030> know<00:06:35.300> if<00:06:35.600> you<00:06:35.810> can

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
id2 ID three and i don't know if you can

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.460 
id2 ID three and i don't know if you can
specify<00:06:37.130> a<00:06:37.340> few<00:06:37.699> different<00:06:38.090> ones<00:06:38.210> on<00:06:38.539> a<00:06:38.630> single

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
specify a few different ones on a single

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.740 
specify a few different ones on a single
command<00:06:39.800> or<00:06:40.010> you<00:06:40.430> could<00:06:40.880> just<00:06:40.910> run<00:06:41.419> them<00:06:41.570> in

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
command or you could just run them in

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.950 
command or you could just run them in
sequence<00:06:43.180> afterward<00:06:44.180> but<00:06:44.360> I<00:06:44.389> just<00:06:44.660> have<00:06:44.810> one

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
sequence afterward but I just have one

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.420 
sequence afterward but I just have one
email<00:06:45.410> address<00:06:45.650> that<00:06:45.680> I'm<00:06:45.919> really<00:06:46.010> concerned

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
email address that I'm really concerned

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.439 
email address that I'm really concerned
about<00:06:46.760> backing<00:06:47.270> up<00:06:47.389> my<00:06:47.510> primary<00:06:47.780> one<00:06:48.110> and<00:06:49.449> then

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
about backing up my primary one and then

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:51.430 
about backing up my primary one and then
you<00:06:50.570> really<00:06:50.750> don't<00:06:50.870> have<00:06:50.930> to<00:06:50.990> worry<00:06:51.169> about<00:06:51.229> the

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
you really don't have to worry about the

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.260 
you really don't have to worry about the
rest<00:06:51.620> of<00:06:51.740> these<00:06:51.889> these<00:06:52.250> are<00:06:52.310> just<00:06:52.580> the<00:06:53.090> default

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
rest of these these are just the default

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650 
of having it done this way is that on

Sunday morning on a Saturday morning
after<00:07:11.570> this<00:07:11.900> is<00:07:12.020> run<00:07:12.260> I<00:07:12.470> see<00:07:13.220> the<00:07:13.849> mail<00:07:14.060> store

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 
after this is run I see the mail store

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.379 
after this is run I see the mail store
window<00:07:16.220> open<00:07:16.520> it's<00:07:16.639> actually<00:07:16.970> not<00:07:17.090> that<00:07:17.150> big

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389 
window open it's actually not that big

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:18.730 
window open it's actually not that big
of<00:07:17.510> a<00:07:17.570> negative<00:07:17.720> because<00:07:18.169> at<00:07:18.289> least<00:07:18.380> it<00:07:18.590> lets

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:18.740 
of a negative because at least it lets

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.589 
of a negative because at least it lets
me<00:07:18.889> know<00:07:18.919> that<00:07:19.039> it<00:07:19.220> ran<00:07:19.460> now<00:07:19.940> unfortunately<00:07:20.300> I

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:20.599 
me know that it ran now unfortunately I

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:23.230 
me know that it ran now unfortunately I
wasn't<00:07:20.960> checking<00:07:21.080> the<00:07:21.440> the<00:07:22.070> status<00:07:22.400> of<00:07:22.760> that

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
wasn't checking the the status of that

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.480 
wasn't checking the the status of that
run<00:07:23.510> and<00:07:23.750> I<00:07:24.199> would<00:07:24.409> have<00:07:24.500> noticed<00:07:24.830> if<00:07:25.070> I<00:07:25.190> just

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.490 
run and I would have noticed if I just

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.000 
run and I would have noticed if I just
spread<00:07:26.449> this<00:07:26.659> out<00:07:26.900> here<00:07:27.169> that<00:07:27.320> it<00:07:27.409> was<00:07:27.530> failed

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.010 
spread this out here that it was failed

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.339 
spread this out here that it was failed
and<00:07:28.280> I<00:07:28.880> could<00:07:29.120> have<00:07:29.210> fixed<00:07:29.360> it<00:07:29.539> so<00:07:29.659> it<00:07:29.870> did<00:07:30.110> run

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:30.349 
and I could have fixed it so it did run

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:33.460 
and I could have fixed it so it did run
last<00:07:31.280> Saturday<00:07:31.699> at<00:07:31.789> 4:30<00:07:32.300> but<00:07:32.960> it<00:07:33.050> failed<00:07:33.320> so

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.470 
last Saturday at 4:30 but it failed so

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.129 
last Saturday at 4:30 but it failed so
that's<00:07:33.770> kind<00:07:33.979> of<00:07:34.039> useless<00:07:34.280> so<00:07:35.120> again<00:07:35.870> just<00:07:35.900> a

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:36.139 
that's kind of useless so again just a

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:37.810 
that's kind of useless so again just a
reminder<00:07:36.229> to<00:07:36.710> make<00:07:36.919> sure<00:07:37.070> to<00:07:37.159> check<00:07:37.400> that<00:07:37.430> and

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:37.820 
reminder to make sure to check that and

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.659 
reminder to make sure to check that and
make<00:07:37.880> sure<00:07:38.539> it<00:07:38.630> ran<00:07:38.840> and<00:07:39.220> once<00:07:40.220> you<00:07:40.370> have<00:07:40.490> that

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:40.669 
make sure it ran and once you have that

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.670 
make sure it ran and once you have that
you'll<00:07:40.940> have<00:07:41.090> all<00:07:41.270> your<00:07:41.300> email<00:07:41.780> and<00:07:41.990> you<00:07:42.500> can
