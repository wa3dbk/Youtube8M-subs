 snow white i am a stylist and i would like to 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.320
 this video in this story 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.940
 tell you about the five rules of behavior 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.430
 on sales 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.390
 as you can imagine summer is 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.539
 time when rest is already notes and do it 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.599
 and why not go well, for example in 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.199
 same department store from goals cyc and not 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.320
 evaluate just a wide range 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.500
 clothes that hang with perks sail 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.629
 which falls under sales 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.430
 why not learn to buy 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.320
 right why not learn 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.899
 choose the things that fit 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.370
 Your wardrobe, especially with discounts 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.649
 doing it is always much nicer and so 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.160
 5 rules of conduct for sales 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.120
 rule number one before going 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.370
 on sale 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.430
 make yourself a small shopping list 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.630
 maybe he will have you big thing 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.820
 the main thing that you have to go to the store 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.369
 purposefully you must understand what 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.460
 what items of clothing are missing your 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.470
 wardrobe rule number two should you 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.200
 be enough free time for 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.630
 shopping as soon as shopping has any 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.180
 time constraints so immediately you 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.159
 start to get nervous and worry about 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.090
 that you do not have enough time to measure everything 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.240
 outfits and trust me during 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.490
 time and concluded the whole chip sales 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.750
 the less you have it the less 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.210
 probabilities of finding the most say so 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.649
 the sweetest most attractive thing 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.210
 lowest price 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.360
 rule number three or tip number 3 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.380
 know your exact size and know exactly 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.950
 your silhouette 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.950
 which suits you and if you come for 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.530
 something fitted or silhouette us something 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.800
 need to rush to buy in straight things 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.759
 you didn't plan this rule 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.880
 number four 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.120
 Evaluate the entire range first. 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.130
 store sometimes things with sales excellent 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.950
 combined with things from the new 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.230
 collections and it turns out trendy 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.050
 fairly fresh oddly enough 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.390
 combinations also in the department store wanted 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.970
 pcie is a separate corner and separate 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.769
 zones where represented 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.300
 previous autumn-winter collections and 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.850
 many different clothes 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.550
 maybe these clothes are also sports 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.650
 combined with clothes from 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.290
 spring-summer season well, and the last 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.180
 rule come to the department store come 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.610
 on sale 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.340
 with a certain budget for purchases and 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.100
 if you put aside this budget 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.579
 It is this amount on the purchase that is not in any way 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.220
 case do not go beyond because 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.230
 desire and opportunity rather even 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.480
 desires to go beyond you will 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.340
 always and as soon as you will go out 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.920
 for your budget 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.230
 so immediately you will make a mistake and 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.250
 it must be a signal to you 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.480
 tom you do wrong 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.630

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.750
 wardrobe and find some bright 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.180
 accents that would be combined with your 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.969
 the rest of the wardrobe 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.319
