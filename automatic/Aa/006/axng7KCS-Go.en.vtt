00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
lipstick out there so I do recommend

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.160 
lipstick out there so I do recommend
exfoliating<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.760> conditioning<00:03:44.390> your<00:03:44.900> lips

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
exfoliating and conditioning your lips

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.009 
exfoliating and conditioning your lips
but<00:03:45.859> once<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.370> do<00:03:46.609> this<00:03:46.970> just<00:03:47.510> applies<00:03:47.989> on

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
but once you do this just applies on

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.490 
but once you do this just applies on
smoothly<00:03:48.769> and<00:03:49.220> just<00:03:49.549> looks<00:03:49.810> amazing<00:03:50.810> another

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
smoothly and just looks amazing another

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.680

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.270 
and it is their colored gold lipstick I
think<00:03:57.739> that's<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:59.450> name<00:03:59.480> of<00:03:59.690> this<00:04:00.230> line<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:01.190> i

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
think that's the name of this line and i

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.610 
think that's the name of this line and i
believe<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.670> color<00:04:01.880> i<00:04:02.030> got<00:04:02.359> was<00:04:02.660> in<00:04:02.900> burgundy

believe the color i got was in burgundy

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.430 
believe the color i got was in burgundy
pink<00:04:04.329> something<00:04:05.329> like<00:04:05.450> that<00:04:05.660> but<00:04:06.170> this<00:04:06.380> was

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440
