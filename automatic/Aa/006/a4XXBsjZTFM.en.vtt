section<00:02:57.790> which<00:02:58.030> i<00:02:58.210> think<00:02:58.270> is<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.810> most

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
section which i think is the most

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.170 
section which i think is the most
important<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.920> audio<00:03:00.340> quality<00:03:00.370> now<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
important is the audio quality now the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.350 
important is the audio quality now the
HD<00:03:04.180> 439<00:03:04.870> audio<00:03:05.440> quality<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:06.160> quite<00:03:07.030> average

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
HD 439 audio quality is quite average

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.060 
HD 439 audio quality is quite average
the<00:03:08.080> mids<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:08.650> highs<00:03:08.740> are<00:03:09.280> great<00:03:10.650> sorry<00:03:11.650> the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
the mids and highs are great sorry the

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.480 
the mids and highs are great sorry the
base<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:12.790> great<00:03:13.360> but<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.440> mids<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.800> highs<00:03:14.890> are

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
base is great but the mids and highs are

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.440 
base is great but the mids and highs are
a<00:03:16.740> respectable<00:03:17.740> standard<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.430> it's<00:03:18.850> good<00:03:19.180> I

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
a respectable standard so it's good I

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.520 
a respectable standard so it's good I
guess<00:03:20.910> but<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.060> base<00:03:22.240> is<00:03:22.270> quite<00:03:22.720> extended<00:03:23.350> and

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
guess but the base is quite extended and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.600 
guess but the base is quite extended and
it's<00:03:23.920> too<00:03:24.130> tight<00:03:24.490> controlled<00:03:25.270> and<00:03:25.540> defined<00:03:26.610> so

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
it's too tight controlled and defined so

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.820 
it's too tight controlled and defined so
it's<00:03:27.820> really<00:03:28.060> great<00:03:28.360> basis<00:03:28.840> does<00:03:29.020> not<00:03:29.290> do<00:03:29.620> me

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
it's really great basis does not do me

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.520 
it's really great basis does not do me
so<00:03:30.070> it<00:03:31.000> would<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:31.420> vibrate<00:03:32.020> against<00:03:32.320> your

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
so it would like vibrate against your

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.210 
so it would like vibrate against your
ears<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:33.330> tickle<00:03:34.330> them<00:03:34.510> like<00:03:35.200> some<00:03:35.830> of<00:03:35.950> skull

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
ears and tickle them like some of skull

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.000

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
it's worth it but I guess you're paying

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.999 
it's worth it but I guess you're paying
for<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.610> great<00:04:33.909> design<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.599> the<00:04:34.680> great<00:04:35.680> build

for the great design and the great build
quality<00:04:36.099> and<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.969> guess<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.449> great<00:04:37.780> base<00:04:38.050> but

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:38.439 
quality and I guess the great base but

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:41.640 
quality and I guess the great base but
mids<00:04:39.129> and<00:04:39.250> highs<00:04:39.340> are<00:04:39.849> respectable<00:04:40.479> and<00:04:40.870> the

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
mids and highs are respectable and the

hundred<00:04:41.860> dollar<00:04:42.159> price<00:04:42.520> tag<00:04:42.849> isn't<00:04:43.240> great<00:04:43.810> but

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
hundred dollar price tag isn't great but

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:48.719
