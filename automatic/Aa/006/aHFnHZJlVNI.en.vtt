00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
struggled just a little bit in fact you

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.770

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.980 
can prepare differently you know I think
that<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.030> way<00:02:06.180> I'll<00:02:06.330> handle<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.720> is<00:02:06.869> all

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
that the way I'll handle it is all

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.960 
that the way I'll handle it is all
prepared<00:02:07.440> similarly<00:02:07.799> up<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:08.610> know<00:02:08.729> watch

you<00:03:43.380> up

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.300 

I'm<00:03:49.380> not<00:03:49.620> just<00:03:49.830> are<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.040> guys<00:03:50.220> in<00:03:50.460> that<00:03:52.280> well<00:03:53.280> I

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
I'm not just are you guys in that well I

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.010 
I'm not just are you guys in that well I
think<00:03:53.400> that's<00:03:53.820> that's<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.300> big<00:03:54.480> thing<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.810> think

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
think that's that's a big thing I think

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.750 
think that's that's a big thing I think
that's<00:03:55.560> one<00:03:55.770> of<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:56.040> problems<00:03:56.160> I've<00:03:56.520> had<00:03:56.550> in

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
that's one of the problems I've had in

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.030 
that's one of the problems I've had in
the<00:03:56.820> last<00:03:56.940> couple<00:03:57.150> weeks<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.720> think<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:58.110> you

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
the last couple weeks I think that you

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.500 
the last couple weeks I think that you
know<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.640> really<00:03:59.940> looking<00:04:00.300> in<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.480> mirror

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
know and really looking in the mirror

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.510 
know and really looking in the mirror
and<00:04:00.900> himself<00:04:01.290> doing<00:04:01.500> some<00:04:01.680> self<00:04:01.890> evaluations

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
and himself doing some self evaluations

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.030 
and himself doing some self evaluations
soul-searching<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.300> think<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:03.860> I've<00:04:04.860> been

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
soul-searching I think that I've been

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.460 
soul-searching I think that I've been
playing<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:05.550> hard<00:04:05.700> not<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:05.940> make<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.150> mistake

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
playing so hard not to make a mistake

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.990 
playing so hard not to make a mistake
and<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:08.160> hasn't<00:04:08.430> really<00:04:08.520> been<00:04:08.700> allowing

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
and it hasn't really been allowing

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.850 
and it hasn't really been allowing
myself<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.810> enjoy<00:04:09.960> the<00:04:10.230> game<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.590> have<00:04:10.680> fun

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
myself to enjoy the game and have fun

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.420 
myself to enjoy the game and have fun
with<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.130> game<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:13.560> know<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.890> playing

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
with the game so you know the playing

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.770 
with the game so you know the playing
not<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.670> lose<00:04:14.850> is<00:04:15.240> something<00:04:15.510> that<00:04:15.600> can

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
not to lose is something that can

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.970 
not to lose is something that can
absolutely<00:04:15.990> kill<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.650> think<00:04:16.830> that's

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
absolutely kill you and I think that's

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.170 
absolutely kill you and I think that's
something<00:04:17.130> that's<00:04:17.340> allowed<00:04:17.700> me<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:18.030> be<00:04:18.150> a

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
something that's allowed me to be a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.699 
something that's allowed me to be a
little<00:04:18.420> bit<00:04:18.570> unsuccessful<00:04:19.230> last<00:04:19.440> couple

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
little bit unsuccessful last couple

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.080 
little bit unsuccessful last couple
weeks<00:04:19.860> because<00:04:20.100> I'm<00:04:20.250> trying<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:20.700> hard<00:04:20.730> not<00:04:20.970> to

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
weeks because I'm trying so hard not to

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.390 
weeks because I'm trying so hard not to
screw<00:04:21.390> up<00:04:21.540> that<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:22.650> know<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:22.830> often<00:04:23.220> lose
