and then slide I just bring the whole
thing<00:03:51.569> around<00:03:51.690> until<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:52.920> actually

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
thing around until you like actually

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.449 
thing around until you like actually
easier<00:03:53.819> moving<00:03:54.980> so<00:03:55.980> don't<00:03:56.220> get<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.370> wrong

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
easier moving so don't get the wrong

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.990 
easier moving so don't get the wrong
idea<00:03:56.609> by<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.510> fact<00:03:57.720> i'm<00:03:57.870> doing<00:03:58.139> stationers

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
idea by the fact i'm doing stationers

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.879 
idea by the fact i'm doing stationers
this<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.150> what<00:04:00.269> that<00:04:00.389> looks<00:04:00.630> like<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:04.650> said

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
this is what that looks like I said

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.280 
this is what that looks like I said
we're<00:04:05.069> easier<00:04:05.430> laughing<00:04:06.090> because<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:07.049> get

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
we're easier laughing because you get

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.830 
we're easier laughing because you get
better<00:04:07.500> scoop<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:12.269> also<00:04:12.389> better<00:04:12.660> when

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
better scoop and it's also better when

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.930 
better scoop and it's also better when
you<00:04:12.900> have

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.270 

so<00:04:16.780> this<00:04:17.230> is<00:04:17.410> what<00:04:17.530> that<00:04:17.650> looks<00:04:17.830> like<00:04:17.890> one<00:04:18.160> more

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
so this is what that looks like one more

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.950 
so this is what that looks like one more
time<00:04:21.090> those<00:04:22.090> are<00:04:22.240> all<00:04:22.330> really<00:04:22.360> bad<00:04:22.750> ones

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
time those are all really bad ones

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.330 
time those are all really bad ones
because<00:04:23.170> I<00:04:23.230> don't<00:04:23.470> actually<00:04:23.680> have<00:04:23.980> any<00:04:24.130> room

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
because I don't actually have any room

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.250 
because I don't actually have any room
down<00:04:24.520> here<00:04:26.550> Devin<00:04:27.550> driveway<00:04:28.480> moving<00:04:28.930> slowly

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
down here Devin driveway moving slowly

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.030 
down here Devin driveway moving slowly
across<00:04:29.470> I<00:04:29.980> don't<00:04:30.850> get<00:04:31.410> now<00:04:32.410> what<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.590> backside

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
across I don't get now what a backside

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.060 
across I don't get now what a backside
Ollie<00:04:33.570> is<00:04:34.570> just<00:04:35.470> turning<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.860> other<00:04:35.920> way

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
Ollie is just turning the other way
