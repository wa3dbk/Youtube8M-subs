00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.240
 this sales success really 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.350
 is justified and what it is 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.180
 that have looked at us nissan 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.790
 realized very early that the segment 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.780
 the compact suvs one day very much 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.370
 will sell well 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.710
 one has laced a package 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.129
 compact car with space for the family 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.090
 great trunk chic design 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.309
 all-wheel drive on request of the typical 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.960
 higher suv suspension a bit 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.789
 more ground girlfriend chic look all 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.129
 that together then you have one 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.929
 European development team so people 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.179
 from nissan europe have the car in 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.280
 england developed and there in england 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:07.360
 rebuilt and meanwhile over 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.360
 two million times 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.100
 In 1999 I was the first time on the tokyo 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.979
 motor show and what's the strongest for me there 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.560
 Reminiscent of the grave speech 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.990
 by nissan nissan was broke was from 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.670
 Renault has been taken over and it was 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.390
 clearly quite a lot of cuts 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.250
 follow hard cuts and one of the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.899
 Dots was the design that had 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.270
 nissan somehow no importance 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.210
 had and you have realized that had to 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.780
 that must be important to us 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.060
 become 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.679
 That's what you've just done that sees 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.520
 one also in the interior for example 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.959
 that is very solid but also 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.369
 restrained that is not anyone 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.270
 is not somehow or anything 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.520
 knickknack tuned 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.950
 It is very clean through styled 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.840
 and they are also found to immediately 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.319
 computing is simply a clean one 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.319
 fittings 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.640
 a reason why the nissan qashqai like that 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.730
 it is successful every year 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.030
 cheaper price it gives him off namely 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.880
 19,990 euros under 20,000 euros for one 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.680
 suv for a very popular model 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.320
 and how do you get there by going to 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.790
 for example, a version without four-wheel drive 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.990
 offers it also gives it with and 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.060
 then these cars can be incredible 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.160
 things terrain up and down as 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.980
 one dreams of it but it does not need 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.570
 human beings 90 percent 95 percent of the people 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.740
 never drive into the terrain 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.090
 they do not need four-wheel drive 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.090
 saves money 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.730
 another reason of the qashqai 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.530
 cheap market is the low selection of 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.680
 There are two petrol engines and motorization 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.700
 two diesel and that saves of course 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.100
 development costs once for the engine 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.660
 itself and on the other hand the engine to the 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.490
 car to adapt that must in any case 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.660
 always be made so if only 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.700
 offer four engines 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.990
 then I just need me too 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.370
 also save costs 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.970
 I'll give it to you kindly 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.700
 the customer continues this is 130 ps 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.930
 this is the big one already at others 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.940
 had 110 ps 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.920
 but I think that's enough when driving 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.750
 completely out if you are not permanently with 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.520
 200 on the left lane on the highway 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.820
 you do not want to drive then either 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.820
 more 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.510
 there is one thing that bothers me 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.100
 when nissan qashqai that bothers me 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.680
 but also with some others 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.050
 cars are the buttons 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.620
 here and lower left and fittings since 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:53.870
 attached there are functions such as for 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.790
 the parking aid for the psp and for the 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.640
 all-wheel drive, for example, but also 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.930
 for the trail holding assistant 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.390
 that are not necessarily snapped the 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.980
 You need it every day but down there 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.030
 they are hardly recognized and illuminated 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.220
 they are not really 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.300
 and you really can not do anything with it 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.769
 start this so carelessly 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.650
 slapped hands clapped 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.850
 this is really stupid because you have to 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.850
 to come up with something else 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.500
 Honestly cars are expensive and so 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.360
 trendy models as well as all times it 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.160
 is completely natural that you look after 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.620
 cheap alternatives looked at 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.520
 the qashqai up to a cheap one 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.740
 alternative 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.570
 he looks good and offers plenty of room for 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.700
 the family and goes well on me 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.700
 have found no weakness in the car
