00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
hi everybody and welcome to this

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.420 
hi everybody and welcome to this
walkthrough<00:00:03.449> video<00:00:03.810> about<00:00:04.410> controls<00:00:05.130> and

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
walkthrough video about controls and

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.480 
walkthrough video about controls and
game<00:00:05.910> mechanics<00:00:06.049> I'm<00:00:07.049> Julian<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:07.980> I'm<00:00:08.220> going

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
game mechanics I'm Julian and I'm going

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.060 
game mechanics I'm Julian and I'm going
to<00:00:08.639> show<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:08.940> how<00:00:09.210> son<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.050> nor<00:00:10.290> works<00:00:10.679> in

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
to show you how son of nor works in

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.660 
to show you how son of nor works in
detail<00:00:11.870> so<00:00:12.870> let's<00:00:13.380> take<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.830> look<00:00:14.130> at<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.370> rock

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
detail so let's take a look at this rock

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.210 
detail so let's take a look at this rock
here<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.660> as<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.870> know<00:00:16.080> telekinesis<00:00:16.920> can<00:00:17.100> be

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
here and as you know telekinesis can be

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.090 
here and as you know telekinesis can be
used<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.670> pick<00:00:18.029> stuff<00:00:18.330> up<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.869> then<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.890> can

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
used to pick stuff up and then you can

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.340 
used to pick stuff up and then you can
move<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.460> around<00:00:20.550> but<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> mass<00:00:21.689> determines

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
move it around but the mass determines

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.800 
move it around but the mass determines
how<00:00:22.710> fast<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.400> can<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.880> No<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.600> if<00:00:24.689> you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
how fast you can do that No so if you

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.080 
how fast you can do that No so if you
throw<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.320> object<00:00:25.740> its<00:00:26.189> strong<00:00:26.490> depends<00:00:27.000> on

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
throw the object its strong depends on

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.050 
throw the object its strong depends on
it<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.630> heavy<00:00:28.230> objects<00:00:28.859> won't<00:00:29.099> fly<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.760> far

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
it so heavy objects won't fly that far

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.229 
it so heavy objects won't fly that far
as<00:00:30.300> small<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.869> light<00:00:31.050> ones<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:32.340> if<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.880> take

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
as small and light ones so if you take

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.299 
as small and light ones so if you take
for<00:00:33.510> instance<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.110> smaller<00:00:34.469> rock<00:00:34.739> over<00:00:35.100> here

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
for instance the smaller rock over here

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.729 
for instance the smaller rock over here
which<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.640> about<00:00:35.940> medium<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.630> weight<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.590> can

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
which is about medium in weight you can

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.340 
which is about medium in weight you can
move<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.070> around<00:00:38.160> much<00:00:38.670> faster<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.390> also<00:00:40.260> if

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
move it around much faster and also if

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.260 
move it around much faster and also if
you<00:00:40.590> throw<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.280> will<00:00:41.520> gain<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> lot<00:00:42.030> more

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you throw it it will gain a lot more

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.080 
you throw it it will gain a lot more
speed<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.890> course<00:00:43.920> has<00:00:44.550> an<00:00:44.700> impact

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
speed and that of course has an impact

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.080 
speed and that of course has an impact
on<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.539> damage<00:00:45.750> deals<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:47.250> for<00:00:47.460> instance<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
on the damage deals so for instance a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.319 
on the damage deals so for instance a
very<00:00:48.690> fast<00:00:49.110> small<00:00:49.680> rock<00:00:49.980> will<00:00:50.789> do<00:00:51.000> less<00:00:51.300> damage

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
very fast small rock will do less damage

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.319 
very fast small rock will do less damage
than<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.379> big<00:00:52.680> rock<00:00:53.160> which<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.520> very<00:00:53.969> fast

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
than a big rock which is very fast

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.319 
than a big rock which is very fast
already<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> best<00:00:56.100> thing<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.789> do<00:00:57.030> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
already so the best thing you can do is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.959 
already so the best thing you can do is
basically<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> super<00:00:59.010> huge<00:00:59.250> rock<00:00:59.640> which

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
basically have a super huge rock which

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.250 
basically have a super huge rock which
is<00:01:00.000> super<00:01:00.660> fast<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:02.359> course<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.719> also<00:01:03.899> let

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
is super fast of course you can also let

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.070 
is super fast of course you can also let
objects<00:01:04.860> levitate<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.760> air<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.869> that

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
objects levitate in the air for that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.899 
objects levitate in the air for that
instead<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.680> hitting<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.400> right<00:01:08.640> mouse

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
instead of hitting the right mouse

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.420 
instead of hitting the right mouse
button<00:01:09.360> once<00:01:09.720> which<00:01:10.650> would<00:01:10.799> actually<00:01:11.250> drop

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
button once which would actually drop

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.990 
button once which would actually drop
the<00:01:11.729> object<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:13.320> double<00:01:13.890> hit<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> then

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the object you just double hit it then

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.609 
the object you just double hit it then
it<00:01:15.119> stays<00:01:15.360> firmly<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> air<00:01:16.259> without

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
it stays firmly in the air without

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.490 
it stays firmly in the air without
rotating<00:01:17.159> around<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.509> step<00:01:19.020> safely

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
rotating around so you can step safely

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.820 
rotating around so you can step safely
onto<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:21.170> course<00:01:22.170> your<00:01:22.350> telekinetic

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
onto it of course your telekinetic

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.880 
onto it of course your telekinetic
abilities<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> limited<00:01:24.390> range<00:01:24.890> for

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
abilities have a limited range for

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.410 
abilities have a limited range for
instance<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.369> cannot<00:01:26.700> pick<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.150> an<00:01:27.299> object

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
instance you cannot pick up an object

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.350 
instance you cannot pick up an object
which<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:27.900> too<00:01:28.350> far<00:01:28.650> away<00:01:28.799> or<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.790> instance<00:01:30.180> if

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
which is too far away or for instance if

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.359 
which is too far away or for instance if
you<00:01:30.509> let<00:01:30.689> something<00:01:30.960> levitate<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.799> place<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
you let something levitate in place and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.510 
you let something levitate in place and
then<00:01:32.670> move<00:01:32.909> out<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.180> its<00:01:33.570> range<00:01:34.070> it<00:01:35.070> will<00:01:35.280> fall

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
then move out of its range it will fall

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.600 
then move out of its range it will fall
down<00:01:35.729> again<00:01:36.500> this<00:01:37.500> allows<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.250> instance

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
down again this allows you for instance

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.830 
down again this allows you for instance
to<00:01:38.880> create<00:01:39.210> some<00:01:39.450> pretty<00:01:39.780> neat<00:01:40.049> traps

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
to create some pretty neat traps

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.249 
to create some pretty neat traps
just<00:01:42.530> move<00:01:42.829> almost<00:01:43.250> out<00:01:44.030> of<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.600> range<00:01:44.869> and

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
just move almost out of the range and

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.630 
just move almost out of the range and
then<00:01:46.159> wait<00:01:46.850> for<00:01:47.179> it<00:01:47.299> wait<00:01:47.539> for<00:01:48.049> it<00:01:48.289> is<00:01:49.009> just<00:01:49.429> a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
then wait for it wait for it is just a

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.380 
then wait for it wait for it is just a
little<00:01:50.060> bit<00:01:50.390> further<00:01:50.840> of<00:01:51.880> course<00:01:52.880> this<00:01:53.090> works

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
little bit further of course this works

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.219 
little bit further of course this works
also<00:01:53.869> for<00:01:54.109> carrots<00:01:55.299> but<00:01:56.299> there<00:01:56.539> are<00:01:56.600> even<00:01:56.899> more

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
also for carrots but there are even more

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.199 
also for carrots but there are even more
cool<00:01:57.590> things<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:57.979> can<00:01:58.039> do<00:01:58.310> with<00:01:58.429> telekinesis

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
cool things you can do with telekinesis

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.480 
cool things you can do with telekinesis
for<00:01:59.929> instance<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.439> can<00:02:00.649> right-click<00:02:00.979> for<00:02:01.280> a

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
for instance you can right-click for a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.309 
for instance you can right-click for a
long<00:02:01.700> time<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.030> shoot<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.479> object<00:02:02.959> straight

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
long time to shoot the object straight

on it and then you have three charges of

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.840 
on it and then you have three charges of
it<00:03:08.360> at<00:03:08.570> your<00:03:08.900> disposal<00:03:09.290> which<00:03:10.160> means<00:03:10.459> you<00:03:10.640> can

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
it at your disposal which means you can
