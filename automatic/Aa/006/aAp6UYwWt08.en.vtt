00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 I would like to be in the interval between backlighting about the allegations 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.589
 Compared to the fact that Japanese animation is very popular in the United States 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.420
 Both expand to 37 How Japanese anime pulls 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.969
 It's a bit unusual to start up, so I can start fighting 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.499

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.499
 Toll free 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.279
 What the hell are you doing 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.649
 And it was held in Chicago, USA 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.649

 By the way, when Japanese animation becomes a rice version, it has changed a little 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.240
 But is it true? 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.470
 It's also important to be with the first children of this improvement zone 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.040
 I got a look at the original Japanese animation version 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.310
 is there. 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.390

 Something is a little different 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.350
 So in New York, we are actually making US valu animation 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.350

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.820
 Here we broadcast Japanese anime Yu-Gi-Oh in the US 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.189

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.829

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.829

 I can not speak Japanese and English in the same language 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.780
 English so that you do not feel uncomfortable with the movement of the Japanese mouth 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:51.779
 It means that you are thinking about words 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.369
 End 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:01.099

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.229
 Aim for Japanese animation between US and America 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.229

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.240
