00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
up this is all using the merge glitch

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.510 
up this is all using the merge glitch
and<00:01:59.369> DLC<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.210> stuff<00:02:00.710> it's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> mine<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.280> kind

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
and DLC and stuff it's a mine it's kind

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.800 
and DLC and stuff it's a mine it's kind
of<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.880> concept<00:02:03.270> park<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.689> not

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
of just like a concept park it's not

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.270 
of just like a concept park it's not
really<00:02:03.990> doesn't<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:04.860> have<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.130> much

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280

some<00:02:40.830> like<00:02:40.980> ghetto<00:02:41.220> kind<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.640> realistic<00:02:41.940> lines

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
some like ghetto kind of realistic lines

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.050 
some like ghetto kind of realistic lines
going<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.960> how<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.470> did<00:02:43.710> it<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.040> use<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.550> Zen

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
going and how I did it is I use the Zen

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.180 
going and how I did it is I use the Zen
rocks<00:02:45.360> go<00:02:46.080> all<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.530> way<00:02:46.560> through<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.100> then

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
rocks go all the way through and then

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.010 
rocks go all the way through and then
the<00:02:47.340> crystals<00:02:47.790> actually<00:02:48.210> use<00:02:48.300> n<00:02:48.600> our<00:02:48.750> choice

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
the crystals actually use n our choice

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.960 
the crystals actually use n our choice
which<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.350> covered<00:02:49.680> colored<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.790> merge

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
which I covered colored and the merge

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.660 
which I covered colored and the merge
glitch<00:02:51.270> allows<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.080> combine<00:02:52.830> any<00:02:53.280> objects

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670

together without having to worry about

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.900 
together without having to worry about
the<00:02:55.020> red<00:02:55.200> thing<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.070> was<00:02:56.430> able<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.700> combine

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
the red thing so I was able to combine

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.970 
the red thing so I was able to combine
all<00:02:57.210> those<00:02:57.300> archways<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.500> walls<00:02:58.740> and

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
stuff all together it without having to

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.960 
stuff all together it without having to
worry<00:03:01.410> about<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.680> really<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.280> took<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.760> lot<00:03:02.910> of

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
worry about it really it took a lot of

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.250

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
that I put in and it just it took a

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.840 
that I put in and it just it took a
while<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.260> make<00:03:59.120> took<00:04:00.120> about<00:04:00.320> five<00:04:01.320> hours<00:04:01.850> six

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850

five<00:04:03.090> hours<00:04:03.390> something<00:04:03.540> like<00:04:03.630> that<00:04:04.160> which<00:04:05.160> is

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
five hours something like that which is

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.120 
five hours something like that which is
actually<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.640> think<00:04:05.730> kind<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.090> quick<00:04:06.270> for<00:04:06.480> me<00:04:06.570> I

favorite<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.479> best<00:04:23.509> part<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:24.229> mean<00:04:24.710> not

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
favorite and best part I mean not

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.110 
favorite and best part I mean not
because<00:04:24.889> it<00:04:25.189> really<00:04:25.520> has<00:04:25.639> a<00:04:25.669> lot<00:04:25.819> of<00:04:25.849> stuff<00:04:26.060> to

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
because it really has a lot of stuff to

because it really has a lot of stuff to
sleep<00:04:26.330> just<00:04:26.449> because<00:04:26.840> it's<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.139> freakin<00:04:27.499> cool

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:29.469 
sleep just because it's so freakin cool

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:33.249 
sleep just because it's so freakin cool
and<00:04:30.469> it's<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.740> mine<00:04:30.979> I<00:04:31.479> that<00:04:32.479> I<00:04:32.749> got<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.229> idea

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
and it's a mine I that I got the idea

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.140 
and it's a mine I that I got the idea
from<00:04:33.680> another<00:04:34.099> part<00:04:34.310> that<00:04:34.340> I<00:04:34.550> saw<00:04:34.759> that<00:04:34.999> was<00:04:35.120> a

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
from another part that I saw that was a

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.700 
from another part that I saw that was a
mine<00:04:35.419> but<00:04:35.900> I<00:04:35.930> think<00:04:36.110> I<00:04:36.169> actually<00:04:36.229> did<00:04:36.499> better

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
mine but I think I actually did better

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:39.469 
than the original I mean mine looks more

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:41.679 
than the original I mean mine looks more
like<00:04:39.889> we<00:04:40.099> did<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.879> other<00:04:40.999> one<00:04:41.150> was<00:04:41.300> pretty<00:04:41.509> and
