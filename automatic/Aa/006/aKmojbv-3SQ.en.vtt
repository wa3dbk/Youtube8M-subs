reading<00:00:05.400> around<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:06.089> it<00:00:06.240> seems<00:00:06.569> that<00:00:07.910> mall

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
reading around and it seems that mall

walking<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.480> back<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:09.960> game<00:00:10.940> what<00:00:11.940> was<00:00:12.120> at

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
walking is back in the game what was at

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.919 
walking is back in the game what was at
one<00:00:12.450> point<00:00:12.719> nine<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:13.650> finally<00:00:13.950> got<00:00:14.190> disabled

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
one point nine it finally got disabled

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.260 
one point nine it finally got disabled
don't<00:00:15.929> fish<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.070> Nagas<00:00:17.250> holics<00:00:17.699> decided

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
don't fish and the Nagas holics decided

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.080 
don't fish and the Nagas holics decided
go<00:00:18.890> do<00:00:19.890> their<00:00:20.070> last<00:00:20.310> wall<00:00:20.580> walk<00:00:21.590> but<00:00:23.090> seems

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
go do their last wall walk but seems

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.519 
go do their last wall walk but seems
that<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.570> back<00:00:24.810> now<00:00:26.930> sort<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.050> walk<00:00:28.320> and

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
that it is back now sort of walk and

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.680 
that it is back now sort of walk and
I'll<00:00:28.650> get<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.039> going<00:00:29.340> here

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.819 

oh<00:00:35.640> come<00:00:36.640> on<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:38.649> we<00:00:38.860> go<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:40.600> seems<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.379> be<00:00:41.500> a

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
oh come on there we go but seems to be a

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:48.050 
oh come on there we go but seems to be a
little<00:00:42.129> bit<00:00:42.280> easier

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:55.250 

while<00:00:49.060> walking

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.689 

it's<00:00:55.980> much<00:00:56.160> easier<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:57.890> before<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.339> weren't

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it's much easier to before you weren't

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.080 
it's much easier to before you weren't
able<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.680> hit<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> wall<00:01:03.350> but<00:01:04.640> now<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> can

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
able to hit the wall but now you can

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.260 
able to hit the wall but now you can
which<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.570> kind<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.750> nice<00:01:09.770> um<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:11.580> walk<00:01:12.030> along

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
which is kind of nice um just walk along

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.770 
which is kind of nice um just walk along
the<00:01:12.570> wall<00:01:13.009> perpendicular<00:01:14.009> pretty<00:01:14.310> much<00:01:14.780> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the wall perpendicular pretty much and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.450 
the wall perpendicular pretty much and
then<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.470> move<00:01:16.680> your<00:01:16.890> use<00:01:17.280> your

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
then you can just move your use your

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.090 
then you can just move your use your
mouse<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:18.200> push<00:01:19.200> forward<00:01:19.440> you<00:01:19.619> hold<00:01:19.770> down<00:01:19.890> both

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
mouse to push forward you hold down both

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.980 
mouse to push forward you hold down both
keys<00:01:20.399> and<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:22.740> can<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.940> walk<00:01:24.149> and<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
keys and you can just just walk and you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:35.330 
keys and you can just just walk and you
can<00:01:25.140> run<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:32.210> I'm<00:01:33.210> running<00:01:33.690> around<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.350> mountain

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
can run to I'm running around a mountain

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.859 
can run to I'm running around a mountain
right<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:42.090> go<00:01:42.210> up<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.630> kind<00:01:42.750> of

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
right now you have to go up you kind of

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.469 
right now you have to go up you kind of
have<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.020> look<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:43.770> areas<00:01:44.039> that<00:01:44.190> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.670> move

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
have to look for areas that you can move

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.779 
have to look for areas that you can move
up<00:01:45.690> there's<00:01:46.679> not<00:01:46.860> very<00:01:46.890> many<00:01:47.190> areas<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.670> I

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
up there's not very many areas like I

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:55.340 
up there's not very many areas like I
end<00:01:48.000> up<00:01:48.060> losing<00:01:48.450> ground<00:01:48.600> there

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.590 

you<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.130> start<00:01:56.640> walking<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
you have to start walking on to the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.359 
you have to start walking on to the
ground<00:01:57.840> perpendicular<00:01:58.530> or<00:01:59.040> onto<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
ground perpendicular or onto the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:10.600 
ground perpendicular or onto the
mountain<00:01:59.610> perpendicular

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.600 

they<00:02:11.570> disabled<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.320> while<00:02:12.590> back<00:02:12.620> then<00:02:13.430> they

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
they disabled it a while back then they

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.010 
they disabled it a while back then they
just<00:02:13.910> put<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.120> back<00:02:14.270> in<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.570> game<00:02:14.690> when<00:02:14.900> they

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
just put it back in the game when they

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.690 
just put it back in the game when they
just<00:02:15.350> when<00:02:15.620> they<00:02:15.740> disabled<00:02:16.490> ball<00:02:16.640> jumping

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
just when they disabled ball jumping

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.650 
just when they disabled ball jumping
pretty<00:02:19.700> much<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:20.000> can't<00:02:20.210> do<00:02:20.330> one<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.570> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
pretty much you can't do one of the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.070 
pretty much you can't do one of the
other<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.990> seems<00:02:21.200> with<00:02:21.470> their<00:02:21.620> physics<00:02:21.980> engine

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
other it seems with their physics engine

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.630 
other it seems with their physics engine
for<00:02:24.080> whatever<00:02:24.470> physics<00:02:24.920> engine<00:02:25.220> they<00:02:25.340> have

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.140 

but<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:28.760> cool<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.390> can<00:02:29.540> do<00:02:29.660> loops

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.650 

I<00:02:36.239> have<00:02:36.930> before<00:02:38.239> see<00:02:39.239> I'm<00:02:39.510> just<00:02:39.569> like<00:02:39.900> run<00:02:40.530> in
