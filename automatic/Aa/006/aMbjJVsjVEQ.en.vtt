00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.750
 well, we have moved to 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.310
 here to the samsung stand for 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.410
 show you a compact terminal a 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.240
 Simple terminal as is the samsung 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.490
 galaxy fame that you will surely find 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.630
 interesting many of you 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.490
 Well, as not everything could be 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.570
 high-end and high-end terminals 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.689
 we are in front of a terminal 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.119
 quite affordable simple and compact 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.189
 I would say the samsung galaxy fein a 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.710
 terminal with a 3.5 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.960
 inches what times those in which 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.570
 top end terminals had this 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.250
 screen size this terminal as 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.930
 you see is quite pretty compact has 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.129
 the usual design that we usually 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.840
 find with the devices 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.520
 samsung the truth is that it seems that the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.950
 have cloned everyone from 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.989
 Samsung Galaxy S3 and retains the lines 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.969
 teachers of brand design 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.320
 Korean as you see in the front 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.739
 we are together with the serigraphy 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.589
 of the brand on a speaker in the part 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.659
 front we have the different sensors and 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.399
 the front camera also in the part 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.679
 bottom we have three buttons two of 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.229
 them tactile and one physical one of the 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:08.230
 signs of differentiation that uses 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.940
 always the samsung on your devices 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.160
 the truth that is not a subject either 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.870
 too thin terminal surely 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.370
 because its screen size as 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.920
 increases the thickness a little so that 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.990
 fit with the components that form it 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.970
 in the back we find ourselves 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.400
 a camera from which later on 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.980
 we will talk together with flash led and other of 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.620
 the speakers if we see the laterals 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.040
 few novelties raise and lower volume 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.020
 connector for micro usb for charging 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.700
 unlocking the screen and in the part 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.700
 top we have the 3 jack 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.650
 in the specifications section as 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.510
 can you imagine we will not find anything 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.090
 very remarkable we find 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.650
 previous benefits times for a 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.300
 terminal that the truth is that you can 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.640
 serve for some user will stay 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.830
 short for others the processor that mounts 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.630
 this this plane is a processor of a 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.780
 only one gigahertz nucleus and 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.210
 we remember for example this kind of 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.130
 processors that mounted the first 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.990
 'nexus one' a core hole exerted 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.289
 also the ram memory section 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.989
 we have 512 megabytes has accompanied everything by 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.400
 4 gigas of internal storage as 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.380
 we always say the truth that we are 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.239
 makes a little bit of these 4 gigs 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.030
 although as usual in the signature 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.420
 Korean so we can increase through 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.610
 microsd cards in addition to all of it 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.790
 we have 1300 milliamp battery 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.830
 that we believe will give it autonomy 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.959
 more than enough to a terminal with 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.940
 some specifications of this type 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.440
 It is also important to highlight the 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.480
 Connectivity section something that if we 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.519
 like it a lot despite being a terminal 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.960
 frequent low - end technology 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.520
 nfc bluetooth 4.0 or radio 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.630
 and the truth is that when dealing with a terminal 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.820
 low-end and with specifications 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.750
 something fair for what they see us and for 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.150
 what we have been used to 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.740
 lately the truth is that we had 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.170
 that we could include a version of 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.400
 something old or something that was not 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.300
 very up to date but the truth is that 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.550
 this galaxy pain includes the version 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.380
 Android 4.1.2 a version that already 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.810
 would like to many terminals cameras 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.550
 other signatures or from or from previous 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.470
 editions the truth is that in this 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.510
 aspect surely in the users not 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.280
 You may have no complaints about this 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.540
 terminal in the layer section of 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.950
 personalization the truth is that no 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.020
 let's go into a lot of detail because 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.180
 surely if there is a known layer in 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.230
 the in the world of android this layer is 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.290
 which include the terminals of 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.450
 samsung galaxy s3 no ute ctera etcetera 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.640
 a layer the truth very well implemented 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.050
 that as you can see it runs very well already 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.850
 despite being a terminal that does not have 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.740
 great movies in no 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.090
 moment we have we have any kind of 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.739
 long 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.239
 it is true that today 3.5 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.249
 inches can be considered a size 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.069
 small screen what was once 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:48.900
 usual in frames with android today 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.939
 in days it has been reserved a little bit for 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.290
 the most compact terminals and maybe 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.510
 for terminals in a range of one 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.219
 range a little bit lower in this case 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.280
 as we have said 3.5 screen 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:02.939
 inches ft technology and a 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.799
 resolution of 480 x 320 evidently the 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.599
 resolution is nothing special 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.280
 but the truth is that there is a 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.889
 little to the screen size level 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.530
 with this size the truth is that the 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:17.669
 resolution as it is acceptable we could 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.799
 say all this gives us about 165 pixels 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.900
 per inch that is far from what 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.789
 that we have been seeing in the news of 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.110
 high-end of the mobile world congress 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.720
 I hope that for many 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.490
 users will be more than enough 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.780
 surely the camera will not be one of the 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.850
 most important sections of the 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.070
 potential customers of this samsung 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.270
 galaxy frame however samsung is a 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.920
 brand that usually makes a very good 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.180
 I work in this aspect and the truth is 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.640
 than to find ourselves in front of a range 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.200
 low we have a 5 megapixel camera 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.510
 that sure 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.790
 good that will meet the needs of 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.980
 more than one user in the front 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.350
 we found a vga camera that will be 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.870
 enough to make the typical 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.890
 video calls 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.140
 Well, this has been the Samsung 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.450
 galaxy pain a low-end terminal one 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.340
 bet on the compact world for 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.140
 smaller 3.5-inch terminals 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.670
 and the truth that it can be a terminal 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.990
 quite interesting for a kind of 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.270
 users that does not require large 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.400
 specifications as you have seen the 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.500
 design is very similar to that of all the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.270
 galaxy family and it can be a terminal 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.070
 potential for all those who 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.270
 want to access the android range without 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.090
 shell out a lot of 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.040
 Congratulations information has come to the 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.420
 end of the video so now the truth 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.100
 with exclusivity I hope and philippa are 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.390
 very many for example it occurs to me that 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.190
 I could put you on facebook and see the 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.260
 photos of a favorite that you like you can 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.150
 get up and go get the fridge but 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.340
