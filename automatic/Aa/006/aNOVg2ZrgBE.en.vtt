00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.580 
doing a little battlefield thing they
upgrade<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> engine<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.720> nicely<00:01:34.110> that

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
upgrade the engine that nicely that

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.929 
upgrade the engine that nicely that
would<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.829> awesome<00:01:35.040> especially<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.820> they

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
would be awesome especially if they

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.760 
would be awesome especially if they
implemented<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.630> into<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.140> zombies<00:01:37.590> because

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
implemented it into like zombies because

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.380 
implemented it into like zombies because
multiplayer<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.640> zombies<00:01:38.970> are<00:01:39.090> using<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
multiplayer and zombies are using the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.510 
multiplayer and zombies are using the
same<00:01:39.600> engine<00:01:39.960> now<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.799> we'll<00:01:41.100> see<00:01:41.250> tell<00:01:41.460> me

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
same engine now so we'll see tell me

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.130 
same engine now so we'll see tell me
what<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.759> will<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.299> able<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.600> blow

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
what you think will you be able to blow

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.960 
what you think will you be able to blow
this<00:01:43.320> up<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.579> think<00:01:44.729> I'll<00:01:44.850> make

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
this up that up do you think I'll make

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.960 
this up that up do you think I'll make
the<00:01:45.119> game<00:01:45.570> better<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:46.259> worse<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:46.920> whatever<00:01:47.880> I

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the game better or worse or whatever I

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.320 
the game better or worse or whatever I
think<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.360> would<00:01:48.450> be<00:01:48.540> pretty<00:01:48.689> cool<00:01:48.810> personally

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
think it would be pretty cool personally

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.230 
think it would be pretty cool personally
there's<00:01:51.080> being<00:01:51.320> able<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.680> blow<00:01:52.340> up<00:01:52.400> a<00:01:52.550> wall<00:01:52.760> but

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
there's being able to blow up a wall but

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.030 
there's being able to blow up a wall but
that's<00:01:53.780> kind<00:01:54.050> of<00:01:54.080> always<00:01:54.260> been<00:01:54.560> an<00:01:54.650> element<00:01:55.010> of

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
that's kind of always been an element of

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.950 
that's kind of always been an element of
Todd<00:01:55.280> just<00:01:55.550> knowing<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.150> map<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.600> if<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:56.780> mat

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
Todd just knowing the map and if the mat

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.650 
Todd just knowing the map and if the mat
can<00:01:57.170> change<00:01:57.500> like<00:01:57.800> that<00:01:57.830> I'm<00:01:58.790> not<00:01:58.970> sure<00:01:59.030> I'm

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
can change like that I'm not sure I'm

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.030 
can change like that I'm not sure I'm
going<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.810> think<00:02:00.110> down<00:02:00.260> below<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.800> I'll<00:02:01.010> see

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
going to think down below and I'll see

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.370 
going to think down below and I'll see
you<00:02:01.250> guys<00:02:01.280> later
