00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.210 

it's<00:02:03.890> not

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
it's not

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:16.540 
it's not
this<00:02:05.760> much<00:02:06.120> like<00:02:06.420> babies

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.860 

okay<00:02:17.550> we<00:02:17.670> had<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.910> set<00:02:18.120> up<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.300> drop<00:02:18.569> trap

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
okay we had to set up the drop trap

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.559 
okay we had to set up the drop trap
because<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.410> cats<00:02:19.650> were<00:02:19.860> very<00:02:20.130> shy<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.910> would

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
because the cats were very shy and would

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.020 
because the cats were very shy and would
not<00:02:21.810> walk<00:02:22.050> into<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.590> metal<00:02:22.800> trap<00:02:23.190> that's

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
not walk into the metal trap that's

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.050 
not walk into the metal trap that's
because<00:02:24.390> they've<00:02:24.599> seen<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.989> trap<00:02:25.200> before<00:02:26.060> now

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
because they've seen the trap before now

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.520 
because they've seen the trap before now
we're<00:02:27.270> hoping<00:02:27.569> that<00:02:27.630> they<00:02:27.840> go<00:02:27.959> into<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.290> drop

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
we're hoping that they go into the drop

00:02:28.530 --> 00:03:08.559 
we're hoping that they go into the drop
