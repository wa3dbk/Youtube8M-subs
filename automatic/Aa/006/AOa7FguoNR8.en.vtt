up to some people these parts here just

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.089

lightly<00:00:29.180> oiled<00:00:29.599> yeah<00:00:29.869> yes

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099

the<00:00:31.340> disadvantage<00:00:31.970> on<00:00:32.090> this<00:00:32.210> engine<00:00:32.480> is<00:00:32.630> these

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
the disadvantage on this engine is these

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.350 
the disadvantage on this engine is these
parts<00:00:33.170> here<00:00:33.350> are<00:00:33.380> exposed<00:00:34.010> mm-hmm<00:00:34.790> on<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.090> LX

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
parts here are exposed mm-hmm on the LX

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.740 
parts here are exposed mm-hmm on the LX
engines<00:00:35.719> they're<00:00:36.079> in<00:00:36.200> Keast<00:00:36.500> yes<00:00:37.239> but<00:00:38.239> this

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
engines they're in Keast yes but this

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.209 
engines they're in Keast yes but this
has<00:00:38.930> an<00:00:39.050> advantage<00:00:39.320> because<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:39.710> can<00:00:39.890> control

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
has an advantage because you can control

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.750 
has an advantage because you can control
the<00:00:40.370> throttle<00:00:40.550> in<00:00:40.910> years<00:00:41.120> well<00:00:41.649> a<00:00:42.670> little<00:00:43.670> bit

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
the throttle in years well a little bit

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.419 
the throttle in years well a little bit
of<00:00:43.850> oil<00:00:43.940> in<00:00:44.149> here<00:00:44.539> yes<00:00:50.710> not<00:00:51.710> concern<00:00:52.129> you<00:00:52.280> but

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
of oil in here yes not concern you but

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.340 
of oil in here yes not concern you but
all<00:00:52.609> these<00:00:52.910> here<00:00:53.300> should<00:00:53.539> all<00:00:53.659> be<00:00:53.839> getting<00:00:53.960> oil

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
all these here should all be getting oil

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.869 
all these here should all be getting oil
see<00:00:54.499> this<00:00:54.649> little<00:00:54.890> hole<00:00:55.039> here<00:00:55.070> yes<00:00:55.640> there

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
see this little hole here yes there

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.130 
see this little hole here yes there
should<00:00:55.999> be<00:00:56.120> oil<00:00:56.300> coming<00:00:56.659> up<00:00:56.780> here<00:00:56.960> all<00:00:57.050> the

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
should be oil coming up here all the
