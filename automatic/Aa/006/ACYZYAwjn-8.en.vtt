cool and I wanted to always make my
shirt<00:02:53.959> like<00:02:54.200> like<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.070> really<00:02:55.549> like<00:02:55.790> I<00:02:55.970> always

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.370 
but that's I think it's cold with your
shoe<00:02:58.549> like<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.239> can<00:02:59.420> design<00:02:59.780> something<00:03:00.200> that

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
shoe like you can design something that

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.380 
shoe like you can design something that
you<00:03:00.799> made<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.190> not<00:03:01.310> what<00:03:01.519> other<00:03:01.700> people<00:03:01.820> made
