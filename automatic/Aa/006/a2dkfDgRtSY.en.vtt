wide tooth comb now you could use a comb

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.480 
wide tooth comb now you could use a comb
that's<00:01:48.570> much<00:01:48.840> more<00:01:49.140> wide<00:01:49.439> toothed<00:01:49.799> than<00:01:50.220> this

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
that's much more wide toothed than this

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.240 
that's much more wide toothed than this
this<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> only<00:01:51.540> one<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.020> have

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
this just is the only one that I have

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.060 
this just is the only one that I have
they<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.490> some<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.000> are<00:01:54.030> even<00:01:54.470> wider<00:01:55.470> apart

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
they have some that are even wider apart

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.920 
they have some that are even wider apart
and<00:01:56.369> those<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.909> course<00:01:56.939> are<00:01:57.270> even<00:01:57.509> better<00:01:57.689> for

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
and those of course are even better for

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.020 
and those of course are even better for
your<00:01:58.020> hair<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:59.100> also<00:01:59.340> want<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.820> make<00:02:00.000> sure

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
your hair and you also want to make sure

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.890 
your hair and you also want to make sure
you<00:02:00.299> look<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.049> comb<00:02:01.320> has<00:02:01.619> rounded<00:02:02.460> edges

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.540 

can<00:02:07.900> you<00:02:08.020> see<00:02:08.229> how<00:02:08.410> those<00:02:08.530> edges<00:02:09.040> are<00:02:09.250> rounded

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
can you see how those edges are rounded

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.060 
can you see how those edges are rounded
they're<00:02:10.090> not<00:02:10.270> pointed<00:02:10.900> and<00:02:11.110> there's<00:02:11.650> none<00:02:12.040> of

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
they're not pointed and there's none of

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.850 
they're not pointed and there's none of
those<00:02:12.370> little<00:02:12.690> balls<00:02:13.690> at<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.110> end<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.680> them

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
those little balls at the end of them

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.420 
those little balls at the end of them
like<00:02:15.640> hairbrushes<00:02:16.300> often<00:02:16.870> have<00:02:17.080> now<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
like hairbrushes often have now the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.310 
like hairbrushes often have now the
reason<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.820> want<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.060> wide<00:02:19.270> tooth<00:02:19.570> comb<00:02:19.600> is

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
reason you want a wide tooth comb is

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.290 
reason you want a wide tooth comb is
when<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.160> are<00:02:21.310> detangling<00:02:22.060> your<00:02:22.120> hair

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
when you are detangling your hair

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.270 
when you are detangling your hair
especially<00:02:22.750> when<00:02:23.440> it's<00:02:23.590> wet<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:25.060> are<00:02:26.280> pulling

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
especially when it's wet you are pulling

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.500 
especially when it's wet you are pulling
through<00:02:27.700> snags<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:29.250> tangles<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.580> when<00:02:31.390> you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
through snags and tangles and when you

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.420 
through snags and tangles and when you
hit<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.810> tangle<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.770> yank<00:02:33.070> it<00:02:33.190> through

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
hit a tangle and you yank it through

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.480 
hit a tangle and you yank it through
with<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.580> brush<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.240> are<00:02:35.050> ripping<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.980> tangle

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
with a brush you are ripping that tangle

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.620 
with a brush you are ripping that tangle
out<00:02:36.580> not<00:02:37.120> gently<00:02:38.050> d<00:02:38.440> combing<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.820> using<00:02:40.510> a

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
out not gently d combing it so using a

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.580 
out not gently d combing it so using a
wide<00:02:40.870> tooth<00:02:41.200> comb<00:02:41.520> helps<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:43.030> more<00:02:43.900> gently

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
wide tooth comb helps to more gently

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.670 
wide tooth comb helps to more gently
separate<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.460> hairs<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.240> more<00:02:46.840> gently<00:02:47.320> work

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
separate the hairs and more gently work

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.790 
separate the hairs and more gently work
out<00:02:47.890> knots<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.820> tangles<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:50.200> this<00:02:50.650> is

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
out knots and tangles and this is

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.770 
out knots and tangles and this is
especially<00:02:51.220> important<00:02:52.000> when<00:02:52.060> your<00:02:52.300> hair<00:02:52.540> is

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
especially important when your hair is

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.480 
especially important when your hair is
wet<00:02:53.650> because<00:02:54.370> when<00:02:54.580> your<00:02:54.730> hair<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:55.060> wet<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.630> is

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
wet because when your hair is wet it is

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.850 
wet because when your hair is wet it is
that<00:02:57.490> much<00:02:57.790> more<00:02:58.030> susceptible<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.660> damage<00:02:58.870> now

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
that much more susceptible to damage now

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.950 
that much more susceptible to damage now
what<00:03:00.280> happens<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.880> when<00:03:01.090> your<00:03:01.210> hair<00:03:01.360> is<00:03:01.450> wet<00:03:01.720> it

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
what happens is when your hair is wet it

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.040 
what happens is when your hair is wet it
is<00:03:02.170> has<00:03:02.920> less<00:03:03.220> elasticity<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.360> if<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.870> don't

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
is has less elasticity and if you don't

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.690 
is has less elasticity and if you don't
know<00:03:05.170> what<00:03:05.320> elasticity<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.220> it's<00:03:06.460> a<00:03:06.550> very

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
know what elasticity is it's a very

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.670 
know what elasticity is it's a very
crucial<00:03:07.240> element<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.870> your<00:03:08.110> hair's<00:03:08.350> health

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
crucial element of your hair's health

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.800 
crucial element of your hair's health
and<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.790> can<00:03:09.820> think<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.210> it<00:03:10.330> kind<00:03:10.600> of<00:03:10.630> how<00:03:10.750> you

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
and you can think of it kind of how you

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.449 
and you can think of it kind of how you
would<00:03:10.989> think<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.320> rubber<00:03:11.470> band<00:03:11.830> when<00:03:12.340> you

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
would think of a rubber band when you

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.940 
would think of a rubber band when you
get<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.640> brand-new<00:03:13.209> rubber<00:03:14.140> band<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.800> you

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
get a brand-new rubber band and you

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.530 
get a brand-new rubber band and you
stretch<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:15.520> and<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:16.000> stretch<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.450> and

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
stretch it and you stretch it and

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.500 
stretch it and you stretch it and
stretch<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:17.050> always<00:03:17.200> goes<00:03:17.470> back<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.770> its

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
stretch it it always goes back to its

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.360 
stretch it it always goes back to its
regular<00:03:19.510> shape<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.470> length<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.070> doesn't

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
regular shape and length and it doesn't

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.400 
regular shape and length and it doesn't
get<00:03:21.459> stretched<00:03:21.880> out<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.390> just<00:03:22.660> always<00:03:22.989> returns

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
get stretched out it just always returns

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.770 
get stretched out it just always returns
back<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.830> normal<00:03:24.130> that's<00:03:24.670> how<00:03:25.000> our<00:03:25.150> hair<00:03:25.540> is

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
back to normal that's how our hair is

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.320 
back to normal that's how our hair is
and<00:03:26.620> should<00:03:26.890> be<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.160> should<00:03:27.190> be<00:03:27.430> very<00:03:27.820> elastic

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
and should be it should be very elastic

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.910 
and should be it should be very elastic
it<00:03:28.480> should<00:03:28.630> have<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.900> ability<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.320> be<00:03:29.560> pulled

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
it should have the ability to be pulled

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.460 
it should have the ability to be pulled
and<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.880> individual<00:03:31.480> strands<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:32.080> stretch

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
and this individual strands to stretch

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.560 
and this individual strands to stretch
and<00:03:32.739> then<00:03:32.890> return<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.640> their<00:03:34.060> original<00:03:34.270> shape

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
and then return to their original shape

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.330 
and then return to their original shape
and<00:03:35.020> their<00:03:35.350> original<00:03:35.739> length<00:03:35.920> without<00:03:36.100> any

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
and their original length without any

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.050 
and their original length without any
damage<00:03:36.930> now<00:03:37.930> when<00:03:38.260> your<00:03:38.440> hair<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.890> wet<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.580> has

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
damage now when your hair is wet it has

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.390 
damage now when your hair is wet it has
less<00:03:40.739> elasticity<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.239> when<00:03:43.239> you<00:03:43.390> pull<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:44.020> it

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
less elasticity so when you pull it it

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.170 
less elasticity so when you pull it it
pulls<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.820> it<00:03:46.830> becomes<00:03:47.830> weak<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.580> breaks

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
pulls and it becomes weak and breaks

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.900 
pulls and it becomes weak and breaks
easier<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:50.440> can<00:03:50.620> think<00:03:50.890> of<00:03:51.070> it<00:03:51.190> as<00:03:51.370> when<00:03:51.790> your

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
easier you can think of it as when your

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.540 
easier you can think of it as when your
hair<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.390> damaged<00:03:52.930> or<00:03:53.260> when<00:03:53.470> it's<00:03:53.620> wet<00:03:54.040> and

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
hair is damaged or when it's wet and

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.380 
hair is damaged or when it's wet and
weak<00:03:55.300> it<00:03:55.570> has<00:03:55.810> less<00:03:56.610> elasticity<00:03:57.610> and<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:58.239> can

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
weak it has less elasticity and you can

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.630 
weak it has less elasticity and you can
think<00:03:58.570> of<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:58.750> as<00:03:58.959> if<00:03:59.320> you<00:03:59.860> go<00:04:00.310> back<00:04:00.459> to<00:04:00.580> the

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
think of it as if you go back to the

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.250 
think of it as if you go back to the
rubber<00:04:00.820> band<00:04:01.090> again<00:04:01.330> when<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:01.720> have<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:01.930> really

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
rubber band again when you have a really

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.800 
rubber band again when you have a really
old<00:04:02.380> rubber<00:04:03.100> band<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.640> it's<00:04:03.760> dried<00:04:04.300> out<00:04:04.330> and

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
old rubber band and it's dried out and

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.720 
old rubber band and it's dried out and
old<00:04:05.170> and<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.590> stretch<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.280> snaps

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
old and you stretch it and it snaps

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.570 
old and you stretch it and it snaps
that's<00:04:07.690> exactly<00:04:08.380> what<00:04:08.590> your<00:04:08.890> hair<00:04:09.130> does<00:04:09.340> when

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
that's exactly what your hair does when

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.080 
that's exactly what your hair does when
your<00:04:09.700> hair<00:04:09.880> is<00:04:09.910> dry<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:11.430> damaged<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.820> then<00:04:13.000> on

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
your hair is dry and damaged and then on

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.180 
your hair is dry and damaged and then on
top<00:04:13.360> of<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.630> when<00:04:13.750> your<00:04:13.900> hair<00:04:14.050> is<00:04:14.140> wet<00:04:14.440> it<00:04:14.980> has

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
top of it when your hair is wet it has

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.610 
top of it when your hair is wet it has
less<00:04:15.550> elasticity<00:04:16.419> and<00:04:16.600> it<00:04:16.810> will<00:04:17.020> snap<00:04:17.260> and

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
less elasticity and it will snap and

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.069 
less elasticity and it will snap and
break

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
break

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.309 
break
and<00:04:18.169> so<00:04:18.799> by<00:04:18.949> using<00:04:19.189> a<00:04:19.430> wide<00:04:19.699> tooth<00:04:20.060> comb<00:04:20.319> this

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:21.319 
and so by using a wide tooth comb this

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:23.830 
and so by using a wide tooth comb this
really<00:04:21.919> helps<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.460> prevent<00:04:22.819> yanking<00:04:23.629> those

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
really helps to prevent yanking those

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.320 
really helps to prevent yanking those
tangles<00:04:24.340> pulling<00:04:25.340> them<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:25.729> breaking<00:04:26.210> that

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
tangles pulling them and breaking that

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.270 
tangles pulling them and breaking that
hair<00:04:26.629> so<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:26.930> really<00:04:27.409> want<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.680> always<00:04:27.889> comb
