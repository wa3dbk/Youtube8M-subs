difficult time off the table and like

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.939 
difficult time off the table and like
Steven<00:00:46.660> said<00:00:46.870> he<00:00:46.960> shows<00:00:47.170> what<00:00:47.199> a<00:00:47.350> class<00:00:47.590> act<00:00:47.739> he

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
tournament in Myers he's probably one of

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.520 
tournament in Myers he's probably one of
the<00:00:55.270> greatest<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:55.809> ever<00:00:55.840> play<00:00:56.109> the<00:00:56.320> game

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
the greatest to ever play the game

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.080 
the greatest to ever play the game
I<00:00:56.680> was<00:00:56.980> fortunate<00:00:57.190> enough<00:00:57.609> to<00:00:57.789> get<00:00:57.910> to<00:00:57.969> the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
I was fortunate enough to get to the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.630 
I was fortunate enough to get to the
World<00:00:58.329> final<00:00:58.719> a<00:00:58.840> couple<00:00:59.140> years<00:00:59.379> ago<00:00:59.500> and<00:01:00.430> play

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
World final a couple years ago and play

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.729 
World final a couple years ago and play
John<00:01:00.940> and<00:01:01.629> at<00:01:01.750> some<00:01:01.930> stage<00:01:01.960> I<00:01:02.289> thought<00:01:02.440> I<00:01:02.500> had

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
John and at some stage I thought I had

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.290 
John and at some stage I thought I had
him<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:03.100> mean<00:01:03.340> I'd<00:01:03.460> come<00:01:03.640> back<00:01:03.789> at<00:01:03.940> him<00:01:03.969> and<00:01:04.180> he

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
him I mean I'd come back at him and he

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.670 
him I mean I'd come back at him and he
looked<00:01:04.840> as<00:01:04.960> though<00:01:04.990> he<00:01:05.140> was<00:01:05.230> gone<00:01:05.440> at<00:01:05.560> one

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
looked as though he was gone at one

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.980 
looked as though he was gone at one
stage<00:01:05.920> and<00:01:06.190> all<00:01:07.120> of<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.300> sudden<00:01:07.330> he<00:01:07.660> just<00:01:07.870> seemed

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
stage and all of a sudden he just seemed

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.720 
stage and all of a sudden he just seemed
to<00:01:08.140> flick<00:01:08.620> a<00:01:08.650> switch<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:09.160> the<00:01:09.370> next<00:01:09.610> minute

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
to flick a switch and the next minute

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.310 
to flick a switch and the next minute
and<00:01:10.060> you'd<00:01:10.480> think<00:01:10.630> there<00:01:10.840> was<00:01:10.960> nothing<00:01:11.050> wrong

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
and you'd think there was nothing wrong

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.690 
and you'd think there was nothing wrong
with<00:01:11.500> him<00:01:11.590> he<00:01:11.680> went<00:01:11.860> on<00:01:12.010> and<00:01:12.130> reeled<00:01:12.310> four<00:01:12.580> or

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
with him he went on and reeled four or

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.400 
with him he went on and reeled four or
five<00:01:12.850> frames<00:01:13.060> off<00:01:13.390> which<00:01:13.540> I<00:01:13.750> think<00:01:14.260> there's

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
five frames off which I think there's

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.660 
five frames off which I think there's
only<00:01:14.500> a<00:01:14.590> few<00:01:14.800> players<00:01:15.040> out<00:01:15.220> there<00:01:15.250> what<00:01:15.550> could

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
only a few players out there what could

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.520 
only a few players out there what could
probably<00:01:15.880> do<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.120> it<00:01:16.930> does<00:01:17.110> seem<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.350> go<00:01:17.470> to

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
probably do that it does seem to go to

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.170 
probably do that it does seem to go to
soak<00:01:17.830> a<00:01:17.950> lot<00:01:18.100> up<00:01:18.220> on<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.490> rope<00:01:18.640> suddenly<00:01:19.060> and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
soak a lot up on the rope suddenly and

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.220 
soak a lot up on the rope suddenly and
then<00:01:19.270> come<00:01:19.480> back<00:01:19.510> for<00:01:19.690> more

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
then come back for more

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.520 
then come back for more
yeah<00:01:21.070> I<00:01:21.100> think<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.570> perfect<00:01:22.780> examples<00:01:23.440> the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
yeah I think the perfect examples the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.100 
yeah I think the perfect examples the
World<00:01:23.710> Championships<00:01:24.300> just<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.570> season<00:01:25.930> just
