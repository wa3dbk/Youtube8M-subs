00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 we live listening and talking about the 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.250
 end of the world as we know it we 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.140
 we found in such a delicate time 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.910
 that the minimum change could result in 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.769
 our annihilation or our 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.750
 restructures total but what I'm 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.520
 sure is that to continue we need a 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.240
 change not in 100 years nor in 50 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.240
 we need a change made 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.010
 life seeks life itself and is for 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.000
 what we find ourselves today 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.029
 exploring and fixing our own 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.430
 limits in physical technology and 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.170
 astronomical we are custodians of our 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.320
 meaning you own and constantly 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.400
 we play tricks to the destination but 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.900
 unfortunately we tend to project 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.970
 our own nature to the 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.040
 nature itself we are doing away with the 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.710
 only to be superior than scientifically 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.410
 yes our planet gives us life 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.720
 we believe a deity superior than our 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.550
 selfishness we think we need another age 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.010
 superior to justify all of our 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.420
 acts we come from our centuries 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.210
 feelings are not yet at all 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.250
 controlled and worse still we are doing 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.019
 of this planet a disaster and doing 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.030
 that our systems collapse day by day 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.400
 we look for our father to 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.440
 self-justify we forgive our 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.870
 mistakes and many times we finish 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.360
 Forgiving ourselves in the 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.710
 last years we have developed 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.299
 technologies so advanced that we can 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.100
 communicate today with all the 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.960
 galaxy technology that a hundred years ago 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.299
 it would have been like witchcraft today saves 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.680
 millions of people around is we have 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.780
 forgotten the true 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.480
 these advances to lock us in what 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.610
 today we know how our bubble 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.150
 we say life we have moved away from the 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.090
 planets and stars by maturity or 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.070
 maybe just a nerve failure yet 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.900
 I'm still waiting for the day to see live 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.790
 a person jump and fall in the middle 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.710
 of time on another planet if we do not 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.250
 we put to see this planet like that 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.900
 little blue dot in the universe and still 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.140
 you see this experiment is about 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.899
 convince yourself that god created 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.930
 this little blue dot for one of the 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.790
 millions of species that live in this 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.800
 piece of winter now try saying 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.399
 that the owner of that point is a 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.130
 fraction of this species or race or ethnicity 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.750
 or political stance we are not in a 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.790
 privileged point if there is life 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.520
 extraterrestrial possibly 17 hundreds 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.500
 of years of advance or just in the era of 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.330
 the caverns our preferences do not 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.890
 They count and there is no one right now except 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.140
 our own species that tells us that 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.000
 to be alone or accompanied is not the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.130
 question if the minimum enough for 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.870
 discover projects oriented to 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.920
 future are our hope that in 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.180
 actually we will have a 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.920
 but we will not be the ones who 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.069
 let's get to the next exoplanet 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.840
 habitable will be a very similar species 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.970
 to ours with more of our 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.290
 virtues and less of our defects 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.640
 more prudent, more capable and more honest if 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.530
 we want to find a good motivation 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.690
 let's find a true goal 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.690
 attainable our own transcendence 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.050
 I hope you liked this video 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.850
 very much is a personal reflection already 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.550
 they know many things that I have read 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.709
 about the future and I want to tell you that 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.180
 your opinion is respected and what you want 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.860
 eat write here in the comments 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.510
 you are welcome, I have nothing left 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.190
 more than saying that thank you very much 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.510
 for watching this video for hitting like 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.280
 share our your social networks 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.590
 for following me on twitter on facebook and 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.750
 also by subscribing to this channel this 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.850
 effort I do it from me for you and 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.590
 subscribe so it costs them nothing 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.450
 so we see ourselves as hysterical in a 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.959
 next video next week with a 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.959
 little surprise 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.890
 is a part of the video where many 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.909
 funny things we do not know if we already know 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.650
 I listened 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.349
 that we do not have anything but 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.989
 well in several projects the 01 800 will 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.209
 and come back he's also going to come back the big 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.260
 willie and I'm very aware is 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.049
 because we have a new program that 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.909
 we are going to premiere here if I organize and 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.980
 that's my main frustration that's why 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.569
 today and it was a very confusing day because 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.860
 I did not know how to organize because of 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.480
 it really affects me a lot to upload videos 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.280
 the day that I have to go up but 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.519
 because you have the job and all that because 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.560
 get me so 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.349
 if we are lucky under these new 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.819
 concepts and organization we will have 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.379
 some videos this week so the 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:30.360
 hysterical really thank you very much for 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.190
 all your support never give up and never 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.419
 let someone tell you that they are not worth 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.419
 so I love them
