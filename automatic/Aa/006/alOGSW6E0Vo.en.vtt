my control thingy the difference is
against<00:01:54.829> a<00:01:54.950> 30<00:01:55.189> second<00:01:55.670> cooldown<00:01:55.849> and<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.599> can

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780

against a 30 second cooldown and you can
only<00:01:56.989> in<00:01:57.200> my<00:01:57.439> control<00:01:57.799> person<00:01:58.429> that<00:01:59.209> is<00:01:59.689> below

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
only in my control person that is below

only in my control person that is below
level<00:02:00.979> 88<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:01.729> yeah<00:02:02.439> it's<00:02:03.439> not<00:02:03.590> really<00:02:03.619> that

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
level 88 so yeah it's not really that

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:09.729 
level 88 so yeah it's not really that
good<00:02:04.459> for<00:02:04.879> PvP<00:02:05.390> but<00:02:05.689> maybe<00:02:06.469> for<00:02:06.709> a<00:02:06.739> PVD<00:02:08.739> next

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
good for PvP but maybe for a PVD next

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.690 
good for PvP but maybe for a PVD next
down<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.220> body<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.209> soul<00:02:11.980> this<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.160> actually<00:02:13.549> a

movement<00:02:14.239> increase<00:02:15.519> effective<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:16.879> it's<00:02:17.810> a

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
movement increase effective and it's a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.470 
movement increase effective and it's a
passive<00:02:18.349> talent<00:02:18.769> that<00:02:19.459> actually<00:02:19.879> what<00:02:20.450> it

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
passive talent that actually what it

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.099 
passive talent that actually what it
does<00:02:20.750> is<00:02:21.019> make<00:02:21.500> us<00:02:22.400> power<00:02:22.700> shield<00:02:23.269> or<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.959> leap

huge<00:02:36.930> combat<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.290> yeah<00:02:38.829> but<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.819> bad<00:02:39.999> thing

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
huge combat and yeah but the bad thing

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.750 
huge combat and yeah but the bad thing
about<00:02:40.269> it<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:41.019> when<00:02:41.799> you<00:02:41.889> get<00:02:42.069> snared<00:02:42.430> or

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
about it is is when you get snared or

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.420 
about it is is when you get snared or
routed<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.599> actually<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.139> waste<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.099> so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
routed it is actually a waste of it so

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.660 
routed it is actually a waste of it so
in<00:02:46.090> my<00:02:46.329> opinion<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:46.930> don't<00:02:46.989> really<00:02:47.920> choose<00:02:48.189> body

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
in my opinion I don't really choose body

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.300 
in my opinion I don't really choose body
and<00:02:48.879> soul<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.569> if<00:02:50.049> you<00:02:50.349> like<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.829> if<00:02:51.010> you're

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
and soul so if you like it if you're

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.170 
and soul so if you like it if you're
comfortable<00:02:51.609> with<00:02:51.939> it<00:02:52.209> then<00:02:52.959> go<00:02:53.319> ahead<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
comfortable with it then go ahead the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.140 
comfortable with it then go ahead the
next<00:02:55.480> one<00:02:55.599> is<00:02:55.629> my<00:02:56.019> bender<00:02:56.469> yes<00:02:57.129> this<00:02:57.579> is<00:02:57.790> fine

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
next one is my bender yes this is fine

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.289 
next one is my bender yes this is fine
one<00:02:58.420> for<00:02:58.659> arena<00:02:59.109> well<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.280> bad<00:03:00.489> thing<00:03:00.519> about<00:03:01.000> a

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
one for arena well the bad thing about a

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.190 
one for arena well the bad thing about a
mind<00:03:01.659> bender<00:03:01.989> is<00:03:02.109> it<00:03:02.379> only<00:03:02.980> has<00:03:03.310> such<00:03:03.879> low<00:03:04.389> HP

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
mind bender is it only has such low HP

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.679 
mind bender is it only has such low HP
so<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:06.249> can<00:03:06.400> actually<00:03:06.519> be<00:03:06.849> destroyed<00:03:07.269> very

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
so you can actually be destroyed very

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.039 
so you can actually be destroyed very
fast<00:03:08.079> it<00:03:08.950> actually<00:03:09.310> replaces<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.540> shadow

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
fast it actually replaces the shadow

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.250 
fast it actually replaces the shadow
fiend<00:03:11.319> and<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:13.030> cooldown<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.510> this<00:03:13.810> one<00:03:14.019> is

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
fiend and the cooldown of this one is

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.830 
fiend and the cooldown of this one is
one<00:03:14.560> minute<00:03:14.949> and<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:16.510> one<00:03:16.689> actually

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
one minute and this one actually

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.509 
one minute and this one actually
increases<00:03:17.439> more<00:03:17.620> damage<00:03:17.980> of<00:03:18.129> it<00:03:18.250> and

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
increases more damage of it and

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.689 
increases more damage of it and
increases<00:03:19.359> more<00:03:19.569> mana<00:03:20.319> back<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.949> every<00:03:21.669> time

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:21.699 
increases more mana back and every time

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:24.689 
increases more mana back and every time
when<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.180> could<00:03:22.389> damage<00:03:22.659> it<00:03:22.989> James<00:03:23.650> 2%<00:03:24.459> matter

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
when you could damage it James 2% matter

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.860 
when you could damage it James 2% matter
back<00:03:24.969> so<00:03:25.180> that's<00:03:25.269> it's<00:03:26.019> pretty<00:03:26.260> nice<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:28.569> next

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
back so that's it's pretty nice the next

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.050 
back so that's it's pretty nice the next
one<00:03:28.989> is<00:03:29.049> power<00:03:29.439> works<00:03:29.739> solvents<00:03:30.400> I<00:03:30.549> don't<00:03:30.879> feel

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
one is power works solvents I don't feel

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.959 
one is power works solvents I don't feel
really<00:03:31.329> comfortable<00:03:31.689> with<00:03:32.079> this<00:03:32.349> and<00:03:32.969> the

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:33.969 
really comfortable with this and the

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:37.920 
really comfortable with this and the
reason<00:03:34.000> why<00:03:34.540> is<00:03:34.569> because<00:03:35.400> yeah<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.730> use<00:03:37.449> smite

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
reason why is because yeah I use smite

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.030 
reason why is because yeah I use smite
more<00:03:38.260> often<00:03:38.680> for<00:03:39.219> the<00:03:39.489> Archangel<00:03:40.090> Brock

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
more often for the Archangel Brock

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.899 
more often for the Archangel Brock
powered<00:03:43.030> solace<00:03:43.420> is<00:03:43.629> yeah<00:03:44.349> it<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:45.189> less<00:03:45.549> damage

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
powered solace is yeah it is less damage

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.869 
powered solace is yeah it is less damage
and<00:03:46.090> smart<00:03:46.450> but<00:03:47.200> it<00:03:47.590> only<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:48.219> different

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
and smart but it only the different

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.990 
and smart but it only the different
about<00:03:49.060> it<00:03:49.120> is<00:03:49.329> is<00:03:49.599> when<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:50.260> cast<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:51.519> gives

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
about it is is when you cast it it gives

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.959 
about it is is when you cast it it gives
you<00:03:52.150> zero<00:03:52.930> dot<00:03:53.290> seven<00:03:53.890> percent<00:03:54.280> maximum<00:03:54.760> mana

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:54.969 
you zero dot seven percent maximum mana

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.390 
you zero dot seven percent maximum mana
back<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:55.540> that's<00:03:55.719> not<00:03:55.870> really<00:03:56.079> that<00:03:56.590> much<00:03:57.040> so

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
back and that's not really that much so

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.569 
back and that's not really that much so
in<00:03:58.299> my<00:03:58.480> opinion<00:03:58.629> this<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.319> not<00:03:59.620> really<00:04:00.129> nice

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
in my opinion this is not really nice

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.449 
in my opinion this is not really nice
talent<00:04:01.090> it's<00:04:01.359> actually<00:04:01.659> maybe<00:04:02.500> waste<00:04:03.069> of<00:04:03.280> it

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
talent it's actually maybe waste of it

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.589 
talent it's actually maybe waste of it
oh<00:04:03.700> yeah<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:05.769> next<00:04:06.069> one<00:04:06.250> is<00:04:06.400> desperate<00:04:07.239> prayer

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
oh yeah the next one is desperate prayer

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.500 
oh yeah the next one is desperate prayer
and<00:04:08.040> yeah<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.489> might<00:04:09.700> know<00:04:09.909> this<00:04:10.060> one<00:04:10.299> guys

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
and yeah you might know this one guys

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.559 
and yeah you might know this one guys
it's<00:04:10.900> still<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.799> same<00:04:12.010> as<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.219> open<00:04:12.609> it<00:04:13.329> use

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
it's still the same as the open it use

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.660 
it's still the same as the open it use
you<00:04:13.719> from<00:04:13.870> thirty<00:04:14.109> percent<00:04:14.530> of<00:04:14.799> your<00:04:14.889> third<00:04:15.129> HP

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
you from thirty percent of your third HP

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.330 
you from thirty percent of your third HP
where<00:04:16.509> the<00:04:16.750> bad<00:04:16.900> thing<00:04:17.139> about<00:04:17.199> this<00:04:17.560> is<00:04:17.799> two

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
where the bad thing about this is two

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.550 
where the bad thing about this is two
minute<00:04:18.579> cooldown<00:04:18.849> and<00:04:19.239> it's<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.599> way<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:20.169> big

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
minute cooldown and it's a way to big

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.909 
minute cooldown and it's a way to big
cooldown<00:04:21.539> so<00:04:22.539> that's<00:04:23.139> the<00:04:23.259> reason<00:04:23.320> why<00:04:23.620> don't

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
cooldown so that's the reason why don't

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.909 
cooldown so that's the reason why don't
we<00:04:24.039> use<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.610> but<00:04:25.180> if<00:04:25.750> you've<00:04:25.990> comfortable<00:04:26.830> with

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
we use it but if you've comfortable with

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.040 
we use it but if you've comfortable with
it<00:04:27.039> just<00:04:27.490> use<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.919> yeah<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:31.180> next<00:04:31.660> one<00:04:31.840> is

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
it just use it and yeah the next one is

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.370 
it just use it and yeah the next one is
maybe<00:04:32.380> my<00:04:32.949> favorite<00:04:33.430> thing<00:04:34.120> on<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.419> wall<00:04:34.449> you

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
maybe my favorite thing on the wall you

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.370 
maybe my favorite thing on the wall you
called<00:04:35.680> spectral<00:04:36.130> guys<00:04:36.639> it's<00:04:37.060> actually<00:04:37.380> sort

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
called spectral guys it's actually sort

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.370 
called spectral guys it's actually sort
of<00:04:38.530> stealth<00:04:39.099> ability<00:04:39.729> when<00:04:40.419> you<00:04:40.539> cast<00:04:40.990> it<00:04:41.199> it

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
of stealth ability when you cast it it

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.029 
of stealth ability when you cast it it
leaves<00:04:42.220> a<00:04:42.550> copy<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:43.599> behind<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.349> you

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
leaves a copy of you behind and you

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.670 
leaves a copy of you behind and you
actually<00:04:45.699> turn<00:04:46.270> into<00:04:46.330> stealth<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.169> can<00:04:47.409> walk

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
actually turn into stealth I can walk

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.430 
actually turn into stealth I can walk
around<00:04:48.010> for<00:04:48.400> six<00:04:48.909> seconds<00:04:49.419> it's<00:04:49.659> pretty<00:04:50.139> funny

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
around for six seconds it's pretty funny

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.240

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
you can compare this to a little yeah

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.209 
you can compare this to a little yeah
version<00:05:57.139> of<00:05:57.849> sacred<00:05:58.849> shield<00:05:59.179> in<00:05:59.449> the<00:05:59.569> old<00:05:59.719> time

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
there this is definitely not good

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.199 
there this is definitely not good
because<00:06:03.019> they<00:06:03.439> can<00:06:03.649> hit<00:06:04.369> you<00:06:04.550> straight

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:05.209

for me and it increases my flash you by
way<00:07:06.640> might<00:07:07.030> speed<00:07:07.450> so<00:07:08.170> yeah<00:07:08.410> that's<00:07:09.100> really

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
way might speed so yeah that's really
