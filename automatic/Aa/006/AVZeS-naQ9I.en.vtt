the battle my crew kadhal is views
countax<00:01:23.580> i<00:01:23.759> predicted<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.360> u-turn<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.990> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
countax i predicted the u-turn and it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.320 
countax i predicted the u-turn and it
almost<00:01:25.740> took<00:01:26.009> out<00:01:26.159> his<00:01:26.340> car<00:01:26.640> across<00:01:26.820> scott<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
almost took out his car across scott and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.120 
almost took out his car across scott and
i<00:01:27.360> switch<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.600> my<00:01:27.810> sheriff<00:01:28.140> Rosco<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.710> then

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
i switch to my sheriff Rosco and then

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.499 
i switch to my sheriff Rosco and then
things<00:01:29.369> happens<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.909> all<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.180> happens

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
things happens and all that happens

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.940 
things happens and all that happens
eventually<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.200> his<00:01:31.320> car<00:01:31.350> across<00:01:31.680> could

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
eventually is that his car across could

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.340 
eventually is that his car across could
dive<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.729> i<00:01:32.939> know<00:01:33.060> its<00:01:33.390> aspects<00:01:33.750> one<00:01:33.960> since<00:01:34.229> i

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
dive here i know its aspects one since i

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.140 
dive here i know its aspects one since i
made<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:36.170> as<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.439> specs<00:01:37.860> i<00:01:38.150> predicted

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
made that and as it is specs i predicted

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.480 
made that and as it is specs i predicted
it<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> bottom<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.110> motor<00:01:40.740> drive<00:01:41.130> from<00:01:41.340> my

Zeb striker would activate but he

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.649 
Zeb striker would activate but he
predicts<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.009> uses<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> hidden<00:01:44.729> power<00:01:44.909> which

can just learn new names for the new
guys

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
guys

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.720 
guys
go<00:02:15.210> for<00:02:15.450> third<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:15.870> scarf<00:02:16.290> there<00:02:16.590> blitz<00:02:16.890> with

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
go for third that scarf there blitz with

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.940 
go for third that scarf there blitz with
the<00:02:18.090> reckless<00:02:18.570> ability<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.440> dreamworld

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
the reckless ability the dreamworld

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.850 
the reckless ability the dreamworld
reckless<00:02:20.370> ability<00:02:20.790> which<00:02:21.110> ridiculous<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.290> 120

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
reckless ability which ridiculous is 120

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.840 
reckless ability which ridiculous is 120
plus<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.340> stab<00:02:24.240> was<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:24.660> 180<00:02:25.140> plus<00:02:26.010> your

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
plus a stab was just 180 plus your

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.370 
plus a stab was just 180 plus your
reckless<00:02:27.240> which<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.570> believe<00:02:27.780> another

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
reckless which is I believe another

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.030 
reckless which is I believe another
twenty<00:02:28.830> percent<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.280> 180<00:02:29.610> divided<00:02:30.000> by<00:02:30.060> 5<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:31.040> 36

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
twenty percent so 180 divided by 5 is 36

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.120 
twenty percent so 180 divided by 5 is 36
so<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.370> for<00:02:33.140> 206<00:02:34.140> base<00:02:34.380> power<00:02:34.650> which<00:02:34.920> is

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
so it's for 206 base power which is

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.790 
so it's for 206 base power which is
fantastic<00:02:35.990> scarfed<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.110> gives<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.560> decent

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
fantastic scarfed it gives it a decent

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.220 
fantastic scarfed it gives it a decent
speed<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:38.910> know<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.510> brave<00:02:39.720> re<00:02:39.990> is

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
speed but I know that the brave re is

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.860 
speed but I know that the brave re is
also<00:02:40.680> scoffed<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.820> I'm<00:02:42.150> going<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.390> switch<00:02:42.630> out

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
also scoffed so I'm going to switch out

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.910 
also scoffed so I'm going to switch out
and<00:02:43.170> go<00:02:43.290> into<00:02:43.470> Cara<00:02:43.860> koska<00:02:44.690> or<00:02:45.690> care<00:02:46.290> Acosta

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
and go into Cara koska or care Acosta

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.130 
and go into Cara koska or care Acosta
and<00:02:47.040> he<00:02:47.550> predicts<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.210> goes<00:02:48.540> for<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.750> u-turn

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
and he predicts that goes for the u-turn

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.720 
and he predicts that goes for the u-turn
or<00:02:49.320> maybe<00:02:49.500> just<00:02:49.620> wanted<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.160> scout<00:02:50.400> if<00:02:50.610> I

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
or maybe just wanted to scout if I

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.860 
or maybe just wanted to scout if I
wanted<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:50.970> go<00:02:51.090> through<00:02:51.270> their<00:02:51.480> billets<00:02:51.750> or

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
wanted to go through their billets or

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.520 
wanted to go through their billets or
not<00:02:52.020> but<00:02:52.230> that's<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.190> what<00:02:53.400> happens<00:02:54.170> here<00:02:55.170> he

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
not but that's just what happens here he

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.250 
not but that's just what happens here he
goes<00:02:55.680> into<00:02:55.860> ember<00:02:56.220> which<00:02:56.340> was<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:57.020> really<00:02:58.020> weird

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
goes into ember which was a really weird

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
decision on my part I would thought

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.250 
decision on my part I would thought
because<00:03:02.490> Aquajet<00:03:03.180> has<00:03:03.390> priority<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.080> it's

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
because Aquajet has priority and it's

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.960

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
very very good defense i think its base

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.600 
very very good defense i think its base
130<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.990> it's<00:03:40.500> got<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.650> good<00:03:40.770> attack<00:03:41.070> too<00:03:41.340> so

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
130 and it's got a good attack too so

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.890 
130 and it's got a good attack too so
it's<00:03:42.120> basically<00:03:43.580> like<00:03:44.580> Kabutops<00:03:45.240> but<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.660> bit

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
it's basically like Kabutops but a bit

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.230 
it's basically like Kabutops but a bit

more bulky and a bit slower well quite a

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.970 
more bulky and a bit slower well quite a
bit<00:03:48.480> slower<00:03:48.690> but<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.930> bit<00:03:49.140> more<00:03:49.290> bulky<00:03:49.650> but<00:03:49.920> it

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
bit slower but a bit more bulky but it

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.530 
bit slower but a bit more bulky but it
still<00:03:50.100> has<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.250> Aquajet<00:03:50.670> priority<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:51.360> it's

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
still has the Aquajet priority so it's

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.390 
still has the Aquajet priority so it's
not<00:03:51.660> too<00:03:52.230> bad<00:03:52.410> it<00:03:52.560> doesn't<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:52.920> she'll<00:03:53.160> break

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
not too bad it doesn't like she'll break

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.420 
not too bad it doesn't like she'll break
but<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.790> needs<00:03:54.000> at<00:03:54.210> least<00:03:54.270> plus<00:03:55.140> full<00:03:55.440> speed<00:03:55.890> to

but a bit more offensive and a bit

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.950 
but a bit more offensive and a bit
slower<00:04:35.640> because<00:04:35.910> it's<00:04:36.150> pretty<00:04:36.690> similar

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
slower because it's pretty similar
