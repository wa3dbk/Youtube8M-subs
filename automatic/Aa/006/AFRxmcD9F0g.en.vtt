00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.860
 these two functions have already been deactivated 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.510
 but if you want to return these functions 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.110
 as before, you just have to repeat the 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.300

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.240
 but now instead of putting 0 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:34.830
 we wrote 1 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.830
 and we accept 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.730
