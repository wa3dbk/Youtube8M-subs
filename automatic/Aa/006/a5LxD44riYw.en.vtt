console fan is running very loudly and

console fan is running very loudly and
the<00:00:15.280> suspicion<00:00:15.820> is<00:00:15.940> that<00:00:16.150> this<00:00:16.330> is<00:00:16.539> putting

the ps4 at risk of damage this was
prompted<00:00:19.570> because<00:00:20.560> with<00:00:20.920> the<00:00:21.009> release<00:00:21.310> of

rocket<00:00:22.179> League<00:00:22.330> people's<00:00:22.810> fans<00:00:23.439> were<00:00:23.679> running

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
rocket League people's fans were running

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.710 
rocket League people's fans were running
more<00:00:24.160> loudly<00:00:24.429> than<00:00:24.670> they<00:00:24.939> were<00:00:25.000> accustomed<00:00:25.330> to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
more loudly than they were accustomed to

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.540 
more loudly than they were accustomed to
so<00:00:26.080> I<00:00:26.109> thought<00:00:26.349> I<00:00:26.380> would<00:00:26.560> test<00:00:26.769> out<00:00:27.039> one<00:00:27.339> of<00:00:27.369> the

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
so I thought I would test out one of the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.310 
so I thought I would test out one of the
supposed<00:00:27.880> solutions<00:00:28.509> that<00:00:28.779> seemed<00:00:29.050> plausible

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
supposed solutions that seemed plausible

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.519 
supposed solutions that seemed plausible
to<00:00:29.859> me<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:31.210> solution<00:00:31.630> suggests<00:00:32.140> that<00:00:32.289> if<00:00:32.439> you

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
to me the solution suggests that if you

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.860 
to me the solution suggests that if you
elevate<00:00:33.010> the<00:00:33.160> ps4<00:00:33.460> off<00:00:33.879> the<00:00:34.120> surface<00:00:34.570> on<00:00:34.780> which

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
elevate the ps4 off the surface on which

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.430 
elevate the ps4 off the surface on which
it<00:00:34.930> puts<00:00:35.140> it's<00:00:35.590> by<00:00:35.980> adding<00:00:36.579> feet<00:00:37.270> air<00:00:37.809> can<00:00:38.170> also

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
it puts it's by adding feet air can also

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.380 
it puts it's by adding feet air can also
radiate<00:00:38.890> out<00:00:39.100> of<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.340> bottom<00:00:39.730> of<00:00:39.850> the<00:00:39.910> casing

how the console was built to do anyway
so<00:00:49.270> I'm<00:00:49.449> testing<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:49.989> loudness<00:00:50.199> of<00:00:50.530> the

so I'm testing the loudness of the
console<00:00:51.010> with<00:00:51.219> a<00:00:51.250> simple<00:00:51.670> decibel<00:00:52.149> meter<00:00:52.300> app

of play on the stilts I was measuring

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.410 
of play on the stilts I was measuring
the<00:01:41.290> same<00:01:41.530> approximate<00:01:42.159> level<00:01:42.520> of<00:01:42.640> noise<00:01:42.880> as<00:01:43.390> I

the same approximate level of noise as I

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.200 
the same approximate level of noise as I
was<00:01:43.780> without<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.320> stilts<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:45.700> I'm<00:01:45.790> not<00:01:45.909> seeing

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
was without the stilts so I'm not seeing

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.410

any change really now again I do think

dissipated<00:01:53.770> from<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:54.040> console<00:01:54.490> but<00:01:55.210> as<00:01:55.360> you

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
dissipated from the console but as you

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.020 
dissipated from the console but as you
can<00:01:55.630> see<00:01:55.689> the<00:01:56.170> difference<00:01:56.590> is<00:01:56.829> negligible<00:01:57.250> so

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
can see the difference is negligible so

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.580 
can see the difference is negligible so
given<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.539> results<00:01:59.049> that<00:01:59.170> we're<00:01:59.289> finding

here<00:01:59.829> I'm<00:02:00.070> recommending<00:02:00.430> against<00:02:01.090> even

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
here I'm recommending against even

here I'm recommending against even
bothering<00:02:01.750> with<00:02:01.869> this<00:02:02.140> kind<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.469> solution<00:02:02.680> I

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
bothering with this kind of solution I

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.340 
bothering with this kind of solution I
will<00:02:04.119> note<00:02:04.390> that<00:02:04.420> because<00:02:05.049> of<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.320> very

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
will note that because of the very

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.400 
will note that because of the very
careful<00:02:06.039> design<00:02:06.219> of<00:02:06.729> how<00:02:06.939> air<00:02:07.329> flows<00:02:07.689> inside

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410
