 Let's go to you as the organism mine. 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.850
 nail polishes 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.180
 the idea of ​​this video was ivete maria 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.850
 sofia veloso and taba andrade 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.960
 dear readers who suggested a video 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.550
 a kiss for 3 and go there to see how it is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.550
 that the body everything right 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.050
 so folks I have these two 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.550
 floor organizers 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.280
 they are from mdf I bought raw cup in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.079
 I tried in white I did not go 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.910
 indicate the store to you 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.820
 where I bought because I did not like the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.190
 then the union is good but 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.399
 you can have it done in any 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.780
 shop that sells mdf items and then 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.320
 come on, these are my glazes 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:10.820
 Blues stay here and a ranchinho here 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:14.369
 underneath also the golden yellows and 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:20.850
 oranges here a briefcase full of 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:27.080
 cotton mover things and the issue of 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:30.329
 purple I miss lasi violets 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.009
 the greens are realizing that the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.780
 organism for connectivity organized by 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.939
 mark an era but I started to 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.780
 organize by body here in the corner of 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.960
 A bad one, I found it easier to 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.979
 I'm down here and with my 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.100
 boxes with stickers and fabric paint 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.729
 my items to instantly manipulate the line and 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.729
 it is 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.630
 on the shelf that you know very well 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.600
 I always have the background of my videos 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.290
 I keep from neighbors who do not fit in the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.980
 floor organizer and also 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.330
 consequently they are the most 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.600
 pretty are not 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.270
 I also arranged by color to be more 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.910
 easy to find in the future. 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.250
 a little because I too have organized 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.350
 so it's ok 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.220
 and it's this people a little bit 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.130
 Enamel is still missing the bad I have 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.680
 also this organizer box 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.200
 from my old blog 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.920
 decorating nails and that's where I put the 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:45.200
 my extra bases videos all 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.360
 leaders and brilliant 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.870
 are the effect enamels I keep here 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.420
 inside and I have two more boxes 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.600
 organizers that I did you too 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.180
 Can you do with a shoe box, I can? 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.370
 I taught you already made a video here on the channel. 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.510
 teaching how to do I will leave it to 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.620
 you 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:13.470
 and in this little green I put the enamels 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:15.680
 black and gray to white and some 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:21.180
 that did not fit on my shelf 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:25.250
 colored is in the red box I 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.260
 I put the pink and red enamels 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.630
 combining right box 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.680
 you can see that there is still space 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:38.120
 to fill these are roses and the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.239
 reds from the other half 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.700
 and it's the colors that I - I use people I even 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.680
 I have a lot but I hardly use pink and 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.989
 red and they stay here 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.609
 I'd also like to share a 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.700
 I owe you the orey antunes gave 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:00.219
 because it is for those who keep the enamels on 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.519
 boxes to put a penguin 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:05.200
 enamel on his own cap so that 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.730
 It gets easier when you choose 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.250
 the color saints will stay all the time 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.340
 lifting glass I loved this 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:16.299
 Tip I'll try to kiss you 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.220
 dear, thank you, thank you, same people. 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.620
 that I have a lot of nail polish 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.940
 and I've always cataloged my glazes 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.490
 Excel worksheet but I had the 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.310
 opportunity to meet a person does 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.449
 part of a group of 11 lines and very 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:37.000
 more than she made a super legal catalog 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.300
 with a worksheet and also a showcase 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.720
 and I improved her idea. 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:48.099
 and I'll show you now how I 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:51.130
 did I name the worksheet and the second 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:55.150
 column is the mark of the enamel 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:58.120
 the third the name of the enamel 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:02.650
 the fourth is the color 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:06.159
 the fifth is the description being literal mozzo 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:11.020
 what is it the sixth one if I have ever used it or not 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:14.500
 the enamel to the seventh and the validity to the octaves 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.300
 is the quantity and the last is the 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.530
 characteristic of him where he is and whether 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:24.130
 national or imported, and together with 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:27.639
 this worksheet has a showcase that are 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.590
 all the colors are glazed are we are 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.870
 it's the wrong way 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.259
 That's why I said that it took a while. 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.909
 more to leave I went riding according to 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:39.159
 with the worksheet number one of the 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:41.620
 showcase and equal number one of the worksheet 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:45.099
 and so it goes 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.990
 I put it on my body that I realized that 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.000
 so it is 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.840
 The more I like to decorate 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.670
 then I 'll combine colors and 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.980
 It's much easier than I can 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.170
 look so glitter matches with such 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:02.700
 Enamel and so on 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:05.340
 I currently have 490 enamels and 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.180
 it took me a little while to do this 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:13.500
 But most people do it once, only 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:16.950
 that you will leave the space empty or 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.500
 some empty houses and according to you 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.400
 for buying or receiving from terenos 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.420
 hardly says 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:27.750
 You'll fill both in the worksheet. 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.700
 how much in the showcase is not painting obvious 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.850
 which will not get more in the order of color 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:35.940
 by body but will have much to facilitate 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:39.360
 most will already go well okay I 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:43.460
 I really liked how you can have the copy 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:47.460
 or print I did on paper 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:51.300
 Transparency taprobana would jump and ask for 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:54.930
 role and transparency and ready 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.460
 I put a white paper behind it and 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.870
 Beautiful, I loved it 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:03.060
 I'm drooling here in the organization, people. 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.820
 I hope you have enjoyed it so much. 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.560
 how much I and I will leave there on the blog that 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.960
 this first link here below 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.960
 video the two spreadsheets for you 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:16.440
 to download it will interest you 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.930
 clear and you can also use the 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.150
 organization of your enamels 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:24.390
 if you like do not forget to give a 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.800
 I liked it here in this sharing video 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.500
 also that I think it's a good idea 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.640
 cool for us or show it to others 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.710
 people 

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.330
 I know you guys got super curious. 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:36.750
 to know what was inside the 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:38.580
 little boxes of my suitcases and I go 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.600
 show you my collection of 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:45.860

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.040
 switched on
