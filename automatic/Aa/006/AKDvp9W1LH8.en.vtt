to make it as as correct as as we could

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.840 
to make it as as correct as as we could
this<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:45.229> numbers-matching<00:01:46.229> car<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:47.700> has

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
this is a numbers-matching car it has

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.960 
this is a numbers-matching car it has
the<00:01:48.000> original<00:01:48.090> motor<00:01:48.680> transmission<00:01:49.729> rear<00:01:50.729> end

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
not original to this car is the

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.340 
not original to this car is the
alternator<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.359> distributor<00:03:26.959> the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350

alternator so the distributor the
carburetor<00:03:28.480> all<00:03:29.480> those<00:03:30.170> are<00:03:30.440> all<00:03:30.560> date<00:03:30.889> coded

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
carburetor all those are all date coded

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.610 
carburetor all those are all date coded
correctly<00:03:31.849> and<00:03:32.450> they<00:03:32.540> all<00:03:32.720> match<00:03:33.049> this<00:03:33.319> car

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620

and therefore this car we're looking for

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.330 
and therefore this car we're looking for
an<00:03:35.599> alternator<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.139> it's<00:03:36.500> it's<00:03:36.859> hard<00:03:36.889> to<00:03:37.069> find

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
an alternator and it's it's hard to find

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.479 
an alternator and it's it's hard to find
it's<00:03:37.880> one<00:03:38.030> of<00:03:38.090> those<00:03:38.150> hard<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.450> find<00:03:38.480> items<00:03:38.989> and

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
it's one of those hard to find items and

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.670 
it's one of those hard to find items and
it<00:03:40.489> won't<00:03:40.880> be<00:03:40.970> cheap<00:03:41.000> but<00:03:41.569> neither<00:03:42.200> was<00:03:42.440> the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
it won't be cheap but neither was the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.430 
it won't be cheap but neither was the
restoration<00:03:43.099> so<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:44.840> know<00:03:44.930> eventually<00:03:45.139> we'll

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
restoration so you know eventually we'll

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.630 
restoration so you know eventually we'll
find<00:03:45.500> that<00:03:45.919> and<00:03:46.299> finish<00:03:47.299> off<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.599> project

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
find that and finish off the project
