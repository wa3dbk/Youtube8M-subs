plant beets in fact you may already have

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.270 
plant beets in fact you may already have
them<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.500> ground<00:00:13.679> or<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.040> might<00:00:14.190> have

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
them in the ground or you might have

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.460 
them in the ground or you might have
started<00:00:14.460> them<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.730> your<00:00:14.940> greenhouse<00:00:15.350> but<00:00:16.350> in

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
started them in your greenhouse but in

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.840 
started them in your greenhouse but in
case<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.800> haven't<00:00:17.010> here's<00:00:17.520> what<00:00:17.699> they<00:00:17.820> look

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
case you haven't here's what they look

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.400 
case you haven't here's what they look
like<00:00:18.170> they're<00:00:19.170> tiny<00:00:19.529> little<00:00:20.270> dried<00:00:21.410> fruits

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
like they're tiny little dried fruits

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.560 
like they're tiny little dried fruits
and<00:00:22.859> that's<00:00:23.609> right<00:00:23.850> they're<00:00:24.029> fruits<00:00:24.300> they're

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
and that's right they're fruits they're

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.870 
and that's right they're fruits they're
not<00:00:24.779> seeds<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.380> seeds<00:00:25.560> are<00:00:25.800> actually<00:00:25.949> inside

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
not seeds the seeds are actually inside

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.089 
not seeds the seeds are actually inside
of<00:00:27.300> these<00:00:27.779> little<00:00:27.990> dried<00:00:28.320> fruits<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.980> there

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
of these little dried fruits and there

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.110 
of these little dried fruits and there
can<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.310> up<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.730> eight<00:00:30.320> seeds<00:00:31.320> inside<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.550> when

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
can be up to eight seeds inside and when

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.870 
can be up to eight seeds inside and when
you<00:00:33.149> start<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:34.130> seed<00:00:35.130> whether<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.489> start<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.790> in

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
you start a seed whether you start it in

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.670 
you start a seed whether you start it in
the<00:00:35.969> ground<00:00:36.120> or<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.809> tray<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.530> one

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the ground or in a tray like this one

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.860 
the ground or in a tray like this one
right<00:00:37.829> here<00:00:37.890> you'll<00:00:38.820> find<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.390> they<00:00:39.600> grow<00:00:39.840> in

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
right here you'll find that they grow in

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.619 
right here you'll find that they grow in
clumps<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.760> happens<00:00:42.090> when<00:00:42.210> they<00:00:42.329> grow<00:00:42.450> in

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
clumps so what happens when they grow in

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.270 
clumps so what happens when they grow in
clumps<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.350> you'll<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.890> come<00:00:44.070> back

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
clumps is that you'll have to come back

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.490 
clumps is that you'll have to come back
and<00:00:44.520> thin<00:00:44.850> these<00:00:45.090> out<00:00:45.390> because<00:00:45.809> beets<00:00:46.200> won't

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and thin these out because beets won't

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.869 
and thin these out because beets won't
grow<00:00:46.860> well<00:00:47.100> when<00:00:47.280> they're<00:00:47.430> close<00:00:47.670> together

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
grow well when they're close together

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.900 
grow well when they're close together
they<00:00:48.539> won't<00:00:48.719> form<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.710> bulb<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> end

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
they won't form a bulb at the end

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.610 
they won't form a bulb at the end
they'll<00:00:51.180> stay<00:00:51.449> kind<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.780> skinny<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.500> can

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
they'll stay kind of skinny and you can

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.470 
they'll stay kind of skinny and you can
eat<00:00:52.739> beet<00:00:52.920> greens<00:00:53.219> which<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.610> good<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.360> then

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
eat beet greens which are good but then

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.720 
eat beet greens which are good but then
you<00:00:54.570> won't<00:00:54.719> end<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.320> nice<00:00:56.100> bulb<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
you won't end up with a nice bulb at the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.110 
you won't end up with a nice bulb at the
end<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.440> need<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.710> do<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.120> you'll

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
end so what you need to do is you'll

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.219 
end so what you need to do is you'll
need<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.329> come<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:02.930> separate<00:01:03.930> them<00:01:04.170> like

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
need to come in and separate them like

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.039 
need to come in and separate them like
this<00:01:04.880> and<00:01:06.590> then<00:01:07.590> find<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.130> nice<00:01:08.310> spot<00:01:08.900> that<00:01:09.900> gets

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
this and then find a nice spot that gets

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.469 
this and then find a nice spot that gets
a<00:01:10.409> good<00:01:10.920> deal<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.280> Sun<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.670> doesn't<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.330> be

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
a good deal of Sun it doesn't have to be

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.620 
a good deal of Sun it doesn't have to be
as<00:01:12.750> much<00:01:12.990> Sun<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.290> say<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> tomato<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.270> pepper

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
as much Sun as say a tomato or a pepper

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.100 
as much Sun as say a tomato or a pepper
and<00:01:16.040> then<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.310> plant<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.450> ground<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and then just plant it in the ground and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.320 
and then just plant it in the ground and
firm<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.070> around<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.909> want<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> try<00:01:21.210> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
firm it in around it you want to try to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.240 
firm it in around it you want to try to
keep<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.750> level<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.590> same<00:01:22.740> level<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.159> was

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
keep it level with the same level it was

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.730 
keep it level with the same level it was
planted<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.360> seed<00:01:24.570> starting<00:01:25.080> container

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
planted in your seed starting container

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.260 
planted in your seed starting container
and<00:01:26.040> that's<00:01:26.520> what<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.970> that's<00:01:27.000> how<00:01:27.210> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and that's what and that's how you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.490 
and that's what and that's how you
transplant<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.750> seedling<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:28.259> if<00:01:28.380> you're

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
transplant a seedling now if you're

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.730 
transplant a seedling now if you're
gonna<00:01:28.590> plant<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.100> seed<00:01:29.840> then<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.350> want<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
gonna plant a seed then you just want to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.240 
gonna plant a seed then you just want to
dig<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> little<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> hole<00:01:33.799> about<00:01:34.799> half<00:01:35.100> an

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
dig a little bit of a hole about half an

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490 
dig a little bit of a hole about half an
inch<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.759> an<00:01:36.210> inch<00:01:36.420> deep<00:01:36.689> depending<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.320> how

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
inch to an inch deep depending on how

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.100 
inch to an inch deep depending on how
cold<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.040> where<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.909> then<00:01:39.869> just

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
cold it is where you are and then just

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.780 
cold it is where you are and then just
cover<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.829> that's<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.369> takes

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
cover it up and that's all it takes

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.760 
cover it up and that's all it takes
remember<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:43.049> plant<00:01:43.290> them<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.530> little

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
remember you can plant them a little

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770 
remember you can plant them a little
further<00:01:43.979> apart<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.820> each<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.600> them

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
further apart because each one of them

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.649 
further apart because each one of them
has<00:01:46.110> at<00:01:46.979> least<00:01:47.280> six<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.670> eight<00:01:47.729> seeds<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.540> it

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
has at least six to eight seeds in it

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.120 
has at least six to eight seeds in it
and<00:01:48.869> you're<00:01:49.229> gonna<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> thin<00:01:49.890> those

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and you're gonna have to thin those

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.920 
and you're gonna have to thin those
anyway<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:50.670> go<00:01:51.180> ahead<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.509> plant<00:01:51.750> them<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
anyway so go ahead and plant them a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.660 
anyway so go ahead and plant them a
little<00:01:52.110> bit<00:01:52.229> further<00:01:52.439> apart<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.159> within

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
little bit further apart and within

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
little bit further apart and within
about<00:01:53.880> 60<00:01:54.420> days<00:01:54.630> you'll<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:54.990> yourself<00:01:55.590> some

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
about 60 days you'll have yourself some

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.620 
about 60 days you'll have yourself some
beets<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.310> eat<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.700> they<00:01:57.299> are<00:01:57.390> definitely

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
beets to eat and they are definitely
