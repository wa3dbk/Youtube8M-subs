got those weird orange filter on it so

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.470 
got those weird orange filter on it so
you<00:00:46.410> basically<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.610> divide<00:00:47.850> between<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.270> new

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
you basically can divide between the new

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.350 
you basically can divide between the new
ones<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.710> older<00:00:49.950> ones<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.239> can

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
ones and the older ones you can you can

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.450 
ones and the older ones you can you can
drive<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.930> older<00:00:52.559> cars<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.250> new

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
drive all the older cars on the new

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.850 
drive all the older cars on the new
tracks<00:00:53.760> hence<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.809> select<00:00:55.110> them<00:00:55.230> there<00:00:55.440> so

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
tracks hence I can select them there so

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.740 
tracks hence I can select them there so
