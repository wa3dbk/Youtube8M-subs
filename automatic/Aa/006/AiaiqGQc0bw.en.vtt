00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.000

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.450
 you want to collect four 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.450
 good diamonds this on map and 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:52.059
 and well the case I do not know why I'm 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.059
 looking for this 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:03.500
 it will be that he sold me something for place what I 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.730
 here towards the huave zone can the best 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.050
 what was the introduction 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:12.920
 but we go 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.920
 so that it does not cut 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.260
 here 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.050

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.720
 god who master the stadium match or 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.720
 it would not fly to fall 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.020
 as he pretends that I go, I think that 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.289
 irrigations 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.399
