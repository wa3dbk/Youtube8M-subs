today<00:00:03.980> we're<00:00:04.100> going<00:00:04.190> to<00:00:04.250> discuss<00:00:04.430> how<00:00:04.970> to

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
today we're going to discuss how to

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.839 
today we're going to discuss how to
remove<00:00:05.740> your<00:00:06.740> bearings<00:00:07.250> from<00:00:07.460> your<00:00:07.609> skate

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849

but<00:00:46.129> they're<00:00:46.280> micro<00:00:46.640> bearings<00:00:47.059> therefore

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
but they're micro bearings therefore

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.680 
but they're micro bearings therefore
some<00:00:47.840> of<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:47.989> newer<00:00:48.230> speed<00:00:48.649> skates<00:00:49.359> so<00:00:50.359> a

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
some of the newer speed skates so a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.299 
some of the newer speed skates so a
standard<00:00:50.960> seven<00:00:51.500> or<00:00:51.590> eight<00:00:51.680> millimeter<00:00:52.039> press

standard seven or eight millimeter press

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.060 
standard seven or eight millimeter press
will<00:00:52.609> work<00:00:52.820> for<00:00:53.090> either<00:00:53.239> I<00:00:54.199> tend<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:54.859> like<00:00:55.039> a

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
will work for either I tend to like a

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.380 
will work for either I tend to like a
press<00:00:55.399> that<00:00:55.640> has<00:00:55.850> interchangeable

press side what I will do is I will just

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.039 
press side what I will do is I will just
lightly<00:01:32.119> seat<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:34.040> bearings<00:01:34.460> into<00:01:35.420> here<00:01:35.869> I

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
lightly seat the bearings into here I

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.010 
lightly seat the bearings into here I
will<00:01:36.649> slide<00:01:36.920> them<00:01:37.130> on<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.369> press<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.840> you

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
will slide them on the press and you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.179 
will slide them on the press and you
will<00:01:39.170> give<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.560> light<00:01:39.920> pressure<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:42.189> there

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
will give a light pressure and there

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.060 
will give a light pressure and there
your<00:01:43.430> bearings<00:01:43.759> cutting<00:01:44.720> straight<00:01:45.070> wide

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
your bearings cutting straight wide

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.209 
your bearings cutting straight wide
wheels<00:01:46.689> regardless<00:01:47.689> what<00:01:48.259> I<00:01:48.290> like<00:01:48.560> about<00:01:48.770> the

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
wheels regardless what I like about the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.450 
wheels regardless what I like about the
adjustable<00:01:50.079> press<00:01:51.079> on<00:01:51.380> this<00:01:51.530> side<00:01:51.740> is<00:01:52.009> when

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
adjustable press on this side is when

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.399 
adjustable press on this side is when
you<00:01:52.579> have<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:53.360> nylon<00:01:53.719> inserts<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.350> the

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
you have the nylon inserts and the

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.649 
you have the nylon inserts and the
aluminum<00:01:54.829> inserts<00:01:55.250> if<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:56.060> press<00:01:56.329> too<00:01:56.630> hard

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
aluminum inserts if you press too hard

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.749 
aluminum inserts if you press too hard
if<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.259> press<00:01:57.469> at<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.710> wrong<00:01:57.890> angle<00:01:58.070> you<00:01:58.460> can

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
if you press at the wrong angle you can

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.670 
if you press at the wrong angle you can
damage<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.360> insert<00:01:59.810> effectively<00:02:00.380> ruining

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
damage the insert effectively ruining

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.130 
damage the insert effectively ruining
your<00:02:00.799> wheel<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:01.909> it's<00:02:02.060> nice<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.570> have<00:02:02.750> that

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
your wheel so it's nice to have that

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.930 
your wheel so it's nice to have that
sort<00:02:03.619> of<00:02:03.770> adjustability<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:05.210> simplicity
