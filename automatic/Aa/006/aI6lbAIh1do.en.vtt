00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
supposedly 3 watt to using surface mount

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.440 
supposedly 3 watt to using surface mount
LEDs<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.040> it's<00:00:08.160> got<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.340> ring<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.910> LEDs

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
underneath this typical reflector thing

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.660 
underneath this typical reflector thing
that<00:00:13.380> I've<00:00:13.440> normally<00:00:13.769> be<00:00:13.889> used<00:00:14.070> with<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.280> single

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
that I've normally be used with a single

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.080 
that I've normally be used with a single
high-power<00:00:15.150> LEDs<00:00:15.920> anyway<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.760> take<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.060> bit

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
high-power LEDs anyway to take it a bit

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.510 
high-power LEDs anyway to take it a bit
you<00:00:18.600> unscrew<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.529> end<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:19.920> only<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.250> few

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
you unscrew the end it's only a few

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.179 
you unscrew the end it's only a few
turns<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.060> then<00:00:21.180> suddenly<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.810> just<00:00:22.189> pops

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
turns and then suddenly it just pops

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.130 
turns and then suddenly it just pops
open<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> live<00:00:23.970> circuit<00:00:24.420> board<00:00:24.600> pops<00:00:24.869> out

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
open in the live circuit board pops out

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.279 
open in the live circuit board pops out
so<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.380> don't<00:00:25.529> really<00:00:25.769> want<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.160> trying<00:00:26.490> to

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
so you don't really want to be trying to

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.269 
so you don't really want to be trying to
unscrew<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> screw<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.710> version<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.160> these

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
unscrew the screw and version of these

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.040 
unscrew the screw and version of these
because<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.789> doesn't<00:00:30.179> take<00:00:30.420> much<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:30.689> us<00:00:30.900> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
because it doesn't take much for us to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.530 
because it doesn't take much for us to
come<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.279> inside<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.300> little

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
come to this and inside is this little

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.150 
come to this and inside is this little
reflector<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.170> does<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.620> little<00:00:34.680> hole

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
reflector and does have that little hole

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.979 
reflector and does have that little hole
in<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.340> middle<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.790> designed<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.780> sit

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
in the middle of this designed to sit

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.250 
in the middle of this designed to sit
over<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.590> high<00:00:38.280> power<00:00:38.610> LED<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.600> I'm<00:00:39.870> guessing

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
over a a high power LED so I'm guessing

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.010 
over a a high power LED so I'm guessing
that's<00:00:40.350> where<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.950> was<00:00:41.040> originally<00:00:42.020> intended

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that's where it was originally intended

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.100 
that's where it was originally intended
to<00:00:43.290> be<00:00:43.730> used<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.239> case<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.719> got<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
to be used but in this case it's got a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.200 
to be used but in this case it's got a
little<00:00:46.289> circuit<00:00:46.739> board<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:47.010> little<00:00:47.210> aluminium

supply<00:00:53.070> inside<00:00:53.489> no<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.390> worth<00:00:54.510> noting<00:00:55.020> that

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050

supply inside no it's worth noting that
there<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.739> two<00:00:56.010> holes<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.210> there

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
there are two holes in this and there

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.779 
there are two holes in this and there
are<00:00:57.480> two<00:00:57.899> little<00:00:58.050> standoff<00:00:58.590> pillars<00:00:58.920> which

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
are two little standoff pillars which

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.029 
are two little standoff pillars which
don't<00:01:00.359> line<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.379> okay

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
don't line up but that's okay

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.410 
don't line up but that's okay
that's<00:01:02.489> what<00:01:03.390> happens<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:04.979> another<00:01:05.909> bit<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.270> a

attractive little lamp it looks okay and

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.740 
attractive little lamp it looks okay and
like<00:03:00.639> the<00:03:00.790> other<00:03:00.879> lamp<00:03:01.120> it's<00:03:01.329> quite<00:03:01.540> nice<00:03:01.689> to

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
like the other lamp it's quite nice to

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.830 
like the other lamp it's quite nice to
see<00:03:02.109> that<00:03:02.290> our<00:03:02.409> mininum<00:03:03.599> substrate<00:03:04.599> being

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840

used and for the to keep the LEDs cool
and<00:03:09.489> it's<00:03:09.670> simple<00:03:10.000> enough<00:03:10.269> so<00:03:10.299> really<00:03:10.959> not<00:03:11.829> an

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
and it's simple enough so really not an

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.500 
and it's simple enough so really not an
awful<00:03:12.189> lot<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.430> go<00:03:12.519> wrong<00:03:12.700> this<00:03:12.909> the<00:03:13.090> smoothing

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
awful lot to go wrong this the smoothing

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.089 
awful lot to go wrong this the smoothing
is<00:03:13.599> a<00:03:13.629> nice<00:03:13.780> feature<00:03:14.049> and<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.650> resistor<00:03:15.010> an

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
is a nice feature and the resistor an

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.189 
is a nice feature and the resistor an
output<00:03:15.489> that<00:03:16.030> should<00:03:16.299> get<00:03:16.510> rid<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.989> lot<00:03:17.169> of

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:17.199 
output that should get rid of a lot of

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.530 
output that should get rid of a lot of
the<00:03:17.379> ripple<00:03:17.799> in<00:03:17.889> this<00:03:18.040> yeah<00:03:18.639> neat<00:03:19.060> little<00:03:19.180> lamp

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
the ripple in this yeah neat little lamp

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.080 
the ripple in this yeah neat little lamp
or<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.109> also<00:03:20.319> just<00:03:20.769> totally<00:03:21.340> hackable<00:03:21.730> if<00:03:21.940> you

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
or and also just totally hackable if you

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.869 
or and also just totally hackable if you
gutted<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.720> out<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:24.099> put<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.400> cover<00:03:24.699> and

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
gutted it out and you put this cover and

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.189 
gutted it out and you put this cover and
you<00:03:24.970> could<00:03:25.120> just<00:03:25.329> put<00:03:25.540> anything<00:03:25.810> you<00:03:26.019> liked

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:26.199 
you could just put anything you liked

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.809 
you could just put anything you liked
and<00:03:26.410> there<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.799> could<00:03:26.919> make<00:03:27.400> your<00:03:27.519> own<00:03:27.609> little

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
and there you could make your own little

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.270 
and there you could make your own little
LED<00:03:28.389> arrays<00:03:28.659> up<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.290> quite<00:03:29.620> nice<00:03:29.919> from<00:03:30.069> that

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
LED arrays up so quite nice from that

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.669 
LED arrays up so quite nice from that
aspect
