00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.650
 now giving us to another who is one of the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.880
 basic and is one of the basic 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.920
 truly for us the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.980
 Hispanics I mean the meatballs 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.900
 we can increase some meatballs very 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.080
 easy to make and we will accompany them 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.000
 with a chipotle sauce 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.000
 so check the first thing we need 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 it's ground beef I need to pique a 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 little onion 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:49.180
 with a quarter we remove 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.890
 the chiles 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.900
 You can use a little coriander that 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.300
 will perfume the meat will give flavor 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.520
 also to the same meat 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 of the marinade of chipotle chili 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.300
 new 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.500
 and now instead of bread crushed what 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.420
 we are going to use are oat strings in 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.790
 oat flakes that lead to a 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.790
 processor or blender 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.930
 at the time when the meat 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.300
 will unfold with total ease of 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:27.840
 poles in an area just like it is 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.840
 happening now is the time 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.960
 a little bit of breastfeeding 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.730
 and I started throwing the meatballs 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:42.860
 directly with the palms 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:46.300
 frying pan with high temperatures 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.610
 add a little oil 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.610
 and let's go sealing the meatballs 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.760
 the next step is we need tomatoes 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.110
 cut only the tomatoes in quarters 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.110
 just as I am doing 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.709
 cut a little onion 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:15.550
 garlic cilantro all inside the glass of the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.010
 blender and we are about to make a sauce 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.280
 basic now the simulating that we had 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.280
 mentioned 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.680
 the marinade of chipotle peppers 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.680
 so generous 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.050
 As you know, he likes the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.960
 functional people 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.960
 the recipe now yes black pepper 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.930
 salt and as a liquid medium you can use 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:46.900
 from a chicken broth or background or 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.900
 vegetables or simply water this is the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.540
 basic recipe for a tomato sauce and 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.579
 chipotle lowered fire can you 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.720
 jump a lot of care starts putting 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.700
 little away from your body and then add 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.940
 suddenly the res 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.910
 the laurel we raise the fire now is the 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.610
 moment to raise the fire and we are 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.230
 nothing to serve this wonderful basic 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.230
