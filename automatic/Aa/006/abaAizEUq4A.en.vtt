00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
floor which is going to make the shot

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.709 
floor which is going to make the shot
even<00:03:10.629> harder<00:03:14.730> my<00:03:15.730> followers<00:03:16.209> best<00:03:16.540> as

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.280 

he<00:03:32.520> finally<00:03:32.910> stops<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.510> starts<00:03:33.660> packing<00:03:34.020> at

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
he finally stops and starts packing at

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.949 
he finally stops and starts packing at
the<00:03:34.440> meal<00:03:35.040> on<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.340> floor<00:03:35.580> but<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.599> means<00:03:36.750> his

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
the meal on the floor but it means his

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.780 
the meal on the floor but it means his
head<00:03:37.170> keeps<00:03:37.500> popping<00:03:37.980> up<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.250> down<00:03:38.430> up<00:03:38.670> and
