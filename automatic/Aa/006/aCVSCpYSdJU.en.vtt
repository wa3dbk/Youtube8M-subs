but it worked so that's how my character
climbed<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:23.280> first<00:05:23.790> rung<00:05:24.090> of<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.390> career

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
climbed the first rung of the career

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.210 
climbed the first rung of the career
ladder<00:05:25.050> by<00:05:25.680> trying<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.610> suck<00:05:27.090> up<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:27.420> the<00:05:27.660> boss

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
ladder by trying to suck up to the boss

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.340 
ladder by trying to suck up to the boss
