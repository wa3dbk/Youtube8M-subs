00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
too great but just imagine um the

just<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.730> take<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.210> this<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:01.510> more<00:03:01.720> or<00:03:01.810> less

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
just to take and this is more or less

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.370 
just to take and this is more or less
how<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.650> tank<00:03:03.340> would<00:03:03.610> actually<00:03:04.120> move<00:03:04.330> you<00:03:05.260> know

how a tank would actually move you know

the same no matter where I go just the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
only thing that changes are is the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.240 
only thing that changes are is the
direction<00:03:22.570> more<00:03:23.080> or<00:03:23.170> less<00:03:23.230> so<00:03:23.410> i<00:03:23.440> could<00:03:23.709> let<00:03:24.160> me

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
direction more or less so i could let me

direction more or less so i could let me
try<00:03:24.430> running<00:03:24.760> around<00:03:25.030> here<00:03:25.270> so<00:03:25.510> maybe<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:25.870> get

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
try running around here so maybe you get

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.960 
try running around here so maybe you get
a<00:03:26.020> better<00:03:26.140> sense<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.590> what<00:03:27.070> i<00:03:27.100> what<00:03:27.880> i'm

controls<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:33.850> just<00:03:33.970> take<00:03:34.300> more<00:03:34.930> or<00:03:35.020> less<00:03:35.170> for

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
controls I it just take more or less for

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.140 
controls I it just take more or less for
the<00:03:36.010> most<00:03:36.160> part<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.400> just<00:03:36.550> takes<00:03:36.670> getting<00:03:36.790> used

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
the most part it just takes getting used

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.240 
the most part it just takes getting used
to<00:03:37.300> to<00:03:38.140> get<00:03:38.260> used<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.440> tanker<00:03:38.709> chose<00:03:38.890> this<00:03:39.070> not

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
to to get used to tanker chose this not

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.090 
to to get used to tanker chose this not
it's<00:03:39.610> not<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:39.790> huge<00:03:40.000> deal<00:03:40.090> at<00:03:40.480> all<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:41.050> is<00:03:41.739> weird

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
it's not a huge deal at all it is weird

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.140 
it's not a huge deal at all it is weird
but<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:43.500> don't<00:03:44.500> know<00:03:44.560> probably<00:03:44.950> now<00:03:45.190> now<00:03:45.970> it

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
but I don't know probably now now it

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.810 
but I don't know probably now now it
would<00:03:46.239> probably<00:03:46.480> be<00:03:46.690> a<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:48.280> will<00:03:48.400> probably<00:03:48.670> be

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
would probably be a it will probably be

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.850 
would probably be a it will probably be
weird<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.330> for<00:03:49.720> somebody<00:03:50.019> who<00:03:50.200> is<00:03:50.470> used<00:03:50.769> to

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
weird to for somebody who is used to

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.110 
weird to for somebody who is used to
monitor<00:03:51.010> games<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.459> go<00:03:51.580> back<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:51.850> take<00:03:52.000> the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
monitor games to go back to take the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.840 
monitor games to go back to take the
shows<00:03:52.300> but<00:03:52.450> me<00:03:52.630> being<00:03:53.080> that<00:03:53.140> I<00:03:53.230> grew<00:03:53.500> up<00:03:53.530> on<00:03:53.950> on

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
shows but me being that I grew up on on

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.820 
shows but me being that I grew up on on
these<00:03:55.060> games<00:03:55.330> it's<00:03:55.600> really<00:03:55.810> not<00:03:55.959> a<00:03:56.230> huge<00:03:56.590> deal

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
these games it's really not a huge deal

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.340 
these games it's really not a huge deal
but<00:03:57.610> if<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.180> compare<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.510> any<00:03:58.750> modern<00:03:59.140> game

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
but if you compare to any modern game

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.320 
but if you compare to any modern game
you'll<00:03:59.620> of<00:03:59.920> course<00:03:59.950> you'll<00:04:00.280> notice<00:04:00.550> moving

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
you'll of course you'll notice moving

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.970 
you'll of course you'll notice moving
backwards<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.959> character<00:04:02.290> or<00:04:02.440> Bobby<00:04:02.650> fate

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
backwards the character or Bobby fate

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.280 
backwards the character or Bobby fate
probably<00:04:03.550> face<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.300> camera<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:04.870> move

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
probably face the camera and move

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.820 
probably face the camera and move
backwards<00:04:05.890> and<00:04:06.570> moving<00:04:07.570> forward<00:04:08.320> will<00:04:08.440> be<00:04:08.560> a

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
backwards and moving forward will be a

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.770 
backwards and moving forward will be a
moving<00:04:09.130> side<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.400> side<00:04:09.550> will<00:04:09.880> probably<00:04:10.269> way

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
moving side to side will probably way

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.800 
moving side to side will probably way
more<00:04:10.810> human-like<00:04:11.820> than<00:04:12.820> it<00:04:12.940> is<00:04:13.060> right<00:04:13.090> now<00:04:13.330> it

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
more human-like than it is right now it

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.430 
more human-like than it is right now it
would<00:04:14.050> not<00:04:14.260> just<00:04:14.650> be<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:15.760> know<00:04:15.910> imagine<00:04:16.440> Jill

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
would not just be you know imagine Jill

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.990 
would not just be you know imagine Jill
just<00:04:17.680> being<00:04:17.950> a<00:04:18.040> tank<00:04:18.280> right<00:04:18.459> now<00:04:18.640> and<00:04:18.820> that's

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
just being a tank right now and that's

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.409 
just being a tank right now and that's
more<00:04:19.479> or<00:04:19.539> less<00:04:19.630> Oh<00:04:19.930> what<00:04:20.830> you<00:04:20.979> get<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.400> know<00:04:22.120> I

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
more or less Oh what you get I know I

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.210 
more or less Oh what you get I know I
know<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:22.780> probably<00:04:22.960> didn't<00:04:23.229> do<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.440> too<00:04:23.979> great

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
know I probably didn't do it too great

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.020 
know I probably didn't do it too great
of<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.400> job<00:04:24.430> at<00:04:24.789> this

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
of a job at this

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.820 
of a job at this
I<00:04:25.060> tried<00:04:25.389> I<00:04:25.570> just<00:04:25.780> figured<00:04:26.020> it<00:04:26.139> would<00:04:26.290> be<00:04:26.320> way

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
I tried I just figured it would be way

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.400 
I tried I just figured it would be way
better<00:04:27.100> if<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.520> showed<00:04:28.000> you<00:04:28.210> on<00:04:28.630> what<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.139> meant

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
better if I showed you on what I meant

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.940 
better if I showed you on what I meant

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
by ten controls as opposed to try to

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.190 
by ten controls as opposed to try to
explain<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:33.580> because<00:04:33.669> really<00:04:34.300> explaining<00:04:35.020> it

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
explain it because really explaining it

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.379 
explain it because really explaining it
