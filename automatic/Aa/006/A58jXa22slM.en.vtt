00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
I straighten my roots because they were

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.850 
I straighten my roots because they were
really<00:00:50.879> curly<00:00:51.329> before<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> even<00:00:52.320> started

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
really curly before I even started

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.670 
really curly before I even started
curling<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.719> as<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.170> see<00:00:55.350> I'm<00:00:55.500> low

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
curling it so as you can see I'm low

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.010 
curling it so as you can see I'm low
drying<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.160> right<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.000> now<00:00:57.420> I'm<00:00:57.629> taking

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
drying it right there and now I'm taking

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.990 
drying it right there and now I'm taking
my<00:00:58.050> one-inch<00:00:58.500> Conair<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.219> think<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.699> one<00:00:59.820> inch

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
my one-inch Conair I think it's one inch

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.779 
my one-inch Conair I think it's one inch
and<00:01:00.359> I'm<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.559> going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.829> section<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.430> off<00:01:02.579> I

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and I'm just going to section it off I

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.579 
and I'm just going to section it off I
do<00:01:02.850> about<00:01:03.030> three<00:01:03.359> or<00:01:03.449> four<00:01:03.629> sections<00:01:04.140> because

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
do about three or four sections because

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.929 
do about three or four sections because
my<00:01:04.739> hair<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:04.979> pretty<00:01:05.129> short<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.760> have

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
my hair is pretty short and I have

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.980 
my hair is pretty short and I have
layers<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.350> easier<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.960> there<00:01:09.960> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
layers so it's just easier and there I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.920 
layers so it's just easier and there I
am<00:01:10.140> shaking<00:01:10.350> my<00:01:10.530> head<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.479> curl

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
am shaking my head I'm going to curl

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.450 
am shaking my head I'm going to curl
every<00:01:13.350> other<00:01:13.680> curl<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.159> different

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
every other curl in a different

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.600 
every other curl in a different
direction<00:01:14.659> so<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.770> see<00:01:16.830> I'm<00:01:17.220> doing

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
direction so as you can see I'm doing

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.520 
direction so as you can see I'm doing
this<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.939> towards<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> back<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.380> I'm

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
this one towards the back and then I'm

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.590 
this one towards the back and then I'm
going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.950> do<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.430> next<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:20.880> towards<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
going to do the next one towards the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.109 
going to do the next one towards the
front<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.070> creates<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
front and what this creates is just a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.810 
front and what this creates is just a
more<00:01:24.509> effortless<00:01:25.140> look<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.400> curls<00:01:26.700> will

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
more effortless look and the curls will

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.450 
more effortless look and the curls will
be<00:01:26.909> less<00:01:27.150> uniform<00:01:27.689> they<00:01:27.869> won't<00:01:28.080> kind<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.100> mesh

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
be less uniform they won't kind of mesh

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.190 
be less uniform they won't kind of mesh
into<00:01:29.850> each<00:01:29.970> other<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.659> when<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.930> shake

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
into each other so that when you shake

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.260 
into each other so that when you shake
it<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.470> it'll<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.920> more<00:01:32.610> wild<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.000> it'll

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
it out it'll be more wild and it'll

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.630 
it out it'll be more wild and it'll
create<00:01:33.420> more<00:01:33.840> volume<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:35.549> I'm

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
create more volume so that is what I'm

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.649 
create more volume so that is what I'm
doing<00:01:36.030> there<00:01:36.570> as<00:01:37.460> I<00:01:38.460> get<00:01:38.700> towards<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> top

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
doing there as I get towards the top

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.289 
doing there as I get towards the top
which<00:01:40.049> you're<00:01:40.229> about<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.710> see<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.670> find<00:01:42.150> my

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
which you're about to see I just find my

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.870 
which you're about to see I just find my
natural<00:01:42.689> part<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.250> towards<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> crown<00:01:44.610> area

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
natural part and towards the crown area

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.030 
natural part and towards the crown area
I<00:01:45.180> continue<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.560> backwards

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
I continue going in the backwards

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.149 
I continue going in the backwards
forwards<00:01:47.549> direction<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.270> my<00:01:48.299> curls<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
forwards direction with my curls but the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.210 
forwards direction with my curls but the
closer<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.640> get<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.090> my<00:01:51.450> bang<00:01:51.720> area<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.409> do

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
closer I get to my bang area I just do

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.280 
closer I get to my bang area I just do
it<00:01:53.340> backwards<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.450> flows<00:01:54.869> rather

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it backwards so that it flows rather

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.030 
it backwards so that it flows rather
than<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.280> curls<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.969> my<00:01:57.090> face<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:58.040> I

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
than the curls going in my face and I

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.770 
than the curls going in my face and I
just<00:01:59.250> find<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.790> looks<00:01:59.969> better<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.540> as<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
just find that it looks better so as you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.630 
just find that it looks better so as you
can<00:02:00.899> see<00:02:00.960> I'm<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.290> doing<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:02.250> towards<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
can see I'm just doing one towards the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.310 
can see I'm just doing one towards the
front<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> rest<00:02:03.780> I'm<00:02:03.899> going<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.170> doing

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
front but the rest I'm going to be doing

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.260 
front but the rest I'm going to be doing
towards<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> back<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.430> my<00:02:05.579> bangs<00:02:05.790> flow

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
towards the back so that my bangs flow

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.839 
towards the back so that my bangs flow
towards<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.200> back<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:08.250> could<00:02:08.340> also<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.729> this

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
towards the back you could also do this

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.050 
towards the back you could also do this
with<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> flatiron<00:02:09.420> if<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.849> Flatiron<00:02:11.849> it

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
with a flatiron if you just Flatiron it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.339 
with a flatiron if you just Flatiron it
up

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
up

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.959 
up
and<00:02:12.439> back<00:02:12.769> but<00:02:13.219> I<00:02:13.249> like<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.609> do<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.849> with<00:02:13.939> a

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:13.969 
and back but I like to do it with a

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.330 
and back but I like to do it with a
curling<00:02:14.329> iron<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.650> reason<00:02:15.890> why<00:02:15.980> I'm<00:02:16.129> only

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
curling iron and the reason why I'm only

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.309 
curling iron and the reason why I'm only
using<00:02:16.549> a<00:02:16.760> one-inch<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.389> not<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.540> bigger<00:02:17.870> one<00:02:18.139> is

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
using a one-inch and not a bigger one is

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.170 
using a one-inch and not a bigger one is
because<00:02:18.739> when<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.010> have<00:02:19.069> shorter<00:02:19.579> hair<00:02:19.609> your

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
because when you have shorter hair your

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.360 
because when you have shorter hair your
hair<00:02:20.209> doesn't<00:02:20.719> take<00:02:21.109> as<00:02:21.349> well<00:02:21.680> with<00:02:21.980> larger

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
hair doesn't take as well with larger

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.550 
hair doesn't take as well with larger
barrels<00:02:22.819> so<00:02:23.569> that's<00:02:23.749> why<00:02:23.930> I'm<00:02:24.109> using<00:02:24.260> this

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
barrels so that's why I'm using this

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.619 
barrels so that's why I'm using this
small<00:02:24.829> one<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:25.280> here<00:02:25.609> I<00:02:25.639> am<00:02:25.730> just<00:02:26.180> curling<00:02:26.480> my
