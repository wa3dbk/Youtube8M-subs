cat this is one of the quadrants that
we've<00:00:02.820> been<00:00:03.120> monitoring<00:00:03.510> since<00:00:03.840> our<00:00:03.990> last

visit Italy so what spots coming up at
the<00:00:06.000> moment<00:00:06.390> well<00:00:07.290> we've<00:00:07.500> got<00:00:07.529> plenty<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.460> very

the moment well we've got plenty a very
very<00:00:09.150> tiny<00:00:09.510> ground<00:00:10.019> ivy<00:00:10.500> parents<00:00:10.920> coming<00:00:11.160> up

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
very tiny ground ivy parents coming up

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.089 
very tiny ground ivy parents coming up
and<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.360> know<00:00:12.420> from<00:00:12.719> previous<00:00:12.990> years<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.980> a

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
and I know from previous years that in a

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.770 
and I know from previous years that in a
couple<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.400> months<00:00:14.580> time<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.210> be<00:00:15.240> seeing

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
couple of months time is to be seeing

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.290 
couple of months time is to be seeing
purple<00:00:16.020> flowers<00:00:16.770> but<00:00:17.460> then<00:00:17.640> they<00:00:17.820> die<00:00:18.060> off

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
purple flowers but then they die off

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.170 
purple flowers but then they die off
right<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.410> get<00:00:19.619> wood<00:00:20.250> sage<00:00:20.520> popping<00:00:21.029> up

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
right and you get wood sage popping up

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.679 
right and you get wood sage popping up
over<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.720> above<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.199> ground<00:00:22.410> ivy<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.850> quite

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
over and above the ground ivy it's quite

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.189 
over and above the ground ivy it's quite
a<00:00:24.720> lot<00:00:24.990> taller<00:00:25.939> now<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.000> collected<00:00:27.539> would<00:00:27.869> say

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
a lot taller now we collected would say

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.730 
a lot taller now we collected would say
seeds<00:00:28.859> last<00:00:29.369> time<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.789> were<00:00:29.939> here<00:00:30.439> so<00:00:31.439> direct

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
seeds last time we were here so direct

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.590 
seeds last time we were here so direct
this<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> good<00:00:32.189> place<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.910> try<00:00:33.239> out<00:00:33.390> some

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
this is a good place to try out some

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.990 
this is a good place to try out some
planting<00:00:34.110> well<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.559> know<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.890> grows<00:00:35.130> here<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
planting well we know it grows here and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.959 
planting well we know it grows here and
we<00:00:36.120> also<00:00:36.270> know<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.170> small<00:00:37.469> balls

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
we also know that we have small balls

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.760 
we also know that we have small balls
right<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.120> means<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.660> may<00:00:39.870> doze<00:00:40.079> exactly

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
right that means you may doze exactly

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.410 
right that means you may doze exactly
and<00:00:40.890> we're<00:00:41.070> hoping<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> pull<00:00:41.790> those<00:00:42.000> off<00:00:42.210> as

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and we're hoping to pull those off as

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.229 
and we're hoping to pull those off as
they<00:00:42.540> come<00:00:42.840> along<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:44.070> give<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.550> wood<00:00:44.940> sage

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
they come along to give the wood sage

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.080 
they come along to give the wood sage
and<00:00:45.629> other<00:00:45.809> plants<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.260> chance<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:47.090> provide

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
and other plants a chance to provide

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.060 
and other plants a chance to provide
more<00:00:48.329> ground<00:00:48.629> cover<00:00:48.930> hopefully<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.829> better

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
more ground cover hopefully be better

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.049 
more ground cover hopefully be better
able<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.940> compete<00:00:51.559> rapidly<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.739> alien<00:00:53.489> small

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
able to compete rapidly and alien small

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.869 
able to compete rapidly and alien small
balls<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:55.440> are<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.920> try<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.160> keep

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
balls right we are going to try and keep

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.650 
balls right we are going to try and keep
a<00:00:57.149> lid<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.920> keep<00:00:58.920> pulling<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.660> so

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
a lid on that keep pulling it up so

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.029 
a lid on that keep pulling it up so
hopefully<00:01:00.840> badly<00:01:01.320> some<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.680> might<00:01:01.859> have

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
hopefully badly some of this might have

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.070 
hopefully badly some of this might have
to<00:01:02.160> keep<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.460> down<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:03.059> should<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.600> theory

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
to keep it down it should do in theory

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.219 
to keep it down it should do in theory
but<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:05.040> found<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.930> even

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
but I have found that it can it even

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.920 
but I have found that it can it even
grows<00:01:07.650> above<00:01:08.100> Bracken<00:01:08.729> there's<00:01:09.150> some<00:01:09.510> Bracken

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
grows above Bracken there's some Bracken

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.050 
grows above Bracken there's some Bracken
up<00:01:10.049> there<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.560> was<00:01:10.920> astonished<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.430> see<00:01:11.640> that

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
up there I was astonished to see that

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210 
up there I was astonished to see that
the<00:01:12.510> small<00:01:12.780> balsam<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.380> actually<00:01:13.710> grow<00:01:13.890> quite

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the small balsam can actually grow quite

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.490 
the small balsam can actually grow quite
big<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.700> poke<00:01:14.909> its<00:01:15.119> head<00:01:15.180> not<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.930> small<00:01:16.229> ball

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
big and poke its head not so small ball

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.789 
big and poke its head not so small ball
so<00:01:16.770> no<00:01:17.430> but<00:01:17.640> i<00:01:17.790> think<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.650> get

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
so no but i think if we if we can get

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.520 
so no but i think if we if we can get
these<00:01:20.040> growing<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.659> keep<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.020> small<00:01:22.290> bowls

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
these growing and keep the small bowls

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920 
these growing and keep the small bowls
of<00:01:22.770> out<00:01:23.070> okay<00:01:24.000> i<00:01:24.030> mean<00:01:24.150> i've<00:01:24.270> got<00:01:24.450> some<00:01:24.659> seed

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
of out okay i mean i've got some seed

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.109 
of out okay i mean i've got some seed
husks<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.560> lots<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.860> seeds<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.759> think

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
husks but lots of seeds in here I think

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.050 
husks but lots of seeds in here I think
it's<00:01:27.270> virtually<00:01:27.659> impossible<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.320> separate

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
it's virtually impossible to separate

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.630 
it's virtually impossible to separate
and<00:01:30.060> we<00:01:30.090> scarify<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.810> soil<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.799> yes<00:01:32.100> so

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
and we scarify the soil we have yes so

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.760 
and we scarify the soil we have yes so
what<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.000> scatter<00:01:33.240> them<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.600> ah<00:01:33.780> yes<00:01:34.350> because

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
what just scatter them in ah yes because

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.320 
what just scatter them in ah yes because
that's<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:35.340> would<00:01:35.490> normally<00:01:35.640> happen

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
that's what would normally happen

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:44.060 
that's what would normally happen
nature<00:01:36.780> yeah

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.680 

so<00:01:44.550> we're<00:01:44.700> actually<00:01:44.820> planting<00:01:45.390> sort<00:01:45.630> of

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
so we're actually planting sort of

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.230 
so we're actually planting sort of
mixture<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.200> seeds<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.740> husks

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.300 

so<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.990> how<00:01:54.229> would<00:01:54.380> these<00:01:54.500> seeds<00:01:54.799> normally<00:01:55.189> be

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
so the how would these seeds normally be

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.280 
so the how would these seeds normally be
distributed<00:01:55.880> there<00:01:56.030> but<00:01:56.210> they<00:01:56.299> just<00:01:56.509> drop<00:01:57.170> out

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
distributed there but they just drop out

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.560 
distributed there but they just drop out
drop<00:01:57.680> out<00:01:57.829> of<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.430> plant<00:01:58.729> as<00:01:58.970> far<00:01:59.210> as<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.509> can

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
drop out of the plant as far as I can

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.490 
drop out of the plant as far as I can
tell<00:01:59.750> yes<00:02:00.439> Nicholas<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:02.119> just<00:02:02.420> found<00:02:02.630> some<00:02:03.020> on

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
tell yes Nicholas you just found some on

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.929 
tell yes Nicholas you just found some on
yeah<00:02:04.040> on<00:02:04.759> an<00:02:04.880> old<00:02:05.090> flower<00:02:05.390> spike<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:07.430> looks

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
yeah on an old flower spike and it looks

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.609 
yeah on an old flower spike and it looks
that<00:02:08.149> looks<00:02:08.599> as<00:02:08.780> if<00:02:08.810> most<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.289> them<00:02:09.440> still

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
that looks as if most of them still

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.520 
that looks as if most of them still
there<00:02:09.950> anyway<00:02:10.399> so<00:02:10.880> i<00:02:11.599> think<00:02:11.750> we<00:02:12.080> are<00:02:12.110> actually

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
there anyway so i think we are actually

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.130 
there anyway so i think we are actually
doing<00:02:13.010> pretty<00:02:13.819> much<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.269> same<00:02:14.599> as<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.900> flag

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
doing pretty much the same as the flag

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.199 
doing pretty much the same as the flag
would<00:02:15.380> anyway<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:16.610> just<00:02:16.849> that<00:02:16.910> we're

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
would anyway it's just that we're

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:24.640 
would anyway it's just that we're
planting<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.959> few<00:02:18.140> more<00:02:21.340> small<00:02:22.340> balsam<00:02:22.760> yes<00:02:23.650> so

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
planting a few more small balsam yes so

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.880 
planting a few more small balsam yes so
they<00:02:24.769> should<00:02:24.800> start<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.340> sprout<00:02:25.610> when<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:26.890> I

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
they should start to sprout when I I

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.949 
they should start to sprout when I I
really<00:02:28.459> don't<00:02:28.670> know<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:29.090> would<00:02:29.360> say<00:02:29.600> if<00:02:29.840> we

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
really don't know I would say if we

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.350 
really don't know I would say if we
could<00:02:30.110> get<00:02:30.230> some<00:02:30.470> rain<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:31.030> whether<00:02:32.030> it

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
could get some rain and whether it

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.860 
could get some rain and whether it
should<00:02:32.390> be<00:02:33.880> great<00:02:34.880> gonna<00:02:35.360> come<00:02:35.510> back<00:02:35.630> after

as<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:49.879> sort<00:02:50.239> of<00:02:50.299> backup<00:02:50.569> i'm<00:02:50.989> also<00:02:51.170> going<00:02:51.530> to

as a sort of backup i'm also going to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.860 
as a sort of backup i'm also going to
plant<00:02:51.980> some<00:02:52.340> at<00:02:52.640> least<00:02:52.700> II<00:02:53.060> didn't<00:02:53.420> see<00:02:53.450> tray

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
plant some at least II didn't see tray

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.420 
plant some at least II didn't see tray
of<00:02:54.049> home<00:02:54.260> I'm<00:02:55.220> taking<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:55.670> bit<00:02:55.819> of<00:02:55.849> a<00:02:56.030> soil<00:02:56.239> home

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
of home I'm taking a bit of a soil home

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.430 
of home I'm taking a bit of a soil home
so<00:02:58.430> if<00:02:58.790> this<00:02:59.120> doesn't<00:02:59.540> work<00:02:59.690> we<00:03:00.049> should<00:03:00.260> have

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
so if this doesn't work we should have

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.800 
so if this doesn't work we should have
some<00:03:00.650> seedlings<00:03:01.129> that<00:03:01.459> when<00:03:02.180> they<00:03:02.269> go<00:03:02.450> into<00:03:02.659> as

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
some seedlings that when they go into as

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.759 
some seedlings that when they go into as
a<00:03:02.959> reasonable<00:03:03.530> size<00:03:03.739> plug<00:03:04.250> plants<00:03:05.769> and

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
a reasonable size plug plants and

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.440 
a reasonable size plug plants and
that'll<00:03:07.040> be<00:03:07.159> more<00:03:07.310> controlled<00:03:07.700> intensity<00:03:08.269> may

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
that'll be more controlled intensity may

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.539 
that'll be more controlled intensity may
well<00:03:08.720> with<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.170> really<00:03:09.409> yes<00:03:09.950> it'll<00:03:10.190> be<00:03:10.370> much

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
well with it really yes it'll be much

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.759 
well with it really yes it'll be much
more<00:03:10.579> control<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.239> give<00:03:11.690> them<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.959> head<00:03:12.110> start<00:03:12.140> I

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
more control to give them a head start I

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:19.420 
more control to give them a head start I
know<00:03:12.829> it's<00:03:13.099> not<00:03:13.250> totally<00:03:13.909> natural<00:03:18.430> whatever

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
know it's not totally natural whatever

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.450 
know it's not totally natural whatever
it<00:03:19.640> takes<00:03:19.879> yes
