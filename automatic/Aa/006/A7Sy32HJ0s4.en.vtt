00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
 I feel a little obliged to talk about France 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.220
 It was really fun, really 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.340
 There is only one thing - every meal during the day is EXCLUSIVELY important for the French, 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.580
 except breakfast. For some reason 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.920
 at lunch and dinner, we all sat together at the table as a real family and talked 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.660
 But at breakfast everyone was ... 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.740
 Here's a croissant! Ok, let's go 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.640
 Well, breakfast is just the most important meal of the day 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.800
 I was going to joke about how the French have a whole cheesy section in supermarkets, 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.860
 but I realized that at home we have a whole section of candy and ice cream 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.060
 Whatever. 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.600
 We went to the Louvre, which was really astonishing 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.040
 They had great paintings by famous artists. 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.460
 They had the famous statue without hands, 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.340
 had the deluxe rooms in which people had apparently once lived 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.340
 and perhaps the most famous picture of the world - Mona Lisa 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420
 The room was very crowded 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.700
 And just behind Mona Lisa, there was this super high picture that probably took twenty years to do. 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.480
 The frame of the picture was as wide as my body. 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.240
 But were there crowds to photograph this picture? 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.740
 NO. 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.080
 I do not even know what it is called. 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.320
 The American school system has failed me once again. 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.120
 And as a person who likes to paint, it was very cool to see the unique colors and details. 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.500
 Also, I made a bunch of asshole shots! 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.300
 Look, this is the famous hands-free! 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.880
 Look at the butt! 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.120
 So, I was doing well, but then we went to the Picasso Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.000
 and one more 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.580
 I forgot his name. 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.680
 It was something French. 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.020
 It was strange to be in these places, like someone who likes to paint animations 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.520
 "Oh, I like the colors, they're pretty good, 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.500
 and o paint a face on this side of the head. 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.400
 It is - 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.200
 This is an interesting ... design? " 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.520
 But I have to draw the line somewhere, Picasso. 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.160
 I mean, just look at this! 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.640
 Why is it framed? 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.420
 Someone - 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.640
 Someone has framed this. 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.900
 Picasso was a good artist, 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.820
 security is better than me, 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.600
 so why did they put these things on display? 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.380
 Would you call this his best job? 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.920
 So not just Picasso, look at the Museum of Modern Art. 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.740
 My favorite picture was a black ring. 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.200
 In fact, I liked so much that I painted it on my phone, 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.400
 and maybe I spent more time and reflection than the real artist! 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.960
 I'm not saying that the more realistic the picture is, the more artistic it is 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.360
 Oh, wait, that's what I say 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.740
 I mean, look at my drawings, 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.800
 (no, seriously, look at them) 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.120
 Their heads are super-round and so white that they can not dance anymore. 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.600
 If I was an art contest against Leonardo da Vinci, 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.220
 he would have won! 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.760
 Because his works require talent, it's not easy to paint something that looks exactly like it really is 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.900
 But animations? 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.880
 They are easy. 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.920
 They are extremely easy. 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.440
 And I know that I leave paintings with colored patterns and shapes, 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.800
 and after seeing this, I figured out something called the Keith Haring principle, 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.700
 to help people like me understand better modern art. 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.200
 In the late 1970s, a man named Keith Haring painted graffiti on subway stations that had a unique design. 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.860
 Every time he started painting a graphite, he did not think about what the final product would be. 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.660
 He just painted what he felt. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Eventually he has made hundreds of graffiti 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.980
 and people began to notice the unique characters 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.660
 Soon, he had become more and more popular and popular 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.660
 Now you can buy T-shirts and glasses of his works. 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.860
 And I think this is really cool. 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.240
 I would wear his interesting designs, but 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.200
 Are they a museum? 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.220
 No. 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.140
 Keith has made thousands of these small, simple drawings. 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.380
 They are still art, 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.520
 but artists do not have to pay to see them. 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.300
 They have to pay to wear and drink from them. 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.260
 And by the way, these things are by no means tested, so I'm talking blindly at the moment 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.420
 But I think Picasso, and this picture of a circle, should be on T-shirts or children's books or even web comics. 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.240
 So people will say, "Hey, I like your blouse." 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.800
 "Thank you, I love design and I will never put it in a frame and hang it on my wall."
