bright orange color I just wanted to see

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.610 
bright orange color I just wanted to see
how<00:03:06.400> similar<00:03:06.639> it's<00:03:07.120> only<00:03:07.299> 10<00:03:07.510> feet<00:03:07.540> let<00:03:08.350> me<00:03:08.410> see

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
how similar it's only 10 feet let me see

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.590 
how similar it's only 10 feet let me see
how<00:03:08.739> similar<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.250> was<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.609> duck<00:03:09.940> brands<00:03:10.269> or

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
how similar it was to duck brands or

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.840 
how similar it was to duck brands or
it's<00:03:11.139> actually<00:03:11.680> quite<00:03:11.889> a<00:03:12.010> bit<00:03:12.190> different<00:03:12.340> so

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
it's actually quite a bit different so

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.460 
it's actually quite a bit different so
I'm<00:03:12.970> pretty<00:03:13.239> satisfied<00:03:13.480> with<00:03:13.989> that<00:03:14.139> but<00:03:14.380> I'm

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
I'm pretty satisfied with that but I'm

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.319 
I'm pretty satisfied with that but I'm
gonna<00:03:14.560> have<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.889> use<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.010> sparingly<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:16.299> I

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
gonna have to use it sparingly and so I

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.710 
gonna have to use it sparingly and so I
can<00:03:16.540> manage<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.139> go<00:03:17.260> back<00:03:17.470> there<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.799> get<00:03:17.950> more

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
can manage to go back there and get more

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.349 
can manage to go back there and get more
then<00:03:19.720> they<00:03:19.989> have<00:03:20.230> 10<00:03:20.920> yard<00:03:21.160> rolls<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.609> tape<00:03:21.790> for

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
then they have 10 yard rolls of tape for

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.720 
then they have 10 yard rolls of tape for
a<00:03:22.420> dollar<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.170> they<00:03:23.560> have<00:03:23.829> black<00:03:24.340> white<00:03:24.700> and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
a dollar and they have black white and

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.870 
a dollar and they have black white and
red<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.359> is<00:03:25.930> like<00:03:26.170> it's<00:03:26.950> called<00:03:27.340> tool<00:03:27.700> bench

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
red it is like it's called tool bench

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.420 
red it is like it's called tool bench
hardware<00:03:28.799> 10<00:03:29.799> yards<00:03:30.160> it's<00:03:30.639> really<00:03:30.880> thin<00:03:31.299> like

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
hardware 10 yards it's really thin like

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.500 
hardware 10 yards it's really thin like
so<00:03:33.430> i'll<00:03:33.549> probably<00:03:33.760> only<00:03:33.970> use<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.299> for<00:03:34.329> like

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
so i'll probably only use it for like

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.140 
so i'll probably only use it for like
