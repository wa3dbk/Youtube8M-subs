elbow or a kipping pull-up okay that's

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.380 
elbow or a kipping pull-up okay that's
primarily<00:03:02.160> what<00:03:02.370> we<00:03:02.519> see<00:03:02.730> on<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:02.970> bar<00:03:03.150> and

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
primarily what we see on the bar and

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.420 
primarily what we see on the bar and
that's<00:03:03.569> what<00:03:03.720> we<00:03:04.200> want<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.500> steer<00:03:05.010> clear<00:03:05.040> from

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
that's what we want to steer clear from

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.759 
that's what we want to steer clear from
and<00:03:06.300> that's<00:03:06.540> that's<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.959> big<00:03:07.110> inhibitor<00:03:07.650> in

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
and that's that's a big inhibitor in

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.370 
and that's that's a big inhibitor in
terms<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.160> getting<00:03:08.940> better<00:03:09.090> at<00:03:09.630> this<00:03:10.140> type<00:03:10.350> of
