00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.180 

and<00:02:21.709> this<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.160> just<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.520> compare<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:24.620> size<00:02:24.890> and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
and this is just to compare the size and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.650 
and this is just to compare the size and
the<00:02:25.310> stems<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.880> how<00:02:25.970> much<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.330> ended<00:02:26.569> up

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
the stems and how much it ended up

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.960 
the stems and how much it ended up
swelling<00:02:27.280> compared<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.550> flowers<00:02:28.940> that

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
swelling compared to the flowers that

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.670 
swelling compared to the flowers that
were<00:02:29.330> not<00:02:29.540> pollinated<00:02:30.670> now<00:02:31.670> here<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.930> view

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
were not pollinated now here is a view

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
were not pollinated now here is a view
of<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:36.610> full<00:02:37.610> innopolis<00:02:37.940> flower<00:02:39.370> from<00:02:40.370> behind

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
of the full innopolis flower from behind

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.590 
of the full innopolis flower from behind
and<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.660> can<00:02:41.810> see<00:02:41.989> that<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.260> stem<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:44.239> ridges

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
and you can see that the stem the ridges

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.540 
and you can see that the stem the ridges
are<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.780> little<00:02:44.989> bit<00:02:45.110> more<00:02:45.319> apparent<00:02:45.590> because

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
are a little bit more apparent because

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.750 
are a little bit more apparent because
the<00:02:46.880> stem<00:02:47.150> has<00:02:47.300> swollen<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:50.470> hope<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:52.280> the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
the stem has swollen and I hope that the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.530 
the stem has swollen and I hope that the
plant<00:02:53.030> continues<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:54.319> grow
