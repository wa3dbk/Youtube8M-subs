can't get better than that so another

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.980 
can't get better than that so another
thing<00:02:53.160> about<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.700> nature's<00:02:54.060> fruits<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.630> that

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
thing about the nature's fruits is that

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.120 
thing about the nature's fruits is that
they<00:02:55.710> are<00:02:56.190> taking<00:02:56.970> care<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.210> your<00:02:57.420> your

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130

antioxidants antioxidants are very

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.200 
antioxidants antioxidants are very
crucial<00:03:01.530> because<00:03:02.130> they<00:03:02.280> actually<00:03:02.460> will

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
crucial because they actually will

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.920 
crucial because they actually will
combat<00:03:03.810> or<00:03:03.990> they'll<00:03:04.110> fight<00:03:05.360> they<00:03:06.360> will<00:03:06.540> fight

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930

free<00:03:07.530> radicals<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:08.250> free<00:03:09.000> radical<00:03:09.420> damage<00:03:09.450> now

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
free radicals so free radical damage now

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.510 
free radicals so free radical damage now
if<00:03:10.440> you're<00:03:10.590> unfamiliar<00:03:11.070> with<00:03:11.190> free<00:03:11.490> radicals

if you're unfamiliar with free radicals

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.120 
if you're unfamiliar with free radicals
free<00:03:12.390> radicals<00:03:12.810> are<00:03:12.930> actually<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.500> pathway

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
free radicals are actually the pathway

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.310 
free radicals are actually the pathway
to<00:03:15.030> cancer<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.110> heart<00:03:16.470> disease<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:17.040> strokes<00:03:17.490> to

to cancer to heart disease to strokes to
aging<00:03:19.320> so<00:03:19.920> with<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.490> I've<00:03:21.330> created<00:03:21.540> this

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
aging so with that I've created this

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.270 
aging so with that I've created this
little<00:03:22.020> guy<00:03:22.700> mister<00:03:23.700> free<00:03:24.150> radical<00:03:25.280> that's

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
little guy mister free radical that's

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.320 
little guy mister free radical that's
him<00:03:26.580> so<00:03:27.240> pretty<00:03:28.170> much<00:03:28.260> free<00:03:29.010> radicals<00:03:29.490> the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
him so pretty much free radicals the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.600 
him so pretty much free radicals the
antioxidants<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.230> nature's<00:03:31.530> fruits<00:03:31.860> watch

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
this so to dumb it down that's pretty

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.920 
this so to dumb it down that's pretty
