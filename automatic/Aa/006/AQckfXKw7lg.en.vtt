 I am Flemish you are a craftsman 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.040
 sculptor for a very long time in the 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.600
 little shock the states of the first elected 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.699
 if you install in the world 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.769
 it started how your business 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.589
 it started with the development that 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:45.170
 come place from 79 neighborhood 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.640

 I had the opportunity to come 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.120
 meet because he was looking for the sculptor 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.190
 to have a shop of champlain 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.409
 so that way I had 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.720
 the opportunity in a small local because me 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.979
 I had finished my studies at the school of 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.890
 sculpture of saint jean port pretty 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.449
 and then it's an opportunity the dr launched 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.540
 my career officially condemned on 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.939
 screw with the sculpture with this thing 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.950
 is from lima we have near you here the 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.590
 first cultures actually that you have 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.560
 do you train 34 34 hours in this corner 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.470
 that was actually done 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.390
 sculptures here these two pieces that I have 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.860
 did when I was in second grade at 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.479
 the sculpture school of these people when 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.850
 I read the sculptures here 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.460
 I would call a space and that represents 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.650
 a character are going to the future and 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.080
 who takes space a character who 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.060
 seems confident and challenging and then who 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.800
 is confident of him to go to 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.110
 the future is here well there would be like 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.040
 a sculpture garden with 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.930
 beautiful family forms 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.520
 both are carved and has been 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.810
 then actually it's more than 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.370
 thirty years they are made at the level 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.960
 of the matter precisely is it 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.659
 still not bad hand you it depends 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.220
 structures in fact I am 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.680
 specialized in structure his taste in 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.930
 the main material is wood a 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.900

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.360
 which is inspiring 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.759
