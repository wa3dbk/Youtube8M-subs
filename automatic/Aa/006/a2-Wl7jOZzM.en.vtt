00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
back at the town that you started in and

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.640 
back at the town that you started in and
then<00:06:26.220> once<00:06:26.520> you<00:06:26.580> equip<00:06:26.880> it<00:06:27.110> you<00:06:28.110> can<00:06:28.410> basically

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
then once you equip it you can basically

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.700 
then once you equip it you can basically
fly<00:06:29.690> anywhere<00:06:30.690> you<00:06:30.840> want<00:06:31.050> in<00:06:31.140> the<00:06:31.200> game<00:06:31.230> it

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
fly anywhere you want in the game it

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.440 
fly anywhere you want in the game it
makes<00:06:31.980> getting<00:06:32.220> the<00:06:32.490> green<00:06:32.700> capsules<00:06:33.210> a<00:06:33.270> lot

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
makes getting the green capsules a lot

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.440 
makes getting the green capsules a lot
easier<00:06:33.840> and<00:06:34.430> it's<00:06:35.430> probably<00:06:36.090> it's<00:06:36.330> not

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
easier and it's probably it's not

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.170 
easier and it's probably it's not
necessarily<00:06:36.990> faster<00:06:37.380> than<00:06:37.470> riding<00:06:37.770> a<00:06:37.830> horse

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
necessarily faster than riding a horse

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.800 
necessarily faster than riding a horse
but<00:06:39.180> it's<00:06:39.720> more<00:06:39.930> fun<00:06:40.220> so<00:06:41.540> there<00:06:42.540> you<00:06:42.660> go<00:06:42.780> guys
