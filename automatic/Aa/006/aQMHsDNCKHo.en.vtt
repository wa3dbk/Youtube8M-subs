fire rocket stove I have about same

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.960 
fire rocket stove I have about same
amount<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.369> wood<00:00:20.840> dry<00:00:21.840> wood<00:00:22.109> from<00:00:22.980> same<00:00:23.250> branch

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
amount of wood dry wood from same branch

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.800 
amount of wood dry wood from same branch
I<00:00:24.000> wanted<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.930> see<00:00:25.199> which<00:00:25.650> still<00:00:26.449> will<00:00:27.449> perform

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
I wanted to see which still will perform

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.710 
I wanted to see which still will perform
better<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.470> know<00:00:28.920> they're<00:00:29.279> not<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.609> same<00:00:29.820> maybe

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
better I know they're not the same maybe

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.959 
better I know they're not the same maybe
the<00:00:30.960> better<00:00:31.170> comparison<00:00:31.679> will<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:32.099> against

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the better comparison will be against

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.910 
the better comparison will be against
the<00:00:33.149> solo<00:00:33.450> stove<00:00:33.840> vs.<00:00:35.149> by<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> light<00:00:36.890> but<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the solo stove vs. by a light but I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.420 
the solo stove vs. by a light but I
don't<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> stove<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.829> wanted<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.219> see

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
don't have the stove and I wanted to see

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.860 
don't have the stove and I wanted to see
which<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:42.590> these<00:00:43.590> two<00:00:43.890> will<00:00:44.160> perform<00:00:44.460> better

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
which of these two will perform better

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.330 
which of these two will perform better
so<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> wanted<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.530> which<00:00:46.800> one<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.100> these

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
so I wanted to see which one of these

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.139 
so I wanted to see which one of these
two<00:00:47.610> will<00:00:47.940> take<00:00:47.969> less<00:00:48.780> wood<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.879> which<00:00:50.879> one

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
two will take less wood and which one

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.410 
two will take less wood and which one
will<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.329> fastest<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.850> way<00:00:53.850> I'm<00:00:54.030> going<00:00:54.390> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
will be fastest and the way I'm going to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.130 
will be fastest and the way I'm going to
do<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.320> soon<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.980> cotton<00:00:56.670> ball

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
do it is as soon as the cotton ball

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.450 
do it is as soon as the cotton ball
lights<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:59.690> am<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> time<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
lights up I am going to time it for the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.910 
lights up I am going to time it for the
bio<00:01:02.730> lights<00:01:03.120> though<00:01:03.510> I'm<00:01:04.110> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> take<00:01:04.739> this

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
bio lights though I'm going to take this

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.630 
bio lights though I'm going to take this
pile<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.670> chop<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.659> into<00:01:06.900> smaller<00:01:07.320> pieces

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
pile and chop it up into smaller pieces

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.600 
pile and chop it up into smaller pieces
so<00:01:08.640> they<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:08.909> fit<00:01:09.180> inside<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.610> violet

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
so they can fit inside of that violet

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.200 
so they can fit inside of that violet
stove<00:01:11.990> for<00:01:12.990> rocket<00:01:13.439> stove<00:01:13.909> I'm<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.150> to

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
stove for rocket stove I'm going to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.719 
stove for rocket stove I'm going to
leave<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:16.040> but<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.580> be

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
leave it as it is but it's going to be

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.820 
leave it as it is but it's going to be
about<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> same<00:01:18.330> amount<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.930> wood<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.619> each

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
about the same amount of wood for each

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.090 
about the same amount of wood for each
stove<00:01:20.689> okay<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.900> got<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> fire<00:01:22.500> started

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
stove okay so I got the fire started

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.920 
stove okay so I got the fire started
it<00:01:23.250> took<00:01:23.430> about<00:01:23.580> maybe<00:01:23.729> three<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.330> these<00:01:24.659> ah

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
it took about maybe three of these ah

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.990 
it took about maybe three of these ah
sticks

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.960 

okay<00:01:34.000> so<00:01:34.060> we<00:01:34.690> have<00:01:34.870> a<00:01:34.900> boil<00:01:35.400> about<00:01:36.400> thirteen

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
okay so we have a boil about thirteen

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.360 
okay so we have a boil about thirteen
and<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.180> half<00:01:37.210> minutes<00:01:38.460> from<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.940> time<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.360> lit

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
and a half minutes from the time I lit

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.430 
and a half minutes from the time I lit
cotton<00:01:42.370> ball<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.410> timing<00:01:44.620> boiled<00:01:46.229> much<00:01:47.229> on

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
cotton ball to the timing boiled much on

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.300 
cotton ball to the timing boiled much on
yourself<00:01:51.690> so<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:52.750> use<00:01:53.110> maybe<00:01:53.380> about<00:01:53.710> four<00:01:54.070> or

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
yourself so I use maybe about four or

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.380 
yourself so I use maybe about four or
five<00:01:54.580> sticks<00:01:55.000> from<00:01:55.990> this<00:01:56.200> pile<00:01:56.940> maybe<00:01:57.940> halfway

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
five sticks from this pile maybe halfway

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.690 
five sticks from this pile maybe halfway
gone<00:01:59.160> to<00:02:00.160> this<00:02:00.280> pile<00:02:00.580> maybe<00:02:00.850> even<00:02:01.119> less<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.640> I

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
gone to this pile maybe even less so I

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.060 
gone to this pile maybe even less so I
start<00:02:04.030> about<00:02:04.240> this<00:02:04.450> much<00:02:04.740> finish<00:02:05.740> with<00:02:05.890> this

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
start about this much finish with this

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.410 
start about this much finish with this
about<00:02:06.850> eight<00:02:07.060> minutes<00:02:07.509> into<00:02:07.690> this<00:02:07.900> process

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
about eight minutes into this process

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.600 
about eight minutes into this process
the<00:02:10.420> fire<00:02:10.690> stopped<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.130> had<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.430> take

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
the fire stopped so I had to take

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.060 
the fire stopped so I had to take
another<00:02:12.910> stick<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:13.989> break<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.560> in<00:02:14.620> half<00:02:14.650> and

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
another stick and break it in half and

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.580 
another stick and break it in half and
put<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.430> here<00:02:15.760> it's<00:02:16.600> taking<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.050> part<00:02:17.320> of

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
put it in here it's taking the part of

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.210 
put it in here it's taking the part of
the<00:02:18.070> stove<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:19.080> put<00:02:20.080> another<00:02:20.470> couple<00:02:20.860> sticks

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.940 
the stove and put another couple sticks
in<00:02:21.520> I'm<00:02:22.330> not<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.510> big<00:02:22.750> deal<00:02:23.020> but<00:02:23.320> one<00:02:23.739> of<00:02:23.830> the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
in I'm not a big deal but one of the

reason<00:02:24.190> why<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.370> like<00:02:24.730> where<00:02:25.000> rocket<00:02:25.360> stove<00:02:25.630> is

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
reason why I like where rocket stove is

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.440 
reason why I like where rocket stove is
because<00:02:27.130> I'm<00:02:27.430> gonna<00:02:27.640> have<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:27.940> take<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.209> part

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
because I'm gonna have to take the part

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.740 
because I'm gonna have to take the part
out<00:02:29.280> okay<00:02:30.280> I<00:02:30.310> got<00:02:30.780> rocket<00:02:31.780> stove<00:02:32.050> lit<00:02:33.750> it's

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
out okay I got rocket stove lit it's

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.430 
out okay I got rocket stove lit it's
been<00:02:34.989> already<00:02:35.200> about<00:02:35.680> two<00:02:36.459> minutes<00:02:37.440> follow

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
been already about two minutes follow

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.620

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
minutes into the boiling process in the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.680 
minutes into the boiling process in the
rocket<00:02:43.690> stove<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.760> fire<00:02:46.030> was<00:02:46.450> not<00:02:47.070> going<00:02:48.070> good

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
rocket stove the fire was not going good

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.320 
rocket stove the fire was not going good
I<00:02:49.799> started<00:02:50.799> I<00:02:51.280> wanted<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.820> start<00:02:52.090> with<00:02:52.239> the

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
I started I wanted to start with the

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.090 
I started I wanted to start with the
same<00:02:52.570> amount<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:52.959> food<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.350> use<00:02:53.590> for<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.890> bio

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
same amount of food I use for the bio

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.979 
same amount of food I use for the bio
lifestyle<00:02:54.670> which<00:02:54.940> is<00:02:55.060> about<00:02:55.269> three<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:55.810> a

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
lifestyle which is about three and a

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.740 
lifestyle which is about three and a
half<00:02:56.019> sticks<00:02:56.700> maybe<00:02:57.700> about<00:02:57.910> this<00:02:58.180> size<00:02:58.480> or

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
half sticks maybe about this size or

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.220 
half sticks maybe about this size or
smaller<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.330> wasn't<00:03:01.600> really<00:03:01.780> going<00:03:01.930> to

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
smaller but it wasn't really going to

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.920 
smaller but it wasn't really going to
him<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:03.010> mean<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.430> was<00:03:03.519> burning<00:03:03.940> but<00:03:04.120> not<00:03:04.360> as

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
him I mean it was burning but not as

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.150 
him I mean it was burning but not as
good<00:03:05.170> as<00:03:05.290> now<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:08.320> what<00:03:08.709> I've<00:03:08.860> done<00:03:09.100> is

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
good as now and so what I've done is

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.280 
good as now and so what I've done is
I've<00:03:09.850> used<00:03:10.120> up<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.570> rest<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.989> sticks

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
I've used up the rest of the sticks

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.210 
I've used up the rest of the sticks
maybe<00:03:11.650> left<00:03:11.950> one<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.989> then<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.560> fire<00:03:14.799> is<00:03:15.040> just

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
maybe left one and then the fire is just

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.850 
maybe left one and then the fire is just
started<00:03:15.459> burning<00:03:15.640> really<00:03:16.150> good<00:03:16.480> it's<00:03:17.470> burning

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
started burning really good it's burning

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.940 
started burning really good it's burning
really<00:03:18.130> well<00:03:18.510> but<00:03:19.510> from<00:03:19.780> my<00:03:19.930> experience<00:03:19.959> it

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
really well but from my experience it

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.710 
really well but from my experience it
you<00:03:21.220> know<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.459> does<00:03:21.640> really<00:03:22.000> take<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.390> little

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
you know it does really take a little

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.069 
you know it does really take a little
bit<00:03:22.930> more<00:03:22.989> wood<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:25.150> start<00:03:25.450> going<00:03:25.660> on<00:03:25.840> disk

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
bit more wood to start going on disk

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.910 
bit more wood to start going on disk
this<00:03:26.380> well<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.730> for<00:03:27.940> comparison<00:03:28.660> this<00:03:29.590> is<00:03:29.650> what

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
this well so for comparison this is what

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.030 
this well so for comparison this is what
I<00:03:29.950> have<00:03:30.160> left<00:03:30.480> from<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.660> bio<00:03:31.840> by<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.560> light

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
I have left from the bio by a light

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.420 
I have left from the bio by a light
stove<00:03:33.519> file<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:35.560> is<00:03:35.709> what<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.100> left<00:03:36.280> from

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
stove file this is what I have left from

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.250 
stove file this is what I have left from
rocket<00:03:36.820> stove

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
rocket stove

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.089 
rocket stove
okay<00:03:39.260> I<00:03:39.530> got<00:03:39.739> a<00:03:39.769> boil<00:03:40.069> in<00:03:40.310> 29<00:03:40.879> minutes<00:03:45.099> nice

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
okay I got a boil in 29 minutes nice

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.390 
okay I got a boil in 29 minutes nice
rolling<00:03:46.819> boil<00:03:47.799> but<00:03:48.799> as<00:03:49.069> far<00:03:49.370> as<00:03:49.400> efficiency<00:03:49.849> I

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
rolling boil but as far as efficiency I

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.390 
rolling boil but as far as efficiency I
had<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.549> use<00:03:52.700> all<00:03:52.879> of<00:03:53.030> my<00:03:53.060> food<00:03:53.330> I<00:03:54.220> think<00:03:55.220> both

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
had to use all of my food I think both

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.170 
had to use all of my food I think both
are<00:03:55.430> great<00:03:55.819> stoves<00:03:56.950> both<00:03:57.950> serve<00:03:58.340> different

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
are great stoves both serve different

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
are great stoves both serve different
