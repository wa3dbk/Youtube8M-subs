00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.050 

what<00:00:00.870> I<00:00:01.079> have<00:00:01.410> here<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:01.979> problem<00:00:02.310> involving

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
what I have here is a problem involving

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.900 
what I have here is a problem involving
a<00:00:03.270> hydrated<00:00:04.110> salt<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:05.040> in<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.310> case<00:00:05.609> its

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
a hydrated salt and in this case its

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.430 
a hydrated salt and in this case its
hydrated<00:00:07.429> be<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> co2<00:00:08.880> which<00:00:09.599> i<00:00:09.809> think<00:00:09.870> is

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
hydrated be a co2 which i think is

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.220 
hydrated be a co2 which i think is
barium<00:00:11.690> chloride<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:14.660> why<00:00:15.660> i've<00:00:15.750> been<00:00:15.809> given

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
barium chloride and why i've been given

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.070 
barium chloride and why i've been given
her<00:00:16.379> as<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.529> percentage<00:00:17.010> by<00:00:17.430> mass<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.779> water

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
her as a percentage by mass of the water

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.550 
her as a percentage by mass of the water
and<00:00:19.760> so<00:00:20.760> i<00:00:21.090> need<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.449> find<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> formula<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
and so i need to find the formula of the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.769 
and so i need to find the formula of the
hydrated<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.980> hydrated<00:00:26.580> da<00:00:26.789> co2<00:00:27.359> contains

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
hydrated so so hydrated da co2 contains

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.450 
hydrated so so hydrated da co2 contains
fourteen<00:00:28.289> point<00:00:28.680> seven<00:00:29.039> four<00:00:29.490> percent<00:00:30.019> h2o<00:00:31.460> by

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
fourteen point seven four percent h2o by

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.970 
fourteen point seven four percent h2o by
mass<00:00:32.730> find<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.570> formula<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.380> hydrated

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
mass find the formula of the hydrated

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.810 
mass find the formula of the hydrated
salt<00:00:36.559> so<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.860> slightly<00:00:38.010> different<00:00:38.309> from

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
salt so this is slightly different from

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.209 
salt so this is slightly different from
the<00:00:38.910> last<00:00:39.239> question<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:41.030> it's<00:00:42.030> comparable<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
the last question and it's comparable to

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.900 
the last question and it's comparable to
the<00:00:44.219> questions<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.539> did<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.579> finding<00:00:47.579> out<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the questions I did on finding out the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.299 
the questions I did on finding out the
molar<00:00:48.180> mass<00:00:48.539> well<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.320> relative<00:00:49.710> atomic<00:00:50.010> mass

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
molar mass well the relative atomic mass

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.420 
molar mass well the relative atomic mass
from<00:00:50.640> from<00:00:51.270> given<00:00:51.660> percentage<00:00:52.160> abundances<00:00:53.160> by

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
from from given percentage abundances by

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.979 
from from given percentage abundances by
mass<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:55.969> so<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> first<00:00:57.270> thing<00:00:57.570> I'm<00:00:57.690> going<00:00:57.870> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
mass and so the first thing I'm going to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.709 
mass and so the first thing I'm going to
do<00:00:58.170> has<00:00:58.379> assumed<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.879> sample<00:01:00.359> which<00:01:00.510> I'm

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
do has assumed that the sample which I'm

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
do has assumed that the sample which I'm
going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> calculate<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.829> from<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:03.110> 100<00:01:04.110> 100

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
going to calculate it from is 100 100

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.859 
going to calculate it from is 100 100
grams<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.189> total<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.600> weighs<00:01:06.840> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
grams in total and if it weighs a

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.750 
grams in total and if it weighs a
hundred<00:01:07.439> grams<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.830> total<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.310> means<00:01:08.520> in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
hundred grams in total that means in

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.200 
hundred grams in total that means in
that<00:01:09.000> sample<00:01:09.470> I'm<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.460> fourteen

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
that sample I'm going to have fourteen

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.060 
that sample I'm going to have fourteen
point<00:01:12.600> seven<00:01:12.869> four<00:01:13.229> grams<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.799> h2o<00:01:14.509> so

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
point seven four grams of h2o so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:27.320 
point seven four grams of h2o so
fourteen<00:01:19.820> point<00:01:20.820> seven<00:01:21.600> four<00:01:22.259> grams<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:24.619> h2o

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
fourteen point seven four grams of h2o

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.730 
fourteen point seven four grams of h2o
and<00:01:27.420> now<00:01:28.080> also<00:01:28.380> means<00:01:28.800> that<00:01:28.890> my<00:01:29.490> mass<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.740> paco2

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and now also means that my mass of paco2

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.410 
and now also means that my mass of paco2
is<00:01:32.220> gonna<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:34.670> one<00:01:35.670> hundred<00:01:36.260> minus<00:01:37.260> fourteen

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
is gonna be one hundred minus fourteen

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.090 
is gonna be one hundred minus fourteen
point<00:01:39.420> seven<00:01:39.750> four<00:01:40.200> which<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.680> equal<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:43.100> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
point seven four which is equal to the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.730 
point seven four which is equal to the
region<00:01:44.460> minus<00:01:44.820> fourteen<00:01:45.720> point<00:01:46.230> seven<00:01:46.530> four

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
region minus fourteen point seven four

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.640 
region minus fourteen point seven four
eighty<00:01:49.740> five<00:01:50.220> point<00:01:50.490> two<00:01:50.700> six<00:01:52.010> eighty<00:01:53.010> five

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
eighty five point two six eighty five

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.460 
eighty five point two six eighty five
point<00:01:55.650> two<00:01:56.010> six<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:59.060> so<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.960> would<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
point two six and so this would be the

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.260 
point two six and so this would be the
mass<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.920> vco2<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.940> this<00:02:03.120> hydrated<00:02:03.720> compound

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
mass of vco2 in this hydrated compound

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.320 
mass of vco2 in this hydrated compound
and<00:02:06.270> hydrated<00:02:06.840> salt<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:08.880> so<00:02:10.040> this<00:02:11.040> is<00:02:11.280> a

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
and hydrated salt and so this is a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.390 
and hydrated salt and so this is a
massive<00:02:12.330> flaw<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.560> need<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.130> do<00:02:17.250> is

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
massive flaw and now I need to do is

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.460 
massive flaw and now I need to do is
find<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.910> molar<00:02:18.210> ratio<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:21.020> this<00:02:22.020> ratio<00:02:22.410> I

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
find the molar ratio and this ratio I

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.530 
find the molar ratio and this ratio I
couldn't<00:02:22.770> get<00:02:22.950> now<00:02:23.160> by<00:02:23.580> working<00:02:23.880> out<00:02:24.270> the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
couldn't get now by working out the

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.080 
couldn't get now by working out the
number<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.930> moles<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.290> each<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.740> these<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.370> so

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
number of moles of each of these and so

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.670 
number of moles of each of these and so
first<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.540> need<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.810> divide<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.260> fourteen

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
first I need to divide the fourteen

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.500 
first I need to divide the fourteen
point<00:02:29.010> seven<00:02:29.190> four<00:02:29.550> by<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.790> molar<00:02:30.240> mass<00:02:30.360> of

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
point seven four by the molar mass of

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.370 
point seven four by the molar mass of
water<00:02:30.890> which<00:02:31.890> we<00:02:32.130> know<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.400> be<00:02:32.610> 16<00:02:33.450> plus<00:02:34.020> two

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
water which we know to be 16 plus two

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.030 
water which we know to be 16 plus two
which<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.890> eighteen<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:37.260> we<00:02:37.410> divide<00:02:37.770> this

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
which is eighteen and so we divide this

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.440 
which is eighteen and so we divide this
by<00:02:38.180> eighteen<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:40.550> when<00:02:41.550> we<00:02:41.700> divide<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:42.390> by

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
by eighteen and when we divide this by

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.500 
by eighteen and when we divide this by
eighteen<00:02:43.230> we'd<00:02:43.560> get<00:02:43.890> therefore<00:02:45.230> n<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:47.730> equal

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
eighteen we'd get therefore n is equal

00:02:48.510 --> 00:03:03.979 
eighteen we'd get therefore n is equal
to

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:15.410 

0.819<00:03:06.930> 0.819<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.830> this<00:03:12.220> would<00:03:12.370> be<00:03:12.580> in<00:03:12.760> modes

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.360 

now<00:03:16.420> we<00:03:16.480> can<00:03:16.840> do<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.140> same<00:03:17.319> for<00:03:17.590> this<00:03:17.799> but<00:03:18.190> we

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
now we can do the same for this but we

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.770 
now we can do the same for this but we
need<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.700> work<00:03:18.879> out<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.239> molar<00:03:19.480> mass<00:03:19.750> of

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
need to work out the molar mass of

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.009 
need to work out the molar mass of
barium<00:03:20.709> chloride<00:03:20.980> first<00:03:21.579> and<00:03:22.360> so<00:03:22.629> we<00:03:22.750> can<00:03:22.900> do

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
barium chloride first and so we can do

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.720 
barium chloride first and so we can do
that<00:03:23.170> with<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.379> periodic<00:03:23.829> table<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:24.220> we<00:03:24.579> need

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
that with the periodic table so we need

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.640 
that with the periodic table so we need
to<00:03:24.879> add<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.239> relative<00:03:26.079> atomic<00:03:26.290> mass<00:03:26.620> of

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
to add the relative atomic mass of

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.229 
to add the relative atomic mass of
barium<00:03:28.980> so<00:03:29.980> where's<00:03:30.159> that<00:03:30.310> PA

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:41.360 

one<00:03:34.239> hundred<00:03:34.599> and<00:03:34.660> forty<00:03:35.049> seven<00:03:35.260> point<00:03:35.739> three

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.130 

so<00:03:42.370> one<00:03:42.579> hundred<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:43.030> forty<00:03:43.480> seven<00:03:43.690> point

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
so one hundred and forty seven point

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.670 
so one hundred and forty seven point
three<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:47.010> then<00:03:48.010> we<00:03:48.190> add<00:03:48.370> this<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:49.230> two<00:03:50.230> times

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
three and then we add this to two times

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.280 
three and then we add this to two times
the<00:03:51.220> relative<00:03:52.180> atomic<00:03:52.659> mass<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:53.079> chlorine

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
the relative atomic mass of chlorine

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.619 
the relative atomic mass of chlorine
which<00:03:53.590> i<00:03:53.739> think<00:03:53.799> is<00:03:54.099> thirty<00:03:54.579> five<00:03:54.940> point<00:03:55.239> five

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
which i think is thirty five point five

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:01.530 
which i think is thirty five point five
yep

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:15.600 

and<00:04:02.140> excuse<00:04:02.769> us

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:25.879 

this<00:04:16.610> gives<00:04:16.880> us<00:04:17.030> two<00:04:17.270> hundred<00:04:17.420> and<00:04:17.830> 8.3

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.809 

and<00:04:26.430> now<00:04:26.789> we<00:04:26.849> have<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.629> molar<00:04:28.319> mass<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:28.819> the

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
and now we have the molar mass of the

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:35.110 
and now we have the molar mass of the
barium<00:04:30.569> chloride<00:04:30.810> this<00:04:31.229> tool<00:04:31.560> enables<00:04:31.740> me<00:04:34.039> and

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
barium chloride this tool enables me and

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.700 
barium chloride this tool enables me and
so<00:04:36.120> now<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.360> need<00:04:36.599> to<00:04:36.840> do<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.050> divide<00:04:37.349> the<00:04:37.469> mass

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
so now I need to do is divide the mass

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.920 
so now I need to do is divide the mass
which<00:04:38.099> I<00:04:38.219> have<00:04:38.370> here<00:04:38.729> by<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:39.509> molar<00:04:39.840> mass

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
which I have here by the molar mass

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.610 
which I have here by the molar mass
which<00:04:40.289> I<00:04:40.469> have<00:04:40.590> here<00:04:41.719> using<00:04:42.719> number<00:04:43.349> of<00:04:43.439> mole

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
which I have here using number of mole

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.270 
which I have here using number of mole
equals<00:04:44.129> mass<00:04:44.460> divided<00:04:45.060> by<00:04:45.210> molar<00:04:45.840> mass<00:04:46.139> and<00:04:46.620> so

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
equals mass divided by molar mass and so

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.510 
equals mass divided by molar mass and so
the<00:04:47.310> molar<00:04:47.909> mass<00:04:48.210> I<00:04:48.419> get<00:04:48.750> from<00:04:49.650> I<00:04:49.949> mean<00:04:50.219> the

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
the molar mass I get from I mean the

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.270 
the molar mass I get from I mean the
number<00:04:50.819> of<00:04:50.879> moles<00:04:51.090> I<00:04:51.240> get<00:04:51.419> from<00:04:51.599> dividing

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
number of moles I get from dividing

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.070 
number of moles I get from dividing
eighty<00:04:53.280> five<00:04:53.759> point<00:04:54.240> two<00:04:54.479> six<00:04:55.110> by<00:04:57.080> children

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
eighty five point two six by children

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:15.420 
eighty five point two six by children
eight<00:04:58.409> point<00:04:58.770> three<00:04:58.889> is

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:26.320 

0.41<00:05:20.350> 0.41<00:05:24.010> now<00:05:25.010> this<00:05:25.580> is<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:25.910> barium

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
0.41 0.41 now this is the barium

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.720 
0.41 0.41 now this is the barium
chloride<00:05:26.540> and<00:05:27.050> in<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.710> formula<00:05:28.340> of<00:05:28.520> a

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
chloride and in the formula of a

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.120 
chloride and in the formula of a
hydrated<00:05:29.360> so<00:05:29.600> the<00:05:30.020> formula<00:05:30.530> would<00:05:30.680> usually<00:05:30.890> be

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
hydrated so the formula would usually be

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.920 
hydrated so the formula would usually be
represented<00:05:31.970> in<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.300> form<00:05:32.510> be<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:33.680> CL<00:05:34.610> 2<00:05:35.510> and

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
represented in the form be a CL 2 and

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.410 
represented in the form be a CL 2 and
Olivia<00:05:36.350> dot<00:05:36.710> here<00:05:37.070> and<00:05:37.520> then<00:05:37.730> I<00:05:37.760> would<00:05:37.880> have<00:05:38.060> X

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
Olivia dot here and then I would have X

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.720 
Olivia dot here and then I would have X
we<00:05:38.720> don't<00:05:38.930> know<00:05:39.020> X<00:05:39.290> here<00:05:39.560> and<00:05:39.650> an<00:05:39.950> X<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.520> I

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
we don't know X here and an X and I

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.520 
we don't know X here and an X and I
would<00:05:40.910> have<00:05:41.090> h2o<00:05:42.640> and<00:05:43.930> because<00:05:44.930> of<00:05:44.960> that<00:05:45.110> I'm

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
would have h2o and because of that I'm

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.440 
would have h2o and because of that I'm
going<00:05:45.770> to<00:05:45.860> take<00:05:46.100> this<00:05:46.370> which<00:05:46.910> is<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:47.180> number

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
going to take this which is the number

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.580 
going to take this which is the number
of<00:05:47.540> moles<00:05:47.750> of<00:05:49.420> barium<00:05:50.420> the<00:05:51.110> Berryville

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
of moles of barium the Berryville

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.250 
of moles of barium the Berryville
chloride<00:05:51.950> in<00:05:52.220> 100<00:05:52.850> grams<00:05:52.880> and<00:05:53.420> this<00:05:53.990> is<00:05:54.110> number

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
chloride in 100 grams and this is number

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.290 
chloride in 100 grams and this is number
of<00:05:54.410> moles<00:05:54.470> of<00:05:54.770> h2<00:05:55.010> and<00:05:55.370> on<00:05:55.490> you<00:05:55.610> I'm<00:05:55.970> gonna<00:05:56.120> put

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
of moles of h2 and on you I'm gonna put

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.130 
of moles of h2 and on you I'm gonna put
the<00:05:56.450> barium<00:05:56.780> chloride<00:05:56.960> Mo's<00:05:57.680> on<00:05:58.040> this<00:05:58.280> side

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
the barium chloride Mo's on this side

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.900 
the barium chloride Mo's on this side
are<00:06:00.140> you<00:06:00.260> like<00:06:00.680> this<00:06:00.980> so<00:06:01.250> I'm<00:06:01.340> going<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:01.640> put<00:06:01.850> it

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
are you like this so I'm going to put it

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.070 
are you like this so I'm going to put it
here<00:06:02.120> zero<00:06:02.690> point<00:06:03.490> forward<00:06:04.490> and<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:05.690> moles<00:06:05.930> of

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
here zero point forward and the moles of

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.900 
here zero point forward and the moles of
water<00:06:06.350> h2o<00:06:07.130> I'm<00:06:07.310> going<00:06:07.550> on<00:06:07.820> this<00:06:08.030> side<00:06:08.240> so

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
water h2o I'm going on this side so

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.510 
water h2o I'm going on this side so
0.819<00:06:10.910> and<00:06:11.480> now<00:06:12.200> I'm<00:06:12.560> going<00:06:12.860> to<00:06:12.980> do<00:06:13.160> is<00:06:13.250> divide

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
0.819 and now I'm going to do is divide

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.110 
0.819 and now I'm going to do is divide
both<00:06:13.580> values<00:06:14.360> by<00:06:14.980> 0.4<00:06:15.980> one<00:06:16.220> so<00:06:16.490> that<00:06:16.640> the

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
both values by 0.4 one so that the

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.370 
both values by 0.4 one so that the
number<00:06:17.450> of<00:06:17.510> moles<00:06:17.690> on<00:06:17.870> this<00:06:18.050> side<00:06:18.230> will<00:06:18.350> be

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
number of moles on this side will be

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.740 
number of moles on this side will be
equal<00:06:18.590> to<00:06:18.830> one<00:06:19.130> so<00:06:19.370> it<00:06:19.490> can<00:06:19.670> be<00:06:19.820> in<00:06:19.910> the<00:06:20.030> form<00:06:20.240> 1

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
equal to one so it can be in the form 1

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:28.900 
equal to one so it can be in the form 1
2<00:06:21.250> xh<00:06:22.250> x<00:06:22.550> and<00:06:23.030> then<00:06:23.150> we<00:06:23.420> can<00:06:24.230> find<00:06:24.440> X<00:06:24.620> Y<00:06:27.700> so<00:06:28.700> if<00:06:28.790> I

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
2 xh x and then we can find X Y so if I

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.680 
2 xh x and then we can find X Y so if I
divide<00:06:29.530> this<00:06:30.530> by<00:06:30.590> 0.4<00:06:31.580> 1<00:06:31.730> obviously<00:06:32.120> we'd<00:06:32.450> get

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
divide this by 0.4 1 obviously we'd get

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.340 
divide this by 0.4 1 obviously we'd get
one<00:06:33.190> you're<00:06:34.190> dividing<00:06:34.400> it<00:06:34.700> by<00:06:34.880> itself<00:06:35.350> but

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
one you're dividing it by itself but

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:45.000 
one you're dividing it by itself but
this<00:06:36.740> only<00:06:37.610> divided<00:06:38.030> 0.819<00:06:38.810> by<00:06:39.170> 0.4<00:06:39.940> 0.8<00:06:40.940> 1<00:06:41.240> 9<00:06:42.400> 4

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
this only divided 0.819 by 0.4 0.8 1 9 4

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:50.490 
this only divided 0.819 by 0.4 0.8 1 9 4
we<00:06:46.010> get<00:06:46.160> one<00:06:46.400> point<00:06:46.730> nine<00:06:47.420> nine<00:06:47.480> seven<00:06:48.290> one

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
we get one point nine nine seven one

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.660 
we get one point nine nine seven one
point<00:06:52.210> nine<00:06:53.210> nine<00:06:53.240> eight<00:06:53.930> and<00:06:54.400> so<00:06:55.400> what<00:06:55.580> we

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
point nine nine eight and so what we

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.400 
point nine nine eight and so what we
need<00:06:55.820> to<00:06:55.850> do<00:06:56.090> now<00:06:56.270> is<00:06:56.570> round<00:06:56.990> this<00:06:57.170> to<00:06:57.350> the

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410 
need to do now is round this to the

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.390 
need to do now is round this to the
nearest<00:06:57.500> whole<00:06:57.950> number

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
nearest whole number

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.200 
nearest whole number
and<00:06:58.880> so<00:06:59.330> this<00:06:59.840> rounded<00:07:00.350> would<00:07:00.590> be<00:07:01.030> it<00:07:02.030> would

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
and so this rounded would be it would

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.630 
and so this rounded would be it would
produce<00:07:02.420> a<00:07:02.690> ratio<00:07:02.870> of<00:07:03.080> 1<00:07:03.320> to<00:07:03.350> 2<00:07:04.030> of<00:07:05.030> 1<00:07:05.510> to<00:07:05.750> 2<00:07:05.990> and

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:06.640 
produce a ratio of 1 to 2 of 1 to 2 and

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.490 
produce a ratio of 1 to 2 of 1 to 2 and
therefore<00:07:07.640> X<00:07:08.060> is<00:07:08.360> equal<00:07:08.780> to<00:07:08.810> 2<00:07:09.080> because<00:07:09.290> now

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500 
therefore X is equal to 2 because now

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.950 
therefore X is equal to 2 because now
it's<00:07:09.650> in<00:07:09.710> the<00:07:09.830> ratio<00:07:10.010> of<00:07:10.190> 1<00:07:10.480> the<00:07:11.480> one<00:07:11.630> is<00:07:11.780> here

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
it's in the ratio of 1 the one is here

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.280 
it's in the ratio of 1 the one is here
by<00:07:12.200> a<00:07:12.230> middle<00:07:12.770> now<00:07:13.310> it's<00:07:13.460> in<00:07:13.550> the<00:07:13.610> ratio<00:07:13.790> 1<00:07:14.180> to<00:07:14.450> X

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.290 
by a middle now it's in the ratio 1 to X

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:21.040 
by a middle now it's in the ratio 1 to X
and<00:07:16.030> X<00:07:17.030> is<00:07:17.270> 2<00:07:17.720> so<00:07:17.990> the<00:07:18.200> formula<00:07:19.480> it<00:07:20.480> asked<00:07:20.900> us<00:07:20.990> to

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050 
and X is 2 so the formula it asked us to

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.990 
and X is 2 so the formula it asked us to
find<00:07:21.350> the<00:07:21.530> formula<00:07:21.860> of<00:07:22.040> the<00:07:22.130> hydrogen<00:07:22.670> so<00:07:22.820> the

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 
find the formula of the hydrogen so the

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.920 
find the formula of the hydrogen so the
formula<00:07:23.510> would<00:07:23.630> be<00:07:24.490> let<00:07:25.490> me<00:07:25.610> do<00:07:25.790> this

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
formula would be let me do this

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:36.630 
formula would be let me do this
like<00:07:27.770> you<00:07:28.180> could<00:07:29.180> be<00:07:29.560> bacl<00:07:30.560> 2<00:07:31.600> and<00:07:32.950> then<00:07:33.950> 2<00:07:34.340> h2o

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:36.640 
like you could be bacl 2 and then 2 h2o

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:45.010 
like you could be bacl 2 and then 2 h2o
and<00:07:38.410> this<00:07:39.410> would<00:07:39.560> be<00:07:39.680> a<00:07:39.710> formula<00:07:41.170> 2x<00:07:42.170> equals
