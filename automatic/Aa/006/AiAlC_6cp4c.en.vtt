00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
these are between the studs obviously if

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.140 
these are between the studs obviously if
you<00:00:25.980> hit<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> stud<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.490> know<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.880> get<00:00:27.060> an

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
you hit a stud you know I can get an

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.210 
you hit a stud you know I can get an
insulation<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.410> between<00:00:28.710> studs

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
insulation in it so that between studs

insulation in it so that between studs
now<00:00:30.090> usually<00:00:30.539> if<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:31.470> solid<00:00:31.650> backing

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
now usually if this was solid backing

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.040 
now usually if this was solid backing
what<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> person<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.630> two<00:00:33.750> watertight

what a person can do two watertight
pieces<00:00:34.710> make<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.550> hole<00:00:35.790> round<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.420> bigger

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
pieces make the hole round and bigger

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.190 
pieces make the hole round and bigger
about<00:00:37.559> an<00:00:37.710> inch<00:00:37.980> around<00:00:38.160> bigger<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.750> then<00:00:39.989> you

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
about an inch around bigger and then you

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.869 
about an inch around bigger and then you
put<00:00:41.190> your<00:00:42.020> call<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.230> thing<00:00:43.670> caulking<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
put your call your thing caulking on the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.029 
put your call your thing caulking on the
back<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> paper<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.079> then<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.379> kind<00:00:46.950> of

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
back of the paper and then you kind of

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.860 
back of the paper and then you kind of
go<00:00:47.370> right<00:00:47.399> over<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.059> entire<00:00:48.390> thing<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
go right over the entire thing like a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.619 
go right over the entire thing like a
bicycle<00:00:49.350> tire<00:00:49.700> many<00:00:50.700> years<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.090> I've<00:00:51.239> been<00:00:51.510> in

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
bicycle tire many years as I've been in

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.060 
bicycle tire many years as I've been in
the<00:00:51.719> trade<00:00:51.899> I've<00:00:52.079> never<00:00:52.289> seen<00:00:52.500> anybody<00:00:52.739> do

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
the trade I've never seen anybody do

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.299 
the trade I've never seen anybody do
that

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
that

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.580 
that
so<00:00:53.910> generally<00:00:54.510> most<00:00:54.719> folks<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.350> here

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
so generally most folks do this here

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.529 
so generally most folks do this here
though<00:00:55.800> they'll<00:00:56.640> drill<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> hole<00:00:57.149> pump<00:00:57.420> in

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
though they'll drill the hole pump in

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.569 
though they'll drill the hole pump in
their<00:00:57.690> insulation<00:00:58.109> then<00:00:58.829> they'll<00:00:58.980> put<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> cork

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
their insulation then they'll put a cork

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.610 
their insulation then they'll put a cork
with<00:00:59.760> polyurethane<00:01:00.120> caulking<00:01:00.930> inside<00:01:01.379> any

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
with polyurethane caulking inside any

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.490 
with polyurethane caulking inside any
idea<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.980> see<00:01:02.129> Network<00:01:02.539> anyway<00:01:03.539> what<00:01:04.379> I'm

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
idea to see Network anyway what I'm

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.840 
idea to see Network anyway what I'm
gonna<00:01:04.619> do<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.920> I'm<00:01:05.010> gonna<00:01:05.070> patch<00:01:05.369> all<00:01:05.670> these

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
guys here a lot of ways to pass this I

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.560 
guys here a lot of ways to pass this I
can<00:01:08.310> come<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.549> ten<00:01:08.880> different<00:01:09.210> ways<00:01:09.240> to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
can come up with ten different ways to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.630 
can come up with ten different ways to
patches<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> sake<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.920> what<00:01:11.460> we're

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
patches but for the sake of what we're

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.719 
patches but for the sake of what we're
doing<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.990> put<00:01:13.530> 12<00:01:13.890> feet<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.280> all<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.610> these

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
doing is I put 12 feet on all of these

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.249 
doing is I put 12 feet on all of these
holes

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
holes

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.440 
holes
well<00:01:16.259> creep<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.950> gives<00:01:17.280> me<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.729> little<00:01:18.299> extra

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
well creep just gives me a little extra

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.530 
well creep just gives me a little extra
around<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> edges<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.799> will<00:01:20.009> adhere

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
around the edges so this will adhere

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.149 
around the edges so this will adhere
here's<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.720> twenty<00:01:22.080> thirty<00:01:22.380> La<00:01:22.950> Habra

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
here's in a twenty thirty La Habra

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.310 
here's in a twenty thirty La Habra
cement<00:01:23.880> because<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.540> what<00:01:24.750> their<00:01:24.869> texture

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
cement because that's what their texture

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.440 
cement because that's what their texture
is<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.369> twenty<00:01:26.670> thirty<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.090> texture

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
is this is twenty thirty the texture

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.789 
is this is twenty thirty the texture
it's<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.810> skip<00:01:28.020> child<00:01:28.259> finish<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.590> bring

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
it's just a skip child finish to bring

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.920 
it's just a skip child finish to bring
it<00:01:28.890> straight<00:01:29.009> up<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.970> I'm<00:01:30.060> gonna<00:01:30.180> use<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.420> too

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it straight up so I'm gonna use that too

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.649 
it straight up so I'm gonna use that too
if<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.799> use<00:01:32.009> an<00:01:32.159> acrylic<00:01:32.430> where<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> didn't<00:01:33.479> meet

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
if I use an acrylic where I didn't meet

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.120 
if I use an acrylic where I didn't meet
where<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> wouldn't<00:01:34.290> need<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.650> put<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> world

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
where I wouldn't need to put the world

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.800 
where I wouldn't need to put the world
Creek<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.520> acrylic<00:01:35.820> would<00:01:36.090> suck<00:01:36.390> up<00:01:36.540> into

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
Creek on the acrylic would suck up into

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.910 
Creek on the acrylic would suck up into
some<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.110> these<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:37.380> they're<00:01:37.650> concave<00:01:38.220> so

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
some of these because they're concave so

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
some of these because they're concave so
I'd<00:01:40.920> save<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> step<00:01:41.549> with<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.820> cut<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.240> then

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
I'd save a step with your cut but then

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.539 
I'd save a step with your cut but then
when<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> acrylic<00:01:43.560> dries<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.950> become<00:01:44.310> paved

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
when the acrylic dries you become paved

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.770 
when the acrylic dries you become paved
also<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.210> I'm<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.600> using<00:01:45.890> Greater<00:01:46.890> La<00:01:47.399> Habra

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
also so I'm just using Greater La Habra

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.359 
also so I'm just using Greater La Habra
2030<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.930> match<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.350> finish<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:49.860> what<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
2030 to match this finish here what I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.130 
2030 to match this finish here what I
generally<00:01:50.579> did<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.270> did<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> top<00:01:51.810> soak

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
generally did is I did the top soak

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.010 
generally did is I did the top soak
there<00:01:52.350> already<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.630> should<00:01:54.810> take<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
there already so you should take a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.200 
there already so you should take a
little<00:01:55.170> bit<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.680> tip<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:56.070> crop<00:01:56.490> go

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
little bit on the tip of your crop go

the entire whole one thing hot this here
is<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:13.290> finish<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:13.920> very<00:02:13.950> forgiving<00:02:14.730> very

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
is this finish is very forgiving very

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.740

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
I'm gonna take my texture off now with

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.660 
I'm gonna take my texture off now with
this<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:06.030> painted<00:03:06.769> this<00:03:07.769> is<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.070> same<00:03:08.250> printer

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
this is painted this is the same printer

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.460 
this is painted this is the same printer
they<00:03:08.820> use<00:03:09.060> when<00:03:09.330> they<00:03:09.420> painted<00:03:09.750> this<00:03:09.870> so

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
they use when they painted this so

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.380 
they use when they painted this so
they're<00:03:11.190> probably<00:03:11.459> gonna<00:03:11.760> go<00:03:11.970> with<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> rhino

primer over this and this has been paid

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.240 
primer over this and this has been paid
in<00:03:18.090> 10<00:03:18.360> 20<00:03:18.720> times<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.230> last<00:03:19.320> 70<00:03:19.769> years<00:03:19.799> so

in 10 20 times in the last 70 years so

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.850 
in 10 20 times in the last 70 years so
these<00:03:20.430> will<00:03:20.760> also<00:03:21.150> need<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.870> be<00:03:21.989> trying<00:03:22.530> twice

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
these will also need to be trying twice

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.190 
these will also need to be trying twice
you<00:03:23.070> just<00:03:23.250> take<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.459> brush<00:03:23.820> go<00:03:24.690> over<00:03:24.840> room<00:03:24.930> twice

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
you just take a brush go over room twice

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.590 
you just take a brush go over room twice
and<00:03:25.560> what<00:03:25.980> that'll<00:03:26.160> do<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.400> it'll<00:03:26.519> mellow<00:03:27.000> the

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
and what that'll do is it'll mellow the

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.420 
and what that'll do is it'll mellow the
roughness<00:03:28.049> out<00:03:28.290> once<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.739> mellow<00:03:29.010> just<00:03:29.250> rough

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
roughness out once you mellow just rough

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.430 
roughness out once you mellow just rough
this<00:03:29.579> out<00:03:29.790> it'll<00:03:30.390> match<00:03:30.570> this<00:03:30.780> right<00:03:30.989> here

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440

we still have about hundred matches the
little<00:03:44.130> holes<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.610> do<00:03:44.760> on<00:03:44.940> this<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.390> we're

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
little holes to do on this so we're

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.410 
little holes to do on this so we're
gonna<00:03:46.019> continue<00:03:46.470> with<00:03:46.739> our<00:03:46.980> project<00:03:47.519> I<00:03:47.700> thank
