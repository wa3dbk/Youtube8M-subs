Wells<00:01:35.550> you<00:01:35.729> into<00:01:35.909> thinking<00:01:36.120> there's<00:01:36.390> gonna<00:01:36.510> be

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
Wells you into thinking there's gonna be

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:46.790 
Wells you into thinking there's gonna be
a<00:01:36.720> constant<00:01:37.170> rate<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.440> fire<00:01:45.350> don't<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.500> too

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
a constant rate of fire don't be too

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.030 
a constant rate of fire don't be too
quick<00:01:47.010> to<00:01:47.100> cross<00:01:47.460> under<00:01:47.880> him<00:01:48.830> otherwise<00:01:49.830> you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
quick to cross under him otherwise you

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.120 
quick to cross under him otherwise you
might<00:01:50.190> get<00:01:50.400> trapped<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:52.680> want<00:01:52.830> to<00:01:52.890> let<00:01:53.040> him

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
might get trapped you want to let him

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.630 
might get trapped you want to let him
take<00:01:53.369> two<00:01:53.580> steps<00:01:53.850> before<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.360> try<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.690> cross

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.859 

naturally<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.820> bites<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.150> lot<00:02:00.330> easier<00:02:00.690> if<00:02:00.780> you

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
naturally this bites a lot easier if you

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.060 
naturally this bites a lot easier if you
want<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.140> use<00:02:01.229> rush<00:02:01.500> jets

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
want to use rush jets

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.590 
want to use rush jets
just<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:02.670> all<00:02:02.790> up<00:02:02.940> in<00:02:03.090> his<00:02:03.150> face<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
just get all up in his face and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.740 
just get all up in his face and
everything<00:02:08.000> but<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.209> highly<00:02:09.570> doable

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
everything but it is highly doable

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.560 
everything but it is highly doable
without<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:11.910> requires<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.330> good<00:02:12.510> deal

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
without it just requires a good deal

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.930 
without it just requires a good deal
more<00:02:12.720> patience<00:02:13.380> really<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:17.519> have<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.730> very

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
more patience really you have a very

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.400 
more patience really you have a very
limited<00:02:18.120> window<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.630> opportunity<00:02:19.290> to

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
limited window of opportunity to

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.300 
limited window of opportunity to
counter-attack<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.590> take<00:02:22.769> advantage<00:02:22.920> of

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
counter-attack and so take advantage of

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.900 
counter-attack and so take advantage of
it<00:02:23.430> when<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.640> can<00:02:28.550> just<00:02:29.550> definitely

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
it when you can just definitely

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:45.960 
it when you can just definitely
prioritize<00:02:30.570> getting<00:02:30.780> around<00:02:31.110> his<00:02:31.260> shots

fights a lot easier if you're willing to

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.540 
fights a lot easier if you're willing to
use<00:03:44.530> rush<00:03:44.950> jets<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:46.030> yeah<00:03:46.720> stabbity<00:03:50.550> the

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
use rush jets and yeah stabbity the

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.270 
use rush jets and yeah stabbity the
trick<00:03:51.790> now<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.240> getting<00:03:52.450> under<00:03:52.780> them<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.280> that

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
trick now is getting under them so that

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.610 
trick now is getting under them so that
you<00:03:54.340> don't<00:03:54.490> get<00:03:54.610> trapped<00:03:54.880> on<00:03:55.060> one<00:03:55.360> side<00:03:55.900> bugger

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
you don't get trapped on one side bugger

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.880 
you don't get trapped on one side bugger
and<00:03:59.880> all<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.030> while<00:04:01.210> having<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:01.900> try<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.680> make

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
and all the while having to try and make

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.740 
and all the while having to try and make
sure<00:04:02.920> that<00:04:03.130> you<00:04:03.340> don't<00:04:03.460> get<00:04:03.670> trapped<00:04:03.940> on<00:04:04.210> the

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
sure that you don't get trapped on the

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:14.429 
sure that you don't get trapped on the
wrong<00:04:04.930> side<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.290> things<00:04:05.680> kind<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.550> like<00:04:06.640> that

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.199 

just<00:04:15.439> takes<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:15.709> bit<00:04:15.739> more<00:04:16.039> patience<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:16.820> care

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
just takes a bit more patience and care

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:17.830 
just takes a bit more patience and care
bugger

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
bugger

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.270 
bugger
ah<00:04:18.789> we're<00:04:19.789> still<00:04:19.970> pretty<00:04:20.180> good<00:04:20.329> there<00:04:20.600> I<00:04:21.280> know

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
ah we're still pretty good there I know

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
ah we're still pretty good there I know
I<00:04:22.310> can<00:04:22.580> manage<00:04:22.910> this

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.089 

so<00:04:30.300> all<00:04:30.479> this<00:04:30.719> stage<00:04:31.020> was<00:04:31.289> basically<00:04:31.830> nothing

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
so all this stage was basically nothing

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.670 
so all this stage was basically nothing
but<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.460> boss<00:04:32.699> battle<00:04:32.969> that<00:04:33.539> second<00:04:34.020> phase<00:04:34.199> it

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
but a boss battle that second phase it

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.850 
but a boss battle that second phase it
still<00:04:35.009> has<00:04:35.189> at<00:04:35.340> least<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.639> little<00:04:35.789> bite<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.389> it

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.339

Wylie machine three it's pretty much a
non-issue<00:04:47.240> or<00:04:47.930> just<00:04:48.169> a<00:04:48.259> test<00:04:48.500> of<00:04:48.590> your

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 
a lot the spiraling shots aren't too

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:55.929 
a lot the spiraling shots aren't too
tricky<00:04:53.810> to<00:04:53.930> dodge<00:04:54.229> what<00:04:55.129> difficulty<00:04:55.729> there<00:04:55.909> is

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:55.939 
tricky to dodge what difficulty there is

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.089 
tricky to dodge what difficulty there is
here<00:04:56.330> it's<00:04:56.780> all<00:04:57.080> in<00:04:57.229> the<00:04:57.349> second<00:04:57.710> phase<00:04:57.860> of<00:04:58.009> the

here it's all in the second phase of the

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:00.379 
fights it largely comes down to just how

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.080 
fights it largely comes down to just how
cooperative<00:05:00.560> Wiley<00:05:01.219> is<00:05:01.250> feeling<00:05:01.729> here<00:05:01.939> with

time<00:05:04.580> you're<00:05:05.419> gonna<00:05:05.539> have<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.810> hard<00:05:06.080> time

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
time you're gonna have a hard time

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.619 
time you're gonna have a hard time
crossing<00:05:06.830> under<00:05:07.099> the<00:05:07.189> machine<00:05:07.629> getting

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
crossing under the machine getting

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:10.659 
crossing under the machine getting
cornered<00:05:08.900> it's<00:05:09.289> quite<00:05:09.800> easy<00:05:09.949> to<00:05:10.129> do<00:05:10.370> in<00:05:10.490> this

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
cornered it's quite easy to do in this

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.820 
cornered it's quite easy to do in this
fight<00:05:10.909> if<00:05:11.479> you<00:05:11.569> don't<00:05:11.870> pay<00:05:12.020> attention<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.650> can

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
fight if you don't pay attention you can

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.320 
fight if you don't pay attention you can
get<00:05:12.979> caught<00:05:13.219> with<00:05:13.400> nowhere<00:05:13.669> to<00:05:13.729> go<00:05:13.789> before<00:05:14.090> you

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
get caught with nowhere to go before you

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.990 
get caught with nowhere to go before you
realize<00:05:14.719> this<00:05:14.930> still<00:05:15.860> it<00:05:16.279> could<00:05:16.729> have<00:05:16.849> been<00:05:16.939> a

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
realize this still it could have been a

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.510 
realize this still it could have been a
lot<00:05:17.210> harder<00:05:17.360> than<00:05:17.539> it<00:05:17.689> is<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.830> shots<00:05:19.069> are<00:05:19.279> fast

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
lot harder than it is the shots are fast

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.519 
lot harder than it is the shots are fast
but<00:05:19.759> dodging<00:05:20.360> them<00:05:20.509> is<00:05:20.629> very<00:05:20.689> doable<00:05:21.110> if<00:05:21.409> you

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:21.529 
but dodging them is very doable if you

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.800 
but dodging them is very doable if you
pay<00:05:21.680> attention<00:05:21.879> it<00:05:22.879> kind<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.240> feels<00:05:23.449> like<00:05:23.569> they

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
pay attention it kind of feels like they

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.869 
pay attention it kind of feels like they
have<00:05:23.930> a<00:05:23.960> slight<00:05:24.469> weird<00:05:24.740> hitbox<00:05:25.189> syndrome<00:05:25.699> but

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:25.879 
have a slight weird hitbox syndrome but

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:27.610 
have a slight weird hitbox syndrome but
not<00:05:26.060> nearly<00:05:26.419> as<00:05:26.629> bad<00:05:26.810> as<00:05:26.840> others<00:05:27.229> we've<00:05:27.409> seen

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
not nearly as bad as others we've seen

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.189 
not nearly as bad as others we've seen
in<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.800> past<00:05:28.180> really<00:05:29.180> the<00:05:29.509> main<00:05:29.689> thing<00:05:29.960> here

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
in the past really the main thing here

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.260 
in the past really the main thing here
is<00:05:30.229> just<00:05:30.409> paying<00:05:30.889> close<00:05:31.159> attention<00:05:31.340> and<00:05:31.849> not

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
is just paying close attention and not

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.760 
is just paying close attention and not
getting<00:05:32.569> old<00:05:32.779> into<00:05:33.050> thinking<00:05:33.349> that<00:05:33.379> a<00:05:33.529> pattern

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
getting old into thinking that a pattern

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.499 
getting old into thinking that a pattern
exists<00:05:34.370> with<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:34.639> shots<00:05:34.879> that<00:05:35.029> actually

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:35.509 
exists with the shots that actually

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:38.469 
exists with the shots that actually
isn't<00:05:35.689> fair<00:05:36.050> trust<00:05:36.889> me<00:05:37.099> on<00:05:37.189> that<00:05:37.219> you<00:05:38.090> get<00:05:38.270> too

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
isn't fair trust me on that you get too

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.269 
isn't fair trust me on that you get too
complacent<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:39.199> thinking<00:05:39.680> it'll<00:05:39.830> be<00:05:39.979> shot

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
complacent and thinking it'll be shot

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.050 
complacent and thinking it'll be shot
shot<00:05:40.819> shot<00:05:41.419> shot<00:05:42.050> shot<00:05:42.650> shot<00:05:43.279> but<00:05:43.909> then

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
shot shot shot shot shot but then

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.850 
shot shot shot shot shot but then
suddenly<00:05:44.300> there's<00:05:44.960> a<00:05:45.020> pause<00:05:45.289> in<00:05:45.529> the<00:05:45.560> shots

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
suddenly there's a pause in the shots

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.920 
suddenly there's a pause in the shots
and<00:05:46.099> it's<00:05:46.610> just<00:05:47.120> enough<00:05:47.419> to<00:05:47.569> throw<00:05:47.750> you<00:05:47.810> off

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
and it's just enough to throw you off

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.680 
and it's just enough to throw you off
and<00:05:48.199> bang<00:05:48.529> that's<00:05:48.830> where<00:05:49.069> it<00:05:49.190> gets<00:05:49.339> you<00:05:49.690> so

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.159 
and bang that's where it gets you so
this<00:05:50.900> one<00:05:51.169> yeah<00:05:51.949> slightly<00:05:52.759> tricky<00:05:53.180> but<00:05:53.659> really

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
this one yeah slightly tricky but really

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.029 
this one yeah slightly tricky but really
not<00:05:54.319> bad<00:05:54.500> at<00:05:54.560> all

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.529 
so I'd say a three out of ten feels
about<00:05:56.960> right<00:05:57.020> and<00:05:57.860> so<00:05:58.460> with<00:05:58.669> that<00:05:58.819> that's<00:05:59.240> the

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
about right and so with that that's the

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.240 
about right and so with that that's the
