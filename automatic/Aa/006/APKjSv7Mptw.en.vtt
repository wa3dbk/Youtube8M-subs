00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
and it could still work

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:19.150 
and it could still work
so<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:13.490> make<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.090> need<00:02:14.600> 30<00:02:15.410> redstone<00:02:18.160> you

you'd have to connect the Redstone from
the<00:02:57.890> opposite<00:02:58.190> sides<00:02:58.550> of<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.820> piston<00:02:59.060> other

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
the opposite sides of the piston other

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.750 
the opposite sides of the piston other
distant<00:03:00.170> sticky<00:03:00.530> pistons<00:03:00.920> yeah<00:03:01.580> they're

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
distant sticky pistons yeah they're

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.820 
distant sticky pistons yeah they're
sticky<00:03:01.970> pistons<00:03:04.990> to<00:03:05.990> make<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.560> want<00:03:06.740> to

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
sticky pistons to make it you want to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.740 
sticky pistons to make it you want to
make<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.670> so<00:03:07.970> p1<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:09.620> redstone<00:03:10.070> starts<00:03:10.750> from

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
make it so p1 the redstone starts from

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.290 
make it so p1 the redstone starts from
one<00:03:12.200> side<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.680> look<00:03:12.830> Justin<00:03:13.190> Turner<00:03:13.430> on<00:03:13.940> the

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
one side to look Justin Turner on the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.580 
one side to look Justin Turner on the
opposite<00:03:14.660> side<00:03:14.900> so<00:03:15.860> I<00:03:15.890> this<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:19.390> I'll<00:03:20.390> be<00:03:20.590> to

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
opposite side so I this and I'll be to

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.920 
opposite side so I this and I'll be to
make<00:03:21.770> it<00:03:22.010> on<00:03:22.190> totals<00:03:22.760> like<00:03:22.970> they<00:03:23.450> all<00:03:23.570> get<00:03:23.780> to

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
make it on totals like they all get to

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.450 
make it on totals like they all get to
the<00:03:24.050> redstone<00:03:24.410> torch<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.800> where<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.040> could<00:03:25.250> be

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
the redstone torch and where it could be

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.610 
the redstone torch and where it could be
one<00:03:26.240> two<00:03:26.540> three<00:03:27.320> four<00:03:28.240> five<00:03:29.240> six<00:03:29.690> seven<00:03:30.320> eight

be interning there anyone so like 30 or

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.100 
be interning there anyone so like 30 or
2<00:03:59.420> more<00:03:59.570> redstone<00:04:00.460> to<00:04:01.460> make<00:04:01.790> all<00:04:01.970> this<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:02.960> you

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
2 more redstone to make all this and you

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.260 
2 more redstone to make all this and you
want<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.410> Redstone<00:04:03.830> I<00:04:04.100> mean<00:04:04.430> looks<00:04:04.640> sticky

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
want the Redstone I mean looks sticky

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.820 
want the Redstone I mean looks sticky
pistons<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:05.930> be<00:04:06.200> far<00:04:07.070> away<00:04:07.190> from<00:04:07.340> each<00:04:07.610> other

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
pistons to be far away from each other

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:20.410 
pistons to be far away from each other
1<00:04:09.830> 2<00:04:10.280> 3<00:04:10.550> 4<00:04:11.060> that's<00:04:12.050> very<00:04:12.380> easy<00:04:12.730> again<00:04:14.230> just

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.900 

I<00:04:20.500> wonder<00:04:21.500> if<00:04:21.530> I<00:04:21.740> think<00:04:22.160> that<00:04:22.280> all<00:04:22.400> make<00:04:22.790> an

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
I wonder if I think that all make an

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.420 
I wonder if I think that all make an
opening<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:24.590> can<00:04:24.800> close<00:04:25.010> it<00:04:25.190> up<00:04:25.250> again

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
opening and you can close it up again

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.990 
opening and you can close it up again
with<00:04:25.640> that<00:04:26.410> or<00:04:29.740> like<00:04:30.740> here<00:04:31.040> like<00:04:31.640> you<00:04:31.850> can

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
with that or like here like you can

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.330 
with that or like here like you can
really<00:04:32.180> make<00:04:32.420> it<00:04:32.450> very<00:04:32.720> real<00:04:33.200> days<00:04:36.190> take<00:04:37.190> that

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
really make it very real days take that

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.760 
really make it very real days take that
off<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:38.650> then<00:04:39.650> go<00:04:39.800> down<00:04:39.980> and<00:04:40.310> then<00:04:41.260> that<00:04:42.260> from

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
off and then go down and then that from

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.060 
off and then go down and then that from
here<00:04:42.980> you<00:04:43.160> can<00:04:43.280> use<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.030> ladders<00:04:44.420> and<00:04:45.070> put

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
here you can use the ladders and put

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.370 
here you can use the ladders and put
your<00:04:46.790> original<00:04:47.360> torch<00:04:47.540> again<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:47.960> then<00:04:48.080> put
