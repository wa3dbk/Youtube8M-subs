00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
in the course of the these reviews this

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.160 
in the course of the these reviews this
is<00:02:23.850> now<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.030> third<00:02:24.180> review<00:02:24.690> where<00:02:24.959> we<00:02:24.990> were

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
is now the third review where we were

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.520 
is now the third review where we were
looking<00:02:25.470> at<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:26.240> reaction<00:02:27.240> figures<00:02:27.900> spots

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
looking at the reaction figures spots

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.380 
looking at the reaction figures spots
already<00:02:28.680> talked<00:02:28.980> about<00:02:29.069> how<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.640> love<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.180> fact

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
already talked about how I love the fact

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.809 
already talked about how I love the fact
that<00:02:30.540> Funko<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.380> well<00:02:31.980> aware<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.370> what<00:02:32.670> they're

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
that Funko is well aware of what they're

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.420 
that Funko is well aware of what they're
producing<00:02:33.000> with<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.630> line<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.280> giving<00:02:35.280> us

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
producing with this line and giving us

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.520 
producing with this line and giving us
something<00:02:35.909> that<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.239> would<00:02:36.450> expect<00:02:36.900> back<00:02:37.230> then

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
something that we would expect back then

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.420 
something that we would expect back then
back<00:02:38.459> then<00:02:38.519> with<00:02:39.060> GI<00:02:39.269> Joes<00:02:39.659> and<00:02:39.959> other

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
back then with GI Joes and other

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.070 
back then with GI Joes and other
figures<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:42.180> tend<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.570> get<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.810> lot<00:02:43.020> of

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
figures you tend to get a lot of

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.680 
figures you tend to get a lot of
accessories<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.800> were<00:02:44.240> different<00:02:45.240> colors

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
accessories that were different colors

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.930 
accessories that were different colors
than<00:02:46.170> what<00:02:46.350> we<00:02:46.500> would<00:02:46.740> expect<00:02:46.800> with<00:02:47.370> realistic

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
than what we would expect with realistic

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.330 
than what we would expect with realistic
weapons<00:02:48.480> with<00:02:49.410> GI<00:02:49.590> Joe<00:02:49.740> figures<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.160> got<00:02:50.310> a

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
weapons with GI Joe figures you got a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.450 
weapons with GI Joe figures you got a
lot<00:02:50.520> of<00:02:50.550> red<00:02:51.000> guns<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:52.590> know<00:02:52.710> purple<00:02:53.250> guns

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
lot of red guns you know purple guns

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.450 
lot of red guns you know purple guns
white<00:02:54.090> guns<00:02:54.470> not<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.530> lot<00:02:55.740> of<00:02:55.770> guns<00:02:56.010> look<00:02:56.250> like

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
white guns not a lot of guns look like

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.970 
white guns not a lot of guns look like
that<00:02:56.610> in<00:02:56.730> real<00:02:56.850> life<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.390> same<00:02:58.200> idea<00:02:58.500> with<00:02:58.740> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
that in real life and same idea with the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.340 
that in real life and same idea with the
flamethrowers<00:02:59.880> we're<00:03:00.570> getting<00:03:00.840> them<00:03:00.960> in<00:03:01.200> a

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
flamethrowers we're getting them in a

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.460 
flamethrowers we're getting them in a
blue<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.160> not<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:02.820> a<00:03:02.910> black<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.930> simple<00:03:04.350> way

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
blue and not in a black the simple way

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.870 
blue and not in a black the simple way
the<00:03:04.740> simple<00:03:05.010> solution<00:03:05.130> would<00:03:05.490> have<00:03:05.610> been<00:03:05.730> to

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
the simple solution would have been to

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.210 
the simple solution would have been to
give<00:03:06.000> us<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.360> black<00:03:06.810> flame<00:03:07.200> thrower<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:08.070> that's

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
give us a black flame thrower but that's

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.680 
give us a black flame thrower but that's
not<00:03:08.370> how<00:03:08.460> it<00:03:08.610> would<00:03:08.730> have<00:03:08.850> looked<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.330> 80s

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
not how it would have looked in the 80s

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.710 
not how it would have looked in the 80s
so<00:03:09.930> therefore<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.590> really<00:03:11.280> love<00:03:11.490> it<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:12.510> can't

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
so therefore I really love it you can't

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.350 
so therefore I really love it you can't
take<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.020> flamethrower<00:03:13.710> and<00:03:14.150> put<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.240> in

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
take the flamethrower and put it in

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.640

very a simplistic in color really could

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.330 
very a simplistic in color really could
be<00:03:36.450> said<00:03:36.720> for<00:03:36.750> all<00:03:37.110> of<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.590> reaction<00:03:38.070> figures

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
be said for all of the reaction figures

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.950 
be said for all of the reaction figures
that<00:03:38.490> we'll<00:03:38.610> be<00:03:38.640> looking<00:03:38.820> at<00:03:39.060> case<00:03:39.780> in<00:03:39.930> point

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
that we'll be looking at case in point

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.930 
that we'll be looking at case in point
there<00:03:40.350> is<00:03:40.440> Ripley<00:03:40.740> right<00:03:40.920> there<00:03:41.130> they<00:03:41.700> share

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
there is Ripley right there they share

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.220 
there is Ripley right there they share
that<00:03:42.090> same<00:03:42.300> sort<00:03:42.600> of<00:03:42.660> navy<00:03:43.050> blue<00:03:45.020> also<00:03:46.020> a

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
that same sort of navy blue also a

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.190 
that same sort of navy blue also a
common<00:03:46.620> trait<00:03:46.860> with<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.100> lot<00:03:47.550> of<00:03:47.580> old<00:03:48.000> 80s<00:03:48.750> toys

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
common trait with a lot of old 80s toys

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.100 
common trait with a lot of old 80s toys
was<00:03:50.070> that<00:03:50.520> a<00:03:50.580> lot<00:03:50.820> of<00:03:50.970> companies<00:03:51.540> tried<00:03:51.959> to

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
was that a lot of companies tried to

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.690 
was that a lot of companies tried to
reuse<00:03:52.650> same<00:03:53.130> paint<00:03:53.490> and<00:03:53.990> same<00:03:54.990> body<00:03:55.320> pieces<00:03:55.860> to

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
reuse same paint and same body pieces to

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.000 
reuse same paint and same body pieces to
save<00:03:56.970> costs<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.320> this<00:03:58.410> case<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.890> makes

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
save costs so in this case it makes

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.940 
save costs so in this case it makes
perfect<00:03:59.220> sense<00:03:59.490> that<00:04:00.140> yes<00:04:01.140> Ripley<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.800> him

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
perfect sense that yes Ripley and him

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.160 
perfect sense that yes Ripley and him
kind<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.280> had<00:04:02.430> similar<00:04:02.790> jackets<00:04:03.150> anyways<00:04:03.510> but

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
kind of had similar jackets anyways but

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.420 
kind of had similar jackets anyways but
it<00:04:04.290> makes<00:04:04.440> sense<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.740> they<00:04:04.860> use<00:04:05.100> pretty<00:04:05.340> much

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
it makes sense that they use pretty much

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.030 
it makes sense that they use pretty much
the<00:04:05.610> exact<00:04:05.910> same<00:04:06.150> color<00:04:06.860> from<00:04:07.860> one<00:04:08.040> another

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
the exact same color from one another

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.030 
the exact same color from one another
his<00:04:11.040> face<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.900> what<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.080> would<00:04:13.170> expect<00:04:13.530> from<00:04:13.800> a

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
his face is what you would expect from a

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.820 
his face is what you would expect from a
retro<00:04:14.850> figure<00:04:15.239> it's<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.690> would<00:04:16.320> not<00:04:16.470> say<00:04:16.709> it

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
retro figure it's I would not say it

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.640 
retro figure it's I would not say it
looks<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.220> lot<00:04:17.430> like<00:04:17.700> him<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:19.049> kind<00:04:19.350> of<00:04:19.380> looks
