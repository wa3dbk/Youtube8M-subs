in<00:00:00.329> this<00:00:00.659> tutorial<00:00:00.900> we're<00:00:01.530> going<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.770> write

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
in this tutorial we're going to write

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.379 
in this tutorial we're going to write
our<00:00:02.010> first<00:00:02.280> plugin<00:00:02.550> it's<00:00:03.000> going<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.270> take

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
our first plugin it's going to take

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.680 
our first plugin it's going to take
about<00:00:03.510> 2<00:00:03.870> minutes<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.290> actually<00:00:04.710> write<00:00:05.190> and

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
about 2 minutes to actually write and

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.629 
about 2 minutes to actually write and
it's<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.810> volume<00:00:07.020> control<00:00:07.259> plugin<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.519> way

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
it's a volume control plugin to the way

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.430

has<00:01:50.700> been<00:01:50.729> updated<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.479> our<00:01:51.600> compiler<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.590> your

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
has been updated in our compiler if your

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.920 
has been updated in our compiler if your
compiler<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> desktop<00:01:54.450> it'll

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
compiler is on the desktop it'll

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.050 
compiler is on the desktop it'll
actually<00:01:55.049> flash<00:01:55.530> when<00:01:55.979> when<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.579> happened

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
actually flash when when that happened

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.359 
actually flash when when that happened
if<00:01:57.540> your<00:01:57.750> compiler<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.259> minimized<00:01:58.799> it'll<00:01:59.219> all

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
if your compiler is minimized it'll all

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.539 
if your compiler is minimized it'll all
go<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.729> pretty<00:02:00.060> much<00:02:00.210> transparently<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.380> you

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
go on pretty much transparently for you

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.340 
go on pretty much transparently for you
so<00:02:02.549> now<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:02.939> I've<00:02:03.180> got<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.540> interface<00:02:04.079> set

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
so now that I've got the interface set

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.139 
so now that I've got the interface set
up<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.680> need<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.950> go<00:02:05.130> alter<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> code<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.000> do

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
up I need to go alter the code to do

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.700 
up I need to go alter the code to do
some<00:02:06.360> signal<00:02:06.689> processing<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.439> I'm<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.680> to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
some signal processing and I'm going to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.770 
some signal processing and I'm going to
use<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.849> these<00:02:09.060> buttons<00:02:09.450> here<00:02:09.569> that

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
use one of these buttons here that

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.809 
use one of these buttons here that
controls<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.319> compiler<00:02:10.739> you've<00:02:11.129> got<00:02:11.280> rebuild

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
controls the compiler you've got rebuild

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.250 
controls the compiler you've got rebuild
a<00:02:12.030> debug<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.720> go<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.260> C++

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
a debug and go to C++

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.559 
a debug and go to C++
so<00:02:14.349> I'm<00:02:14.860> going<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.069> click<00:02:15.250> on<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:16.060> get<00:02:16.450> my

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
so I'm going to click on that to get my

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.250 
so I'm going to click on that to get my
C++<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.549> compiler<00:02:18.549> back<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.720> Here<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:19.930> am<00:02:20.049> in

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
C++ a compiler back and Here I am in

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.509 
C++ a compiler back and Here I am in
volume<00:02:20.860> dot<00:02:21.069> CPP<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.209> want<00:02:22.629> to<00:02:22.720> navigate<00:02:23.110> to

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
volume dot CPP so I want to navigate to

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.580 
volume dot CPP so I want to navigate to
the<00:02:24.519> process<00:02:25.000> audio<00:02:25.390> frame<00:02:25.810> function<00:02:26.379> this<00:02:26.560> is

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
the process audio frame function this is

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.050 
the process audio frame function this is
the<00:02:26.709> function<00:02:26.829> where<00:02:27.310> all<00:02:27.519> of<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.879> work

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
the function where all of the work

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.420 
the function where all of the work
happens<00:02:28.360> all<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.620> processing<00:02:30.579> so<00:02:31.510> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
happens all of the processing so the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.740 
happens all of the processing so the
process<00:02:33.430> audio<00:02:33.579> frame<00:02:34.030> function<00:02:34.450> has<00:02:34.569> already

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
process audio frame function has already

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.259 
process audio frame function has already
been<00:02:34.870> pre-written<00:02:35.409> for<00:02:35.950> me<00:02:36.159> to<00:02:36.819> just<00:02:37.060> pass

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
been pre-written for me to just pass

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.220 
been pre-written for me to just pass
data<00:02:37.659> from<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.200> input<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.519> output<00:02:40.079> and<00:02:41.079> so

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
data from the input to the output and so

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.170 
data from the input to the output and so
what<00:02:41.379> I<00:02:41.409> want<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.799> do<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.310> alter<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:42.909> by

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
what I want to do is to alter that by

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.770 
what I want to do is to alter that by
scaling<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.019> data<00:02:44.879> using<00:02:45.879> my<00:02:46.269> volume

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
scaling the data using my volume

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.740 
scaling the data using my volume
variable<00:02:47.379> and<00:02:48.370> I'll<00:02:48.700> need<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.090> do<00:02:49.209> that<00:02:49.390> three

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
variable and I'll need to do that three

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.199 
variable and I'll need to do that three
times<00:02:49.859> because<00:02:50.859> I<00:02:51.280> have<00:02:51.459> three<00:02:51.879> different

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
times because I have three different

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.680 
times because I have three different
plug-in<00:02:52.840> routings<00:02:53.379> a<00:02:53.620> mono<00:02:54.579> and<00:02:54.909> insert<00:02:55.450> a

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
plug-in routings a mono and insert a

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.369 
plug-in routings a mono and insert a
mono<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.349> stereo<00:02:56.560> out<00:02:57.129> aux<00:02:57.879> type<00:02:58.629> and<00:02:59.290> a

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
mono and stereo out aux type and a

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.550 
mono and stereo out aux type and a
stereo<00:02:59.769> and<00:03:00.129> stereo<00:03:00.549> out<00:03:00.760> insert<00:03:01.209> type<00:03:01.560> like

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
stereo and stereo out insert type like

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.770 
stereo and stereo out insert type like
this<00:03:02.769> so<00:03:03.069> that<00:03:03.310> will<00:03:03.940> take<00:03:04.090> care<00:03:04.329> of<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.569> three

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
this so that will take care of the three

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.339 
this so that will take care of the three
possible<00:03:05.500> combinations<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.790> had<00:03:07.150> so<00:03:08.019> I'll

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
possible combinations that I had so I'll

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.940 
possible combinations that I had so I'll
go<00:03:08.500> ahead<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:09.010> minimize<00:03:09.159> that<00:03:09.400> again<00:03:09.940> and

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
go ahead and minimize that again and

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.140 
go ahead and minimize that again and
rebuild<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.159> I'm<00:03:12.310> going<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.489> use<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:12.790> rebuild

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
rebuild it I'm going to use the rebuild

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.619 
rebuild it I'm going to use the rebuild
button<00:03:13.510> from<00:03:13.930> racket<00:03:14.920> FX<00:03:15.280> that'll<00:03:16.239> go<00:03:16.389> ahead

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
button from racket FX that'll go ahead

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.720 
button from racket FX that'll go ahead
and<00:03:17.019> start<00:03:17.379> the<00:03:17.590> rebuilding<00:03:17.769> in<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.340> compiler

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
and start the rebuilding in the compiler

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.210 
and start the rebuilding in the compiler
and<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.359> can<00:03:19.569> follow<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.199> build<00:03:20.440> by<00:03:20.859> just

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
and I can follow the build by just

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.640 
and I can follow the build by just
checking<00:03:21.430> on<00:03:21.879> the<00:03:22.540> little<00:03:22.780> box<00:03:22.959> up<00:03:23.230> here<00:03:23.500> and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
checking on the little box up here and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.789 
checking on the little box up here and
my<00:03:24.099> rebuild<00:03:24.549> did<00:03:24.790> succeed<00:03:25.239> so<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.440> next<00:03:26.650> thing

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
my rebuild did succeed so the next thing

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.280 
my rebuild did succeed so the next thing
I'll<00:03:26.919> do<00:03:27.129> is<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.519> load<00:03:27.819> the<00:03:27.849> DLL<00:03:28.660> into<00:03:29.109> the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
I'll do is to load the DLL into the

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.920 
I'll do is to load the DLL into the
process<00:03:29.680> space<00:03:29.919> and<00:03:30.250> all<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.419> other<00:03:31.540> sliders

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
process space and all the other sliders

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.869 
process space and all the other sliders
disappear<00:03:32.650> except<00:03:32.949> for<00:03:33.099> the<00:03:33.190> one<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.579> set

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
disappear except for the one that I set

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.479 
disappear except for the one that I set
up<00:03:33.910> here<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.780> is<00:03:34.900> now<00:03:35.169> on<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:35.889> can<00:03:36.040> see<00:03:36.250> that

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
up here it is now on you can see that

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.689 
up here it is now on you can see that
it's<00:03:37.090> working<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.810> I<00:03:38.109> can<00:03:38.290> also<00:03:38.699> enter

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
it's working and I can also enter

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.819 
it's working and I can also enter
information<00:03:40.090> into<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.660> slider<00:03:40.959> by<00:03:41.260> putting

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
information into the slider by putting

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.550 
information into the slider by putting
it<00:03:41.949> directly<00:03:42.400> in<00:03:42.699> here<00:03:43.150> at<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.840> tab<00:03:44.049> control

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
it directly in here at the tab control

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.979 
it directly in here at the tab control
and<00:03:44.829> that<00:03:45.099> will<00:03:45.310> enter<00:03:45.849> the<00:03:45.970> data<00:03:46.150> into<00:03:46.629> it<00:03:46.780> so

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
and that will enter the data into it so

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.229 
and that will enter the data into it so
you<00:03:47.230> can<00:03:47.620> type<00:03:47.859> in<00:03:48.040> very<00:03:48.430> very<00:03:48.699> precise

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
you can type in very very precise

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.059 
you can type in very very precise
numbers<00:03:49.750> inside<00:03:50.199> of<00:03:50.319> these<00:03:50.500> boxes<00:03:50.889> when<00:03:51.040> you

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
numbers inside of these boxes when you

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.789 
numbers inside of these boxes when you
need<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.569> so<00:03:52.569> let's<00:03:52.750> run<00:03:52.959> some<00:03:52.989> audio<00:03:53.500> through

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
need to so let's run some audio through

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:02.770 
need to so let's run some audio through
it

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.890 

and<00:04:03.800> it's<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.920> working<00:04:05.340> volume<00:04:05.730> control<00:04:06.120> so

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
and it's a working volume control so

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.740 
and it's a working volume control so
this<00:04:07.739> is<00:04:07.890> pretty<00:04:08.069> cool<00:04:08.370> because<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:09.300> idea<00:04:09.690> is

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
this is pretty cool because the idea is

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.570 
this is pretty cool because the idea is
that<00:04:10.080> if<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.319> can<00:04:10.470> make<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.650> volume<00:04:10.980> control

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
that if you can make a volume control

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.059 
that if you can make a volume control
and<00:04:11.879> have<00:04:12.599> it<00:04:12.810> control<00:04:13.319> data<00:04:13.590> in<00:04:13.800> real<00:04:14.040> time

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
and have it control data in real time

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.400 
and have it control data in real time
then<00:04:14.700> really<00:04:15.300> you<00:04:15.330> can<00:04:15.569> do<00:04:15.690> whatever<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:16.139> want

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
then really you can do whatever you want

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.740 
then really you can do whatever you want
it's<00:04:16.650> just<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:17.010> matter<00:04:17.190> of<00:04:17.540> how<00:04:18.540> many

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
it's just a matter of how many

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.449 
it's just a matter of how many
algorithms<00:04:19.049> you've<00:04:19.470> got<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.739> go<00:04:19.859> through<00:04:20.220> and

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
algorithms you've got to go through and

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.540 
algorithms you've got to go through and
your<00:04:20.790> experience<00:04:21.359> level<00:04:21.570> in<00:04:21.810> doing<00:04:22.079> this<00:04:22.200> so

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
your experience level in doing this so

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.670 
your experience level in doing this so
I'll<00:04:23.550> be<00:04:23.760> adding<00:04:23.970> another<00:04:24.419> button<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.380> this

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
I'll be adding another button to this

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.379 
I'll be adding another button to this
project<00:04:26.220> in<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.520> next<00:04:26.729> video<00:04:27.000> that<00:04:27.240> will<00:04:27.360> show

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
project in the next video that will show

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.950 
project in the next video that will show
you<00:04:27.510> how<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.750> use<00:04:28.200> some<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.220> these<00:04:29.960> extra

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
you how to use some of these extra

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.430 
you how to use some of these extra
controls<00:04:31.350> that<00:04:31.500> are<00:04:31.620> on<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.830> user<00:04:31.950> interface
