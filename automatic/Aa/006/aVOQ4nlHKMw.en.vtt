what he's wearing and he's got an orange
exosuit<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.700> think<00:02:23.910> he's<00:02:24.000> one<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.300> elite

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
exosuit I think he's one of the elite

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.390 
exosuit I think he's one of the elite
ones<00:02:24.660> looks<00:02:24.959> really<00:02:25.290> nice<00:02:25.440> with<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.190> white

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
ones looks really nice with the white

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.860 
ones looks really nice with the white
and<00:02:26.550> then<00:02:26.670> he's<00:02:26.790> got<00:02:26.940> helmet<00:02:27.390> which<00:02:27.600> here

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
and then he's got helmet which here

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.840 
and then he's got helmet which here
which<00:02:28.200> actually<00:02:28.350> matches<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.220> I've<00:02:29.670> got

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
which actually matches that I've got

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.940 
which actually matches that I've got
that<00:02:29.940> helmet<00:02:30.239> myself<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.959> often<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.530> wear<00:02:31.770> that

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
that helmet myself and often I wear that

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.740 
that helmet myself and often I wear that
one<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.459> think<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.030> goes<00:02:33.150> really<00:02:33.390> well<00:02:33.510> with<00:02:33.600> a

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
one I think it goes really well with a

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
kind of helmet which matches it quite

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.759 
kind of helmet which matches it quite
all<00:04:14.479> as<00:04:14.599> well<00:04:14.780> but<00:04:15.139> when<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:15.290> first<00:04:15.560> looked

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
all as well but when I first looked

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:16.930 
all as well but when I first looked
through<00:04:15.799> this<00:04:16.039> it<00:04:16.159> kind<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.340> looks<00:04:16.489> like<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.669> bit

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
through this it kind of looks like a bit

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.430 
through this it kind of looks like a bit
of<00:04:17.030> a<00:04:17.090> mess<00:04:17.359> all<00:04:17.599> of<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.870> stuff<00:04:18.079> but<00:04:18.320> then<00:04:18.409> I

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
of a mess all of the stuff but then I

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.539 
of a mess all of the stuff but then I
have<00:04:18.560> another<00:04:18.769> look<00:04:18.889> another<00:04:19.099> thing<00:04:19.220> that

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
have another look another thing that

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:20.890 
have another look another thing that
actually<00:04:19.639> goes<00:04:20.000> really<00:04:20.239> well<00:04:20.329> even<00:04:20.690> though<00:04:20.780> it

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
actually goes really well even though it

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.570 
actually goes really well even though it
contrasts<00:04:21.349> quite<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.650> bit<00:04:21.859> it<00:04:22.130> goes<00:04:22.370> really

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
contrasts quite a bit it goes really

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.010 
contrasts quite a bit it goes really
well<00:04:22.669> right<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.150> again<00:04:23.419> like<00:04:23.659> the<00:04:23.690> added

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
well right and again like the added

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.180 
well right and again like the added
factor<00:04:24.199> knowing<00:04:24.530> that<00:04:24.680> he's<00:04:24.770> had<00:04:24.889> to<00:04:25.039> earn

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
factor knowing that he's had to earn

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.800 
factor knowing that he's had to earn
some<00:04:25.520> of<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:25.760> loot<00:04:25.940> as<00:04:26.090> well<00:04:26.240> instead<00:04:26.690> of

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
some of that loot as well instead of

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.300 
some of that loot as well instead of
just<00:04:26.960> getting<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.320> Supply<00:04:27.620> Drop<00:04:27.680> just<00:04:28.039> gives<00:04:28.220> it

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
just getting a Supply Drop just gives it

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.680 
just getting a Supply Drop just gives it
that<00:04:28.340> little<00:04:28.639> bit<00:04:28.880> of<00:04:28.970> an<00:04:29.060> extra<00:04:29.300> added<00:04:29.449> edge

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
those difficult to use weapons I think

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:16.749 
those difficult to use weapons I think
one<00:05:15.530> of<00:05:15.560> them<00:05:15.710> is<00:05:15.830> for<00:05:15.979> the<00:05:16.039> heavy<00:05:16.220> weapons<00:05:16.610> as

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
one of them is for the heavy weapons as

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.909 
one of them is for the heavy weapons as
well<00:05:16.789> so<00:05:17.419> I<00:05:17.449> did<00:05:17.900> that<00:05:18.020> myself<00:05:18.199> and<00:05:18.620> I<00:05:18.680> know<00:05:18.889> our

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
well so I did that myself and I know our

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.560 
well so I did that myself and I know our
difficulties<00:05:19.639> so<00:05:19.760> that<00:05:19.909> just<00:05:20.120> adds<00:05:20.270> a<00:05:20.419> little

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
difficulties so that just adds a little

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.480 
difficulties so that just adds a little
extra<00:05:20.900> touch<00:05:21.080> which<00:05:21.590> is<00:05:21.620> you<00:05:22.010> know<00:05:22.099> the<00:05:22.250> reason

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
extra touch which is you know the reason

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.800 
extra touch which is you know the reason

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
I put these at number one I mean they're

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
I put these at number one I mean they're
all<00:05:23.930> great<00:05:24.139> there<00:05:24.260> whatever<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:24.650> little
