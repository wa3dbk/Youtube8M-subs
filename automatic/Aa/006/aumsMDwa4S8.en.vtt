00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.500
 even the boy is my name is fabiano de 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.200
 and exchange an idea with you about 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.550
 two methods that use pass and 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.520
 cooking food 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.130
 are they a support for the simple mug 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.439
 and a grill type armadillo 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.020
 in fact these procedures are well 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.890
 simple and well known by 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.090
 and give an example to the mouth of the 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.980
 barbecue does not have to be much 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.149
 long 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.750
 This will depend on what you go 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.920
 to pass on to me as usually the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.190
 small things 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.230
 I do one foot deep for 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.390
 one wide 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.679
 How much do you guys cook? 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.129
 can do with two spans of 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:51.949
 two depth width is 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.769
 good also just cut some sticks 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.670
 grids to make the grid and put it 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.670
 this way it is 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.290
 to make the structure that holds the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.270
 mug 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.120
 You're going to need an extra stick . 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.500
 or less four forms of compliance and 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.990
 one and a half kind because to 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:32.200
 to support the structure that is 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:35.320
 that way , you reinforce the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.180
 The frame for the mug does not fall 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.180
 bonfire in case the pharmacy is not 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.780
 it is still important that you 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.910
 make the support let them one close 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.070
 on the other because you are going to 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.060
 the coal fire in the 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.680
 barbecue grill 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.940
 after the water has lost in 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.940
 the mug that way I 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.129
 now choke the fire in the barbecue with 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.500
 green leaf to make ember by the 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:49.780
 smoke stopped coming out there put the grill 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:52.420
 but then put meat to roast the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.680
 egg has finished cooking or taking 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.680
 mug expected cold water 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.340
 The egg even thought it was hitting the 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.870
 can bottom is now leaving little 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.000
 barbecue smoke 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.390
 just put the grills and meat 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.390
 to bake 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.849
 after the water come to the boil 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.370
 it took about ten minutes soon 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.580
 cook the meat from the barbecue 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.720
 it took 10 minutes to prass it had recorded 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.930
 another scene before 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.879
 unfortunately the camera did not save is for 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.099
 what in the video that is going to come next 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.079
 half of the meat is missing and I put 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:02.629
 pass on the barbecue because he already had 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:04.489
 eaten her before here my pet and 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.000
 is ready 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.859
 I know that he or who cooks at that time 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.019
 to break the shell and hit the bottom 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.489
 from the can 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.299
 I think it's good to know what kind of 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.609
 beef and randy hare capybara cat 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.949
 You can hope that you 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.240
 have enjoyed the video and help in 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.850
 walk in search of survivors 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.850
 realism 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.850
 thanks
