was a lot of Miss keys and it was a bit
awkward<00:02:46.120> especially<00:02:46.510> if<00:02:46.960> you're<00:02:47.050> trying<00:02:47.170> to

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
awkward especially if you're trying to

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.350 
awkward especially if you're trying to
type<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.950> find<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.520> can<00:02:48.730> type<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.120> lot<00:02:49.300> faster

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
type that I find I can type a lot faster

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.199 
type that I find I can type a lot faster
on<00:02:50.110> here<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:50.890> find<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.370> typing<00:02:52.090> is

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
on here and I find that typing is

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.510 
on here and I find that typing is
significantly<00:02:52.930> more<00:02:53.140> accurate<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:54.010> tell<00:02:54.250> that

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
significantly more accurate to tell that

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.120 
significantly more accurate to tell that
you<00:02:54.640> know

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
you know

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.740 
you know
if<00:02:55.460> you<00:02:55.580> drop<00:02:55.850> it<00:02:55.880> it's<00:02:56.150> not<00:02:56.330> going<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.600> break

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
if you drop it it's not going to break

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.360 
if you drop it it's not going to break
