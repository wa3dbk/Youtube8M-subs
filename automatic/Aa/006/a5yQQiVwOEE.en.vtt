traditionally<00:00:37.220> any<00:00:37.490> change<00:00:37.910> create<00:00:38.690> some

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
traditionally any change create some

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.230 
traditionally any change create some
confusions<00:00:39.770> and<00:00:39.860> create<00:00:40.430> some<00:00:40.670> people<00:00:41.030> who

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.240

doesn't like you know and i think some
time<00:00:45.770> two<00:00:45.920> times<00:00:46.100> we<00:00:46.250> need<00:00:46.430> to<00:00:46.610> change<00:00:46.940> the

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
time two times we need to change the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.760 
time two times we need to change the
regulation<00:00:47.660> first<00:00:48.050> of<00:00:48.200> all<00:00:48.290> to<00:00:48.440> keep<00:00:48.620> the

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
regulation first of all to keep the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.150 
regulation first of all to keep the
motivation<00:00:48.950> for<00:00:49.370> our<00:00:49.730> engineers<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:51.680> bring

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
motivation for our engineers to bring

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.150 
motivation for our engineers to bring
some<00:00:52.430> new<00:00:52.580> partners<00:00:53.120> some<00:00:53.390> new<00:00:53.540> technology<00:00:54.160> to

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
some new partners some new technology to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.130 
some new partners some new technology to
create<00:00:55.310> some<00:00:55.640> new<00:00:55.670> interest<00:00:56.240> and<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.930> create

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
create some new interest and to create

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.760 
create some new interest and to create
some<00:00:57.350> new<00:00:57.380> challenge<00:01:01.780> my<00:01:02.780> father<00:01:03.200> had<00:01:03.410> today

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
some new challenge my father had today

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.970 
some new challenge my father had today
so<00:01:03.920> we<00:01:04.850> this<00:01:05.540> is<00:01:05.720> what<00:01:05.900> i<00:01:05.930> would<00:01:06.170> say<00:01:06.350> because

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
so we this is what i would say because

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.260 
so we this is what i would say because
we<00:01:07.540> obviously<00:01:08.540> we<00:01:09.110> we<00:01:09.800> we<00:01:10.640> understand<00:01:11.150> the

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
we obviously we we we understand the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.360 
we obviously we we we understand the
concern<00:01:11.690> of<00:01:11.720> all<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.470> fans<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:12.980> i<00:01:13.160> think

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
concern of all the fans and i think

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.040 
concern of all the fans and i think
there<00:01:13.520> was<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.640> lot<00:01:13.820> of<00:01:13.850> noise<00:01:14.300> in<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:14.660> price<00:01:14.870> in

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
there was a lot of noise in the price in

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.380 
there was a lot of noise in the price in
the<00:01:15.170> media<00:01:15.470> about<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:16.100> engine<00:01:16.520> noise<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.090> the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
the media about the engine noise and the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.810 
the media about the engine noise and the
attraction<00:01:17.930> or<00:01:18.140> formula<00:01:19.100> one<00:01:19.250> in<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.490> future

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
attraction or formula one in the future

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.840 
attraction or formula one in the future
I<00:01:19.970> with<00:01:20.720> these<00:01:20.900> very<00:01:20.930> small<00:01:21.350> engine<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.190> not

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
I with these very small engine and not

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.410 
I with these very small engine and not
revving<00:01:23.270> very<00:01:23.540> high<00:01:24.790> nobody<00:01:25.790> knows<00:01:26.000> yet<00:01:26.210> you

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
revving very high nobody knows yet you

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.490 
revving very high nobody knows yet you
know<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.500> I<00:01:27.920> think<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.520> best<00:01:29.050> for<00:01:30.050> a<00:01:30.080> for<00:01:30.380> the

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
know so I think the best for a for the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.250 
know so I think the best for a for the
future<00:01:30.800> of<00:01:30.830> formula<00:01:31.220> 1<00:01:31.370> is<00:01:31.520> 2<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:32.210> have<00:01:32.330> a<00:01:32.360> clear

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
future of formula 1 is 2 to have a clear

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.200 
future of formula 1 is 2 to have a clear
commitment<00:01:33.500> from<00:01:34.040> everybody<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.970> very

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
commitment from everybody and the very

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.640 
commitment from everybody and the very
good<00:01:35.360> communications<00:01:35.990> around<00:01:36.290> to<00:01:36.470> make<00:01:36.620> sure

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
good communications around to make sure

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.490 
good communications around to make sure
that<00:01:37.010> whatever<00:01:38.000> we<00:01:38.360> are<00:01:38.390> we<00:01:38.780> are<00:01:38.930> building<00:01:39.110> for

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
that whatever we are we are building for

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.219 
that whatever we are we are building for
the<00:01:39.530> future<00:01:39.620> if<00:01:40.340> one<00:01:40.610> will<00:01:41.240> be<00:01:41.540> part<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.870> what's

feel that formula one needs to be road
car<00:01:59.270> relevant<00:01:59.810> I<00:01:59.900> mean<00:02:00.200> open-wheel<00:02:00.770> sports

think that it would affect the
environmental<00:02:38.010> impact<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.370> f1<00:02:38.670> very<00:02:38.880> much<00:02:39.030> but

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
environmental impact of f1 very much but

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.720 
environmental impact of f1 very much but
it'll<00:02:39.989> help<00:02:40.110> much<00:02:40.350> no<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.739> mean<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.370> fuel

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
it'll help much no I mean the fuel

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.220 
it'll help much no I mean the fuel
