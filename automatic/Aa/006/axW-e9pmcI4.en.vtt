00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.669
 friends 16 walks that we find 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.169
 today for a new video 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:29.779
 against crab and calabria so has and bosco 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.880
 hillsides so these are two modes of 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.530
 mine quest day 2.16 I can be 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.010
 pretty boring if we do not have to good 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.290
 technique then first skull to arm 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.280
 so he first of all a vulnerable state does 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.040
 to kill him it must have caused him 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.089
 damage to push when these 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.750
 will be done already as soon as you push it 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:53.329
 you receive about 500 8 506 without 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.359
 damage r so every time you the 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.930
 to move is a pity to push 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.390
 tours etc 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.440
 you receive a lot of damage 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.260
 several times a lap so with my 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.869
 brother beware and you have 40% 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.320
 constant erosion as soon as you 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.940
 put this wilma state invoked gold octopus 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:16.310
 so this little paul pla who every turn 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.659
 will you attract if possible online 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.000
 right so in heal you are you 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.530
 800 treats in my me what I did 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.489
 and I micra lab in one of these two 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.170
 boxes so pretty free then he goes 

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:29.660
 invoke for the port behind me I 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.819
 go around and push it though 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.140
 be careful if you finish your 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.030
 turn next to one of the two you 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.479
 so die for those breeds that do not 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.819
 not spells like scares 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.250
 evade to do on enemies etc 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.840
 it gets a little boring because you 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.280
 are unable to leave the crab in 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.720
 hut 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.849
 otherwise tie as soon as he lost that state 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.440
 so as soon as they describe a bouquet 

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:53.629
 for wearing when to a spell that goes 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.509
 hit more or less than 1200 r a lap 

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:58.280
 out of two with a minimum range of 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.660
 four it seems to me and advertisers to 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.270
 which will also hit the 1200 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.580
 get low minimum so every turn 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.530
 opposite direction one on the other so done 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.940
 enough attention he is very strong with 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.190
 the 40% of the rosebushes become very 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.140
 hot as a fight you have to survive 12 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.390
 turns and then he just goes 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.190
 die then my technique so like 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.260
 you see it's right to put hen 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.780
 wearing in front of her hen for each time 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.000
 he attracts me 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.700
 and then I go forward one box and I 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.459
 pass my turn this way you groan 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.270
 had stuck he can not attack me 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.150
 know also that invocations 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.260
 dies from the beginning of the turn of 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.300
 the opponent no matter where she stands 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.740
 so find less the samada if they 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.650
 can possibly release m 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.120
 then from the ink down we go out and 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.040
 then only or for example 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.400
 wild boar did his fate is then 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.080
 only make a release on 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.860
 octopus gold I concede you have not hurt 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.690
 of escape because thanks to 72 tackle so 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.250
 me with my annif mine 7.9 to 162 more 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.880
 I 'm going to be a bit abused but that 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.709
 works so here it is dead on 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.080
 going on now to the second bob that's 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.220
 so beautiful knife is another way 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.239
 which also allows to unlock 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.850
 the elevator of the next room so 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.610
 this one he has a little harder already 6 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.440
 finally in general because it's good 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.160
 more really technical that is 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.230
 100% reliable like this before this 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.620
 Once again, he has 11000 vibe points 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:30.049
 scotto with 10 pm base ivo one shot 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.760
 at the cac 50% of infinite erosion so done 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.620
 very careful and actually every time 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.600
 that you are going to attack with a spell by 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.070
 damage line he will lose a pm 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.049
 you see here he lost 1 pm for a 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.250
 maximum turn 5 pm lost this way 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.670
 so this way you avoid them 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.670
 go to the cac 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.280
 also know that you will not have to 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.780
 go over 10 p o of him if not he 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.910
 will do a spell that gives him more 4 pm 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.190
 and the maple tables for a ride so 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.459
 we stayed maximum at 10 2 in jacou or 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.920
 to be able to hit him 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.510
 also one in three turn he will do 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.840
 a spell that takes you away 2pm during a 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.040
 turn a table debate and he has another 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.720
 go right in. 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.569
 as he saw there he hit me from sis in 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.430
 water that will make more or less than 1200 me 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.030
 I had 45 % resistance to my 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:23.130
 ferry from 1200 to by giving you two to 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.330
 four countries so it's quite practical to 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.320
 this way you really have a lot 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.930
 a lot of peace especially for 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.610
 attacked him enough times 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.310
 so here I won the guys from 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.570
 father he hit me and with the 50% 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.340
 erosion it goes down pretty fast you 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.479
 also see that spell hits oh and 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.520
 and then he's half of what he 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.229
 strikes so in fact there you are 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.250
 completely each time by cons 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.389
 the points of the imax go down to that 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.370
 empty so be careful you have to 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.760
 to hit the body-to-body quickly enough 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.900
 however does not affect absolutely 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.010
 the pm who has it so if you make a 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.919
 eternal peck it will not he 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.080
 remove 3pm unfortunately that's it 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.030
 then also another thing he 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.440
 could know if ever so really 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.390
 you can attack in close combat 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.930
 with a spell or a cac 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.650
 however the only one a true pm and that's 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.520
 not rewind the previous round 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.539
 however you will also receive 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.039
 about 1200 1200 of a master so that's 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:21.660
 quite significant especially with the 50% 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:22.770
 erosion and so be careful but that 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.440
 can be a backup solution if 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.480
 never 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.700
 finally you can still roll 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.860
 back as I was he also a little 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.200
 hot if you try to remove him from 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:38.150
 push it a priori also during the 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.230
 pdp m apart with his fate you go 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.300
 receive 500 damage 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.720
 r about a little more even a bit like 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.040
 with the last murder at the ab so in 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.360
 both cases it is not necessary too 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.300
 saoufet outbreaks quite a lot of 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.620
 damage on every day you have 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.000
 you see here he's already almost dead 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.020
 it was not too hard but when 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 even had to do several tests for 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.450
 understand well love them all to buy 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.070
 a ferry 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:03.320
 otherwise he will kill me he still has not hurt 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:04.460
 of damage to each time the 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.710
 wanted this embarrassment a bit limited but if 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.160
 hit me millet every turn I 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.160
 invite you dead 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:14.509
 so here he is going to boost me again 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.639
 four countries so it's still 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.559
 strong enough is what he boos us had 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.369
 a lot of peace , however, it will be very 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:22.159
 very bad 

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:23.149
 after very strong so there he has not me 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:25.580
 heal all my life so he 

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:27.409
 not exactly cure here so here I 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.819
 kill it i hope you liked video 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.110
 see you soon for a video on 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:30.860
 the mercator 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.740
 now I 'm trying to find how 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.209
 him and to remove him the invulnerable state 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.899
 and thus we find ourselves soon had 

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:37.899
 expressed cô
