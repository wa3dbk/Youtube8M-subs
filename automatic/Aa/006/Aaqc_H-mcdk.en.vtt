00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
of these s buttons again I just want to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.149 
of these s buttons again I just want to
show<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.509> charger<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:05.100> is

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
show you this is the charger this is

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.920 
show you this is the charger this is
really<00:02:05.579> lightweight<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.360> mean<00:02:06.689> there's<00:02:06.869> really

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
really lightweight I mean there's really

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.949 
really lightweight I mean there's really
nothing<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.680> I'm<00:02:07.890> surprised<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.280> I

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
nothing to this I'm surprised that I

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.109 
nothing to this I'm surprised that I
have

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
have

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.240 
have
idea<00:02:10.330> how<00:02:10.450> this<00:02:10.599> works<00:02:10.810> but<00:02:11.620> as<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:11.980> can<00:02:12.099> see

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
idea how this works but as you can see

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.960 
idea how this works but as you can see
the<00:02:12.370> indentations<00:02:13.060> they<00:02:13.930> match<00:02:14.170> the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
the indentations they match the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.920 
the indentations they match the
indentations<00:02:15.970> on<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.269> back<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:16.720> watch

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
indentations on the back of the watch

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.320 
indentations on the back of the watch
you<00:02:17.430> just<00:02:18.430> place<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.730> on<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.120> stand<00:02:19.390> as<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:19.989> and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
you just place it on the stand as so and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.960 
you just place it on the stand as so and
then<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.510> can<00:02:22.659> see<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.989> tics<00:02:23.640> there's<00:02:24.640> three

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
then you can see the tics there's three

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.140 
then you can see the tics there's three
of<00:02:25.120> them<00:02:25.269> if<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.870> look<00:02:26.049> closely<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:27.150> means

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
of them if you look closely that means

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.270 
of them if you look closely that means
it's<00:02:28.329> charging<00:02:28.690> when<00:02:29.409> you<00:02:29.500> get<00:02:29.650> all<00:02:29.890> three<00:02:30.190> of

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
it's charging when you get all three of

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.780 
it's charging when you get all three of
the<00:02:30.400> tics

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
the tics

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.330 
the tics
flashing<00:02:31.390> at<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.629> same<00:02:31.870> time<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:33.099> means

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
flashing at the same time that means

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.759 
flashing at the same time that means
it's<00:02:33.519> fully<00:02:33.730> charged<00:02:34.180> now

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
it's fully charged now

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.460 
it's fully charged now
MTM<00:02:36.640> requires<00:02:37.120> they<00:02:37.540> suggest<00:02:38.019> that<00:02:38.110> you

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
MTM requires they suggest that you

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.349 
MTM requires they suggest that you
recharge<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.610> watch<00:02:39.909> at<00:02:40.870> least<00:02:40.900> once<00:02:41.409> a<00:02:41.560> month

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
recharge the watch at least once a month

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.509 
recharge the watch at least once a month
when<00:02:43.359> the<00:02:43.450> watch<00:02:43.660> wears<00:02:44.530> down<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:44.920> guess<00:02:45.340> it's

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
when the watch wears down I guess it's

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.220 
when the watch wears down I guess it's
really<00:02:45.670> bad<00:02:45.940> for<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.269> battery<00:02:46.599> and<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.079> can

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
really bad for the battery and you can

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.140 
really bad for the battery and you can
really<00:02:47.379> damage<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.220> they<00:02:48.549> don't<00:02:48.670> recommend

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
really damage it so they don't recommend

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.539 
really damage it so they don't recommend
that<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.540> place<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.650> on<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:50.859> charger<00:02:51.099> once<00:02:51.430> a

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
that I place it on the charger once a

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.369 
that I place it on the charger once a
month<00:02:51.730> then<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.180> takes<00:02:52.359> anywhere<00:02:52.690> from<00:02:52.840> six<00:02:53.319> to

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
month then it takes anywhere from six to

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.729 
month then it takes anywhere from six to
eight<00:02:53.500> hours<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:55.180> recharge<00:02:55.629> so<00:02:56.019> that's<00:02:56.500> not

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
eight hours to to recharge so that's not

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:57.270 
eight hours to to recharge so that's not
too<00:02:56.859> bad

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
too bad

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.140
