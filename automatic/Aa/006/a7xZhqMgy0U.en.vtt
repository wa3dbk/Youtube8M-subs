form is a murder cycle as you can see
I'm<00:00:40.800> not<00:00:41.129> quite<00:00:41.460> sure<00:00:41.489> whether<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.239> fitting

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
I'm not quite sure whether it's fitting

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.290 
I'm not quite sure whether it's fitting
for<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> character<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.340> works<00:00:44.910> fine<00:00:45.270> I

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
for the character but it works fine I

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.510 
for the character but it works fine I
suppose

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
suppose

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.660 
suppose
now<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.120> mold<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.780> mode<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.289> okay<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
now the mold in this mode is okay the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.090 
now the mold in this mode is okay the
proportions<00:00:51.329> are<00:00:51.510> good<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.530> has<00:00:52.680> some<00:00:52.980> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
proportions are good and it has some of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.439 
proportions are good and it has some of
the<00:00:53.160> features<00:00:53.340> you'd<00:00:53.760> expect<00:00:53.850> from<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the features you'd expect from a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.619 
the features you'd expect from a
motorcycle<00:00:54.980> such<00:00:55.980> as<00:00:56.190> handlebars<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.539> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
motorcycle such as handlebars and a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.400 
motorcycle such as handlebars and a
chain<00:00:57.899> guard<00:00:58.550> it<00:00:59.550> also<00:00:59.789> has<00:01:00.180> two<00:01:00.660> retractable

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
chain guard it also has two retractable

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.579 
chain guard it also has two retractable
kickstands<00:01:01.949> instead<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:03.320> so<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.439> can

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
kickstands instead of just one so it can

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.800 
kickstands instead of just one so it can
sit<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:05.010> straight<00:01:05.400> without<00:01:05.820> falling<00:01:06.420> over<00:01:06.570> I

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
sit up straight without falling over I

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.539 
sit up straight without falling over I
like<00:01:09.810> how<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.140> missiles<00:01:10.650> act<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.130> exhaust

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
like how the missiles act as exhaust

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.920 
like how the missiles act as exhaust
pipes<00:01:11.850> what<00:01:12.540> with<00:01:12.689> their<00:01:12.900> coloring<00:01:13.290> at<00:01:13.560> all

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
pipes what with their coloring at all

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.929 
pipes what with their coloring at all
aside<00:01:15.930> from<00:01:15.960> stowing<00:01:16.470> them<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.729> can

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
aside from stowing them here you can

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.890 
aside from stowing them here you can
insert<00:01:18.119> them<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.020> back

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.320 

then<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.680> press<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.100> buttons<00:01:26.160> and<00:01:26.820> they

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
then you press these buttons and they

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.310 
then you press these buttons and they
fire<00:01:28.070> either<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.370> just<00:01:29.700> missiles<00:01:30.120> or<00:01:30.480> exhaust

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320

plumes<00:01:31.650> which<00:01:32.460> i<00:01:32.640> think<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:33.030> pretty<00:01:33.270> nifty

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
plumes which i think is pretty nifty

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.060 
plumes which i think is pretty nifty
there<00:01:36.240> aren't<00:01:36.690> really<00:01:36.870> any<00:01:37.050> Mac<00:01:37.620> extras

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
there aren't really any Mac extras

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.790 
there aren't really any Mac extras
visible<00:01:38.580> although<00:01:39.480> some<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.200> seams<00:01:40.500> are

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
visible although some of the seams are

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.330 
visible although some of the seams are
pretty<00:01:41.040> ugly

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.820 

the<00:01:44.340> colors<00:01:44.760> however<00:01:45.230> practically<00:01:46.230> ruin<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
the colors however practically ruin the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.420 
the colors however practically ruin the
disguise<00:01:47.250> element<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.950> appreciate<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:49.980> they

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
disguise element I appreciate that they

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.040 
disguise element I appreciate that they
have<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.790> stick<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.210> spider-man's<00:01:51.810> costume

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
have to stick to spider-man's costume

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.220 
have to stick to spider-man's costume

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.590 
attached this is the only area where it
falls<00:02:04.800> behind<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.520> black<00:02:05.729> costume<00:02:06.000> version

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
falls behind the black costume version

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.900 
falls behind the black costume version
which<00:02:07.290> blends<00:02:07.800> everything<00:02:08.040> together<00:02:08.490> better

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
which blends everything together better

aside from all that red and blue aren't
really<00:02:15.090> practical<00:02:15.690> colors<00:02:16.050> for<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.320> motorcycle

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
really practical colors for a motorcycle

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.690 
really practical colors for a motorcycle
when<00:02:17.940> used<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.360> these<00:02:18.480> amounts<00:02:18.780> anyway<00:02:19.700> at

when used in these amounts anyway at

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.820 
when used in these amounts anyway at
least<00:02:20.760> reverb<00:02:21.600> had<00:02:21.810> additional<00:02:22.080> colors<00:02:22.650> and

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
least reverb had additional colors and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.770 
least reverb had additional colors and
decals<00:02:25.010> although<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.310> do<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.390> use<00:02:27.420> of

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
decals although I do like the use of

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.430 
decals although I do like the use of
silver<00:02:28.170> on<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.890> wheels<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:30.840> also<00:02:31.140> like<00:02:31.410> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
silver on the wheels and I also like the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.410 
silver on the wheels and I also like the
fact<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.070> windshield<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.790> cleverly

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
fact that the windshield is cleverly

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.449 
fact that the windshield is cleverly
deco<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.170> resemble<00:02:34.650> spider-man's<00:02:35.220> head<00:02:37.459> the

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
deco to resemble spider-man's head the

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.670 
deco to resemble spider-man's head the
transformation<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.510> almost<00:02:39.870> exactly<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
transformation is almost exactly the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:03:09.110 
transformation is almost exactly the
same<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:41.310> movie<00:02:41.700> RC<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:43.260> first<00:02:43.530> one<00:02:43.800> I<00:02:43.830> mean

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.300 

the<00:03:10.120> main<00:03:10.360> difference<00:03:10.990> however<00:03:11.260> is<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
the main difference however is that the
