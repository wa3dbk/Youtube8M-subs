00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.080 
but I guess that's how things work now
but<00:03:29.099> what<00:03:29.220> I'm<00:03:29.310> saying<00:03:29.549> is<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.760> seems<00:03:29.940> like

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.759 
but what I'm saying is it seems like
nowadays<00:03:30.299> people<00:03:30.750> don't<00:03:30.959> even<00:03:31.260> have<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.620> have

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
nowadays people don't even have to have

nowadays people don't even have to have
like<00:03:32.129> a<00:03:32.430> halfway<00:03:33.030> clever<00:03:33.660> pickup<00:03:34.109> line<00:03:34.319> if
