seen before someone's got to have done
it<00:01:26.860> because<00:01:26.950> someone<00:01:27.340> does<00:01:27.460> everything<00:01:27.880> I'm

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
trying to change yet tell the same sort

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.830 
trying to change yet tell the same sort
of<00:02:30.160> feel<00:02:30.400> it's<00:02:30.670> it's<00:02:30.850> a<00:02:30.970> it's<00:02:31.300> really<00:02:31.600> kind<00:02:31.780> of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
of feel it's it's a it's really kind of

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.470 
of feel it's it's a it's really kind of
an<00:02:31.930> interesting<00:02:32.140> hybrid
