00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 today we are going to make some lemon cupcakes 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.259
 the ingredients for the dough are 200 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.000
 grams of brown sugar 180 grams of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.429
 flour a teaspoon and a half of 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.679
 Baking powder 3 eggs 100

 milliliters of oil a Greek yogurt of 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.420
 lemon 120 milliliters of right and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.750
 semi-skimmed and 2 tablespoons of juice 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.880
 lemon the ingredients for the cream are 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.310
 500 grams of cheese spread type 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.189
 philadelphia 200 grams of icing sugar 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.230
 the zest of two rascals and 5 drops 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.369
 lemon essence 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.920
 let's go putting in the bowl of the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.380
 blender the eggs and let's start 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.380
 beating at low speed 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.330
 once we have the eggs more or less 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:49.220
 integrated with each other we go 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:52.470
 to add the sugar then the oil 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.320
 and milk 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.660
 and when they are well integrated they are followed 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.090
 The above ingredients will 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.090
 we will add the lemon yogurt 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.240
 we are beating and now we are going to 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.380
 incorporate the flour together with the 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.380
 sifted yeast 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:20.610
 and we will also say the two tablespoons of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.500
 lemon juice we leave beating 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.440
 for a few more seconds until it is 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.440
 the totally homogeneous mass once 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.530
 we have the mass ready let's take 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.870
 our molds for cupcakes and we're going 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.820
 to fill in half once 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.110
 let's have all the molds stuffed what 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.430
 what we are going to do is preheat the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.550
 180 degree oven to 180 degrees and let's 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.380
 to bake them for 20 22 minutes a 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.750
 Once baked we let them cool 5 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.200
 minutes on your tray and then the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.540
 let's cool everything in a grid 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.310
 let's prepare a cream let's put 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.700
 in the bowl 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.280
 the weight and what we are going to do is 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.220
 let's go around 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.740
 the speed goes down so we can stay 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.050
 a softer cream 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.380
 once you see that the cheese is already 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.810
 with a soft texture we will add 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.810
 the previously sieved icing sugar 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.810
 it is very important to always put everything 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:31.350
 sifted because this way we will avoid 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.350
 lumps when well incorporated 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.790
 and the sugar with the cheese we are going to add 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.360
 in the lemon zest 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.019
 and then we will add the drops 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.290
 of lemon essence and let's say to 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:51.019
 leave beating a few more seconds 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.260
 at medium high speed until 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.200
 let's have the cream ready once we have 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.349
 the cream ready let's put it in a 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.709
 manga pastelera have put a 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:06.409
 large star nozzle open and 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.379
 let's proceed to decorate them once 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.670
 we have all the cupcakes decorated what 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:15.810
 what are we going to do is 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.480
 with some yellow sugars 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.020
 we're going to put a few inches by 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.020
 over 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.650
 As you can see, decoration is very 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.650
 simple for these cupcakes that are 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.650
 delicious 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.760
 I hope you like it
