00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.289
 to do all that is in 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.410
 joints start with peel 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.350
 the movement which means we are here 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.920
 So here you see a little wrist 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.970
 and then we break the elbow on Saturday at the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.969
 wrist will straighten 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.649

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.270
 4 the shoulders is a small movement 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.079
 but beat the shoulders that pulls a little bit in 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.370
 the shoulder because you have to switch 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.160
 shoulder forward 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.899
 otherwise braille will stay behind so 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.750
 it's not pretty so a good night because it 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.010
 works here monday if we were here 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.329
 so break the wrist ok ok let's go 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.360
 carry on while you're going to bend the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.050
 elbow on the wrist he will stand up 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.550
 hop and the les paul and forth here and 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.240
 then you continue it's the shoulder 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:11.369
 whose klaus is that right here ok so you 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.260
 are here good so boom past we pass 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:19.320
 on the shoulder and I do the opposite 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.650
 but it's the shoulder up good boom boom 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.670
 and there you rock on the other shoulders 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.540
 or less ok and then continued on 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.340
 the elbow 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.030
 you put your elbow up but while 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.750
 you're going to ride your elbow the shoulder is going 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.530
 resume his place 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.670
 you go bc the shoulder ok you and when 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.320
 you obviously climb the elbow 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.899
 wrist also positioned there is going to be 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.790
 broken ok so you're here good ben I 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.399
 repeat this here which you are going to mount 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.079
 the elbow the wrist and the ash and 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.369
 this is ok here okay up up good and 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.159
 the shoulder you mark he's always in 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.899
 so before the mess man there we come 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.000
 to break down the wave 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.130
 that's what you have to do first 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.659
 place at the beginning when you start your 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.799
 beginnings you will not be able to be there 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.450
 to make joints 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.300
 because I will move on to something else 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.660
 it's still the wave 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:16.860
 if we are here which means up 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.580
 knuckles two joints up handle 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.459
 elbows shoulders shoulder elbow wrist 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.170
 phalange hop there is the wave of the visual 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.790
 but the other one is the wave 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.340
 just been broken down so we come back 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:35.489
 phalanx pape handle shoulders elbows 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.800
 shoulder elbow wrist up and phalanges 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.510
 and have streamed so must I give the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.300
 visual when you 're here what we see 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.790
 often hop here boom 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.769
 so here you have had a glimpse of this 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.890
 which is the wave what is called the 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.090
 wave the web the ripples what ge 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.660
 it must be understood that requires a lot 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.660
 working
