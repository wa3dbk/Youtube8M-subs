 What Is that the middle When this say was what the heck

 It's a NES-like 10:00 gal, isn't it ? 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:37.530
 The selection of songs under this that 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:42.149
 With that knob or button you like 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.899
 Can you Tsu'm I mean this is also that of the earlier 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.820
 In the same way to synchronize the knob 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.829
 Let me do 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.670
 If Moraere Press that favorite button operation in it that 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.770
 It is as much as you will in fact be in the controller 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:07.110
 Well this is also easy to use, but this trick is that 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.440
 It's a Pioneer dj mixer, so it's about 700 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.240
 Function called role 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:17.150
 I'd like to put on rolls I think that I have a lot of ul I think so much 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.140
 It seems like people who are not using other pioneers 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.140
 Speaking Well simple 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:32.090
 Over the role in the rust of the head that is in the rust of the song 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:37.490
 When you originated the theory loop is released in the state of applying old theory z When the mold hill date ending Iusu 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.180
 Nde rust from Sabika also begins or rust that it's right in the loop I day does not listen 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.530
 It starts from 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.390
 Thank you very much 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.390
 It is using in that say 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.390
 jr 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.040
 So Well I do a little description I'd think it and understood When the function Well flow actual song 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.640
 It will be such a thing to explain in the mouth 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.090
 Let's make that function so it is a lotion 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.340
 9 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:14.569
 Well it is a state with a name 3 d panel 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:14.569
 Of a place called f and the deck because it uses the song to the left of the deck on the left this time 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.530
 Also 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:24.410
 50,000 there 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:32.900
 You're a princess, I'll tell you below and use that there 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:38.520
 To put on the function of the roll, let's loop that much novel of the roll first 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.580
 To adjust the width of the novel, such as temporary loop 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.040
 this 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:49.110
 This is a knob at the center first 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:53.300
 In such Fu in the manner of it this is in the previous effect 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.300
 If you everyone's here Look school 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.620
 io 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.500
 Looping novel 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:07.300
 The width will be adjustable here 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:12.230
 But it seems like it's the same as a rappel, and I haven't pressed the loop button 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:16.430
 It's like this, but it looks like it's just numbers 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.380
 Give the function a roll Not so changed 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.510
 Let it roll 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.290
 The function of that old roux 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:30.360
 I will synchronize the button to turn on and off from now 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:38.970
 Well , it 's the bottom of the middle of the Hidehito deck once more. 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:40.230
 Because this is a roll on / off switch called loop roll 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.440
 that 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.130
 I think I want to do it and do it button 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.790
 I'll do it here 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.790
 This way 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:56.370
 This is how wide the rape is 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.370
 Only school when you have push-button 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.850
 Tteyuu village will be in the wind Even though this cheap midi controller 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.770
 Yes, in this kind of Fu 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:14.970
 Would with features 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.970
 This part is nine minutes after this early this time 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.910
 Hey you 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:24.540
 Well, there is a button to control the name of the child's name. 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.330
 Knob also It is also the claw tree 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.070
 Because there is such a thing 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:35.640
 Also of his 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:36.460
 Other key brain can also be attached more and more as long as the manner've done now Sakekoe as you like 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:43.180
 I will 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:48.000
 But that I this time I think you try only to the ne effects and doll that 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:51.750
 Can you customize these things as you like? 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.560
 So I do it with the keyboard 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.960
 that 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:02.190
 There are also 9 point mistakes and sample button mistakes. 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:05.730
 If you remember exactly what you put on the keyboard 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.810
 There is no mistake and your own original controller 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.430
 I could make a stone 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.960
 It will be west 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.910
 In Emma 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:18.849
 While this Well today is this only this easy description because this time 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.500
 So say Datte change the fact what Kuru 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.580
 This I would like to try this 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.220
 It is in Well then 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:30.340
 Have you look at the screen once again 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:38.010
 The right button on the right eye of the midi button 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:40.400
 Usually of so please Yes Then it becomes impossible that 3 o'clock set to Yes 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.460
 Become a scratch live 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.220
 And return to the mode The only difference is that 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:50.050
 Whether a standing or or with this kind of effect 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.230
 Since only you have to move if Moraere touching the key 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.890
 I can not come out with this 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:06:01.460
 And when I usually do dj 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:01.460
 If you do not press in 3 it means that it works normally
