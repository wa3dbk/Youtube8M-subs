00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.870 

this<00:00:44.780> is<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.080> space<00:00:45.470> reverb<00:00:46.130> from<00:00:46.340> Eventide

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
this is the space reverb from Eventide

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.940 
this is the space reverb from Eventide
and<00:00:47.410> we're<00:00:48.410> gonna<00:00:48.500> take<00:00:48.590> a<00:00:48.650> look<00:00:48.770> at<00:00:48.860> the

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
and we're gonna take a look at the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.770 
and we're gonna take a look at the
spring<00:00:49.280> algorithm<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.210> I've<00:00:50.510> got<00:00:50.629> to<00:00:50.720> be

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
spring algorithm and I've got to be

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.100 
spring algorithm and I've got to be
honest<00:00:51.110> it<00:00:51.290> sounds<00:00:51.559> really<00:00:51.800> good<00:00:52.930> I've<00:00:53.930> never

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
honest it sounds really good I've never

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.220 
honest it sounds really good I've never
been<00:00:54.410> a<00:00:54.440> huge<00:00:54.770> spring<00:00:55.129> reverb<00:00:55.340> fan<00:00:55.850> but<00:00:56.510> this

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
been a huge spring reverb fan but this

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.440 
been a huge spring reverb fan but this
thing<00:00:57.760> sounds<00:00:58.760> really<00:00:58.970> good<00:00:59.090> I<00:00:59.150> played<00:00:59.330> a<00:00:59.360> lot

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
thing sounds really good I played a lot

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.799 
thing sounds really good I played a lot
of<00:00:59.739> fenders<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:00.950> some<00:01:01.100> boxes<00:01:01.580> with<00:01:02.210> reverb

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
of fenders and some boxes with reverb

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:03.850 
of fenders and some boxes with reverb
and<00:01:02.989> it's<00:01:03.080> actually<00:01:03.320> sitting<00:01:03.440> on<00:01:03.530> top<00:01:03.680> of<00:01:03.739> this

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
and it's actually sitting on top of this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.220 
and it's actually sitting on top of this
dr.<00:01:04.250> Z<00:01:04.460> that<00:01:04.970> has<00:01:05.120> spring<00:01:05.360> reverb<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:05.900> it<00:01:05.960> just

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
dr. Z that has spring reverb and it just

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.510 
dr. Z that has spring reverb and it just
I<00:01:06.409> mean<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:06.560> sounds<00:01:06.830> honestly<00:01:07.190> it<00:01:07.280> sounds

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
I mean it sounds honestly it sounds

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.149 
I mean it sounds honestly it sounds
better<00:01:07.670> than<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.909> Z<00:01:08.090> sorry<00:01:08.810> Z<00:01:09.350> folks<00:01:09.590> but<00:01:09.830> it

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
better than the Z sorry Z folks but it

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.880 
better than the Z sorry Z folks but it
does<00:01:11.230> I'm<00:01:12.230> gonna<00:01:12.380> kind<00:01:12.500> of<00:01:12.530> walk<00:01:12.650> you<00:01:12.770> through

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
does I'm gonna kind of walk you through

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.260 
does I'm gonna kind of walk you through
the<00:01:12.950> knobs<00:01:13.130> here<00:01:13.370> and<00:01:13.580> show<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:13.790> what<00:01:13.940> some<00:01:14.240> of

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
the knobs here and show you what some of

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.210 
the knobs here and show you what some of
the<00:01:14.390> things<00:01:14.540> do<00:01:14.780> mix<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:15.680> decay<00:01:15.920> are<00:01:16.040> pretty

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
the things do mix and decay are pretty

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.260 
the things do mix and decay are pretty
standard

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
standard

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.660 
standard
I<00:01:17.330> don't<00:01:18.020> think<00:01:18.050> explain<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.130> size<00:01:19.370> knob

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
I don't think explain that the size knob

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.370 
I don't think explain that the size knob
actually<00:01:19.850> controls<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.720> tension<00:01:21.229> on<00:01:21.350> the

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
actually controls the tension on the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.410 
actually controls the tension on the
springs<00:01:21.860> but<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:22.520> can<00:01:22.640> give<00:01:22.760> you<00:01:22.850> some<00:01:23.060> pretty

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
springs but you can give you some pretty

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.960 
springs but you can give you some pretty
interesting<00:01:23.750> textures<00:01:24.470> i'll<00:01:24.950> go<00:01:25.100> back<00:01:25.250> to<00:01:25.520> the

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
interesting textures i'll go back to the

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.940 
interesting textures i'll go back to the
preset<00:01:26.450> without<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.930> without<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.479> tremolo

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
preset without the without the tremolo

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.980 
preset without the without the tremolo
but<00:01:33.550> you<00:01:34.550> get<00:01:34.700> real<00:01:34.880> snappy<00:01:35.390> or<00:01:35.600> loosen<00:01:35.930> a

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
but you get real snappy or loosen a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:50.740 
but you get real snappy or loosen a
bobbin<00:01:48.850> that's<00:01:49.850> really<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:50.360> know<00:01:50.390> tight

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
bobbin that's really you know tight

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.880 
bobbin that's really you know tight
sounding<00:01:51.170> there<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.650> can<00:01:51.770> actually

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
sounding there and you can actually

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.710 
sounding there and you can actually
change<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.520> number<00:01:52.940> of<00:01:53.030> Springs<00:01:53.330> with<00:01:53.690> a

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
change the number of Springs with a

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.800 
change the number of Springs with a
delay<00:01:53.990> knob<00:01:54.230> between<00:01:54.620> 1<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.280> 3<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.360> don't<00:01:56.570> know

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
delay knob between 1 and 3 I don't know

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:14.130 
delay knob between 1 and 3 I don't know
if<00:01:56.900> even<00:01:56.990> ty<00:01:57.230> will<00:01:57.380> ever<00:01:58.420> expand<00:01:59.420> on<00:01:59.570> that<00:01:59.780> but

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.339 

pretty<00:02:15.140> awesome<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:17.209> that's<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.989> spring

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
pretty awesome so that's the the spring

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.809 
pretty awesome so that's the the spring
tension<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.860> says<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.430> manual

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
tension it says in the manual

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.580 
tension it says in the manual
something<00:02:20.239> about<00:02:20.450> house<00:02:20.660> for<00:02:20.930> me<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.470> gets

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
something about house for me it gets

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.860 
something about house for me it gets
what<00:02:21.769> I<00:02:21.800> think<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.099> kind<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.340> fun<00:02:22.519> but<00:02:22.870> that

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
what I think is kind of fun but that

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.420 
what I think is kind of fun but that
kind<00:02:24.019> of<00:02:24.050> gives<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.260> an<00:02:24.319> idea<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.980> tension

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
kind of gives you an idea of the tension

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.130 
kind of gives you an idea of the tension
and<00:02:25.610> this<00:02:26.030> brain<00:02:26.360> count<00:02:26.569> you<00:02:26.750> can<00:02:26.870> put<00:02:27.050> in

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
and this brain count you can put in

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.130 
and this brain count you can put in
there<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:28.280> EQ<00:02:28.670> controls<00:02:28.790> feet<00:02:29.480> function<00:02:30.050> as

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
there the EQ controls feet function as

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.500 
there the EQ controls feet function as
damping<00:02:30.560> controls<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.519> on<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.879> first<00:02:32.090> preset

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
damping controls so on that first preset

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.839 
damping controls so on that first preset
I<00:02:32.720> had<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.260> lot<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.620> low<00:02:33.769> end<00:02:33.800> cut<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.430> not

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
I had a lot of the low end cut and not

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:35.920 
I had a lot of the low end cut and not
very<00:02:35.060> much<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.390> high<00:02:35.569> but<00:02:35.780> what's

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
very much of the high but what's

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.630 
very much of the high but what's
interesting<00:02:36.200> here<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.739> contour<00:02:37.280> knob<00:02:37.430> is

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
interesting here is the contour knob is

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.059 
interesting here is the contour knob is
a<00:02:37.970> resonance<00:02:38.480> knob<00:02:38.720> for<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.200> high<00:02:39.440> damping<00:02:39.770> so

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
a resonance knob for the high damping so

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.900 
a resonance knob for the high damping so
you<00:02:40.160> can<00:02:40.250> get<00:02:40.340> this<00:02:40.460> really<00:02:40.700> sort<00:02:41.060> of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
you can get this really sort of

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.340 
you can get this really sort of
I<00:02:42.660> mean<00:02:43.650> kind<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.310> put<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.270> one<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.230> I'll

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
I mean kind of put that on one and I'll

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.410 
I mean kind of put that on one and I'll
increase<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.070> little<00:02:47.130> bit<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:50.150> see<00:02:51.150> here

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
increase that a little bit so see here

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:01.970 
increase that a little bit so see here
it<00:02:51.510> kind<00:02:51.960> of<00:02:52.020> cutting<00:02:52.350> some<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.740> hot<00:03:00.980> so

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
it kind of cutting some of that hot so

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.800 
it kind of cutting some of that hot so
that<00:03:02.010> high<00:03:02.310> kind<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.730> piercing<00:03:03.210> I<00:03:03.480> don't<00:03:03.750> if

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
that high kind of piercing I don't if

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.550 
that high kind of piercing I don't if
you<00:03:03.870> guys<00:03:03.930> can<00:03:04.110> hear<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.290> on<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.380> cam<00:03:04.620> but<00:03:06.560> it's

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
you guys can hear it on the cam but it's

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.970 
you guys can hear it on the cam but it's
pretty<00:03:07.890> darn<00:03:08.040> cool<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:09.600> FX<00:03:09.990> mix<00:03:10.230> adds<00:03:10.500> some

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
pretty darn cool the FX mix adds some

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:23.840 
pretty darn cool the FX mix adds some
cool<00:03:11.190> like<00:03:11.430> chorus<00:03:11.760> II<00:03:11.850> modulation<00:03:22.700> which<00:03:23.700> is

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
cool like chorus II modulation which is

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.760 
cool like chorus II modulation which is
nice<00:03:24.090> for<00:03:24.360> all<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.570> guys<00:03:24.660> who<00:03:24.720> want<00:03:25.050> you<00:03:25.650> know

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
nice for all you guys who want you know

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.910 
nice for all you guys who want you know
chorus<00:03:26.160> spring<00:03:26.850> reverb<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:28.080> then<00:03:28.320> I've

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
chorus spring reverb and then I've

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.960 
chorus spring reverb and then I've
already<00:03:29.220> gotten<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.430> couple<00:03:29.520> of<00:03:29.670> questions

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
already gotten a couple of questions

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.790 
already gotten a couple of questions
about<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.390> tremolo<00:03:30.900> on<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:32.310> spring

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
about the tremolo on the spring

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.290 
about the tremolo on the spring
algorithm<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.610> can<00:03:35.760> actually<00:03:35.880> use<00:03:36.150> it

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
algorithm and you can actually use it

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.640 
algorithm and you can actually use it
just<00:03:36.420> on<00:03:36.570> its<00:03:36.780> own<00:03:36.900> I'll<00:03:37.170> kind<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.410> show<00:03:37.500> you

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
just on its own I'll kind of show you

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.160 
just on its own I'll kind of show you
that<00:03:37.680> here<00:03:37.980> for<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.190> second<00:03:38.780> I'm<00:03:39.780> just<00:03:39.810> kind<00:03:40.110> of

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
that here for a second I'm just kind of

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.150 
that here for a second I'm just kind of
put<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.440> EQ<00:03:40.860> here<00:03:41.100> in<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.280> middle<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:44.010> this

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
put the EQ here in the middle so this

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.710 
put the EQ here in the middle so this
controls<00:03:44.550> sort<00:03:44.760> of<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.880> depth<00:03:45.120> it's<00:03:45.450> not

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
controls sort of the depth it's not

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.390 
controls sort of the depth it's not
quite<00:03:46.050> as<00:03:46.200> deep<00:03:46.410> as<00:03:46.560> I'd<00:03:46.680> like<00:03:46.860> but<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.130> is<00:03:47.220> I

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
quite as deep as I'd like but it is I

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.970 
quite as deep as I'd like but it is I
guess<00:03:47.640> kind<00:03:47.820> of<00:03:47.880> amp<00:03:48.030> like<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.570> way

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
guess kind of amp like in that way

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.380 
guess kind of amp like in that way
that's<00:03:49.980> as<00:03:50.160> deep<00:03:50.340> as<00:03:50.490> it<00:03:50.520> gets<00:03:50.820> of<00:03:51.060> course<00:03:51.240> can

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
that's as deep as it gets of course can

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.449 
that's as deep as it gets of course can
back<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.750> on

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
back it on

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.630 
back it on
this<00:03:54.459> is<00:03:54.610> controls<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.180> speed<00:03:55.480> which<00:03:55.750> is<00:03:55.870> also

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
this is controls the speed which is also

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.559 
this is controls the speed which is also
tap<00:03:57.640> tempo<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:58.209> all<00:03:58.360> if<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.540> have<00:03:58.629> V<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.769> I

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
tap tempo of all if you have V the I

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:07.860 
tap tempo of all if you have V the I
don't<00:04:01.569> know<00:04:01.629> what's<00:04:01.810> here<00:04:02.080> I<00:04:06.720> don't<00:04:07.720> know

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
don't know what's here I don't know

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.699 
don't know what's here I don't know
whether<00:04:07.959> that's<00:04:08.049> controlling<00:04:08.440> right<00:04:08.560> now<00:04:08.650> to

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
whether that's controlling right now to

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.050 
whether that's controlling right now to
be<00:04:08.830> honest<00:04:09.069> but<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.459> know<00:04:09.670> that<00:04:09.790> if<00:04:09.849> you<00:04:09.940> have

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
be honest but I know that if you have

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.100 
be honest but I know that if you have
the<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:11.260> tap<00:04:11.470> tempo<00:04:11.879> aux<00:04:12.879> out<00:04:13.360> thing<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:13.959> can

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
the the tap tempo aux out thing you can

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.170 
the the tap tempo aux out thing you can
even<00:04:14.500> use<00:04:14.769> it<00:04:14.799> to<00:04:15.069> tap<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:15.640> tempo<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.269> so

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
even use it to tap the tempo of that so

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:50.200 
even use it to tap the tempo of that so
you<00:04:19.180> can<00:04:19.389> go<00:04:19.510> really<00:04:19.750> slow

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.920 

so<00:04:51.210> I'm<00:04:51.270> not<00:04:51.389> sure<00:04:51.449> if<00:04:51.569> I've<00:04:51.719> done<00:04:51.810> this

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
so I'm not sure if I've done this

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.779 
so I'm not sure if I've done this
algorithm<00:04:52.409> justice<00:04:52.800> but<00:04:53.009> I<00:04:53.039> hope<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.550> enjoyed

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
algorithm justice but I hope you enjoyed

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.029 
algorithm justice but I hope you enjoyed
the<00:04:53.879> video
