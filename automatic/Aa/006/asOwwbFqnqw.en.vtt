throttle position sensors now many of

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.630 
throttle position sensors now many of
you<00:00:25.080> don't<00:00:25.350> own<00:00:25.529> these<00:00:25.769> or<00:00:26.070> don't<00:00:26.250> know<00:00:26.400> how<00:00:26.430> to

show you a different method on how to
test<00:00:33.540> some<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.780> these<00:00:33.930> sensors<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.950> via

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
test some of these sensors and it's via

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.900 
test some of these sensors and it's via
the<00:00:35.730> simple<00:00:36.059> method<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.660> tap<00:00:36.899> test

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
the simple method of a tap test

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.520 
the simple method of a tap test
well<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.120> couldn't<00:00:39.420> get<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.809> idle<00:00:40.140> high<00:00:40.260> yet

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
well we couldn't get it to idle high yet

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.290 
well we couldn't get it to idle high yet
you<00:00:40.680> guys<00:00:40.860> however<00:00:41.399> will<00:00:41.700> keep<00:00:41.879> driving<00:00:42.239> it

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
you guys however will keep driving it

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.040 
you guys however will keep driving it
around<00:00:42.420> or<00:00:43.550> want<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> backyard<00:00:45.059> method<00:00:45.450> which

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
around or want the backyard method which

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.869 
around or want the backyard method which
is<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.469> video<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.739> all<00:00:46.920> about<00:00:46.950> we'll<00:00:47.789> go

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
is what this video is all about we'll go

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.049 
is what this video is all about we'll go
ahead<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> wiggle<00:00:48.539> test<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:50.700> wiggle

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
ahead and do the wiggle test the wiggle

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.610 
ahead and do the wiggle test the wiggle
test<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.449> supposed<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.750> demonstrate<00:00:52.320> going

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
test is supposed to demonstrate going

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.310 
test is supposed to demonstrate going
over<00:00:52.890> some<00:00:53.129> bumpy<00:00:53.550> road<00:00:53.820> okay<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.230> we

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
over some bumpy road okay so what we

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.959 
over some bumpy road okay so what we
could<00:00:55.469> do<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:56.399> could<00:00:56.610> take<00:00:56.670> our

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
could do is we could take our

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.479 
could do is we could take our
screwdriver<00:00:57.680> or<00:00:58.680> our<00:00:58.920> fingers<00:01:01.039> and<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.340> can

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
screwdriver or our fingers and we can

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.660 
screwdriver or our fingers and we can
kind<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.760> tap<00:01:02.940> around<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> area<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.780> little<00:01:04.019> bit

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
kind of tap around the area a little bit

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.960 
kind of tap around the area a little bit
now<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.090> going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> help<00:01:06.570> us<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:07.970> is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
now what this is going to help us do is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:29.990 
now what this is going to help us do is
to<00:01:09.030> simulate<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.990> problem

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.120 

as<00:01:30.300> you<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.900> see<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.200> idols<00:01:31.560> starting<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.010> go

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
as you can see the idols starting to go

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.570 
as you can see the idols starting to go
up<00:01:32.160> a<00:01:32.340> little<00:01:32.370> bit

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.850 

it<00:01:39.150> seems<00:01:39.480> like<00:01:39.690> it's<00:01:39.870> towards<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.380> connector

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
it seems like it's towards the connector

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.380 
it seems like it's towards the connector
so<00:01:41.040> let's<00:01:41.220> mess<00:01:41.400> around<00:01:41.550> with<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.940> connector

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
so let's mess around with the connector

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:54.560 
so let's mess around with the connector
a<00:01:42.420> little<00:01:42.660> bit

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.510 

looks<00:01:55.080> like<00:01:55.260> we<00:01:55.470> were<00:01:55.560> able<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.980> get<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.340> idol

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
looks like we were able to get the idol

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.840 
looks like we were able to get the idol
up<00:01:56.850> there

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.870 

and<00:02:05.390> with<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.840> tap<00:02:06.050> test<00:02:06.350> idle<00:02:07.340> drops<00:02:07.610> back

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
and with the tap test idle drops back

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:15.059 
and with the tap test idle drops back
down

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.670 

what<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.239> means<00:02:16.780> for<00:02:17.079> us<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.379> that<00:02:17.409> we've

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
what this means for us is that we've

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.039 
what this means for us is that we've
kind<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:17.980> isolated<00:02:18.579> the<00:02:19.030> top<00:02:19.299> test<00:02:19.599> without

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
kind of isolated the top test without

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.709 
kind of isolated the top test without
using<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.590> DV<00:02:20.889> om<00:02:21.189> that<00:02:22.060> were<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.359> throttle

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:22.719 
using a DV om that were the throttle

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.360 
using a DV om that were the throttle
position<00:02:22.840> sensor<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.650> where<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> problem<00:02:24.340> is

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
position sensor is where the problem is

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.780 
position sensor is where the problem is
coming<00:02:24.430> from<00:02:24.790> with<00:02:25.030> intermittent<00:02:25.450> high<00:02:25.569> idle

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
coming from with intermittent high idle

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.300 
coming from with intermittent high idle
what<00:02:27.790> we<00:02:27.909> could<00:02:28.209> realize<00:02:28.629> is<00:02:28.959> if<00:02:29.260> we<00:02:29.950> can<00:02:30.159> get

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
what we could realize is if we can get

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.140 
what we could realize is if we can get
back<00:02:30.519> in<00:02:30.730> there

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
back in there

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.959 
back in there
I<00:02:31.180> was<00:02:32.109> tapping<00:02:32.409> on<00:02:32.859> the<00:02:33.370> neck<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.849> the

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:33.969 
I was tapping on the neck of the

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.750 
I was tapping on the neck of the
throttle<00:02:34.269> position<00:02:34.359> sensor<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.489> on<00:02:36.489> the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
throttle position sensor and on the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.339 
throttle position sensor and on the
actual<00:02:37.239> connector<00:02:37.689> of<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.049> throttle

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
actual connector of the throttle

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.599 
actual connector of the throttle
position<00:02:38.439> sensor<00:02:39.040> as<00:02:39.159> well

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
position sensor as well

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.509 
position sensor as well
so<00:02:40.120> instead<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.599> just<00:02:40.900> taking<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:42.040> unit<00:02:42.370> and

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
so instead of just taking that unit and

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.830 
so instead of just taking that unit and
trying<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.909> replace<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.419> what<00:02:43.569> we're<00:02:43.689> going<00:02:43.810> to

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
trying to replace it what we're going to

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.089 
trying to replace it what we're going to
do<00:02:44.019> is<00:02:44.139> we're<00:02:44.290> actually<00:02:44.379> going<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.769> take<00:02:44.919> the

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
do is we're actually going to take the

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.429 
do is we're actually going to take the
throttle<00:02:45.310> body<00:02:45.579> off<00:02:45.879> and<00:02:46.150> look<00:02:47.019> at<00:02:47.139> everything

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:47.439 
throttle body off and look at everything

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.559 
throttle body off and look at everything
just<00:02:48.310> because<00:02:48.579> we<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.939> we'll<00:02:49.180> get<00:02:49.299> it<00:02:49.389> on<00:02:49.450> the

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
just because we can we'll get it on the

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.030 
just because we can we'll get it on the
bench<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.049> it's<00:02:50.260> better<00:02:50.439> for<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.919> user

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
bench and it's better for the user

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.119 
bench and it's better for the user
videos<00:02:51.519> get<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.530> all<00:02:53.530> right<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:53.739> guys<00:02:53.799> we<00:02:53.980> got

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
videos get to all right you guys we got

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.069 
videos get to all right you guys we got
the<00:02:54.250> throttle<00:02:54.639> position<00:02:55.239> sensor<00:02:55.840> here

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
the throttle position sensor here

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.500 
the throttle position sensor here
viewable<00:02:57.069> we<00:02:57.790> also<00:02:57.939> have<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.180> idle<00:02:58.419> air

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
viewable we also have the idle air

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.780 
viewable we also have the idle air
control<00:02:58.569> motor<00:02:59.469> here<00:02:59.829> and<00:03:00.010> we<00:03:00.430> have<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.639> whole

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
control motor here and we have the whole

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.699 
control motor here and we have the whole
throttle<00:03:01.239> body<00:03:01.389> off<00:03:01.629> as<00:03:02.049> you<00:03:02.199> can<00:03:02.319> see<00:03:02.439> here<00:03:02.620> it

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
throttle body off as you can see here it

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.459 
throttle body off as you can see here it
just<00:03:02.859> made<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.040> easier<00:03:03.579> to<00:03:03.819> make<00:03:04.599> the<00:03:04.719> video<00:03:04.930> so

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:05.469 
just made it easier to make the video so

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.920 
just made it easier to make the video so
again<00:03:05.680> we<00:03:06.310> are<00:03:06.400> not<00:03:06.549> using<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:07.030> DV<00:03:07.329> om<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.689> test

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
again we are not using a DV om to test

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.689 
again we are not using a DV om to test
this<00:03:08.079> we<00:03:08.349> are<00:03:08.439> going<00:03:08.650> purely<00:03:08.980> off<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.370> tap

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:09.699 
this we are going purely off the tap

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.360 
this we are going purely off the tap
test<00:03:09.939> method<00:03:10.500> this<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.650> for<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:11.919> guys<00:03:11.980> at<00:03:12.250> home

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
test method this is for you guys at home

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.449 
test method this is for you guys at home
that<00:03:12.609> don't<00:03:12.760> use<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.389> DV<00:03:14.290> om<00:03:14.530> if<00:03:15.099> you<00:03:15.189> want<00:03:15.400> to

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
that don't use a DV om if you want to

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.159 
that don't use a DV om if you want to
use<00:03:15.549> one<00:03:15.730> go<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.180> other<00:03:16.299> video<00:03:16.569> that<00:03:17.139> I

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.169 
use one go to the other video that I

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:18.990 
use one go to the other video that I
have<00:03:17.349> so<00:03:18.010> this<00:03:18.159> is<00:03:18.250> going<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.459> be<00:03:18.519> our<00:03:18.609> TPS

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
have so this is going to be our TPS

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.460 
have so this is going to be our TPS
sensor<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:19.479> is<00:03:19.540> what<00:03:19.750> we<00:03:19.870> found<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.319> be<00:03:20.349> the

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
sensor this is what we found to be the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.360 
sensor this is what we found to be the
problematic<00:03:21.189> area<00:03:22.979> but<00:03:23.979> we're<00:03:24.069> going<00:03:24.159> to<00:03:24.220> go

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
problematic area but we're going to go

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.860 
problematic area but we're going to go
ahead<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.639> replace<00:03:24.819> this<00:03:25.090> unit<00:03:25.359> again<00:03:25.479> we're

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
ahead and replace this unit again we're

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.479 
ahead and replace this unit again we're
not<00:03:26.049> using<00:03:26.229> a<00:03:26.379> DV<00:03:26.650> om<00:03:26.919> for<00:03:27.129> this<00:03:27.250> video

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
not using a DV om for this video

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.839 
not using a DV om for this video
therefore<00:03:27.909> we<00:03:28.000> cannot<00:03:28.269> accurately<00:03:28.919> 100%<00:03:29.919> say

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
therefore we cannot accurately 100% say

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.030 
therefore we cannot accurately 100% say
that<00:03:31.060> this<00:03:31.209> was<00:03:31.659> the<00:03:31.959> part<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.799> problem

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
that this was the part of the problem

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.309 
that this was the part of the problem
which<00:03:33.729> is<00:03:33.849> why<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.030> don't<00:03:34.359> suggest<00:03:34.569> this<00:03:34.959> method

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
which is why I don't suggest this method

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.259 
which is why I don't suggest this method
but<00:03:35.530> you're<00:03:36.009> in<00:03:36.099> a<00:03:36.159> bind<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.939> is<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.180> way

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
but you're in a bind this is the way

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.020 
but you're in a bind this is the way
you're<00:03:37.419> going<00:03:37.509> to<00:03:37.599> have<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.840> do<00:03:37.959> this<00:03:39.030> you're

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
you're going to have to do this you're

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.580 
you're going to have to do this you're
going<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.239> go<00:03:40.389> ahead<00:03:40.509> and<00:03:40.720> part<00:03:40.930> match<00:03:41.109> right

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
going to go ahead and part match right

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.289 
going to go ahead and part match right
of<00:03:42.189> course<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:42.519> are<00:03:42.759> because<00:03:42.879> you've<00:03:43.090> watched

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
of course you are because you've watched

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.789 
of course you are because you've watched
many<00:03:43.509> videos<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:44.139> you<00:03:44.229> know<00:03:44.379> that's<00:03:44.620> exactly

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
many videos and you know that's exactly

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.319 
many videos and you know that's exactly
what<00:03:45.159> you're<00:03:45.250> going<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.430> want<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:45.609> do<00:03:45.729> one

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
what you're going to want to do one

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.059 
what you're going to want to do one
thing<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.599> should<00:03:46.870> also<00:03:46.989> always<00:03:47.259> do<00:03:48.389> is<00:03:50.069> pull

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
thing you should also always do is pull

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.189 
thing you should also always do is pull
off<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.459> connector<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.239> actually<00:03:52.840> check<00:03:53.169> to

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
off the connector and actually check to

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.460 
off the connector and actually check to
make<00:03:53.439> sure<00:03:53.500> all<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:53.919> wiring<00:03:54.430> is<00:03:54.579> good<00:03:55.470> we

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
make sure all the wiring is good we

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.709 
make sure all the wiring is good we
didn't<00:03:56.650> do<00:03:56.769> this<00:03:56.919> in<00:03:57.189> the<00:03:57.639> first<00:03:58.359> part<00:03:58.569> of<00:03:58.629> the

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:58.719 
didn't do this in the first part of the

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.259 
didn't do this in the first part of the
video<00:03:58.930> because<00:03:59.079> again<00:03:59.560> this<00:04:00.009> was<00:04:00.069> for<00:04:00.519> a<00:04:00.759> very

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
video because again this was for a very

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.349 
video because again this was for a very
beginner<00:04:02.069> automotive<00:04:03.069> related<00:04:03.219> video<00:04:03.729> and<00:04:04.030> we

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
beginner automotive related video and we

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:05.849 
beginner automotive related video and we
just<00:04:04.569> wanted<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:04.900> show<00:04:05.079> you<00:04:05.139> the<00:04:05.259> basics<00:04:05.680> but

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
just wanted to show you the basics but

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.129 
just wanted to show you the basics but
if<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:06.909> know<00:04:07.000> what<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.120> look<00:04:07.209> for<00:04:07.569> check<00:04:07.989> the

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
if you know what to look for check the

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.300 
if you know what to look for check the
wiring<00:04:08.349> for<00:04:08.889> any<00:04:09.040> scarring<00:04:09.400> nicking<00:04:10.299> or<00:04:11.310> open

installed<00:04:30.139> we<00:04:31.139> made<00:04:31.320> sure<00:04:31.350> everything<00:04:31.830> was

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
installed we made sure everything was

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.879 
installed we made sure everything was
done<00:04:32.850> up<00:04:33.030> correctly<00:04:33.420> so<00:04:34.170> as<00:04:34.290> you<00:04:34.470> can<00:04:34.650> see

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
done up correctly so as you can see

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.470 
done up correctly so as you can see
everything<00:04:35.520> is<00:04:35.580> bullets<00:04:35.790> back<00:04:36.000> up<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.360> new

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
everything is bullets back up the new

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.950 
everything is bullets back up the new
throttle<00:04:36.750> system<00:04:37.050> sensor<00:04:37.590> is<00:04:37.740> in<00:04:37.919> our<00:04:38.840> Idol<00:04:39.840> is

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.070 
throttle system sensor is in our Idol is
looking<00:04:40.320> really<00:04:40.650> nice<00:04:41.510> right<00:04:42.510> at<00:04:42.630> around<00:04:42.930> a

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
looking really nice right at around a

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.990 
looking really nice right at around a
thousand<00:04:43.440> rpm<00:04:43.860> which<00:04:44.220> is<00:04:44.340> normal<00:04:44.700> on<00:04:44.820> this

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
thousand rpm which is normal on this

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.920 
thousand rpm which is normal on this
vehicle<00:04:45.620> and<00:04:46.620> we<00:04:47.310> did<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.550> wiggle<00:04:47.850> test<00:04:48.090> did

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
vehicle and we did the wiggle test did

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.590 
vehicle and we did the wiggle test did
the<00:04:49.050> tap<00:04:49.230> test<00:04:49.500> again<00:04:49.830> and<00:04:50.070> we<00:04:51.030> could<00:04:51.210> not<00:04:51.389> get

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
the tap test again and we could not get

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.320 
the tap test again and we could not get
the<00:04:51.720> idle<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.139> spike<00:04:52.530> now<00:04:53.460> what<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:53.970> want<00:04:54.240> to

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
the idle to spike now what you want to

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.790 
the idle to spike now what you want to
do<00:04:54.450> at<00:04:54.600> home<00:04:54.780> is<00:04:55.020> take<00:04:55.200> this<00:04:55.320> thing<00:04:55.500> for<00:04:55.770> a
