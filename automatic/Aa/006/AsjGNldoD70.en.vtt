 Today I will show you a selection 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.340
 various lighting rides and 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:29.039
 how do you target these together? 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:30.390
 could combine for one 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.740
 Outside area is the lighting design 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.720
 as important as yours

 the lighting design in the outdoor area applies 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.200
 less is more 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.150
 in that in the evening hours the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.040
 light is getting smaller it is important 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.930
 that you have the artificial light in it 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.580
 relationship plans decide 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.530
 he chooses the song for the lesser 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.480
 Power levels make sure that you 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.860
 only a few islands of light installed 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.210
 because he did not want any 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.880
 complete illumination as in one 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.680
 football stadium is generating as well 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.090
 important in outdoor lighting on the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.190
 ep protection classes 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.600
 These give the protection to which 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.730
 If there is water in the housing 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.200
 Touch comes when you have one 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.880
 lighting in your demand 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.910
 you want to install 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.200
 at least the ep protection classes 23 spray 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.960
 choose water- proof 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.750
 you 're planning to shine in the house walls like that 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.790
 Should this diet have protection class 44 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.550
 to be splash-protected 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.290
 the protection class ip65 must be met 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.300
 when the lights in the ground below the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.100
 All others are installed in the front 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.110
 lights that are used in the garden 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.000
 and shelter without shelter right in the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.530
 contact with water must be able to come 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.500
 be waterproof and over the ep 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.820
 protection classes 67 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.440
 Now I show you the possibilities of 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.299
 outdoor lighting and how you like this 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.040
 to combine a pleasant atmosphere 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.299
 you should only have a chapter 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.280
 you can be interested in 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.030
 description text of the video a chapter 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.150
 choose 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.280
 let's go who eg in the dark as to 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.409
 front door must be recommended 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.840
 I use light for orientation 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.909
 so you can for you or yours 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.530
 Visitors illuminate the path with it all 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.420
 safely to the desired destination 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.950
 have been recessed lights are there 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.319
 especially good because they are 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.120
 Solar operation also used because of 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.610
 can be where no electricity 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.950
 during the day, the batteries can and 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.549
 at night they make an outstanding 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.140
 Orientation line with diffused light 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.700
 in addition to the walkway lighting can 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.379
 At the house entrance a practical 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.810
 house numbers use lighting 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.540
 with diffuse light characteristic the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.010
 this basic lighting and so on 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.840
 you also a key much faster 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.370
 but for me is the house numbers 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:45.750
 lighting also simply an eyecatcher 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:47.489
 and that's what it looks like in the dark 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.769
 direct lighting for the visitors 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.840
 or residents of a house orientation 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.459
 can very well rebuilt in the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.230
 be used with a 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.209
 circulating meaning one receives one 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.769
 basic brightness around the house 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.810
 putting the wall surfaces into scene 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.190
 In addition, this lighting also offers 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.190
 a very good protection against burglars 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.280
 Wooden terraces like these can be joined 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.530
 outdoor lighting especially nice scene 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.790
 put 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.530
 For this terrace were ground 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.739
 Recessed chosen because this whole 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.400
 easy to install in the hay 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:23.579
 you can use this as diffused 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.079
 or as directed light or around one 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.730
 to display the mark 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.470
 through the side opening of the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.660
 cover you can be very exciting 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.519
 create lighting effects without dazzling 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.500
 It facilitates orientation and 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.690
 draws the architecture of the terrace 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.859
 after to the orienteering of the 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.180
 terrace are very good 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.160
 Combine wall lights 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.349
 they set light accents and serve the 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.090
 general lighting wall lights can 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.010
 For example, an entrance door or round 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.790
 We use it to house the house 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.109
 you for the patio door 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.030
 The model gives a very nice light 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.959
 go up and down with and down 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.519
 one fail 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.949
 do you have the right light for that? 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.970
 a cozy evening and so will the 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.970
 Terrace in the dark 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.750
 to the outside lighting too 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.669
 of course still has to complete 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.220
 remaining garden will be set in scene 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.590
 Best used for bushes trees and 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.600
 Flowers focused light with spots like 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.039
 this 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.550
 you can use it with special effects 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.440
 achieve 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.060
 best ye judge not the whole 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.729
 aimed at the most beautiful plants in 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.169
 her garden 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.430
 It is best to combine solar 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.410
 Spit with diffused light 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.500
 you can do that for example on the 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.400
 lawn area distribute in this way and 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.150
 wise, the garden gets spatial depth 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.160
 you can complete special 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.020
 highlights in her garden with little ones 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.419
 staging effect lights lovingly 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.120
 here ground recessed lights were chosen 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.120
 and that's how the garden looks in the dark 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.000
 but also for the evening hours in yours 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.530
 house can the outdoor lighting one 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.330
 great part for a positive light 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.100
 to inflame, you create 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.990
 visible light in the outside area then 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.100
 results in an unexpected atmosphere 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.120
 and a world behind the windowpane 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.650
 Today I have a selection for you 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.510

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.340
 Outdoor area shown as her 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.920
 can combine specifically with each other 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.990
 and what she has to pay attention to 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.620
 There is less for outdoor use 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.970
