 the link because I already have it downloaded 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.390
 we are also going to download a file that 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.090
 it's called production in Spanish which is 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.800
 to translate the game but good this 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.410
 we can download it later for a 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.809
 At the moment we are not going to take this well 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.910
 let's go to the folder where you have 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.859

 will automatically start the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.690
 decompression of the game in this case I 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.700
 I'm going to cancel it because I already have it 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.400

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.550

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.130
 translate to Spanish as I say the 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.480

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.820

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.869
 game folder in this case here is 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.000

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.690
 be simply open the one that says code 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.180
 sp there are two files two icons stopped 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.130
 that says scott from mp and with from s &amp; p the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.780
 code mpn means there is October 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.230
 multiple and which can be played online 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.970
 and the other one is with the spd that means 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.130
 that there is of duty single player that since 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.160
 a player I will run to 5 player 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.470

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.400

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.400
 enter 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.630
 and ready Well here is the game is 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.600
 simply create the new game in the 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.070
 skill on a novice and good clone 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.950
 just wait for him to load the 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.870
 game and will already be playing in Spanish 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.420
 so, well, I'm going to wait for them to carry 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.380
 to continue so I'm going to cut the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.050
 video a moment 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.730
 While we will give here and good for longer 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.170
 we have the keys set here 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.430
 is this 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.250
 possibly the voices are not 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.980
 translated but the subtitles and how 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.659
 I tell you some things as an example 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.670
 instructions also come in Spanish 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.079
 etc. true then good 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.239
 simply the voices are not 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.799
 translated but the subtitles come and 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.140
 Well, it 's probably slow 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.269
 because I'm already running the qantas but 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.370

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.400
