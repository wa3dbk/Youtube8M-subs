 series from the band small kiel 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:30.179
 because deep is indeed in the eastern 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.660
 Iceland east of the Speyside at hand

 the distillery styler around the corner yes 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.920
 belongs also in the same patient the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:45.480
 for the gategroup work and the gravel 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.180
 is only once with an original 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.170
 bottling appeared in the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.850
 race of the year 1995 range straight at 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.250
 the distillery which was the distillery 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.410
 but the manager showed me the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.090
 new because the bottle at that time me 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.320
 believe she had ten years she had 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.660
 ten or twelve years 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.159
 they came together with the stuff one 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.729
 12 years out of yourself 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.140
 had a bottle that of the cadeaux 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.970
 bottles or similar looked 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.790
 she was from the rounded corners above does not 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:24.330
 as round as or not as waisted as 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.130
 The kapo interesting bottle came up 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.189
 the customer but not to customers not 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.210
 then taken look deep relatively soon 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.939
 rehired 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.500
 it is rumored again that's one of the gravel 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.570
 bottling is supposed to give the rumors 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.890
 you are very long and until then 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.180
 we have to deal with independent 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.979
 give bottlings satisfied 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.290
 like these and while it's a whole 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.570
 for a long time no independent 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.540
 there was bottling there since now 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.490
 a few years more and there you have to 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.350
 anyone started in the group 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.420
 or backgrounds better to the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.719
 independent bottlers for sale 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.790
 this is one now I believe one 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.970
 single almost bottling is exactly there 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.330
 it 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:16.680
 and that is now 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:20.269
 roxette and tastes 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:25.170
 Descriptions 15 years old, vintage 97 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:27.560
 2013 in the spring bottled with taste 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.030
 says the butter scotch and vanilla 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.769
 Caramel open net on the nose in 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.579
 the nose 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:40.579
 it later warms to a more grassy one 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:53.370
 up to a delicious liz was 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:03:00.599
 licorice licorice a really sweet sweet 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:05.959
 taste shows sugar fruit coffee 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:10.519
 coffee sweet good coffee honey and malt 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:16.319
 all get through again on departure 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:23.599
 with an interesting cough sweet 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:26.730
 circuit now tasted by bradley so and 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:32.069
 He was so nice and gave me a nature 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:34.430
 Gifted now look 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.430
 times 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:46.069
 What made this deep out to a 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.069
 lighter 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:58.769
 Madness that's a whiskey 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:09.049
 is caramel 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:09.049
 yes and then this cough sweet family 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:20.470
 that is how it works but also so over 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.470
 lollipop or marshmallow 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:35.960
 I'm excited about something else 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.340
 The oak is missing that miner 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.110
 also the whiskeys for 15 years 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.639
 comparatively bright one 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.669
 find a little bit that may come yes 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:47.199
 even a taste and then 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.199
 in fact, such a graze as well 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:20.630
 interesting the lolli in the mouth and now 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:23.090
 actually spice up the barrel and the 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.169
 argues with the really sweet 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.940
 lolli from the beginning 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.700
 sweet fruits and on the other side 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.720
 yes coffee on the other side of the 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:42.650
 coffee in between is so a bit 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:47.560
 candy and distant x star 40 but 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:55.340
 not bitter bad eat roller coaster immediately 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:59.500
 from the sweet red bull vodka all the way to the 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.500
 Spicy everything is in it 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.040
 as I said, nothing has tried to 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.600
 nothing so first go to the bottle 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.670
 I do not need to pass now 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.500
 and so aha says now you have miniature 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:32.870
 Now go and so what again 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:39.800
 I would have learned there outsider but 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:41.930
 pleasantly smart sportring and then 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.030
 afterwards the rich with 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:48.110
 I would have the closed eyes 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:51.500
 aroma to the first taste is not 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.750
 really seen as whiskey but now 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.030
 not as the fruit of style near 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.580
 not even but these these extreme 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.500
 sweet the normal as well does not have 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:06.350
 this volatility 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:08.720
 this extreme sweet and then only the 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.330
 departure of the whiskey more typical 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.840
 yes great thing has a wonderful 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.970
 like 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.400
 just because it will not be like that 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.630
 really hard but they have to 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.040
 then keep up a little 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.400
 this was bottled in the spring of 2013 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.070
 been 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.770
 but more central to the quarter 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.260
 2013 then middle 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:34.540
 probably already hold 

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.540
 thank you very much for watching
