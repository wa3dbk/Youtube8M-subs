00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.420 
size you need to go full size this is
the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
the

the width and the height so go full size

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.120 
the width and the height so go full size
so<00:02:10.270> you<00:02:10.360> can<00:02:10.720> capture<00:02:11.080> everything<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:12.010> you

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
so you can capture everything that you

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.660 
so you can capture everything that you
want<00:02:12.310> in<00:02:12.520> your<00:02:12.610> in-game<00:02:14.040> frames<00:02:15.040> per<00:02:15.250> second

want in your in-game frames per second

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.270 
want in your in-game frames per second
let's<00:02:16.150> say<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.960> harder<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.920> more

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
let's say the harder it is the more

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
let's say the harder it is the more
quality<00:02:19.000> would<00:02:19.210> have<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.460> your<00:02:21.460> choice<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:22.120> go

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
quality would have so your choice to go

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.030

you either go 30 or 60 60 is the best

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.880 
you either go 30 or 60 60 is the best

problem<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.290> it's<00:02:41.800> already<00:02:42.280> encoded<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.810> you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
problem you it's already encoded so you

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.050 
problem you it's already encoded so you
just<00:02:44.380> stop<00:02:44.830> recording<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.670> can<00:02:45.850> upload

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
just stop recording and you can upload

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.900 
just stop recording and you can upload
it<00:02:46.209> right<00:02:46.480> away<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.770> quality<00:02:48.250> by<00:02:48.520> default

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
it right away the quality by default

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.199 
it right away the quality by default
it's<00:02:49.180> 80<00:02:49.540> but<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.590> can<00:02:50.770> also<00:02:51.010> improve<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:51.730> by

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
it's 80 but you can also improve that by

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.350 
it's 80 but you can also improve that by
selecting<00:02:52.980> 100<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:55.239> audio<00:02:55.600> stereo<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.980> mono

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
selecting 100 the audio stereo and mono

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.050 
selecting 100 the audio stereo and mono
model<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:59.350> sound<00:02:59.770> that<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.400> output<00:03:00.580> sound

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
model is the sound that the output sound

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
model is the sound that the output sound
it<00:03:01.959> will<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.410> will<00:03:02.470> only<00:03:02.890> come<00:03:03.489> out<00:03:03.520> in<00:03:04.510> one

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
it will it will only come out in one

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.690 
it will it will only come out in one
side<00:03:05.410> so<00:03:05.920> if<00:03:06.070> you<00:03:06.220> want<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.640> have<00:03:07.209> both<00:03:08.700> left

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
side so if you want to have both left

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.850 
side so if you want to have both left
and<00:03:09.850> right<00:03:09.940> down<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:10.600> have<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:11.049> go<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.260> stereo

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
and right down you have to go to stereo

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.460 
and right down you have to go to stereo
the<00:03:12.820> frequency<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.600> higher<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:14.290> better

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
the frequency the higher the better

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.229 
the frequency the higher the better
that's<00:03:15.310> pretty<00:03:15.940> much<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.239> so<00:03:16.450> go<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:17.100> 48<00:03:18.239> the

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
that's pretty much it so go to 48 the

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.240 
that's pretty much it so go to 48 the
codec<00:03:19.660> is<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.019> same<00:03:20.290> thing<00:03:20.320> as<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.950> video

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
codec is the same thing as the video

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.979 
codec is the same thing as the video
codec<00:03:21.640> it's<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.269> bendy<00:03:22.870> cam<00:03:23.080> codec<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.959> just

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
codec it's a bendy cam codec so you just

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.050 
codec it's a bendy cam codec so you just
have<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.650> MPEG<00:03:27.489> 1<00:03:27.850> l<00:03:28.420> 2<00:03:29.610> bitrate<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.850> higher

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
have to MPEG 1 l 2 bitrate the higher

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.000 
have to MPEG 1 l 2 bitrate the higher
the<00:03:31.330> better<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:32.049> remember<00:03:32.410> when<00:03:32.769> if<00:03:32.980> you

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
the better so remember when if you

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.850 
the better so remember when if you
uploading<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.549> youtube<00:03:34.030> youtube<00:03:34.860> usually

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
uploading to youtube youtube usually

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.220 
uploading to youtube youtube usually
decreases<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:37.000> quality<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:37.750> need<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.049> go

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
decreases the quality so you need to go

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.460 
decreases the quality so you need to go
to<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.530> maxim<00:03:39.040> because<00:03:39.519> you<00:03:39.640> will<00:03:39.790> lose

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
to the maxim because you will lose

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.620 
to the maxim because you will lose
