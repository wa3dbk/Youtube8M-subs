00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.330 
you can see they're just dying and going
back<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.860> beginning<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.280> stage

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
back to the beginning of the stage

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:08.180 
back to the beginning of the stage
it<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.459> extremely<00:03:00.150> brutal<00:03:06.650> but<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:08.099> know

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
it is extremely brutal but you know

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.160 
it is extremely brutal but you know
interesting<00:03:08.819> nonetheless<00:03:08.970> if<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.659> can<00:03:09.840> if

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
interesting nonetheless if you can if

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.949 
interesting nonetheless if you can if
you<00:03:10.379> can<00:03:10.560> concentrate<00:03:11.280> in<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.780> can

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
you can concentrate in it you can

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.619 
you can concentrate in it you can
probably<00:03:13.379> get<00:03:14.000> somewhat<00:03:15.000> far<00:03:15.269> in<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.480> game

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
probably get somewhat far in the game

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.860 
probably get somewhat far in the game
but<00:03:15.930> trying<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:16.980> talk<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.549> play<00:03:18.120> at<00:03:18.629> the<00:03:18.720> same

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
but trying to talk and play at the same

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.920 
but trying to talk and play at the same
time<00:03:19.079> it's<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.319> little<00:03:19.530> bit<00:03:19.620> harder<00:03:20.720> game<00:03:21.720> is

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
time it's a little bit harder game is

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.979 
time it's a little bit harder game is
challenging<00:03:22.530> very<00:03:23.519> challenging<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.870> know

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
challenging very challenging you know

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.289 
challenging very challenging you know
like<00:03:25.379> I<00:03:25.500> said<00:03:25.650> with<00:03:25.859> just<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.220> one<00:03:26.400> light<00:03:26.640> it

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
like I said with just the one light it

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.410 
like I said with just the one light it
makes<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.720> really<00:03:27.900> really<00:03:28.260> hard<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:30.239> stay

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
makes it really really hard to stay

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.800 
makes it really really hard to stay
alive<00:03:33.950> see<00:03:34.950> if<00:03:35.069> we<00:03:35.370> can<00:03:35.519> see<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.940> naked<00:03:36.629> part

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
alive see if we can see the naked part

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.559 
alive see if we can see the naked part
again<00:03:38.870> right<00:03:39.870> there<00:03:40.940> but<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.090> happens<00:03:42.420> in

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
again right there but that happens in

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.869 
again right there but that happens in
all<00:03:42.660> different<00:03:42.810> parts<00:03:43.169> of<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.319> game

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.100 

the<00:03:48.879> funniest<00:03:49.180> part<00:03:49.540> is<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:49.930> you're

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
the funniest part is that you're

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.039 
the funniest part is that you're
supposed<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.440> kill<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:51.599> the<00:03:52.599> haast<00:03:52.810> or<00:03:53.260> the

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
supposed to kill the the haast or the

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.220 
supposed to kill the the haast or the
the<00:03:56.250> whoa<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.819> changed<00:03:58.629> back<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.810> my<00:03:58.959> regular

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
the whoa I changed back to my regular

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.550 
the whoa I changed back to my regular
gun

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
gun

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.430 
gun
I<00:03:59.590> think<00:04:00.220> it's<00:04:00.340> cuz<00:04:00.459> I<00:04:00.549> shot<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:01.659> little<00:04:01.900> kid

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.050 

but<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.920> can<00:04:06.040> kind<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.310> get<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.519> idea<00:04:06.549> of<00:04:06.909> this

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
but you can kind of get the idea of this

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.960 
but you can kind of get the idea of this
game<00:04:07.530> it's<00:04:08.530> extremely<00:04:09.040> hard

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
game it's extremely hard

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.509 
game it's extremely hard
not<00:04:10.659> exactly<00:04:11.470> probably<00:04:12.040> one<00:04:12.190> of<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.340> most

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
not exactly probably one of the most

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.449 
not exactly probably one of the most
sought<00:04:13.329> after<00:04:13.360> games<00:04:13.900> but<00:04:14.680> after<00:04:15.250> checking

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
sought after games but after checking

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.110 
sought after games but after checking
online<00:04:15.909> it's<00:04:16.320> basically<00:04:17.320> rated<00:04:18.070> number<00:04:18.489> 23

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
online it's basically rated number 23

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.680 
online it's basically rated number 23
out<00:04:19.269> of<00:04:19.389> 100<00:04:19.780> as<00:04:19.989> most<00:04:20.739> difficult<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.220> find<00:04:21.690> so

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
out of 100 as most difficult to find so

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.010 
out of 100 as most difficult to find so
it's<00:04:22.840> kind<00:04:23.020> of<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.169> rare<00:04:23.320> board<00:04:24.630> not<00:04:25.630> exactly

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
it's kind of a rare board not exactly

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.740 
it's kind of a rare board not exactly
the<00:04:26.229> best<00:04:26.350> dog<00:04:26.620> but<00:04:26.860> it<00:04:27.490> is<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.699> good<00:04:28.270> classic

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
the best dog but it is a good classic

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.840 
the best dog but it is a good classic
Konami<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:30.930> graphics<00:04:31.930> wise<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:33.820> know

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
Konami and graphics wise and you know

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.060 
Konami and graphics wise and you know
speaking<00:04:34.389> the<00:04:34.570> sound<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:35.080> stuff<00:04:35.260> for<00:04:35.919> its

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
speaking the sound and stuff for its

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.620 
speaking the sound and stuff for its
time<00:04:36.310> it's<00:04:36.789> not<00:04:36.940> bad<00:04:37.120> at<00:04:37.270> all

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
time it's not bad at all

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.450 
time it's not bad at all
this<00:04:37.750> is<00:04:37.900> actually<00:04:38.199> pretty<00:04:38.380> decent<00:04:38.560> it's<00:04:39.220> just

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
this is actually pretty decent it's just

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.310 
this is actually pretty decent it's just
the<00:04:39.580> level<00:04:40.000> of<00:04:40.210> difficulty<00:04:40.539> is<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:40.990> hardest

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
the level of difficulty is the hardest

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:54.269 
the level of difficulty is the hardest
part

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:54.279 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.629 

give<00:04:55.279> it<00:04:55.399> another<00:04:55.610> try<00:04:55.879> here<00:04:56.329> and<00:04:56.539> I<00:04:57.639> guess

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
give it another try here and I guess

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.299 
give it another try here and I guess
when<00:04:58.819> we<00:04:58.849> die<00:04:59.089> we'll<00:04:59.479> just<00:04:59.739> end<00:05:00.739> it<00:05:00.979> because<00:05:01.219> we

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:01.309 
when we die we'll just end it because we

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:03.309 
when we die we'll just end it because we
can<00:05:01.459> kind<00:05:01.669> of<00:05:01.729> get<00:05:01.879> an<00:05:02.360> idea<00:05:02.539> of<00:05:02.899> what<00:05:03.049> the<00:05:03.169> game

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
can kind of get an idea of what the game

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.939 
can kind of get an idea of what the game
is<00:05:03.349> like<00:05:03.589> here<00:05:04.689> but<00:05:05.689> you<00:05:05.839> really<00:05:06.110> got<00:05:06.799> to<00:05:06.829> get
