00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:34.179 
another world but at the same time it

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.959 
another world but at the same time it
was<00:00:34.210> God<00:00:35.079> be<00:00:35.289> one<00:00:35.469> of<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.589> most<00:00:35.679> part<00:00:36.039> with<00:00:36.819> all

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
was God be one of the most part with all

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.930 
was God be one of the most part with all
the<00:00:37.089> elevation<00:00:37.569> changes<00:00:38.609> not<00:00:39.609> just<00:00:39.640> the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
the elevation changes not just the

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.029 
the elevation changes not just the
amount<00:00:40.179> of<00:00:40.359> elevation<00:00:40.899> but<00:00:41.079> the<00:00:41.170> frequency<00:00:41.800> of

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
amount of elevation but the frequency of

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.290 
amount of elevation but the frequency of
those<00:00:42.609> changes<00:00:43.739> makes<00:00:44.739> for<00:00:44.949> pretty<00:00:45.300> pretty

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
those changes makes for pretty pretty
