platforms that parents ought to have
some<00:00:09.719> say<00:00:10.110> over<00:00:11.040> where<00:00:11.340> their<00:00:11.790> children<00:00:11.820> go<00:00:12.269> to

is<00:00:27.660> expanding<00:00:28.170> school<00:00:28.380> choice<00:00:29.300> but<00:00:30.300> I'm<00:00:30.599> very

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
is expanding school choice but I'm very

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.920 
is expanding school choice but I'm very
agnostic<00:00:31.890> about<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:33.149> form<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.600> choice

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
agnostic about what form that choice

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.440 
agnostic about what form that choice
must<00:00:34.260> take<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:35.430> think<00:00:35.940> there<00:00:36.030> are<00:00:36.090> lots<00:00:36.329> of

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
must take I think there are lots of

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.420 
must take I think there are lots of
different<00:00:36.719> ways<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:37.200> expanding<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.190> number

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
different ways of expanding the number

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.910 
different ways of expanding the number
and<00:00:39.210> quality<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:40.020> choices<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.530> parents<00:00:40.829> are

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
and quality of choices that parents are

I<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:48.420> me<00:00:48.570> which<00:00:49.170> form<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.739> takes<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.160> largely<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
I to me which form it takes is largely a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.330 
I to me which form it takes is largely a
matter<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.879> political<00:00:51.120> convenience<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.340> think

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
matter of political convenience I think

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.250 
matter of political convenience I think
there<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.520> some<00:00:53.730> forms<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.809> choice<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.170> are

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
there are some forms of choice that are

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.660 
there are some forms of choice that are
likely<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.620> be<00:00:55.710> more<00:00:55.980> educationally

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
likely to be more educationally

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.750 
likely to be more educationally
effective<00:00:57.440> more<00:00:58.440> likely<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.100> more

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
effective more likely to be more

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.990 
effective more likely to be more
equitably<00:01:00.239> available<00:01:01.340> and<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.879> my

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
equitably available and so I have my

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.820 
equitably available and so I have my
preferences<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.199> want<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> do<00:01:04.589> what

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
preferences but I just want to do what

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.350 
preferences but I just want to do what
whatever<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.369> politically<00:01:05.790> feasible<00:01:05.909> for

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
whatever is politically feasible for

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.770 
whatever is politically feasible for
expanding<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.229> choices<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.659> not<00:01:09.659> only

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
expanding the choices and and not only

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.420 
expanding the choices and and not only
so<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.409> parents<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.740> more<00:01:10.950> options<00:01:11.130> but

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
so that parents have more options but

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.920 
so that parents have more options but
also<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:11.939> people<00:01:12.540> working<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
also so that people working in the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.750 
also so that people working in the
school<00:01:13.200> system<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.950> more<00:01:14.250> meaningful

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
school system have more meaningful

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.700 
school system have more meaningful
accountability<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.659> results<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.380> if

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
accountability for results that is if

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.289 
accountability for results that is if
people<00:01:17.040> don't<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.310> they<00:01:17.430> leave<00:01:17.670> what<00:01:18.150> are

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
people don't like it they leave what are

people don't like it they leave what are
you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.530> are<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.710> big<00:01:19.920> benefits<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you know what are the big benefits of

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.450 
you know what are the big benefits of
school<00:01:20.820> choice<00:01:21.030> right<00:01:21.720> well<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.040> big

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
school choice right well the the big

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.030 
school choice right well the the big
benefits<00:01:23.610> are<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:25.259> allows<00:01:25.590> people<00:01:25.860> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
benefits are that it allows people to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.370 
benefits are that it allows people to
get<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.580> type<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.880> education<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:27.720> need<00:01:27.750> for

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
get the type of education they need for

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.370 
get the type of education they need for
them<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:29.729> we're<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.540> all<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.750> same<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.200> don't

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
them so we're not all the same we don't

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.170 
them so we're not all the same we don't
all<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.740> same<00:01:31.950> goals<00:01:32.220> for<00:01:32.939> what<00:01:33.060> our

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
all have the same goals for what our

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.210 
all have the same goals for what our
education<00:01:33.659> should<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.200> choice<00:01:34.710> allows<00:01:34.979> us

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
education should be and choice allows us

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.920 
education should be and choice allows us
to<00:01:35.369> customize<00:01:35.820> that's<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.479> big<00:01:36.630> benefit

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
to customize that's one big benefit

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.050 
to customize that's one big benefit
second<00:01:37.229> big<00:01:37.320> benefit<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.159> choice<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
second big benefit is that choice and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.870 
second big benefit is that choice and
competition<00:01:39.680> help<00:01:40.680> improve<00:01:41.159> average<00:01:41.670> quality

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
competition help improve average quality

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.330 
competition help improve average quality
and<00:01:42.270> hold<00:01:42.450> down<00:01:42.570> costs<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.259> both<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> those

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and hold down costs and both of those

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.429 
and hold down costs and both of those
are<00:01:44.579> badly<00:01:44.759> needed<00:01:44.939> as<00:01:45.360> well<00:01:45.570> what<00:01:46.229> are<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
are badly needed as well what are the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.380 
are badly needed as well what are the
big<00:01:46.590> obstacles<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.310> expanding<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> palette

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
big obstacles to expanding the palette

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.179 
big obstacles to expanding the palette
of<00:01:48.509> school<00:01:48.780> choice<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.320> actually<00:01:49.649> think<00:01:50.040> that

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
of school choice I actually think that

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.539 
of school choice I actually think that
that<00:01:50.579> we're<00:01:50.700> making<00:01:50.820> huge<00:01:51.390> progress<00:01:51.799> I<00:01:52.799> think

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
that we're making huge progress I think

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.590 
that we're making huge progress I think
if<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.390> look<00:01:54.930> at<00:01:55.079> what<00:01:55.790> intellectual<00:01:56.790> opinion

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
if we look at what intellectual opinion

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.709 
if we look at what intellectual opinion
was<00:01:57.899> among<00:01:58.259> elites<00:01:58.619> 20-30<00:01:59.460> years<00:01:59.549> ago<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.390> was

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
was among elites 20-30 years ago it was

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.709 
was among elites 20-30 years ago it was
that<00:02:01.110> parents<00:02:02.009> were<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.369> bad<00:02:02.579> choosers<00:02:03.149> they

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719

that parents were just bad choosers they
just<00:02:04.049> didn't<00:02:04.290> know<00:02:04.409> what<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> good<00:02:04.770> education

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
just didn't know what a good education

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.130 
just didn't know what a good education
was<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.149> was<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> role<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.689> elites

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
was and that it was the role of elites

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.369 
was and that it was the role of elites
to<00:02:07.670> usher<00:02:08.670> people<00:02:09.300> into<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> right<00:02:09.810> schools

to usher people into the right schools
that<00:02:10.619> did<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> right<00:02:11.069> things<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:11.520> them<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:13.200> he

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
that did the right things for them so he

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.690 
that did the right things for them so he
when<00:02:13.590> there<00:02:13.710> was<00:02:13.800> choice<00:02:14.070> like<00:02:14.250> magnet

a<00:02:19.700> composition<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.730> elites<00:02:21.270> wanted<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.310> in

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
a composition that elites wanted and in

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.430 
a composition that elites wanted and in

the last 20 30 years it has now become a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.030 
the last 20 30 years it has now become a
widely<00:02:25.860> shared<00:02:26.160> view<00:02:26.790> among<00:02:27.090> elites<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:28.040> both

parties<00:02:29.370> if<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.180> look<00:02:30.330> at<00:02:30.420> both<00:02:30.600> platforms

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
parties if you look at both platforms

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.320 
parties if you look at both platforms
that<00:02:31.320> parents<00:02:32.010> ought<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.220> have<00:02:32.340> some<00:02:32.610> say<00:02:33.030> over

that parents ought to have some say over
where<00:02:34.230> their<00:02:34.680> children<00:02:34.710> go<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.220> school<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
where their children go to school and

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.360 
where their children go to school and
that<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.780> competition<00:02:37.350> for<00:02:37.740> children<00:02:38.160> is

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
that that competition for children is

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.510 
that that competition for children is
making<00:02:39.000> schools<00:02:39.330> better<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> range

making schools better and so the range
