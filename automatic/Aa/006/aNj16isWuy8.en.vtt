00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.040 

here<00:00:05.460> comes<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.759> start<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.240> shitfest

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:23.520 

twilight<00:00:10.050> spark<00:00:10.410> or<00:00:10.590> whatever<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.460> is

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.530 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.720 

yeah<00:00:24.190> this<00:00:24.490> is<00:00:24.700> ridiculous<00:00:25.300> because<00:00:26.730> the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
yeah this is ridiculous because the

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.830 
yeah this is ridiculous because the
logical<00:00:28.180> course<00:00:28.420> of<00:00:28.540> action<00:00:28.690> is<00:00:29.110> to<00:00:30.840> just

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
logical course of action is to just

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.140 
logical course of action is to just
avoid<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.260> bullets<00:00:32.680> but<00:00:32.830> it's<00:00:33.730> just<00:00:33.910> kind<00:00:34.120> of

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
avoid the bullets but it's just kind of

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.210 
avoid the bullets but it's just kind of
dead<00:00:34.690> stand<00:00:35.020> to<00:00:35.110> the<00:00:35.230> side<00:00:35.260> of<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.590> laser<00:00:35.860> but

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
dead stand to the side of the laser but

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.300 
dead stand to the side of the laser but
that<00:00:36.340> doesn't<00:00:36.670> work<00:00:37.080> because<00:00:38.080> just<00:00:38.590> there's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
that doesn't work because just there's

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:47.820 
that doesn't work because just there's
not<00:00:39.460> enough<00:00:39.520> time<00:00:39.910> to<00:00:40.090> dodge<00:00:46.830> another

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
not enough time to dodge another

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.890 
not enough time to dodge another
non-spell<00:00:48.400> now<00:00:48.700> the<00:00:48.760> but<00:00:49.059> now<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.239> stars<00:00:49.600> fall

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
non-spell now the but now the stars fall

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.290 
non-spell now the but now the stars fall
back<00:00:50.290> down<00:00:50.320> from<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.920> top<00:00:51.129> which<00:00:51.550> is<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.940> nice

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
back down from the top which is a nice

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.150 
back down from the top which is a nice
little<00:00:52.570> effect<00:00:52.989> not<00:00:53.170> really<00:00:53.530> that<00:00:53.650> much<00:00:53.710> no<00:00:54.129> a

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
little effect not really that much no a

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:02.040 
little effect not really that much no a
dangerous<00:00:54.640> though<00:00:59.550> now<00:01:00.690> possibly<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.930> only

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
dangerous though now possibly the only

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.689 
dangerous though now possibly the only
decent<00:01:02.409> card<00:01:02.830> in<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:02.980> whole<00:01:03.129> boss<00:01:03.430> fight

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
decent card in the whole boss fight

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.100 
decent card in the whole boss fight
which<00:01:03.850> I<00:01:03.909> would<00:01:04.059> probably<00:01:04.180> fuck<00:01:04.600> up<00:01:04.809> now<00:01:04.960> I'm

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
which I would probably fuck up now I'm

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:13.010 
which I would probably fuck up now I'm

survival<00:02:17.020> card<00:02:17.230> go<00:02:25.140> yeah<00:02:26.140> um<00:02:26.410> I'm<00:02:27.930> assuming<00:02:28.930> if

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
survival card go yeah um I'm assuming if

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.930 
survival card go yeah um I'm assuming if
I<00:02:29.140> actually<00:02:29.350> bother<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:30.070> learn<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.520> pattern

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
I actually bother to learn the pattern

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.300 
I actually bother to learn the pattern
in<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:31.420> card<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:32.050> would<00:02:32.320> be<00:02:32.440> quite<00:02:32.680> easy<00:02:32.950> but

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
in this card it would be quite easy but

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:44.800 
in this card it would be quite easy but
I<00:02:33.340> can't<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.180> isn't

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.040 

so<00:02:45.620> that's<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.920> hard<00:02:46.099> part<00:02:46.190> really<00:02:49.840> next<00:02:50.840> it

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
so that's the hard part really next it

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.580 
so that's the hard part really next it
starts<00:02:51.260> copying<00:02:51.440> fujiyama<00:02:52.069> volcano<00:02:53.590> God

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
starts copying fujiyama volcano God

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.530 
starts copying fujiyama volcano God
usually<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.280> don't<00:02:55.340> screw<00:02:55.640> that<00:02:55.790> up<00:02:55.849> I<00:02:56.030> dodged

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
usually I don't screw that up I dodged

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:11.030 
usually I don't screw that up I dodged
the<00:02:56.750> wrong<00:02:56.900> way

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.100 

there's<00:03:11.760> really<00:03:11.969> no<00:03:12.150> challenge<00:03:12.659> to<00:03:12.810> this<00:03:12.930> one

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
there's really no challenge to this one

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.649 
there's really no challenge to this one
I<00:03:13.140> mean<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.530> bullets<00:03:14.069> or<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:14.489> what<00:03:15.390> was<00:03:15.510> Noah

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
I mean the bullets or so what was Noah

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.479 
I mean the bullets or so what was Noah
fujiyama<00:03:16.140> volcano<00:03:16.530> was<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.950> basically<00:03:17.340> that

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
fujiyama volcano was the basically that

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.740 
fujiyama volcano was the basically that
meant<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.760> whole<00:03:17.909> area<00:03:18.209> was<00:03:18.450> basically

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
meant the whole area was basically

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.849 
meant the whole area was basically
impossible<00:03:19.019> because<00:03:19.500> there<00:03:19.590> were<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:19.709> many

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
impossible because there were so many

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.619 
impossible because there were so many
bullets<00:03:20.280> there<00:03:20.489> but<00:03:21.120> when<00:03:21.359> you're<00:03:21.480> just

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
bullets there but when you're just

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.990 
bullets there but when you're just
firing<00:03:21.780> simple<00:03:22.409> 8-way<00:03:22.739> shots<00:03:23.129> it's<00:03:23.430> not

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
firing simple 8-way shots it's not

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.899 
firing simple 8-way shots it's not
really<00:03:24.329> that<00:03:24.420> dangerous<00:03:25.340> 26<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.489> happens<00:03:26.760> to

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
really that dangerous 26 and happens to

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.080 
really that dangerous 26 and happens to
go<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.510> we<00:03:27.810> have<00:03:28.099> infuriating<00:03:29.099> pinging<00:03:29.670> sound

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
go and we have infuriating pinging sound

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.960 
go and we have infuriating pinging sound
which<00:03:30.359> is<00:03:31.099> which<00:03:32.099> is<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.340> my<00:03:32.430> opinion<00:03:32.459> more

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
which is which is in my opinion more

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.170 
which is which is in my opinion more
more<00:03:33.420> dangerous<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.930> card<00:03:34.140> itself<00:03:38.180> and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
more dangerous in the card itself and

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.800 
more dangerous in the card itself and
