00:00:34.688 --> 00:00:40.414
My love, I know that your heart is already forgotten

00:00:40.414 --> 00:00:44.097
of those moments that you and I

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.681
shared every day...

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:55.746
We must not, to let this sink us more

00:00:55.746 --> 00:00:59.519
Come near me, girl, I...

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:04.841
would give anything to have you

00:01:05.987 --> 00:01:13.709
but this world give us a bad name, no no

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:16.324
time deceived us...

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:28.247
flying across a  twelve dreams ocean

00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:35.784
raising the body up until cover the sea of shade

00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:43.994
flying through a boundless ocean

00:01:43.994 --> 00:01:53.040
spread your wings and come with me, let's fly together at last

00:02:24.112 --> 00:02:29.929
wipe your tears is my commitment

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:34.047
heal your wounds with love

00:02:34.047 --> 00:02:39.104
give you a smile with poetry

00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:45.139
do what the heat of your passion say

00:02:45.356 --> 00:02:49.216
even I would paint the whole sea

00:02:49.482 --> 00:02:54.265
to match it with the color of your eyes

00:02:55.547 --> 00:03:02.817
and then this world give us a bad name, no no

00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:10.518
time deceived us, forget it!, it's time for another chance

00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:17.448
flying across a  twelve dreams ocean

00:03:17.448 --> 00:03:25.235
raising the body up until cover the sea of shade

00:03:25.884 --> 00:03:32.953
flying through a boundless ocean

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:43.279
spread your wings and come with me, let's fly together at last

00:03:43.575 --> 00:03:48.898
...across an ocean of dreams

00:03:48.898 --> 00:03:58.794
spread your wings and come with me, forever my love

00:04:12.121 --> 00:04:19.669
flying across an ocean of dreams...
