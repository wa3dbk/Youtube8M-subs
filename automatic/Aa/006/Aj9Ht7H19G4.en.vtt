00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.070
 very good guys today play spoiler let's go 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.630
 to do a compilation of some of 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.220
 the things that have poked their heads 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.410
 future of minecraft during this week 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.880
 and some of them came out a couple 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.290
 of days I know why I ask you 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.360
 sincerely apologize for not having 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.460
 had time to bring them little by little 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.800
 but I think next to it deserves a lot 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.050
 worth it in the first place we have this 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.150
 image and this post comment of ye 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.950
 both in your Instagram account but that 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.720
 However, he has neither tweeted nor 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.370
 put on facebook or has given signs of 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.500
 nothing similar in any other 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.480
 social network but the important thing is the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.370
 image that I'm going to analyze with the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.050
 greater degree of perfection and giving all 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.390
 the possible information step by step 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.460
 As you can see, it's about some 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.769
 type of underwater structure so 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.109
 that opens the door to new types of 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.940
 daniels or temples under water you know 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.769
 that a few months before the main com 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.090
 dinner bon had the great idea of ​​doing 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.370
 a questions and answers about 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.980
 minecraft in reddit that by the way 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.080
 I also made a video about him and already there 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.000
 He confessed that he would like moyá in the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.860
 future make new types of structures 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.080
 such as the pyramid or the temples of 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.270
 the jungles in other biomes well yes yes 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.650
 in the end they do not back down with what 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.600
 that we can see in this photo 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.520
 we have some underwater temples with 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.530
 almost total security we do not follow 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.390
 also looking at the blocks that 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.730
 appear you can see that there are at least 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.470
 two new blocks one very similar in 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.050
 how much at the level of texturing 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.180
 refers to the cob stones or the musician 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.550
 best or better said because it has as a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.250
 greenish tone or even some new type 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.530
 of block created with algae I say that 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.210
 it may not be like that since yesterday he likes it 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.580
 put filters on the images that you upload to 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.770
 instagram and just like water looks with 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.300
 a slightly purple tone may also be 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.220
 has affected the color of the 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.930
 blocks and finally a block that can 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.790
 give a lot to talk about and I had to 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.830
 comment a lot with some friends and 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.960
 that if you look like one of the faces 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.090
 of some kind of tree by the bark 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.979
 outside and by the inner circle without 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.720
 But it's on all sides so 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.310
 that we could happen to think that for his 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.770
 whitish tone can become a 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.570
 coral block for example although good 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.820
 if so, apart from what happens 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.920
 pretty ugly this block and its material 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.570
 because the coral should be in others 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.340
 colors since the coral formations 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.830
 that we can find should be 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.660
 many different tones and good will be what 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.920
 that there is something that calls us very much 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.170
 the attention and we 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.150
 move away from this second theory and that is 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.680
 has its own light so guys could 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.050
 be something related to 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.540
 coral anemones maybe you can make a 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.360
 type of underwater tree root or 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.220
 algae or a new type of stone or some 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.170
 block fruit of the close-tone crafter 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.790
 but today only leaves us 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.830
 unknowns that we will try to solve 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.650
 as the weeks go by now well 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.090
 this is for 1.8 it is possible but not 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.459
 there is no security since lately 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.780
 the creative pace has been lowered quite a bit and 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.000
 in the weekly hooks are introduced 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.980
 rather little and they fix many box what 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.959
 which is a sign that 1.8 is a 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.489
 point of leaving and as such these new 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.290
 temples will not appear until others 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.209
 later versions can also be 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.130
 Well, well, it's a false alarm that 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.780
 they are simply fixing bugs and 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.180
 then introduce new things to 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.910
 the 1.8 also personally I make myself 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.250
 certain questions that I'm sure to look for 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.709
 acy is to talk about other new types of 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.510
 temple will bring these blocks to the 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.850
 Creation of other new crack theos 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.250
 new biomes and so on there will be new 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.620
 modes or voices linked to these temples 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.840
 craft blocks or biomes or even 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.100
 dimensions or whatever they are 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.880
 preparing for the future of minecraft 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.800
 I like it 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.050
 it's a personal opinion in the 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.510
 comments that you tell me what you think 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.730
 of all this and what doubts arise 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.320
 I will answer and discuss personally all 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.270
 those smart comments that 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.610
 do below here now let's go to 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.650
 next point which are rabbits makes 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.480
 a couple of days diane holtz that's from 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.430
 mode miner took care to leave us some 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.320
 how many images about these innocents 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.390
 animals created by it and 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.800
 surely you will already know that good 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.210
 lately the team in general is 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.100
 watching a series lack of imagination 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.810
 regarding the development of minecraft and 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.360
 that's why he's letting himself be influenced 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.550
 by certain youtubers known as doc 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.750
 disk and certain minecraft players 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.520
 technical why the 1.8 is of certain 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.990
 way full of new features to 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.360
 the blog command directed exclusively 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.980
 to the most makers and functions of 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.690
 certain blocks like the slime block 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.420
 they have been developed almost completely 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.220
 by people removed from moyano however 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.540
 ryan hold it seems that it takes a little 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.950
 creativity banner of these 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.660
 last months having developed the 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.970
 custom world generator that 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.890
 as you know, it's just a remake of a 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.360
 way already known by the beta phase 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.280
 from minecraft and now it comes with 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.300
 rabbits and slightly different from 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.069
 seen 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.199
 in other ways like toilette forest of 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.180
 where the supersport biome was taken is 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.430
 for example or rust christchurch's 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.169
 where bojan sacked the horses before 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.580
 continue with my personal opinion should I 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.009
 say that this is possible that never 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.930
 are minecraft worth so although 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.180
 a discussion or a debate about this 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.129
 it's totally out of place I think that 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.860
 It is fair that they let us comment on something 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.840
 that will affect or may affect the 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.060
 future of the game true is that maybe 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.470
 be a bit ugly or at least lacking 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.090
 of the same charism that they offered in their 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.770
 moment all the new modes that 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.300
 they were showing up in minecraft just 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.979
 you have to look at the mods that 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.289
 they were from the beginning and they have 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.400
 given the image as the clip in which 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.990
 appears in the vast majority of 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.849
 merchandising that helps increase the 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.440
 game form and it gives them fabulous 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.349
 income to many companies of this type 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.969
 as a moyano with the leander mail by 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.949
 example that until now we still 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.659
 We wondered why it is that has 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.879
 no sense that way nor do I think 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:32.039
 make no sense to the rabbit beyond 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:33.990
 to try to please the users that 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.479
 they ask for new mobs but please moi 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.159
 to be able to influence something that 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.610
 have charisma to do more than 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:43.320
 full of bulk and silent comments and 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.930
 show my opinion there 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.030
 to the rabbits that good of the same changes 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.320
 The same goes for what also changes 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.940
 do with the rabbits and what they do 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.620
 also with the corn ones if 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.030
 finally they get to be you can see in 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.710
 one of these photos that shares a 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.170
 food especially with the pig that is 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.240
 the carrot although we still do not know if 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.920
 these rabbits can be tamed or if 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.900
 at the end they will give some kind of 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.970
 food at least we want to know that with 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.980
 carrots will reproduce though clear 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.960
 are rabbits it will be possible for them to be the 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.880
 first mode that give several offspring each 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.290
 once they reproduce all that and a lot 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.210
 more when they pull out a spoiler again 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.800
 on this subject we now turn to the third 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.390
 theme of this video that is about 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.010
 minecraft rhimes during yesterday 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.690
 was open to the beta the rings to all 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.790
 those users who enjoy 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.830
 premium minecraft and they lived in countries in 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.540
 those that until yesterday still could not like 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.580
 if I'm not wrong in most of 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.870
 Latin America and as you know I've been 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.490
 commenting on everything that has happened with 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.320
 minecraft lynch since they started 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.850
 leave spoilers about this until today 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.980
 same that can already be tested by all 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.780
 the world so if you have no idea of 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.370
 what is minecraft I advise you 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.110
 that you visit the links that I will leave you 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.580
 right here and in the description of the video 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.530
 and finally minecraft is being 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.330
 developed now also for ps vita 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.220
 and in the image you can see one of the 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.230
 game menus that could well be 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.630
 of I search the inventory of creative or 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.280
 even a craft in game guide the 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.960
 shows the fame that the 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.820
 PC version since its inception has 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.590
 unbalanced along with their PC versions 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.210
 consoles and mobile devices a 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.860
 practically all the games that have 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.600
 gone out during the story 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.490
 placing itself in the third place of the 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.170
 best-selling video games in the world only 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.970
 below wii sports and the mythical 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.560
 Tetris is just missing a console 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.330
 current which could would be 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.530
 the wiiu although taking into account the 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.090
 problems that nintendo is having 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.710
 to sell the console is unlikely 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.270
 that comes out in the short term but never 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.100
 know maybe it's one of the surprises that 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.960
 we can find during this year 2014 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.550

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.020
