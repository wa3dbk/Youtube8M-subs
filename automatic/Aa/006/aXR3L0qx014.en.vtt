00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.730
 now let's know the trends in 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.149
 social networks like you are spinoza and sea 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.149
 how are you 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.750
 thank you thank you and disney not because you 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.279
 you were last week the truth 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.079
 very much taste and tell me what we have 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.669
 that we have videos is that the latter 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.259
 days I've been giving everything that is 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.390
 storms in faithful states well then 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.789
 let's see what some of the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.249
 people recording with their cell phone and how 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.729
 is that these accidents occur in something 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.729
 let's see it 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.440
 today we can see a person who is 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.540
 recording anybody on a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.120
 bridge but do not lose sight of the side 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.300
 right of the road they will see how 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.530
 they start to slow down and so good what 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.280
 others and others is that the other 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.890
 speed and speed for speed 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.040
 well what we have said is not the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.449
 done so if there is snow inclusion and 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:07.590
 If there is water do not be very careful 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:11.700
 with this because they are usually provoked 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.009
 then we have another one, that's how it has 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.080
 imported to the carambola than that 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.220
 it provokes it is impressive to see all this 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.560
 the next video we have is from 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.420
 these visits what some do 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.670
 lakes and well then let's see what is it 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.140
 what happens when a person is 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.179
 pointing out some crocodiles 11 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.600
 crocodiles but not on the right side of 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.600
 your screen 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.440
 and it's good if they did not see it, not what 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.160
 they saw let's see the request color 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.160
 and this edition 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.520
 technically he got up on the this 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.560
 security hand 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.560
 and well when he and he was 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 as pointing I almost grabbed him and he was 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.360
 close so is the entity that we have also 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.390
 that has to do with this part of 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.130
 natural phenomena is a recording that 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.600
 many are made and then if you want we go 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.790
 to see it and I'm commenting on these 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.500
 recordings that many people make to the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.940
 shore of the sea the first was not expected 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.220
 in this that they are going to see people 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.510
 national 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.820
 you're going to look like a recording 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.710
 from a breakwater anywhere 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.770
 we have the exact place the place does not 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.830
 is designed in the video but what is 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.290
 know is that it was two days ago 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.880
 Suddenly they start to record very waves 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.610
 well the distance seems to be that it is 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.370
 quite considerable from where they are 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.460
 these people to the tip of a 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:53.740
 breakwater until until with the 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:56.260
 ball we reach would look very foamy 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.840
 but not the water begins to wake up 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.840
 there were five people injured by this 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.470
 and well I think we still have 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.880
 any matter is not trend 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.120
 we tend to serbia on twitter in 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.040
 twitter then directly the sites 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.600
 they were very scattered that were the 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.950
 I can quickly comment new and with 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.770
 a firm trend what there was 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.300
 trend was directly with the no 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.890
