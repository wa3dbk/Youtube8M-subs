00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.819 
your heel and your ankle gives you a ton
of<00:02:05.570> support<00:02:06.570> out<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.049> boot<00:02:07.350> which<00:02:07.649> was

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
of support out of this boot which was

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.160 
of support out of this boot which was
one<00:02:08.310> thing<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.759> was<00:02:08.940> kind<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.780> concerned

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
one thing that I was kind of concerned

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.500 
one thing that I was kind of concerned
about<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.730> how<00:02:11.730> much<00:02:11.879> support<00:02:12.060> would<00:02:12.360> it

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
about is how much support would it

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
about is how much support would it
really<00:02:12.690> have

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
really have

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.199 
really have
and<00:02:13.620> after<00:02:13.920> we're<00:02:14.100> done<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.520> mean<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:15.060> could

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
and after we're done I mean you could

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.820 
and after we're done I mean you could
wear<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.540> boot<00:02:15.840> for<00:02:16.110> eight<00:02:16.230> or<00:02:16.380> twelve<00:02:16.650> hours

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
wear this boot for eight or twelve hours

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.460 
wear this boot for eight or twelve hours
doing<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.760> construction<00:02:18.480> or<00:02:18.690> anything<00:02:19.110> like

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
doing the construction or anything like

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.559 
doing the construction or anything like
that<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.920> it's<00:02:20.730> not<00:02:20.819> gonna<00:02:21.060> let<00:02:21.240> your<00:02:21.360> foot

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.880 
that and it's not gonna let your foot
down<00:02:21.690> at<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.959> end<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.230> day<00:02:22.350> your<00:02:22.620> feet<00:02:22.770> are

gonna be happy they're not gonna be sore

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.600 
gonna be happy they're not gonna be sore
they're<00:02:25.530> not<00:02:25.709> going<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.890> be<00:02:26.010> red<00:02:26.250> or<00:02:26.459> anything

one<00:02:29.430> thing<00:02:29.760> probably<00:02:30.480> my<00:02:31.170> favorite<00:02:31.620> about<00:02:31.800> it

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
one thing probably my favorite about it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.780 
one thing probably my favorite about it
is<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:33.209> Express<00:02:33.780> cool<00:02:34.080> lining<00:02:34.650> what<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.640> is

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
is the Express cool lining what it is

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.300 
is the Express cool lining what it is
the<00:02:36.120> lining<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.720> boot<00:02:37.020> basically<00:02:38.010> pulls

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the lining in this boot basically pulls

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.400 
the lining in this boot basically pulls
the<00:02:38.489> moisture<00:02:38.640> away<00:02:39.030> from<00:02:39.120> your<00:02:39.360> foot<00:02:39.480> but

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
the moisture away from your foot but

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.960 
the moisture away from your foot but
then<00:02:40.560> redistributes<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.459> throughout<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
then redistributes it throughout the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.210 
then redistributes it throughout the
liner<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.540> drier<00:02:43.140> portions<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> liner

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
liner to drier portions of the liner

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.009 
liner to drier portions of the liner
kind<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:44.970> creating<00:02:45.300> this<00:02:45.420> evaporative

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
kind of creating this evaporative

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.680 
kind of creating this evaporative
cooling<00:02:46.380> effect<00:02:46.769> on<00:02:47.010> your<00:02:47.640> foot<00:02:47.880> helping<00:02:48.600> to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
cooling effect on your foot helping to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.960 
cooling effect on your foot helping to
keep<00:02:48.900> both<00:02:49.140> your<00:02:49.380> foot<00:02:49.680> dry<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.280> keep<00:02:50.820> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
keep both your foot dry and keep the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.949 
keep both your foot dry and keep the
liner<00:02:51.209> dry<00:02:51.630> now<00:02:52.550> muck<00:02:53.550> says<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.300> these<00:02:54.630> boots

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
liner dry now muck says that these boots

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.320 
liner dry now muck says that these boots
are<00:02:55.170> kind<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.800> an<00:02:55.920> area<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.519> sub-freezing

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330

anywhere in between these are going to

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
be the boot to go to for that now I

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.900 
be the boot to go to for that now I
haven't<00:03:04.319> obviously<00:03:04.800> gotten<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.130> 95<00:03:05.550> degrees

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
haven't obviously gotten the 95 degrees

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.690 
haven't obviously gotten the 95 degrees
with<00:03:06.150> these<00:03:06.330> yet<00:03:06.600> but<00:03:07.260> it's<00:03:07.950> about<00:03:08.160> 40<00:03:08.580> out

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700
