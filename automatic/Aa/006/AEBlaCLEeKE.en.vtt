given or you can use the torrent magnet

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.430 
given or you can use the torrent magnet
then<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> extract<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> ISO<00:01:01.020> using

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
then you have to extract the ISO using

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.979 
then you have to extract the ISO using
any<00:01:02.090> program<00:01:03.090> which<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.420> capable<00:01:03.600> of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
any program which is capable of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.490 
any program which is capable of
extracting<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.650> ISO<00:01:05.250> file<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:06.260> have<00:01:07.260> used

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
extracting the ISO file I have used

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.730 
extracting the ISO file I have used
7-zip<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.330> use<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> too<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.020> have

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
7-zip and you can use it too I have

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.340 
7-zip and you can use it too I have
already<00:01:10.860> extracted<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.909> files<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.869> I

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
already extracted the files so you I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.890 
already extracted the files so you I
don't<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.460> again<00:01:17.420> let's<00:01:18.420> go

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
don't have to do that again let's go

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.550 
don't have to do that again let's go

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
we have to install Microsoft Word so we

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.899 
we have to install Microsoft Word so we
have<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> deselect<00:01:46.619> all<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.189> other<00:01:47.340> programs

and<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:58.020> process<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.649> started<00:01:59.420> I'm<00:02:00.920> pausing

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
and the process is started I'm pausing

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.050 
and the process is started I'm pausing
this<00:02:02.009> video<00:02:02.450> till<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.630> process<00:02:04.020> finishes

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.859 

okay<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:07.780> now<00:02:07.990> it's<00:02:08.259> done<00:02:09.179> let<00:02:10.179> us<00:02:10.210> close<00:02:10.360> this

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
okay so now it's done let us close this

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.570 
okay so now it's done let us close this
window<00:02:12.060> now<00:02:13.060> we<00:02:13.120> have<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.680> activate<00:02:14.680> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
window now we have to activate the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.080 
window now we have to activate the
program<00:02:15.730> which<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.270> quite<00:02:17.020> tricky<00:02:17.410> process

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
program which is a quite tricky process

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.810 
program which is a quite tricky process
but<00:02:19.090> don't<00:02:19.330> worry<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.780> will<00:02:20.380> help<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.950> step<00:02:21.610> by

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
but don't worry I will help you step by

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.360 
but don't worry I will help you step by
step<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:22.770> activate<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.160> program

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
step to activate the program

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
step to activate the program
successfully<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.680> most<00:02:26.920> likely<00:02:27.760> problem<00:02:28.209> is

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
successfully the most likely problem is

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.370 
successfully the most likely problem is
the<00:02:28.780> kms<00:02:29.650> activation<00:02:30.390> most<00:02:31.390> kms<00:02:31.810> activations

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
the kms activation most kms activations

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.850 
the kms activation most kms activations
don't<00:02:33.130> last<00:02:33.340> long<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:34.440> we<00:02:35.440> have<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.680> use<00:02:35.830> a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
don't last long so we have to use a

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.600 
don't last long so we have to use a
program<00:02:36.160> called<00:02:36.400> Auto<00:02:37.000> kms<00:02:37.570> remover<00:02:38.610> which

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
program called Auto kms remover which

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.290 
program called Auto kms remover which
will<00:02:39.760> remove<00:02:40.090> all<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.870> hazards<00:02:41.709> that<00:02:42.300> occur

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
will remove all the hazards that occur

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.970 
will remove all the hazards that occur
due<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.870> invalid<00:02:44.590> kms<00:02:45.070> activation<00:02:46.830> just<00:02:47.830> run

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
due to invalid kms activation just run

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.210 
due to invalid kms activation just run
