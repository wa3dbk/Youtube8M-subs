00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 Hi guys, all good, I'm going to show today. 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.990
 for you 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.750
 is the result of this magic or organ of 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:15.350
 bioderm which is a mohawk magic with 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.740
 Eyes of Polynesia and Organic Macadamia 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.910
 was restorative magic and has pro vitamin 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.590
 b5 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.840
 You're from line 1 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.360
 here and she does not have to film in that 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.660
 daniela mineral is and learns the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.660
 first component of it is the await 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.570
 and here is not being able to read the others 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.210
 components I'll leave a little here 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:54.870
 for you to read 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:01:01.280
 who is interested in the components is 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.280
 a consistent white shade mask 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:10.310
 She has a very striking smell. 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.170
 striking the smell of it I paid and 1990 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.240
 I'm very happy because companies 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.570
 so nationals are they really 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.090
 investing they are seeing that we 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.090
 we are more demanding because we the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.799
 seek out and out products when 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.930
 the pilots come here 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.759
 the stores sell here in brazil they come 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.850
 with a very absurd price because of the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.740
 taxes so many people do not 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.950
 access to those masks that 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.860
 It's wonderful and everyone says it's a 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.570
 many girls talk and the market 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.630
 Brazilian companies have invested 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.000
 I think that's very cool because we 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.189
 You do not have to look far out there. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.259
 an option here it is obvious that there are 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.180
 brands are imported that are incredible 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.060
 They are wonderful, but we also have 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.340
 National products are very good I 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.340
 taking as consumer as is 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.640
 consumers like you right I do not I do not 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.700
 I'm doing a 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.569
 Advertising is illusory, right? 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.209
 talking I used the product and I liked it 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.190
 of the product being that this is not a lie 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.740
 I used to make an advertisement, I'm not 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.690
 advertising for the brand and if I 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.910
 I used the same consumer as you 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.820
 Come back here to show you one 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.560
 whether it was good or not good and 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.980
 I'm very happy because because this 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.800
 bioderm brand was a very good brand is 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.290
 I already have some products I've tried 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.810
 some reviews of the brand 10 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.560
 after he had after appearing in the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.320
 blogs is the youtube companies have grown 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.130
 very early they grew a lot by 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.290
 cause of the free disclosure of the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.260
 products actually because we talk 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.420
 it 's word of mouth it's very important and 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.640
 people generally believe in 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.410
 person who bought the product that went there 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.660
 shop bought the product than that 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.820
 which the company is paying for 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.390
 talk about the product usually happens 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.090
 that 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:13.420
 so are we doing any propaganda 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.549
 free for businesses but benefits 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.900
 It's the people who are here are 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:22.000
 watching why you end up having 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.030
 access to a very good product 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.950
 to products that are accessible is the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.799
 Most people most of the 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.829
 women is a march of repudiation 1990 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.690
 is not male of price of 57 reais but 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.390
 also you will not get poorer for 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.410
 cause of $ 20 or more rich because of 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.200
 $ 20 so it's a price that 's cool, yes it is 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.690
 it's worth it because it 's a magic 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:52.900
 that is very good the quality of people is 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.840
 Wonderful is I used this magic there Comes 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.430
 my hair and I used that mark and stayed 30 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.650
 minutes with her that says it's to stay 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.049
 from 10 to 25 I stayed 30 minutes 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.660
 I wanted to make the most of the magic 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.630
 so we lay that we applied in the 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.400

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.910
 my hair absorbed very fast then 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.190
 No, I always say that, no. 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.560
 put a lot of hair absorbed products 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.650
 this part absorbed do not put more and 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.169
 I usually put a little a little 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.539
 more in the tips that is the part of the hair 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.710
 which is more damaging so I always give 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:37.360
 special attention to the tips is me 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.390
