out you know obviously the screen

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.420 
out you know obviously the screen
doesn't<00:01:36.050> fall<00:01:36.350> out<00:01:36.380> too<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:36.980> can<00:01:37.160> lean<00:01:37.310> it

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
doesn't fall out too you can lean it

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.830 
doesn't fall out too you can lean it
forward<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.820> little<00:01:37.850> bit<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.450> can<00:01:38.600> get<00:01:38.720> to

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
forward a little bit so you can get to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.810 
forward a little bit so you can get to
the<00:01:38.930> bottom<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.350> screw<00:01:39.590> there<00:01:39.860> sometimes<00:01:40.700> you

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
the bottom the screw there sometimes you

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.130 
the bottom the screw there sometimes you
might<00:01:40.970> have<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.180> loosen<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.690> screws<00:01:41.930> down

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
might have to loosen the screws down

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.260 
might have to loosen the screws down
here<00:01:42.440> too<00:01:42.790> sometimes<00:01:43.790> you<00:01:43.970> might<00:01:44.060> have<00:01:44.150> to

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
here too sometimes you might have to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.700 
here too sometimes you might have to
take<00:01:44.450> them<00:01:44.600> out<00:01:44.720> it<00:01:44.900> just<00:01:45.080> depends<00:01:45.470> on<00:01:45.560> how

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
take them out it just depends on how

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.860 
take them out it just depends on how
they<00:01:45.860> did<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.130> at<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.340> factory<00:01:46.820> but<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.660> main

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
they did it at the factory but the main

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.720 
they did it at the factory but the main
important<00:01:48.350> thing<00:01:48.500> is<00:01:48.650> you<00:01:48.770> got<00:01:48.890> two<00:01:49.070> screws<00:01:49.430> on

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
important thing is you got two screws on

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.940 
important thing is you got two screws on
this<00:01:50.150> side<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.630> two<00:01:50.690> screws<00:01:51.320> on<00:01:51.530> this<00:01:51.770> side

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
this side and two screws on this side

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.670 
this side and two screws on this side
that<00:01:52.160> you<00:01:52.280> need<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.640> get<00:01:52.790> out<00:01:52.910> of<00:01:52.940> there<00:01:53.680> okay

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
that you need to get out of there okay

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.470 
that you need to get out of there okay
so<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.980> get<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.430> screws<00:01:55.730> those<00:01:55.970> two<00:01:56.150> on<00:01:56.300> this

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
so you get the screws those two on this

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.820 
so you get the screws those two on this
side<00:01:56.660> and<00:01:56.960> then<00:01:57.110> there<00:01:57.260> was<00:01:57.350> three<00:01:57.560> on<00:01:57.710> this

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
side and then there was three on this

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.410 
side and then there was three on this
side<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.340> know<00:01:58.430> sometimes<00:01:58.820> it's<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.030> factory

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
side you know sometimes it's the factory

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.820 
side you know sometimes it's the factory
they<00:01:59.570> do<00:01:59.630> different<00:02:00.170> things<00:02:00.200> like<00:02:00.530> that

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
they do different things like that

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.340 
they do different things like that
they're<00:02:00.980> all<00:02:01.070> put<00:02:01.250> together<00:02:01.340> by<00:02:01.730> people<00:02:02.350> so

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
they're all put together by people so

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.810 
they're all put together by people so
you<00:02:03.620> know<00:02:03.710> sometimes<00:02:04.100> they<00:02:04.280> forget<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.580> screw

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
you know sometimes they forget a screw

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.920 
you know sometimes they forget a screw
or<00:02:04.850> they<00:02:05.030> add<00:02:05.180> a<00:02:05.210> screw<00:02:05.510> whoever<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.810> case

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
or they add a screw whoever the case

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.870 
or they add a screw whoever the case
might<00:02:06.140> be<00:02:06.170> take<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.650> screws<00:02:06.890> out<00:02:07.070> then<00:02:07.760> of

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
might be take the screws out then of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.449 
might be take the screws out then of
course<00:02:08.149> you<00:02:08.300> can<00:02:08.479> lean<00:02:08.660> your<00:02:08.840> screen<00:02:09.459> forward

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
course you can lean your screen forward

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.400 
course you can lean your screen forward
bring<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.819> forward<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.360> then<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.110> can<00:02:12.260> see

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
bring it forward and then you can see

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.809 
bring it forward and then you can see
what<00:02:12.530> kind<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.739> connector<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.160> got<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:13.610> once

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
what kind of connector you got just once

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.729 
what kind of connector you got just once
an<00:02:14.030> LED<00:02:14.450> type<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.870> screen<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.379> you<00:02:15.470> only<00:02:15.590> got

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
an LED type the screen so you only got

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:16.410 
an LED type the screen so you only got
the<00:02:15.859> one<00:02:16.040> can<00:02:16.250> I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
the one can I

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.330 
the one can I
in<00:02:16.540> there<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.770> course<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:18.010> want<00:02:18.099> to<00:02:18.220> lift

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
in there and of course you want to lift

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.880 
in there and of course you want to lift
up<00:02:18.490> on<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> tape<00:02:19.030> here<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:20.410> want<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.739> get

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
up on the tape here and you want to get

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.580 
up on the tape here and you want to get
the<00:02:21.569> point<00:02:22.569> get<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.840> connector<00:02:23.230> off<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.530> air

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
the point get the connector off the air

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.080 
the point get the connector off the air
without<00:02:23.709> breaking<00:02:24.340> its<00:02:24.550> now<00:02:24.640> they<00:02:24.760> slide

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
without breaking its now they slide

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.960 
without breaking its now they slide
it'll<00:02:25.540> slide<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:26.560> way<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.700> then<00:02:27.819> when<00:02:27.910> you

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
it'll slide that way and then when you

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.190 
it'll slide that way and then when you
put<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.209> back<00:02:28.239> on<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.630> course<00:02:28.660> you're<00:02:28.930> gonna<00:02:29.020> go

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
put it back on of course you're gonna go

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.780 
put it back on of course you're gonna go
this<00:02:29.470> way<00:02:29.709> with<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.340> then<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.459> will<00:02:30.640> lock

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
this way with it and then it will lock

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.130 
this way with it and then it will lock
itself<00:02:31.030> in<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.130> get<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:34.360> tape<00:02:34.600> off<00:02:34.840> a

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
itself in but you get it to tape off a

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.800 
itself in but you get it to tape off a
little<00:02:35.470> bit<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.860> just<00:02:36.640> pull<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.330> like<00:02:37.600> I<00:02:37.750> said

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
little bit and just pull it like I said

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.920 
little bit and just pull it like I said
towards<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.620> way<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:40.480> will<00:02:40.569> come<00:02:40.750> right

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
towards that way and it will come right

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.650 
towards that way and it will come right
out<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.140> there

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
out of there

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.240 
out of there
without<00:02:42.930> our<00:02:43.110> new<00:02:43.290> screen<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.860> here<00:02:44.040> from

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
without our new screen in here from

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.630 
without our new screen in here from
screen<00:02:44.820> country<00:02:45.740> it's<00:02:46.740> gonna<00:02:46.890> match<00:02:47.190> right<00:02:47.490> up

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
screen country it's gonna match right up

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.610 
screen country it's gonna match right up
here<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:47.970> got<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.210> one<00:02:48.450> connector<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.470> we're

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
here we got the one connector that we're

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.110 
here we got the one connector that we're
going<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.800> need<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.040> plug<00:02:50.250> back<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.760> there<00:02:51.000> of

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.290 
give it a nice seal and of course we're
gonna<00:03:08.950> lift<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.970> up<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:11.770> we're<00:03:11.980> gonna<00:03:12.300> gonna

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
gonna lift it up and we're gonna gonna

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.940 
gonna lift it up and we're gonna gonna
position<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:14.050> so<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.290> we<00:03:14.530> can<00:03:14.680> get<00:03:14.830> our

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
position it so that we can get our

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.280 
position it so that we can get our
screws<00:03:15.340> back<00:03:15.370> in<00:03:15.820> there<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.840> from<00:03:17.110> what<00:03:17.230> I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
screws back in there and from what I

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.960 
screws back in there and from what I
recall<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.770> one<00:03:17.920> add<00:03:18.040> two<00:03:18.430> screws<00:03:18.700> on<00:03:18.730> this

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
recall this one add two screws on this

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.330
