 comment force there I confess I 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.080
 not too understand these people what 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.400

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.920
 super constructive comment and there 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.229
 enough of those who say all the time 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.820
 I thought it was about the same 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.119
 the same guy aquapanel way but that's 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.119
 I think a background game 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.579

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:23.210
 after there is what they censor youtube 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.770

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.360
 and we all agree to have 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.700
 tried the youtube adventure is not it 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.120
