00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.510
 these are people like Manuela Scholz thanks to them 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.200
 a "crime scene" is now the oldest in Europe 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.320
 the Trabert initially not only one of about 120 participants but it is present 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.309
 all member of the organization team 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.679
 midweek with guests the route in a race for that state 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.539
 and now they know of course an advantage for the person 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.029
 22-year-old 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.929
 So we have April at Albert as driven and logged in there 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.069
 We thought people were murdering us 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:32.840
 Moritz and his advantages and my chance uses the Weidlich from the same 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.010
 four times today tumbled down to the valley 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.750
 because he has two wheels at home, he also starts in two classes 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.589
 Once the market stops with such a wheel without suspension and later with 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:44.940
 the full suspension 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.530
 also in the Bundeswehr in the amateur classes 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.410
 the fastest and in the end not even five seconds slower than that 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.960
 fastest profile 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.710
 the organizational talent SÃ¶ren Schmidt who also this year in Tabarz 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.010
 can show the importance of the race whether indebtedness leads and 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.660
 Money for us are the commissioners to save refrained Schmidt this time 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.890
 but it takes to be awarded world ranking points 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.800
 the drivers come anyway because of the island situation deep stretches the the 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.810
 Borders invite Kerr 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.759
 and sometimes 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.000
 also the whole trip 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.610
 but has done something for his what the other downhill race in 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.110
 Thuringia failed to succeed in difficult economic times 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.840
 to survive 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.040
 and so is Walter Barth Smith 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.190
 a well-founded Sunday 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.370
 they are all called 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.730
 the stage is the party that could turn everything to us but that to her it 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.610
 also very different in the big walk and I think that's what it wants 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.410
 Percent where backed up next to us 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.090
 the race has survived the anticipation so spectacularly the falls 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.910
 Also, most of the time they go off lightly, there is public appeal for them 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.110
 it does not break off 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.950
 It's amazing to hear that the organizers 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.179
 only two months to prepare 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.899
 because the state cleared differences with the local government 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:56.370
 was 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.390
 but in the end everything had worked out and that does not only make the overall winner happy 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.800
 decorated from Belgium
