 I have enough feedback in the beginning I 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.250
 I liked it because I did not want to repeat my mouth 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.629
 so I wanted to have the record but I 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.160

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.960

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.700

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.890

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.510
 Give it to him, but let's lighten it. 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.190

 also give a whitening at the tips 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.970
 Because talking to Jessica, she 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.380
 said I do not want to have too much commitment 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.760
 retouching 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.920
 when the woman does not want to have too much 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.890
 retouch the more the bleaching well 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.780
 more tips better and smaller touches and 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.650
 They live much higher up. 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.650
 need to type 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.349
 people I loved follow the transformation 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.060
 the jéssica and taking it we will 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.310
 show you a little bit later 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.310
 while a little bit taking everything as 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.680
 was this transformation because it was not 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.260
 totally radical but even in how I give 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.150
 a lot of the concept of Jessica is not this 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.220
 transformation of the Jessica I call it 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.230
 small changes with big impacts 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.260
 we did not do a bog 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.989
 we made the hat it not because I 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.040
 I'm a warrior about it's two to three 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.620
 lighter tones 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.140
 the ombre of four to six more tones 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.510
 Clear is very soft sure it is more 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.209
 smooth but also of great impact 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.970
 he values the color he values the cut 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.160
 That's the coolest thing about Jessica. 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.020
 play with her style and rock 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:18.940
 horrible 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:22.270
 we are going to see the big 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.940
 transformation of the beautiful and 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.890
 renewed and then Jessica liked to talk 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.600
 little for us is not your email 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.580
 It's very beautiful, I asked him something. 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.040
 with more volume which gives a clear 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.290
 left the face of summer 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.790
 he see if I wanted much more than 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.800
 I never imagined that I would be so 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.560
 known and subject to dying of fear 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.240
 but we found it was perfect and only that I 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.580
 know the shopkeeper that I am personal 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.250
 stylist then we also look a lot 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.650
 question of personal style to Jessica 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.050
 it is super detached detached is very 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.120
 then she puts modern lu ranging 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.450
 fully match that look 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.060
 all deprived and unpretentious and that's it 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.120
 That's cool, you understand what you mean. 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.700
 need is to understand his style 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.310
 bring this to your image and the 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.740
 now it's perfect, I loved it 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.070
 now it 's new life in our lives 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.410
