00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
but the very first time I believe that

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.420 
but the very first time I believe that
should<00:04:09.140> be<00:04:09.200> done<00:04:09.440> by<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.620> professional<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:10.400> you

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
have the basic shape and then you can
