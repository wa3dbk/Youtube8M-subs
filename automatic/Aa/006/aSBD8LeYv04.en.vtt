00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:07.810
 it's about one 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.539
 the little flags 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:11.669
 but it already has percent 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.759
 the great effect 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.929
 yes, and indeed, the clacking is therefore what today imagines 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.810
 Bounty 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.569
 and the packing allows you 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:26.009
 To get along with Eick Annemie you need him to lead him again 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.949
 to put that to one in the morning Benedict Bild 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.050
 Bring in money that means if now a zombie or so kills you get 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.069
 Money for that, you can still set everything wonderful as Phil Mogg 

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:41.930
 should bring us on and percent the whole corps and do it 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.840
 yes of course you can download all that sense I have my favorite room 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.110
 Video Star »augrund percent 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.500
 otherwise it could 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500
 here on the page again documents 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.980
 around 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.800
 Let's start with that 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.339
 to set the clack percent or he says he said to install 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.060
 In addition it sounds two variants there was still more mac version thereby 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.500
 So for all mac-user percent you need to download the folder 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.920
 all windows users 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.070
 they here 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.260
 and there is Japan and folder and Nathan granted 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.430
 To be at the nuclear plant was a bit of a reason 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.230
 and percent 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.920
 Webster so another file so I know now with Magnus out but on 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.750
 In any case, they have to race 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.020
 for her to watch how it works 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.830
 yes, in any case, pull up to the two files just a folder 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.960
 and Ammann might be around but died of that percent being accurate 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.820
 would 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.590
 and percent 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.590
 clarify the moment there 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.180
 so was 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.180
 Mix MOP Bounty Cup victory in Tokyo 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.880
 okay 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.200
 and finally stop 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.330
 and close is forewarned 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.960
 and have around my head and neck 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.370
 what in this place 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.370
 once there is percent 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.559
 Percent text files 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:10.690
 around 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.219
 that throws 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.399
 or he said he comes under is that you distribute the garbage July fort text 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:17.509
 to have 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:22.139
 and percent fit here already completely sets realities 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.020
 as 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.179
 high the amount of money is for 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.269
 the respective 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.319
 Percent animal or monster 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.430
 that is send and so that in the very simple things 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.799
 well I would also well except if he wanted to project not necessarily money 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.009
 to adjust 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:43.439
 but in the population depending on video Ariel economic conditions that are 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.180
 be mine 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.109
 now criteria are the 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.859
 a million or so then it is too blatantly goofy if now whole 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.799
 Look at prices OSO lower so there you have to like 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.549
 percent yes balanced ratio percent 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.989
 So after Sumaya farhat-naser set everything under them too 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.819
 could stop that content 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.909
 So percent of just have to just rewrite the numbers here 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.809
 Crime into the 20th 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:12.189
 Wolf is now 30 or so 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.029
 Kor 5 works too 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.029
 yes and percent that's easy today 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:23.849
 yes ten other two text files around the z there put the cap percent 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.389
 multiply 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.389
 In any case, I have not coached that is even more 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.339
 I now definitely find this bomb percent 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:37.469
 I have not dealt with it now 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.230
 the food to ten percent 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.230
 hilarious I paint 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.239
 but the emission itself could definitely 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.109
 he brings every animal 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:49.879
 percent 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.739
 just stop the amount that has set and now reads and multiply or 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:54.389
 so 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.389
 So you can leave it that way and just like new ones 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.329
 the whole percent 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.979
 Change prices yes 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:07.449
 MOPO was already showing around the Wars and is a small poster and I'm a percent 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:08.869
 I'll just say 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:10.050
 Percent year 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.199
 how so with the money is the same 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.449
 so I just wanted to condemn it 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:21.719
 the same commons and thus can get heavier the percent 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:26.300
 First of all, let's get some monster money first 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.840
 Now the drivers have 70 tons of dollars 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.129
 and around 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:34.270
 our test is best 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.259
 for me 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.629
 to do so give yourself APA 1 Bonn murder 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:40.150
 and then Sonndeg 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.020
 and then one time 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.229
 so from Pearson VW Kvitfjell 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.650
 I also want to use these » 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.960
 In any case, it had an urban $ 20 jump and he 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.980
 also found that we have been getting money for the percent quirks 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.809
 of the zombie 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:58.809
 The whole thing is synonymous with toys with Triton or something 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.909
 by Twitter are already 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.370
 Parson of the net in corridors 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.539
 or my answers 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.599
 Speiser 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:14.589
 CEO 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:16.279
 v 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.279
 we are now 28% Cu on five goals 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:23.710
 and it does not stop every time Winnenden plays he kills 

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:25.960
 Percent monsters are not killed 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.969
 and percent 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.309
 so it is possible to kill with monsters 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:33.419
 Make money year so 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.129
 because its consumption that it to none 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.719
 So do not imagine any for now 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.430
 possibly LPG server or something 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.830
 or perhaps economic promoters wadded away 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.249
 Want to circulate money and percent 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:51.469
 now we live so special area have monsters are questioned why 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.240
 can slaughter us 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.330
 including that you earn money in it and should therefore, firstly, use 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.710
 can safely do on the server 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.050
 give up until the next summit goodbye
