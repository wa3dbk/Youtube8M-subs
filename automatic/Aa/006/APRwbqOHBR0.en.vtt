00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 in which is the mind not to get dislike 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.420
 esp and strong or video on this occasion os 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.400
 I'm going to present the new goddess 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.740
 here is called place here the vais to be able 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.990
 see more perfectly and well then the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.519
 truth is that it is a goddess that the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.170
 probability of testing a game with 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.330
 she and the truth I like it a lot so 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.550
 is I come showing you how you see or attack 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.529
 basic because that distance is like that with 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.300
 this kind of wand and its passive is 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.580
 quite interesting and kindly at 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.880
 crystal is told to us that it does not go has the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.660
 power of five colored crystals and 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.950
 when using a skill it activates its 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.110
 corresponding crystal for ten 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.149
 seconds guaranteeing you a bonus 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.980
 additional that I will read them when all the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.440
 crystals are active that is when 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.809
 we use all the skills in little 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.350
 time a little difference time nova 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.700
 it becomes more snake and 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.879
 refreshes the duration of all bonuses 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.670
 for 10 seconds a passive the truth very 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.550
 very interesting as you see we already have one 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.500
 of the crystals that is the bonus the green 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.420
 that comes to us by default and the others 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.070
 we're going to get them we're going to read 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.140
 the first skill called a seal 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.080
 fog and tells us that in grapes it 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.229
 condenses in a fog that follows in 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.380
 one with a speed although it's 95% of 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.710
 yours and all the allies are 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.259
 that is to say they can not be seen by 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.500
 the enemies inside the fog if 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.330
 we attack the fog breaks and while 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.990
 the enemies get inside the fog 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.289
 they are taking damage although it is very little 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:40.659
 damage this activates the blue crystal that we 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:42.009
 give a movement bonus , let's use it 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.440
 already as you see here is not attacking and 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.200
 we use the 1 and now it eliminated us 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.640
 seeing is only seeing this 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.130
 circle on the ground and how and is it 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.869
 receiving a year although very little is 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.539
 well, this would be practically the 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.429
 first skill we are going to take us about 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.780
 etc and we have used as you have seen 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.659
 the third skill that now follows 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.219
 read and well let's read them not the 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.580
 second and the third the second is called 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.360
 crucible of yes no 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:12.590
 instead conjures a few minions of the 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.580
 land that have 200 health life 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.090
 good plus a percentage of the total life 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.860
 from Uruguay and they are going to attack the lines 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.900
 and attack the towers and they are very very 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.940
 useful for good because for example in 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.770
 conquest to throw the towers conquers us 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.020
 this goddess is very very good is very 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.590
 girl and well the third villa is very 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.840
 good 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.240
 well I forgot the second one too 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.300
 skill activates the bonus crystal that 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.370
 gives us physical protection the third 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.520
 skill is called frame strike and it's a 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.670
 fire that harms and exposes the 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.080
 enemies for a second and they bone them 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.740
 they are burning it does not have as a 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.650
 species of bleeding the year increases without 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.100
 that water forgiveness is closer to the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.470
 skill and this activates the red crystal 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.110
 the fire that gives the attacks of 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.550
 water more damage to those around 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.160
 that is to say we are going to see them but 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.780
 if we shoot that blood for example 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.760
 so let's give the children that 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.770
 have around we use the 3 here what 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.860
 you are dead and now as you see then 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.630
 we do area damage in half to all 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.060
 the children around do not with which 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.210
 that passive is new from that of number 3 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.580
 how would you do it on 2 so you can see a 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.950
 little how it works now as you see 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.810
 I only invoke a million but when 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.940
 we have the ability to the maximum we invoke 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.920
 to five and the truth is quite useful 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.750
 especially as I say to support 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.850
 lines in conquest 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.490
 well here you are watching is very very very 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.290
 good the passive of the third ability 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.150
 and let's see the fourth one that is also 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.450
 very interesting is called pillar on van 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:54.150
 and tells us that good that invokes 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.430
 pillars of the sky for 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.439
 catch the enemies to impress them 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.000
 create a square with an electric field 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:06.030
 I think they are killing me and the enemies 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.760
 that go through the square they go 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.890
 electrocuting and losing speed 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.579
 movement for three seconds and this 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.430
 active in the skill the passive of nowa 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.650
 of the metal that what it does is that its 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.449
 Basic attacks have double the damage 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.560
 so pretty interesting are we going to 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.350
 use here on 3 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.449
 let's also use the 2 and we will use 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.330
 the 4 here you see it is the kind of 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.620
 mountain very very very interesting that what 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.960
 what he does, as you have seen, is 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.710
 literally burst enemies and 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.979
 that joining it with for example a 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.380
 Areso multi bird as it has a 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.850
 effect or it will have a devastating effect not 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.669
 so you already know a possible 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.260
 way to use the minions as I say no 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.660
 they are useful against the gods not the 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.389
 they attack but yes that good they are useful 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.490
 to support linear not as I say here 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.780
 they made him kill one easily and 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.910
 I tell you that in what is very 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.020
 touched this goddess and it is easy then 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.240
 get out with her 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.560
 games very good friends so I've 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.129
 seen I guess obviously also 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.229
 they will announce it when they play and well 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:11.909
 here you will see also to see if we 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.310
 we can load this thousand as you see is 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.470
 very easy to charge enemies when 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.120
 we have the activated ones the three 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.849
 it's good because you're already seeing it 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.440
 devastating and let's now see the 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.479
 passive we have left to see what is 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.979
 when we combine all the passive and 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.349
 we have already been told that what we are going to 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.680
 get is going to be a snake shape 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:34.979
 and that all the effects if not us 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.050
 activate for 10 seconds, not like this 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.090
 that we are going to try to kill this change 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.220
 we will also try to kill this 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.409
 possessed although we have little life but 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.180
 good as you can see it's pretty easy and 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.190
 obviously it's about practicing not 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.830
 we would have it so easy actually 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.690
 let's see if we escape this and I 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.000
 he turned the invisible ones as you see, not us 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.620
 You are totally disoriented and I already 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.690
 I say well this may seem to be 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.520
 because they are boats but in the sand it costs 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.120
 much for example you can download to 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.680
 a cloud because you see it you see everything 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.900
 there is on the ground let's say the fog but 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.440
 you do not see it there you can move 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.540
 so 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.830
 quite interesting let's see how you 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.550
 I say like of all the skills 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.410
 we use the 1 we use the 2 we use the 3 and 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.150
 we use the 4 and as you can see it makes me 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.520
 a tremendous snake I take a 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.610
 double what it is that the tail is 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.100
 He has dived me but what would be good is 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.840
 a snake in this case although as 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.210
 you see good because there has been a small 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.310
 book is normal because it has just come out 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.990
 God , I tell you that I never had 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.970
 gone before but good you had the 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.950
 bad luck to meet him and 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.300
 Well, this is practically all not 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.710
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.870
 Goddess who, as I say, promises and promises 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.400
 quite here you are seeing the damage that 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.160
 I am able to remove only with the 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.660
 passive and good because I hope that you 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.830
 you liked it and if there enjoying 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.830
 maite up another goodbye
