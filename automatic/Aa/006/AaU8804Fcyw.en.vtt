00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.160
 you have a long time ago by the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.540
 climbing after skiing very fast I liked 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.830
 because I always found 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.080
 even when I was very bad this third 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.430
 it was a great way to get around 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.050
 mountain I find it great because 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.350
 the climb is not more painful than at 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.529
 foot and then in the descent it's 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.029
 a lot more baroque to thiais 56 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.189
 first in the alps the andes 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.910
 the himalaya the remy atlas the most is 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.219
 today one of the best 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.690
 extreme ski specialists have 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.610
 also two steep slopes where 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.550
 the inclination exceeds 50 degrees 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.200
 is reading the book by Patrick 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.850
 vallance in extreme skiing that gave me a little 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.870
 put the flea in the ear that made me 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.340
 dreaming when I was a kid and then in 82 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.750
 just 18 years old I found myself at 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.860
 top of the whymper corridor at the church 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.540
 open at the time it was far from 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.320
 a classic 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.550
 I admit that I had a little legs 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.010
 disco it's shaking and dry 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.269
 and then after that everything was chained 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.009
 it's been 27 years since it lasted 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.920
 exploit date the descent of the face 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.290
 is the bal terminals in Switzerland rémy lécluse 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.840
 choose route carefully 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.200
 parish grandeur the aesthetics of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.200
 line 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.439
 because steep slope with 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.909
 a fairly rudimentary technique the most 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.960
 important is the head condition 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.000
 physical and the head 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.090
 I think that already agreed these two 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.229
 parameters there is one on 80% of the 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.420
 problem of solved 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.530
 and then after when I talk about the head 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.259
 it is also the apprehension of 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.549
 conditions and the condition of the 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:42.969
 snow we will meet what is 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:44.799
 very very important the quality of the 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.840
 Snow Remy Lecluse the study almost 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.609
 day-to-day on the field but 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.349
 also on the internet to know 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:53.500
 the evolution of the snowpack 

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:55.659
 whatever the place of malaria or the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.939
 peru as here in the langatte case is 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.939
 descended with the american glen plex 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.460
 I do not know 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.420
 I especially want to have fun with my 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.099
 skis then after the top is 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.870
 pretty who are a bit hard this and 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.319
 that in addition we can have fun this is 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.720
 important 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.970
 but after the altitude I do not care 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.989
 little since the fish after I 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.220
 especially want to have fun explains her 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.709
 the performance of the times she comes it's 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.269
 great to perform a perf but sometimes 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.069
 I also enjoy skiing 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.920
 in a pretty clearing in the forests 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.840
 than what is steep slopes in 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.400
 Remy Lecluse leave next September 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.480
 what is the manaslu with customers 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.609
 This is not new 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.410
 he has already made a dozen of his 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.910
 first in commitments in 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.280
 meanwhile he should not stay 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.140
 Inactive the Alps abounds with slopes 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.769
 virgins who have not yet seen these 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.769
 traces of skis
