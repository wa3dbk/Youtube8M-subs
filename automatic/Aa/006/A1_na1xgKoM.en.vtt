00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 so continue now with the olives 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.740
 magic rods with the 3 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.550
 I got from the world of Harry Potter 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.889
 especially the boxes because I too 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.530
 she thinks she's great when there 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.730
 or the benders may cause of 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.990
 finance 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:24.510
 that's the hand u2 until you see it 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.730
 for almost 400 years before Christ 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.000
 the fans but I do not know 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.680
 I am because of the Romans of London year 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.370
 I founded this level like me too 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.750
 on the front this time on the side 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.379
 let's go on the stupid is namely 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.030
 m 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.129
 I can with the ponies if that 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.910
 I do not have the names there 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.110
 on it as with the bars I stick so of the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.850
 noble collection resp 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.610
 to buy at elbenwald in germany 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.059
 So I go there I could remember 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.390
 soundtrack was already a bit again 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.510
 too loud it will be the computer 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.280
 changeable to get up and I have 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.750
 online i just do not have the bars 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.369
 more found on the home page of 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.380
 I do not have universal studios 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.150
 more found the capsule and on the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.080
 special grabber stand because you're harry 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.970
 and hermine continues to roll us on 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.900
 sure if this would have to be going on 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:27.420
 so on with a length of 26 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.860
 centimeters it's pretty short 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.659
 also damn easy because the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.250
 wands here are not out 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.659
 kotka is like the other wands 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.820
 also have no metal bar inside 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.939
 this is some resin asking 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.049
 Please do not tell me what exactly 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:51.149
 so pretty easy 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:53.540
 there is brown has this green-yellow 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.770
 rings lines 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.070
 that's just really only alone 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.780
 when 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.030
 say collectibles or deco items 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.620
 Thought because you do not want anything with it 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.060
 can start because just as easy 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.290
 and most likely very much 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.479
 fragile I do not have it yet 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.460
 tried how much you do with it 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.690
 but i prefer to be careful because 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.450
 it is not clear when I am 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.070
 does not come from the usa and then 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.570
 not even on ebay again 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.710
 that 's why I do not know if they are from the 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.800
 have taken assortment 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:26.730
 I would have to get look at myself 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.510
 if you still find that somewhere 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.980
 was now the villa and English 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.980
 for a bum as well will be on
