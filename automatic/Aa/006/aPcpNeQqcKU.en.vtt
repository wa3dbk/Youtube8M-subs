nice<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.310> shiny<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.650> then<00:01:13.650> what<00:01:13.770> we're<00:01:13.890> going

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
nice and shiny and then what we're going

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.340 
nice and shiny and then what we're going
to<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.400> our<00:01:14.580> clear<00:01:14.970> polish<00:01:15.479> or<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.110> clear

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
to do with our clear polish or the clear

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.499 
to do with our clear polish or the clear
part<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.619> our<00:01:16.770> glitter<00:01:17.070> polish<00:01:17.549> you're<00:01:18.299> just

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
part of our glitter polish you're just

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.109 
part of our glitter polish you're just
going<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.960> make<00:01:19.259> big<00:01:20.040> bubbles<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.970> like

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
going to make big bubbles with it I like

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.450 
going to make big bubbles with it I like
to<00:01:21.150> use<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> brush<00:01:21.990> versus<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> dotting<00:01:23.430> tool

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
to use the brush versus a dotting tool

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.190 
to use the brush versus a dotting tool
because<00:01:24.060> dotting<00:01:24.360> tools<00:01:24.570> tend<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.930> make<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
because dotting tools tend to make this

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.990 
because dotting tools tend to make this
a<00:01:25.259> little<00:01:25.530> flatter<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.159> want<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.790> look

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
a little flatter and I want it to look

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.330 
a little flatter and I want it to look
more<00:01:27.500> 3-dimensional<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.799> was<00:01:28.890> actual

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
more 3-dimensional like it was actual

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.910 
more 3-dimensional like it was actual
water<00:01:29.670> droplets<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.140> taking<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.590> end<00:01:31.740> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
water droplets so just taking the end of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.480 
water droplets so just taking the end of
your<00:01:32.009> brush<00:01:32.310> dot<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> few<00:01:33.420> times<00:01:34.280> make<00:01:35.280> some

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
your brush dot a few times make some

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.850 
your brush dot a few times make some
larger<00:01:36.090> globs<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.200> make<00:01:37.350> some<00:01:37.530> smaller

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
larger globs and then make some smaller

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.410 
larger globs and then make some smaller
ones<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.340> well<00:01:38.490> because<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.909> notice<00:01:39.090> well

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
ones as well because if you notice well

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.640 
ones as well because if you notice well
like<00:01:39.540> when<00:01:39.689> your<00:01:39.810> hands<00:01:39.990> are<00:01:40.140> splattered<00:01:40.619> with

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
like when your hands are splattered with

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.770 
like when your hands are splattered with
water<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.549> dots<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.329> different

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
water you get dots of all different
