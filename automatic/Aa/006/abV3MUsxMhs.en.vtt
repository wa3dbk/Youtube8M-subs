00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
percent can get away with a very

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.270 
percent can get away with a very
well-made<00:02:45.600> freemate<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:46.800> when<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:46.950> say<00:02:47.130> well

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
well-made freemate so when I say well

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.550 
well-made freemate so when I say well
made<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.610> needs<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.880> be<00:02:48.000> very<00:02:48.900> accurate<00:02:49.110> I

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
made it needs to be very accurate I

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.070 
made it needs to be very accurate I
standardized<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.760> angles<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.450> didn't<00:02:51.959> really

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
standardized the angles I didn't really

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.500 
standardized the angles I didn't really
think<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:52.470> would<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.940> great<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.269> really

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
think it would be that great I really

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.930 
think it would be that great I really
didn't<00:02:54.810> but<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.769> just<00:02:55.890> proved<00:02:56.160> me<00:02:56.310> wrong<00:02:56.489> and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
didn't but it just proved me wrong and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.880 
didn't but it just proved me wrong and
