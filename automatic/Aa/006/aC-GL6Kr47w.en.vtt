won't be won't show you for security

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.080 
won't be won't show you for security
reasons<00:03:13.800> you<00:03:14.310> need<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.550> tell<00:03:14.700> your<00:03:14.790> friends

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
that and they need to put that into the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.699 
that and they need to put that into the
server<00:03:17.700> dress<00:03:18.000> bit<00:03:18.269> inside<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.319> minecraft

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
server dress bit inside the minecraft

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.840 

so<00:03:22.960> that<00:03:23.140> same<00:03:23.410> principle<00:03:23.650> applies<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.490> if<00:03:24.700> you

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
so that same principle applies to if you

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.460 
so that same principle applies to if you
want<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.150> connect<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.630> someone<00:03:25.960> else's<00:03:26.320> server

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
want to connect to someone else's server

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.560 
want to connect to someone else's server
they<00:03:27.100> need<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.370> tell<00:03:27.520> your<00:03:27.670> their<00:03:27.970> IP<00:03:28.210> will

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
they need to tell your their IP will

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.660 
they need to tell your their IP will
that<00:03:28.750> be<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.960> number<00:03:29.350> IP<00:03:29.650> or<00:03:30.010> they<00:03:30.460> may<00:03:30.580> have

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
that be a number IP or they may have

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.610 
that be a number IP or they may have
created<00:03:30.940> their<00:03:31.270> own<00:03:31.330> online<00:03:31.690> ID<00:03:32.050> which<00:03:32.320> using

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
created their own online ID which using

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.950 
created their own online ID which using
an<00:03:32.680> address<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:33.670> just<00:03:33.940> ask<00:03:34.120> for<00:03:34.450> whatever<00:03:34.750> that

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
an address so just ask for whatever that

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.320 
an address so just ask for whatever that
is<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.470> then<00:03:36.340> you'll<00:03:36.580> be<00:03:36.610> able<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.970> connect

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
is and then you'll be able to connect

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.210 
is and then you'll be able to connect
about<00:03:37.570> using<00:03:37.900> that<00:03:37.990> as<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.170> new<00:03:38.380> server<00:03:38.830> address

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
about using that as a new server address

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.420 
about using that as a new server address
so<00:03:40.090> that's<00:03:40.420> how<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.630> join<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.650> server<00:03:42.070> in

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
so that's how you join a server in

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.700 
so that's how you join a server in
