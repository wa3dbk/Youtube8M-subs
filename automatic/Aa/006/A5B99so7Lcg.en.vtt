00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hey that such friends of youtube this is the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.029
 Intro of the song dancing de enrique 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.040
 churches if they want to keep up with the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.719
 chords here I leave an annotation for 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.410
 that they can go and learn it also to the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.049
 perfection 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.920
 let's use mines the standard many 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.920
 how we started 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.250
 perfect let's go dividing as per 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:45.239
 phrases the first sentence we're going to 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.239
 learn is this 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.969
 i 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.570
 let's use already know from the hand of 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.120
 one two three and four finger one is going to 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.460
 occupy will cover the fret 2 and the 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.129
 finger 2 the fret 3 we are going to focus 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.810
 now nothing else on the rope number 1 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.550
 we start air after fret 2 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:10.159
 after hammer technique though it's hit 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.280
 chickens the movement 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.150
 then we return fret 2 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.150
 in the air 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.590
 32 since it is a fast movement 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.680
 game booster 3 2 1 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.800
 all right 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.800
 i 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.410
 perfect the next sentence would be this 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.670
 like it focuses these two frets nothing 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.310
 more than now we also cover the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.580
 rope number two we started equal to 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.580
 air 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.650
 we go up now yes and three blows 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.970
 air 1 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.080
 to the air 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.490
 we go down 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:22.060
 and then we slide from 1 to 2 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.060
 let's do it equally very slow 3 2 1 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.470
 do not 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.640
 all right 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.440
 then we are going to join these two parts 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.140
 now if at an average speed so that 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.140
 they are learning it 3 2 1 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.850
 weather 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.920
 and 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.430
 perfect we go almost in half we go to 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.430
 the next phrase chicken I know 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.020
 this let's play the strings one and 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.970
 two at a time 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.980
 we started by placing number one finger in 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.870
 rope number one fret number three 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.870
 that is going to be very slow 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.189
 what do we do a finger change 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.670
 and we slide here to the number fret 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.670
 7 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.770
 all right 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.250
 and again we slide 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.250
 Y 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.660
 I do not want to make it very slow 3 2 1 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.260
 i 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.830
 all right 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.830
 I 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.030
 now a little faster 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.549
 Y 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.269
 perfect we move on to the next arrangement 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.269
 girls and how is it 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.110
 Y 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.440
 this is very easy is nothing else in the 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.980
 Fret number 8 with finger number 2 and 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.020
 with 3 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:38.680
 according to 1 and 2 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.680
 then we went to 10 2 taps 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.000
 Y 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.580
 ok then we went up fret rope 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.400
 number three rope two and after the number 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.260
 four rope number three 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.260
 let's do it equally slow 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.729
 Y 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.620
 and we come to the final arrangement 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:07.329
 here remember also will alternate the 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:08.379
 barb to gain more agility more 

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:10.539
 speed 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:14.169
 this is also easy check fret 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:17.229
 number 8 finger number two and three rope 1 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.729
 and 2 and these one backward travel two 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:24.589
 blows two others 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.589
 we change position check d 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.470
 let's go 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.470
 all right 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.520
 that was going to make it slow 3 2 1 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.030
 Y 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.750
 we have all the phrases learned 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.760
 now we are going to do everything to 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:52.600
 slow speed and then we do it 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.600
 medium and then fast 3 2 1 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.350
 good 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.449
 good 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.440
 but 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.440
 i 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.280
 all right 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.879
 perfect hours and a half 321 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.850
 and all 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.569
 m 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.310
 Y 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.390
 Y 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.090
 remember to make it clean also though 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.040
 not be so fast but be clean 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.080
 they will see that it is solid then they will 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.250
 go giving speed little by little not 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.470
 forget to leave me down here your
