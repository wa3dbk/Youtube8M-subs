cooler<00:00:11.309> master<00:00:11.550> set<00:00:11.820> me<00:00:11.880> three<00:00:12.179> different

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
cooler master set me three different

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.820 
cooler master set me three different
versions<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.080> fans<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.469> me<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.620> take<00:00:13.799> a

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
versions of the fans for me to take a

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.010 
versions of the fans for me to take a
look<00:00:14.099> at<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.969> black<00:00:15.179> one<00:00:15.480> the

look at and that is the black one the
blue<00:00:16.289> one<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.859> red<00:00:17.310> one<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:17.970> without

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
blue one and the red one so without

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.580 
blue one and the red one so without
further<00:00:18.359> ado<00:00:18.750> let's<00:00:19.080> just<00:00:19.199> have<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.380> bit<00:00:19.560> more

also included in the box are mounting
screws<00:00:29.490> because<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:29.939> come<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.150> their<00:00:30.359> own

screws because they come with their own
threading<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
threading on there it's not like the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.990 
threading on there it's not like the
regular<00:00:31.920> fans<00:00:32.309> where<00:00:32.460> you've<00:00:32.579> got<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> hard

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
regular fans where you've got the hard

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.250 
regular fans where you've got the hard
plastic<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.600> create<00:00:33.870> your<00:00:33.960> own<00:00:34.020> thread

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
plastic and you create your own thread

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.720 
plastic and you create your own thread
when<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.530> screw<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:34.980> also<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.520> get

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
when you screw it in also you get

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.880 
when you screw it in also you get
included<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> box<00:00:36.600> -<00:00:36.960> sonnet<00:00:37.380> adapters

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
included in the box - sonnet adapters

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.889 
included in the box - sonnet adapters
now<00:00:38.309> that's<00:00:38.550> these<00:00:38.700> little<00:00:38.760> things<00:00:39.300> now<00:00:39.750> what

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
now that's these little things now what

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.260 
now that's these little things now what
these<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.469> these<00:00:40.920> restrict<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> RPM<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
these do is these restrict to the RPM to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.270 
these do is these restrict to the RPM to
a<00:00:42.360> fixed<00:00:42.719> amount<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:43.680> reduces<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
a fixed amount so this one reduces it to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.880 
a fixed amount so this one reduces it to
1,200<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.539> reduces<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.050> 1,600

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
1,200 and this one reduces it to 1,600

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.100 
1,200 and this one reduces it to 1,600
also<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> DV<00:00:48.750> which<00:00:48.960> will

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
also you have on here the DV which will

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.830 
also you have on here the DV which will
affect<00:00:49.379> fan<00:00:49.680> tune<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.460> one's<00:00:50.670> 19<00:00:51.149> DB<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
affect fan tune so this one's 19 DB and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.020 
affect fan tune so this one's 19 DB and
this<00:00:52.020> one's<00:00:52.199> 28<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.190> depending<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.670> how<00:00:53.820> loud

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
this one's 28 so depending on how loud

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.580 
this one's 28 so depending on how loud
the<00:00:54.239> fans<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.260> use<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> appropriate

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the fans are you can use the appropriate

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.010 
the fans are you can use the appropriate
adapter<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.670> reduce<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.149> volume<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.809> will

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
adapter to reduce that volume this will

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.260 
adapter to reduce that volume this will
reduce<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.440> RPM<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> fans<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.609> also<00:00:59.910> how

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
reduce the RPM of the fans and also how

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.970 
reduce the RPM of the fans and also how
much<00:01:00.420> they're<00:01:00.690> cooling<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> need<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.859> make

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
much they're cooling so you need to make

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.779 
much they're cooling so you need to make
sure<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.219> keep<00:01:02.399> checking<00:01:02.550> those

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
sure you keep checking those

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:03.979 
sure you keep checking those
temperatures<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.300> make<00:01:03.539> sure<00:01:03.690> you've<00:01:03.840> not

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
temperatures to make sure you've not

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.719 
temperatures to make sure you've not
slowed<00:01:04.199> them<00:01:04.379> down<00:01:04.409> too<00:01:04.769> much<00:01:05.040> looking<00:01:05.549> at<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
slowed them down too much looking at the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.280 
slowed them down too much looking at the
fan<00:01:05.909> straight<00:01:06.180> after<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> boxes<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:07.110> isn't

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
fan straight after the boxes there isn't

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.050 
fan straight after the boxes there isn't
a<00:01:07.320> huge<00:01:07.619> difference<00:01:07.770> between<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.369> two<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
a huge difference between the two the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.460 
a huge difference between the two the
main<00:01:09.299> difference<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.840> with<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.260> one

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
main difference is that with this one

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.140 
main difference is that with this one
here<00:01:10.710> because<00:01:11.100> there's<00:01:11.280> LED<00:01:11.610> lighting<00:01:12.030> in

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
here because there's LED lighting in

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.760 
here because there's LED lighting in
there<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.720> fans<00:01:12.960> themselves<00:01:13.110> are<00:01:13.530> quiet

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
there the fans themselves are quiet

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.710 
there the fans themselves are quiet
clear<00:01:14.040> see-through<00:01:14.250> plastic<00:01:14.549> however<00:01:15.479> with

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.160 
the one that's straight black again it
is<00:01:17.549> quite<00:01:17.820> see-through<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.689> has<00:01:18.810> got<00:01:19.049> this

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
is quite see-through but it has got this

look<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> corners<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:25.590> these

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
look at the corners you can see these

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.890 
look at the corners you can see these
are<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.310> removable<00:01:26.939> rubber<00:01:27.270> mounts<00:01:27.720> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
are actually removable rubber mounts it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.749 
are actually removable rubber mounts it
means<00:01:28.200> those<00:01:28.409> will<00:01:28.619> absorb<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> vibrations

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
means those will absorb the vibrations

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.730 
means those will absorb the vibrations
created<00:01:30.090> by<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.390> fan<00:01:30.689> reducing<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> amount

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
created by the fan reducing the amount

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.080 
created by the fan reducing the amount
of<00:01:31.799> noise<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.189> these<00:01:32.310> fans<00:01:32.579> will<00:01:32.729> transfer

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
of noise that these fans will transfer

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.880 
of noise that these fans will transfer
to<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.329> case<00:01:33.540> installing<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:34.619> fans

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
to the case installing these fans

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.380 
to the case installing these fans
couldn't<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.340> easier<00:01:35.759> our<00:01:35.970> no<00:01:36.180> fan

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
couldn't be easier our no fan

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.910 
couldn't be easier our no fan
installations<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> hardest<00:01:37.560> thing<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.740> do

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
installations on the hardest thing to do

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
installations on the hardest thing to do
in<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> world<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:38.790> because<00:01:39.060> these<00:01:39.240> mounts

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
in the world but because these mounts

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.149 
in the world but because these mounts
actually<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.140> their<00:01:40.320> own<00:01:40.350> thread<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
actually have their own thread and you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.679 
actually have their own thread and you
don't<00:01:41.340> create<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> thread<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.150> screw<00:01:42.570> in

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
don't create the thread as you screw in

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.870 
don't create the thread as you screw in
the<00:01:42.869> screw<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.250> makes<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.790> much

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the screw it just makes it so much

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.850 
the screw it just makes it so much
easier<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.329> quicker<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.079> what<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:46.770> my

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
easier and quicker so what are my

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.039 
easier and quicker so what are my
thoughts<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> fans<00:01:47.570> aesthetically<00:01:48.600> yeah

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049

they're very good the black one spins
around<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> darkness<00:01:51.659> which<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.869> all<00:01:52.110> nice

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
around in the darkness which is all nice

around in the darkness which is all nice
the<00:01:52.740> relatively<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.369> though<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.549> would've

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the relatively one though I would've

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.700 
the relatively one though I would've
liked<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.450> little<00:01:54.479> bit<00:01:54.750> more<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.350> they<00:01:55.649> do

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
liked just a little bit more light

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.030 
liked just a little bit more light
shining<00:02:00.780> off<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.049> them<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.590> thing<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.890> would

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
shining off of them one thing I would

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.170 
shining off of them one thing I would
have<00:02:02.070> liked<00:02:02.280> though<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.579> if<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.790> fans<00:02:03.000> were<00:02:03.149> a

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
have liked though is if the fans were a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.060 
have liked though is if the fans were a
little<00:02:03.390> bit<00:02:03.630> quieter<00:02:04.200> now<00:02:04.439> they<00:02:04.590> are<00:02:04.710> designed

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
little bit quieter now they are designed

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.319 
little bit quieter now they are designed
to<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.219> quite<00:02:05.460> quiet<00:02:05.790> with<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.119> rubber

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
to be quite quiet with the rubber

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.260 
to be quite quiet with the rubber
corners<00:02:06.840> and

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
corners and

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.120

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
all of this included it was still a

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.300 
all of this included it was still a
little<00:02:10.720> bit<00:02:10.959> louder<00:02:11.260> than<00:02:11.380> my<00:02:11.650> expectation

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
little bit louder than my expectation

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.070

this<00:02:12.520> could<00:02:12.790> either<00:02:12.910> be<00:02:13.120> my<00:02:13.390> keen<00:02:13.630> ear<00:02:13.840> because

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
this could either be my keen ear because

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.140 
this could either be my keen ear because
I<00:02:14.170> do<00:02:14.230> have<00:02:14.380> my<00:02:14.770> face<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.310> my<00:02:15.340> table<00:02:15.670> next<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.090> me

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
I do have my face on my table next to me

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.910 
I do have my face on my table next to me

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
why it seems a bit louder than they
