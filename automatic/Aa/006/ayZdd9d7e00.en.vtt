00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
display UI elements and I can hide all

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.670 
display UI elements and I can hide all
the<00:01:00.449> UI<00:01:00.839> elements<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.929> a<00:01:03.929> shortcut<00:01:04.440> way<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
the UI elements and a shortcut way of

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.190 
the UI elements and a shortcut way of
doing<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.220> controlled<00:01:05.640> spacebar<00:01:06.120> and<00:01:06.360> if

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
doing that is controlled spacebar and if

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.810 
doing that is controlled spacebar and if
you<00:01:07.290> wanted<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.680> show<00:01:07.920> all<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> UI<00:01:08.370> elements

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
you wanted to show all the UI elements

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.930 
you wanted to show all the UI elements
you'll<00:01:08.940> simply<00:01:09.240> go<00:01:09.480> to<00:01:09.540> display<00:01:10.310> UI<00:01:11.310> elements

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
you'll simply go to display UI elements

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.150 
you'll simply go to display UI elements
and<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.840> would<00:01:12.990> simply<00:01:13.140> go<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.440> show<00:01:13.740> all<00:01:13.950> UI

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
and you would simply go to show all UI

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.540 
and you would simply go to show all UI
elements<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:16.380> let's<00:01:16.800> say<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.010> I<00:01:17.160> was<00:01:17.340> working

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
elements so let's say if I was working

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.160 
elements so let's say if I was working
in<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:17.970> kind<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.330> mode<00:01:18.540> which<00:01:18.780> gives<00:01:18.810> me

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
in this kind of a mode which gives me

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.920 
in this kind of a mode which gives me
more<00:01:19.680> screen<00:01:20.250> real<00:01:20.280> estate<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.910> can<00:01:21.630> simply

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
more screen real estate I can simply

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.920 
more screen real estate I can simply
hold<00:01:22.170> down<00:01:22.230> spacebar<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.640> if<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.600> want<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
hold down spacebar and if I want to

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.790 
hold down spacebar and if I want to
access<00:01:25.110> something<00:01:25.620> let's<00:01:25.830> say<00:01:25.980> from<00:01:26.540> my

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
access something let's say from my

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.260 
access something let's say from my
modify<00:01:28.800> menu<00:01:29.040> or<00:01:29.340> let's<00:01:29.580> say<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:29.820> mesh<00:01:30.060> menu

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
modify menu or let's say my mesh menu

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.150 
modify menu or let's say my mesh menu
right<00:01:30.540> here<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.020> go<00:01:31.260> here<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.650> choose

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
right here I can just go here and choose

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.820 
right here I can just go here and choose
whatever<00:01:32.550> I<00:01:32.610> want<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:35.460> hotbox<00:01:35.820> also<00:01:36.360> has<00:01:36.830> four

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
whatever I want the hotbox also has four

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.460 
whatever I want the hotbox also has four
quadrants<00:01:38.550> so<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.330> I<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.630> go<00:01:39.960> down<00:01:40.140> over<00:01:40.290> here

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
quadrants so if I just go down over here

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830 
quadrants so if I just go down over here
I<00:01:40.650> click<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.700> North<00:01:41.940> with<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.480> left<00:01:42.690> mouse

I click on the North with my left mouse
button<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:44.130> can<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.430> right<00:01:44.700> over<00:01:44.880> here<00:01:45.090> it

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
button you can see right over here it

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.400 
button you can see right over here it
allows<00:01:45.360> me<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:47.120> get<00:01:48.120> to<00:01:48.240> some<00:01:48.450> nice<00:01:48.840> layouts

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
allows me to get to some nice layouts

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.170 
allows me to get to some nice layouts
Maya<00:01:49.740> gives<00:01:50.040> me<00:01:50.190> so<00:01:50.370> hypershade<00:01:50.820> render

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
Maya gives me so hypershade render

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.780 
Maya gives me so hypershade render
perspectives<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:51.990> nice<00:01:52.260> a3<00:01:52.770> view<00:01:52.950> layout<00:01:53.280> or<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
perspectives so nice a3 view layout or a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.940 
perspectives so nice a3 view layout or a
hypershade<00:01:54.300> perspective<00:01:55.140> outline<00:01:55.530> or<00:01:55.710> layout

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
hypershade perspective outline or layout

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.920 
hypershade perspective outline or layout
and<00:01:56.190> so<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:57.500> can<00:01:58.500> go<00:01:58.650> to<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> South<00:01:59.040> quadrant

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
and so on I can go to the South quadrant

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.090 
and so on I can go to the South quadrant
and<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.140> gives<00:02:01.350> me<00:02:01.440> some<00:02:01.920> other<00:02:02.040> layouts<00:02:04.100> it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
and it gives me some other layouts it

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.100 
and it gives me some other layouts it
pretty<00:02:05.430> much<00:02:05.550> will<00:02:05.760> turn<00:02:06.060> my<00:02:06.210> view<00:02:06.450> into<00:02:06.720> like

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
pretty much will turn my view into like

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.990 
pretty much will turn my view into like
a<00:02:07.140> hyper<00:02:07.380> graph<00:02:07.680> or<00:02:07.980> a<00:02:08.009> dynamic<00:02:08.250> relationships

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
a hyper graph or a dynamic relationships

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.220 
a hyper graph or a dynamic relationships
window<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.019> can<00:02:10.800> go<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.039> my<00:02:12.230> West

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
window and so on I can go to my West

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.970 
window and so on I can go to my West
quadrant<00:02:13.500> over<00:02:13.830> here<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.670> gives<00:02:15.180> me<00:02:15.360> some

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
quadrant over here and gives me some

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.130 
quadrant over here and gives me some
selection<00:02:16.980> masks

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
selection masks

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.930 
selection masks
and<00:02:18.530> also<00:02:18.770> on<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.130> right<00:02:19.280> side<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.670> gives<00:02:19.820> me

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
and also on the right side it gives me

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.670 
and also on the right side it gives me
some<00:02:20.120> other<00:02:20.210> options<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:23.200> this<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.380> really

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
some other options so this is really

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.950 
some other options so this is really
cool<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.070> for<00:02:25.250> example<00:02:25.610> if<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:25.790> wanted<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.120> just

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
cool so for example if I wanted to just

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.370 
cool so for example if I wanted to just
convert<00:02:27.290> one<00:02:27.620> view<00:02:28.010> into<00:02:28.960> let's<00:02:29.960> say<00:02:30.170> an

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
convert one view into let's say an

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.810 
convert one view into let's say an
outliner<00:02:30.740> I<00:02:31.010> can<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:31.340> go<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.640> South

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
outliner I can just go to the South

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.340 
outliner I can just go to the South
quadrant<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.390> say<00:02:32.570> you're<00:02:32.960> gonna<00:02:33.110> be<00:02:33.260> the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
quadrant and say you're gonna be the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.260 
quadrant and say you're gonna be the
outliner<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.890> give<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.850> a<00:02:34.910> second<00:02:35.240> and

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
outliner and give it a second and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.700 
outliner and give it a second and
there's<00:02:35.480> my<00:02:35.630> outliner<00:02:35.960> now<00:02:36.170> if<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.350> wanted<00:02:36.590> to

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
there's my outliner now if I wanted to

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.830 
there's my outliner now if I wanted to
get<00:02:36.830> back<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.250> perspective<00:02:37.490> view<00:02:37.820> an<00:02:38.090> easy

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
get back to the perspective view an easy

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.450 
get back to the perspective view an easy
way<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.140> do<00:02:39.320> that<00:02:39.470> from<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.710> hot<00:02:39.890> box<00:02:40.100> itself

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
way to do that from the hot box itself

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.700 
way to do that from the hot box itself
is<00:02:40.730> hold<00:02:41.390> down<00:02:41.570> your<00:02:41.600> spacebar<00:02:41.990> go<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.560> the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
is hold down your spacebar go to the

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.470 
is hold down your spacebar go to the
word<00:02:42.830> Maya<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:43.430> go<00:02:44.240> to<00:02:44.300> perspective<00:02:46.000> also<00:02:47.000> if

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
word Maya and go to perspective also if

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.020 
word Maya and go to perspective also if
you<00:02:47.600> wanted<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.140> just<00:02:48.830> unhide<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.340> few<00:02:49.700> elements

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
you wanted to just unhide a few elements

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.750 
you wanted to just unhide a few elements
I<00:02:50.300> can<00:02:50.870> hold<00:02:51.110> down<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.580> hotbox

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
I can hold down the hotbox

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.870 
I can hold down the hotbox
and<00:02:53.650> go<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:54.830> marking<00:02:55.130> menu<00:02:55.400> on<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.730> right

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
and go to the marking menu on the right

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.050 
and go to the marking menu on the right
side<00:02:56.120> over<00:02:56.239> here<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.660> then<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.440> can<00:02:57.650> go<00:02:57.800> to

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
side over here and then I can go to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.190 
side over here and then I can go to
let's<00:02:59.060> say<00:02:59.209> if<00:02:59.300> I<00:02:59.390> just<00:02:59.540> want<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.780> display<00:03:00.080> the

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
let's say if I just want to display the

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.990 
let's say if I just want to display the
tool<00:03:00.380> box<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.800> you<00:03:01.220> can<00:03:01.340> see<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.610> tool<00:03:01.760> box

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
tool box and you can see the tool box

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.699 
tool box and you can see the tool box
shows<00:03:02.180> up<00:03:02.360> here<00:03:02.540> or<00:03:02.660> if<00:03:03.050> I<00:03:03.110> just<00:03:03.140> wanted<00:03:03.590> to
