00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.250
 hello good afternoon teammates today we are going 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.070
 to do a little double jump 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.699
 tie in a limbo to the ground 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.610
 I have put a little angel rather full 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:26.640
 and the line that I'm going to green 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.470
 phosphorescent with the idea that it looks 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.470
 better at the time of making the knot 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:38.500
 well, we do the following 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.810
 second the little one do a coca 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.110
 and in the same sense then we put the 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.470
 fish hook 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.870
 we give you a margin 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.270
 about 10 centimeters in front of the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:55.160
 head 110 centimeters from the hook 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.940
 and now that we hold we take the other 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.360
 end of the nylon that we have cut 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.520
 and we put it on top of this 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.129
 and give a little more sea the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.010
 more length than a little more 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.580
 long for the time to squeeze have a 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.580
 reference 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.350
 well once we have the preparations 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.350
 Well, we started doing it on paper 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.119
 7 orchard to the age 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.119
 we take the longest 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.120
 well and we have it 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.700
 this is we will say the first tie now 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.159
 let's do the second one that is the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.740
 first purchase we made 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.200
 first before making the draw we have 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.650
 to look which of the two 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.950
 of the donuts is not what we have here 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.690
 which one is fixed and which one is 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.620
 moves inside the tie 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.000
 to move 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.000
 this is the fixed 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.360
 while he was traveling, we take the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.360
 fixed 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.180
 we come here 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.180
 and we started spinning 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.520
 one turn 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.200
 in two laps 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.480
 three laps 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.670
 it's four laps 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.670
 well hold 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.580
 and we throw 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.340
 we already have the two ties in the same 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.280
 to the ground that is what I intended 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.230
 do so that you see it record us 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.780
 help we help with the nail a little 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.060
 then often call a little bit 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.910
 The Pin 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:32.310
 and now we throw strong 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.310
 both at the ends and the other 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.990
 Well, we already have here 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.319
 Double empathy two both have to go 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.629
 in the xerez 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:49.079
 and position has advantage against encounter 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.700
 for safety, not for safety, it's very 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.590
 difficult that behind the eyes is very 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.280
 difficult in itself one is difficult but 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.870
 let's go side even worse 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.500
 then once we have this 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.640
 we choose 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.640
 the second floor 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.760
 it's just a few seconds just with the 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.040
 idea of whether we fish with a whole boat 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.540
 or crab 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.759
 choco like end any type of meat 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.790
 it is always protected or the worm 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:23.960
 is more protected well 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.820
 well 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.690
 we do here 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.690
 A coke 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:32.699
 good is a little longer 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.680
 and we started passing knots 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.960
 3 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.520
 414 turn made has more than 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.520
 over we remove it 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.790
 we have strong 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.690
 but 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.690
 and we have 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.900
 we already have other preparations for example 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.160
 to fish with whole boats not 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.919
 we know the knives 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.130
 that the long the guita then with this 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.380
 idea and put it put it twice is not 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.980
 is nothing more than less so that when 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.290
 We put the dead on the edge of the dead 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:31.800
 as you usually fish too thin for 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.900
 gilded then and then put in double with 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.760
 what an idea because in flight it can cut you 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.910
 also that the friction can be cut 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.729
 nylon and then it can look like that a lot 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.550
 stronger and safer now above 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:49.669
 in fact from renting let's start a 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.669
 small knot a simple but double knot 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.490
 simple but double 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.860
 and now 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.370
 and so we can cut the rest of one of 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.370
 erect 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.169
 and then we have 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.889
 has been tied here we have more than 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:18.650
 a line a nylon here we have it double 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:21.830
 in the east sense 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:26.320
 and with its double double knot in the first 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.320
 that we started is super safe 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.190
 for those who fish for example 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:36.110
 with the worm, there is no need to 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:38.610
 put the second to the ground then 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.040
 let's get the worm we move 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.730
 up and this knot we have 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.400
 here the one that will prevent the worm 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:49.800
 get out until the fuck from here 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:53.099
 even those that hook themselves 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.680
 Well, this little jump I hope 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:59.879
 Let's go I 've tried it and it goes pretty 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.550
 well and I hope you do and 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:04.979
 take advantage of it because nothing has this 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:09.740
 been everything to another thank you very much for 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:09.740
 the attention you pay to the rich 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:16.889
 we have other people in mind, we're going to 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.889
 see good afternoon, thank you friends
