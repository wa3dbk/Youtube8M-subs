00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.500
 Hello dear friends 100 not super 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.620
 ready and this leads arrows 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:18.060
 about how to shoot a gang 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.090
 without lags many are interested in the question here 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.439
 i downloaded bandicam i'm trying to shoot here 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.920
 split and reviews 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:31.020
 but I have a terrible lag oh how 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.960
 joke here are my very first videos when i 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.300
 released here there were lags but now I 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.180
 I release a video without lags and I want 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.670
 tell me how I achieved this 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:47.339
 achievements so let's say here and so bandicam 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.859
 I need version 194 here I personally 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:55.289
 I use this version it suits me 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:59.879
 Fully hereafter what we go to go where a 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.730
 then go to the video tab of the video here you 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.800
 bandicam here you masonry video here you 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.500
 tune everything you want over here 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.110
 keys and no cursor mouse knot effect 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.860
 This you call as want effects under 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.220
 removal of failures and so with him off you 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.220
 need here here settings go to 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.990
 construction site 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.820
 I also want to note what you need 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.290
 Be sure to set the total parameters 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.520
 sound track with this 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.860
 device the main device you 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.960
 You choose which you need I got it 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.479
 microphone actuator where 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.820
 you will take the sound is windows 7 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.890
 I personally have sound vich here and this 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.649
 here is a tick necessarily further effects 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.450
 but the effects you choose it all by yourself 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:59.509
 do not need an option 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:03.409
 that's what i want priority for window 9x 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.330
 j experience here this parameter 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.959
 just makes you lag 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.209
 This parameter is a must 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.160
 include skip recording moments when 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.840
 the frame is not updated this parameter 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:22.280
 Be sure to check the records below . 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.170
 above average it is stable we go further 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.780
 this is the format of the format 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.959
 to make your video quality 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:36.310
 and so I always take off in 1904 resolution 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.859
 280 to 720 and it is this wait 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.720
 FPS I always 30 it is stable if 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.530
 put a little more a little less the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.620
 butt plugs 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.940
 FTC I always rented a motion in the same run 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.570
 principle, you can take any other 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.470
 codec 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.920
 but this example quality will be bmp-1 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.790
 quality will be worse in x form quality 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.370
 It will be good but there for example the frequency 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.170
 frames will not match with 30 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.330
 that's it for h 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.620
 264 basically normal kodak but all 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.650
 anyway maybe there this frame 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.930
 especially if you inviz Yakub somewhere 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.970
 he will use processors 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.480
 possible because of it just moisture and 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.820
 they will go so choose motion jpeg 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.660
 choose the quality you want 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:32.410
 I put on 90 if you have a computer there 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.750
 old there to me is not very powerful then 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.840
 can put for example 70 principle 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.600
 the quality of this does not deteriorate I say 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.570
 that is, if you even put 40 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:50.290
 quality will be mal mal be noticeable that 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:53.080
 quality dropped video quality dropped sound 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.180
 sound you choose everything as you need from me 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:02.350
 This is a stereo and the frequency is 48 thousand hertz 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:06.760
 cdk mpeg 1 or 2 and my bitrate is 192 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:10.390
 kilobits per second like that 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.340
 parameters and after installing such takeshi 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.390
 parameters and the same version of the program 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.310
 maybe you will be lost vogue but it 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.940
 may not be associated with the settings 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.680
 eg 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.650
 with antivirus try to disable 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.140
 antivirus running programs 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.510
 try to do something else 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:34.070
 try to buy a license at all 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:38.420
 It may also help by the way if 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:44.120
 someone needs a bow I have this repack 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:51.470
 me this is a repack with rutraker its author 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:56.680
 bunny rabbit is kind of like linking to 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:05:00.440
 downloading this repack i will give in the description 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.510
 there is also a pickup of settings here 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.170
 that you just need to pick up the settings 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.590

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.510

 Well, I told you how to shoot without 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:23.330
