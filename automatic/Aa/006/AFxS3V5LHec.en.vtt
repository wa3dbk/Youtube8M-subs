00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.600
 of the total value 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.060
 the controversy that there is another law 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.949
 that takes this value to 100 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.869

 the last purchase was 540 reais 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.239
 he awaits the arrival of the products through 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.980
 post office and prepares to pay 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.879
 and taxed 60% of the value of the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.770
 product 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.110
 according to federal income whatsoever 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.059
 imported object over 100 dollars 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.340
 he is finding 60% of the value of 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.039
 product recently the athlete made a

 tribute on the value they are going to buy 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.400
 $ 252 supplement also in this 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.159
 site 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.650
 I bought it and it was taxed at 168 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.260
 to be able to take the product only 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.360
 get the product by paying at the post office 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.210
 according to the delegate of the federal revenue 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.240
 taxation is made on the basis of the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.280
 156 of 1999 which provides that the exemption 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.070
 taxes is when buying 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.590
 was up to 50 dollars and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.310
 sender and recipient are people 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.110
 physical 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.189
 this revenue value does not know this value 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.189
 $ 100 what we have 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.229
 legislation is not enough for us to 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.610
 exemption of up to $ 50, which 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.560
 happened was that some taxpayer 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.380
 entered the justice claiming this 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.869
 right and it seems to me that justice 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.579
 granted this amount more on case 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.439
 it's practical it 's for that particular 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.840
 taxpayer and the revenue 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.250
 rise of $ 50 based on 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.939
 existing legislation is in force 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.100
 currently 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.110
 but the limit for the taxation practiced 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.290
 federal income has been the reason for 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.299
 actions for repayment of amounts paid 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.979
 explains this lawyer the basis for the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.849
 consumer to request a return is the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.520
 decree-law 1804 of 1980 which establishes 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.650
 exemption from taxes when the value of 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.950
 purchase of imported product was up to 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.099
 10 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.730
 in dollars there were in fact no 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:24.629
 change in networks in legislation that 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:29.220
 about decree-law 1804 which 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:32.280
 determines that the goods which are 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.260
 They are posted in the mail acquired in 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.239
 worth up to 100 dollars 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.239
 they are exempt from the 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.930
 that the revenue 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.810
 federal she by unilateral act 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.680
 she placed a concierge who is 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.599
 just this 1 56 99 that 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.660
 determined that the value of these 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.799
 goods would be $ 50 and 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.840
 also changed the question of the sender 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.840
 must be natural person 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.530
 when in fact the legislation does not 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.510
 talked about the recipient and 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.730
 recipient and sender is a person 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.620
 physical or legal entity for the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.329
 consumers and that the taxes paid on 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.640
 the imported product of up to 100 dollars 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.480
 does not need the intermediation of a 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.530
 lawyer as value is small 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.230
 automatically the value of the action will be 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.930
 and a special federal court 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.920
 you can file without a lawyer on account 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.230
 of the value of the stock then the procedure 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.980
 you go along with the revenue 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.319
 federal makes the request directed 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.209
