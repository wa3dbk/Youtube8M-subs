 Aldi offered you say with interesting 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:32.969
 more interesting things from edeka there must 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.790
 you have to wait a bit to wait 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.579
 but they are so loud on it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.440
 or so deliciously shaded from courses to 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.600
 the first time bought us just always just 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.739
 somehow in the hotel or something 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.350
 betty kay optics of metlife this too 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.280
 organic eggs of which they are also very 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.910
 delicious set on the side is that then 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.300
 I have not bought a protein like that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.350
 Giant fan of it good but right now 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.030
 I'm watching my mission 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.130
 come and now if it is completely in the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.490
 step fashion concern me too much mega 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.159
 carbohydrates in the evening just stops 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.780
 if you do not care about that 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.420
 in any case, the per slice has 10 grams 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.729
 protein and 6 degrees 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.229
 that is without so yes I have extra on it 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.150
 pay attention that is without soya because I am 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.640
 I do not want to eat conventional soy 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.380
 that's why it's just made of wheat protein 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.439
 Of course, that's not great either 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.140
 Duper great as a quasi gluten bread so 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.180
 is one he might be all there 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.280
 few days what of this I have to 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.170
 not every day have it now 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.110
 For a long time I saw that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.090
 times that something you do not even bread 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.290
 normal to food once beans then times 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.700
 linden soy schnitzel no idea so 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.570
 I always change my protein source like that 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.310
 not a bit German by always 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:02.380
 the same is exactly the same with me 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.670
 then I'm not vegan though 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.840
 that is with out free range as white 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.519
 I'm not 3 percent 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.929
 in there, or so I've still my 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:17.620
 friend taken 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:23.110

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.640
 Lutow protein that was supposed to be from the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.580
 kills are won 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.080
 yes, I brought my friend because 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.640
 which does not always work so well 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.349
 and gluten anyway he can indeed times 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.090
 test as it is still for him 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.400
 better than it has to buy you with 3 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.340
 percent inside , I can do it on every one 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.890
 case more represented 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:49.599

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.859
 Organic coconut oil muesli on gluten free stuff like that 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.140
 I have never seen that there 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.739
 really nice I do that 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.340
 maybe you can see that 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:03.639
 not at edeka in the biotech and 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.450

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.489
 could be a bit at the moment too 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.470
 eat over it really very much 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.069
 nice if the ingredients are interesting 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.690

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.669

 I still have a battered classic 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.799
 tomato sauce 179 is cheap 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.269

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.110
 my dm or especially nature or 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:07.660
 The 195 are the same size 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.200
 not bad there you come again 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.200

 Israel and the cameras are coming out 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.610
 holland and I do not think so 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.010

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.960
 buy tomatoes because the bio are there 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.790

 low-fat of the potato a melon 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.670

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:51.380
