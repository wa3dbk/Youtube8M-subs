you'll have this little area it seems
more<00:00:25.680> like<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.890> more<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.550> lighthouse

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
know maybe he should be planning how to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.889 
know maybe he should be planning how to
stop<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.579> police<00:00:42.090> officers<00:00:42.270> who<00:00:42.750> were

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
know so he's a little different than

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.209

mean the only difference I could see was
pretty<00:00:56.039> much<00:00:56.219> levels<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.469> possibly<00:00:58.469> sinnoh

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
pretty much levels and possibly sinnoh

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.660 
pretty much levels and possibly sinnoh
moves<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.750> legend<00:01:00.770> finally<00:01:01.770> finally<00:01:02.129> he

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670

ridiculously<00:01:32.159> easy<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.579> mean<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.240> shouldn't

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
ridiculously easy I mean you shouldn't

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.420 
ridiculously easy I mean you shouldn't
be<00:01:33.570> any<00:01:33.689> problem<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.560> know<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.340> rid

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
be any problem so you know just get rid

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.910 
be any problem so you know just get rid
of<00:01:35.520> him<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.000> then<00:01:36.659> coughing<00:01:37.170> over<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.590> since

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
of him and then coughing over here since

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.310 
of him and then coughing over here since
coughing's<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.700> huge<00:01:39.240> defensive<00:01:39.570> beast<00:01:40.049> i

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
coughing's a huge defensive beast i

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.870 
coughing's a huge defensive beast i
would<00:01:40.530> use<00:01:41.899> special<00:01:42.899> special<00:01:43.829> moves<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.490> i'm

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
would use special special moves and i'm

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.490 
would use special special moves and i'm
thinking<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.270> making<00:01:45.420> legend<00:01:45.990> more<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
thinking of making legend more of a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.410 
thinking of making legend more of a
mixed<00:01:46.890> attacker<00:01:47.250> instead<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:47.970> physical

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
mixed attacker instead of just physical

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.210 
mixed attacker instead of just physical
attacks<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.290> mean<00:01:49.470> he<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.040> learn<00:01:50.189> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
attacks because I mean he can learn a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.219 
attacks because I mean he can learn a
wide<00:01:50.579> variety<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:51.149> moves<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.750> think<00:01:51.960> surf

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
wide variety of moves and I think surf

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.980 
wide variety of moves and I think surf
would<00:01:52.470> definitely<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.340> useful<00:01:54.090> move<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.780> him

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
would definitely be a useful move on him

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.440 
would definitely be a useful move on him
so<00:01:55.350> yeah<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.430> mean<00:01:56.460> his<00:01:56.729> attack<00:01:57.210> and

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
so yeah and I mean his attack and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.630 
so yeah and I mean his attack and
special<00:01:57.780> attack<00:01:57.990> aren't<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.549> aren't<00:01:59.549> that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
special attack aren't that aren't that

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.280 
special attack aren't that aren't that
much<00:01:59.790> far<00:02:00.060> apart<00:02:00.360> i<00:02:00.450> mean<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.719> his<00:02:00.840> attack<00:02:01.140> is

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
much far apart i mean like his attack is

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.789 
much far apart i mean like his attack is
probably<00:02:01.530> 70<00:02:02.210> at<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.450> moment<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.020> his

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
probably 70 at this moment and his

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.459 
probably 70 at this moment and his
special<00:02:05.310> attack<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.670> probably<00:02:06.030> 60<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:07.290> yeah

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
special attack is probably 60 so yeah

himself<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:37.280> Apollo<00:02:38.510> goes<00:02:39.510> down<00:02:39.810> way<00:02:40.230> easier

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
himself and Apollo goes down way easier

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.830 
himself and Apollo goes down way easier
than<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.340> thought<00:02:41.370> he<00:02:41.820> would<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.690> know<00:02:42.810> I

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
than I thought he would you know I

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.690 
than I thought he would you know I
thought<00:02:43.020> he<00:02:43.200> would<00:02:43.320> get<00:02:43.530> put<00:02:43.830> up<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.980> fight<00:02:44.280> I

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
thought he would get put up a fight I

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.580 
thought he would get put up a fight I
mean<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.270> think<00:02:45.570> Athena<00:02:45.990> did<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.290> little<00:02:46.470> bit

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
mean I think Athena did a little bit

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.610 
mean I think Athena did a little bit
better<00:02:46.680> job<00:02:47.010> than<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:48.450> after<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.470> beat

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
better job than that so after you beat

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.100 
better job than that so after you beat
Apollo<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.700> whole<00:02:50.880> rocket<00:02:51.390> thing<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.930> say

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
Apollo the whole rocket thing is say

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.380 
Apollo the whole rocket thing is say
there's<00:02:52.410> nothing<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.770> worry<00:02:52.980> about<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.550> this

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
there's nothing to worry about and this

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.050 
there's nothing to worry about and this
guy<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.690> think<00:02:55.020> depending<00:02:55.170> on<00:02:55.890> your<00:02:56.070> game<00:02:56.340> he'll

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
guy I think depending on your game he'll

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.190 
guy I think depending on your game he'll
give<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.330> either<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:58.080> UH<00:02:59.630> silver<00:03:00.630> wing<00:03:00.810> or

give you either the UH silver wing or
the<00:03:01.530> rainbow<00:03:02.070> wing<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.640> think<00:03:02.790> that's<00:03:02.910> what

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
the rainbow wing I think that's what

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.010

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
not in gold and silver he steps back and

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.220 
not in gold and silver he steps back and

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
and next time I believe we'll be going

and next time I believe we'll be going
up<00:03:36.480> we'll<00:03:36.750> be<00:03:36.870> catching<00:03:37.350> hoo<00:03:37.950> which<00:03:38.520> is

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
up we'll be catching hoo which is

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
up we'll be catching hoo which is
probably<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.330> it's<00:03:40.080> gonna<00:03:40.170> be<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.380> bitch<00:03:40.680> cuz<00:03:41.190> I

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
probably a it's gonna be a bitch cuz I

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.440 
probably a it's gonna be a bitch cuz I
mean<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:43.140> know<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.770> caught<00:03:44.280> suicune<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.060> crystal

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
mean I know I caught suicune and crystal

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.710 
mean I know I caught suicune and crystal
were<00:03:45.480> deke<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:46.050> was<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.620> took<00:03:46.830> two<00:03:47.100> pokéballs

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
were deke it was it took two pokéballs

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.290 
were deke it was it took two pokéballs
but<00:03:48.720> i'm<00:03:48.990> guessing<00:03:49.500> hoo<00:03:50.000> it's<00:03:51.000> gonna<00:03:51.150> be<00:03:51.270> a

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
but i'm guessing hoo it's gonna be a

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.510 
but i'm guessing hoo it's gonna be a
little<00:03:51.780> more<00:03:52.290> difficult<00:03:53.010> than<00:03:53.370> that

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
little more difficult than that

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.510 
little more difficult than that
considering<00:03:54.209> it<00:03:54.990> has<00:03:55.200> sacred<00:03:55.890> fire<00:03:56.130> which

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
considering it has sacred fire which

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.490 
considering it has sacred fire which
will<00:03:56.700> probably<00:03:57.209> burn<00:03:57.600> every<00:03:58.140> single<00:03:58.380> one<00:03:58.470> of

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
will probably burn every single one of

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.120 
will probably burn every single one of
my<00:03:58.590> pokemon<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.400> all<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.850> jazz<00:04:00.320> so<00:04:01.320> yeah<00:04:01.530> if

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
my pokemon and all that jazz so yeah if

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.560 
my pokemon and all that jazz so yeah if
you<00:04:02.250> need<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.520> check<00:04:02.820> my<00:04:02.850> check<00:04:03.360> in<00:04:03.480> either
