 we prepare the handlebar by lifting the rubber of the gearbox control 

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:19.106
 we remove the protection of the adhesive a little at a time 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:29.980
 let's start with the adhesive part of the tape facing us, we begin to apply it to the end of the handlebar 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.020
 stretch the ribbon without exaggerating, overlapping about half of the previous loop 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:59.460
 see in the video the tour to make of the tape on the gearbox control 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.000
 always keep the tape with the same tension on the whole handlebar application

 reach the desired point and tape with an electrician's tape (recommended) 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.600
 insert the closure cap also including the tape 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.220
