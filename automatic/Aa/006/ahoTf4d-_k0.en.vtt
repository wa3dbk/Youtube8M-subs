00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
picture quality now the reason this TV

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.610 
picture quality now the reason this TV
is<00:00:42.719> 5k<00:00:43.469> instead<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.070> 4k<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.450> its

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
is 5k instead of 4k is because of its

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.040 
is 5k instead of 4k is because of its
gigantic<00:00:46.620> size<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:48.059> more<00:00:48.480> space<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
gigantic size it's more space on the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.569 
gigantic size it's more space on the
screen<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.649> allow<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:50.100> higher<00:00:50.340> resolution

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
screen to allow for higher resolution

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.760 
screen to allow for higher resolution
video<00:00:51.500> also<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.770> aspect<00:00:53.640> ratio<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.329> 21<00:00:54.989> by<00:00:55.170> 9

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
video also is aspect ratio is 21 by 9

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.000 
video also is aspect ratio is 21 by 9
instead<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.820> standard<00:00:57.329> 16<00:00:58.170> by<00:00:58.320> 9<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
instead of a standard 16 by 9 the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.619 
instead of a standard 16 by 9 the
downside<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.850> arrangement<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.600> that

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
downside of this arrangement is that

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.540 
downside of this arrangement is that
there's<00:01:01.020> actually<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.680> going<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.100> that

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
there's actually not going to be that

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.910 
there's actually not going to be that
much<00:01:02.789> material<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.840> able<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> watch<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
much material to be able to watch in the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.750 
much material to be able to watch in the
21<00:01:05.430> by<00:01:05.670> 9<00:01:05.909> aspect<00:01:06.180> ratio<00:01:06.650> now<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> big<00:01:08.040> TV<00:01:08.490> like

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
21 by 9 aspect ratio now a big TV like

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.179 
21 by 9 aspect ratio now a big TV like
this<00:01:09.000> deserves<00:01:09.390> some<00:01:09.720> big<00:01:10.080> sound<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.740> back<00:01:11.010> it

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189
