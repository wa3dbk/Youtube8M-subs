00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.640
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.740
 Good, I'll show you how to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.750
 people can make a storage 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.329
 as the artificial ones and also the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.490
 Your legs to think and perform okay is 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.560
 very simple very easy to do 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.570
 video will be very fast and here it will be 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.400
 quite efficient then how 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.140
 You'll make us use it. 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.200
 as a basis to make a support for the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.720
 bait and also those in the plenary 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.899
 Styrofoam tablets that usually come 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.870
 on the bottom of some pizza packaging 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.609
 meat also another place where he counts his 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.899
 life around here then we will use 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.420
 How will I do it? 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.760
 They will pick up yellow mushrooms that made 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.190
 very pretty or very white or not 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.620
 also betrayed your preference and will never 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.570
 returned with three official channels and also 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.890
 some loss in the whip here to give the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.629
 example for you 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.350
 Okay, that's all I'm working on. 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.750
 here there are only basically the same size 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.080
 the sert that basis Styrofoam here 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.760
 penada is bigger than the base but who goes 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.570
 Doing this will take a few turns here. 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.880
 A couple of laps I learn will stay 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.040
 All right here, my sport is 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.440
 and it's precisely because of the 13 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.570
 if you want to carry 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.810
 one more 567 stripes 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.940
 just leave here the advantage of alcorcÃ³n 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.310
 longer reminding that it is 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.900
 difficult to find trays of this size that 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.410
 large then usually do not behave 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.790
 between 3 to 6 right and 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.590
 for one of the pedal- 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.250
 much smaller than the official schools 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.160
 to approach here between 10 to 15 legs 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.070
 Okay, so let's see now the mech is in the 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:59.760
 practice in the use of this 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:01.260
 thanks our support looks cool 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.810
 you can carry in your house from 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.050
 Stone and practical ideas do not 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.810
 if you go roll up, you'll go to the band if you go 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.209
 use a smaller scale you will have 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.780
 to leave the Styrofoam belly here more 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.580
 slim 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.120
 if you use a larger scale than 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.129
 Camera distance 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.049
 It's bigger you'll have to leave the 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.400
 races or anything else to get to 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.340
 stay in the company and have no 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.860
 between them in this effective way of 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.470
 company and will not risk falling 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.629
 Okay to learn things here in the bay. 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.269
 It's quite simple just take two 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.549
 from the surface to the surface of the 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.220
 undertake here in our box links the 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.620
 body and it will be very cute 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.340
 ready to play with your fishery 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.890
 certain people 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.569
 Good thing you turn up December officials with well 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.420
 stuck here in our postage 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.940
 now let's see how it gets with the use of 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.920
 pedals for fishing whips 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.319
 basically the same principle was however 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.569
 with a penada do not have is the sum of the two 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.640
 therefore will do again fell swoop 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.760
 she has one at the end we will learn 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:09.790
 the whip will do even made a small 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.290
 tear here Styrofoam to spend oo and noc 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.440
 He gets arrested then we'll give him 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.540
 some laps with just the close screen 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.609
 completely that support is the people 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.290
 see the employment here at the tip but 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.250
 yes, let's see in practice how it is 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.510
 what is this 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.730
 then what we will do us 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.760
 go get the styrofoam or pick up 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.150
 a knife or take a penknife on the stiletto 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:37.030
 I'll make a small rip here in the 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:40.569
 Sure, it's soup base here. 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.150
 about half a centimeter to 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.590
 inside Styrofoam I do not know, I could only 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.690
 see detail here 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.599
 but the scratch is already done 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.669
 to be doing will get the part 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:56.530
 that has a certain knot and will pass here 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:04:02.370
 you become stuck this way 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:08.980
 You're going to walk here. 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:10.840
 this way is in the same lap as the 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.699
 loss was great again here 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:20.889
 through the little hole it passes again and there 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:22.900
 people come back and spit right here in the 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.490
 from above 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.500
 here you can see that the leg is a 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.570
 little big and police lines with a 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.979
 little loose then if you will use 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.470
 support to save 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.720
 I recommend you to do the 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.820
 standard stride size and after 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.410
 have set a standard in size 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.070
 of the two penalties you 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:45.160
 cut the little Styrofoam here 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.220
 already accurate so as not to take this slack here 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.139
 and to be well renders well right ready 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.310
 to take your fishing that will not 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.220
 take up too much space 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.039
 so here and also the blues will come 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.919
 and will bring more convenience in the 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.600
 your fishing right then were those 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.310
 there the two dead because I wanted 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.520
 show you how to do the support 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.940
 to save as much as your legs 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.169
 also their right lures 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.760
