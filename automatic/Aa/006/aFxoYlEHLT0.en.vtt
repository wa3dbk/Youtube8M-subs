00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
to do is just be subscribed to this

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.310 
to do is just be subscribed to this
channel<00:01:29.340> there<00:01:30.329> are<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.750> optional

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
channel there are going to be optional

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.719 
channel there are going to be optional
things<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.040> don't<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.549> those

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
things but you don't have to do those

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.420 
things but you don't have to do those
for<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:33.900> example<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.890> follow<00:01:35.220> me<00:01:35.369> on

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
for so for example if you follow me on

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.550 
for so for example if you follow me on
Twitter<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.939> will<00:01:36.240> give<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.600> another<00:01:37.140> entry

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
Twitter that will give you another entry

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.810 
Twitter that will give you another entry
but<00:01:37.829> that's<00:01:37.950> definitely<00:01:38.100> not<00:01:38.400> something<00:01:38.610> that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
but that's definitely not something that

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.490 
but that's definitely not something that
you<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.450> obviously<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.110> hope<00:01:40.439> that

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
you have to do obviously so I hope that
