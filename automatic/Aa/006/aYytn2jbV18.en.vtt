hey<00:00:00.900> I'm<00:00:01.170> back<00:00:01.350> with<00:00:01.589> another<00:00:01.620> amp<00:00:02.129> test

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:02.600 
hey I'm back with another amp test

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.740 
hey I'm back with another amp test
alright

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
alright

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.570 
alright
this<00:00:04.170> time<00:00:04.440> we<00:00:04.650> have<00:00:04.830> this<00:00:05.250> old<00:00:05.549> beat-up

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
this time we have this old beat-up

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.600 
this time we have this old beat-up
crunch<00:00:08.900> ground-pounder<00:00:10.969> it's<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.259> gpv<00:00:13.610> 2100

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
crunch ground-pounder it's a gpv 2100

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.290 
crunch ground-pounder it's a gpv 2100
point<00:00:15.920> 120<00:00:16.920> 100<00:00:17.580> watts<00:00:19.730> guy<00:00:20.730> came<00:00:21.000> into<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
point 120 100 watts guy came into the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.630 
point 120 100 watts guy came into the
shop<00:00:21.539> with<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.930> wanted<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.470> get<00:00:22.890> some<00:00:23.070> subs<00:00:23.400> I

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
shop with this wanted to get some subs I

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.019 
shop with this wanted to get some subs I
asked<00:00:23.910> him<00:00:24.029> if<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.180> could<00:00:24.210> test<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:25.730> he<00:00:26.730> thinks

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
asked him if I could test it he thinks

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.830 
asked him if I could test it he thinks
it<00:00:27.180> actually<00:00:27.630> puts<00:00:28.349> out<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> 2100<00:00:29.539> we'll<00:00:30.539> see

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it actually puts out the 2100 we'll see

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.160 
it actually puts out the 2100 we'll see
and<00:00:32.270> so<00:00:33.270> I'm<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.570> throw<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.050> my

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and so I'm going to throw this on my

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.690 
and so I'm going to throw this on my
dyno<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.559> see<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.130> really<00:00:35.280> does<00:00:35.520> I

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
dyno and see what it really does I

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.420 
dyno and see what it really does I
looked<00:00:35.910> online<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:37.170> found<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.770> ratings<00:00:38.219> it

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
looked online and I found the ratings it

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.260 
looked online and I found the ratings it
says<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> does<00:00:39.050> 1,050<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.410> ohm<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.940> doesn't

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
says it does 1,050 at one ohm it doesn't

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.900 
says it does 1,050 at one ohm it doesn't
give<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.870> distortion<00:00:43.530> level<00:00:44.070> or<00:00:44.190> anything<00:00:44.430> or

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
give a distortion level or anything or

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.670 
give a distortion level or anything or
voltage<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.870> was<00:00:46.020> at<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.379> probably

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
voltage that that was at it's probably

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.310 
voltage that that was at it's probably
at<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:47.129> 18<00:00:47.550> volts<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.480> I'm<00:00:48.570> crazy<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.110> that

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
at like 18 volts so I'm crazy like that

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.950 
at like 18 volts so I'm crazy like that
but<00:00:50.309> hey<00:00:50.640> maybe<00:00:50.850> not<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.690> set<00:00:51.930> up

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
but hey maybe not got this all set up

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.889 
but hey maybe not got this all set up
for<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.590> ohm<00:00:52.739> certified<00:00:53.600> let<00:00:54.600> me<00:00:54.660> go<00:00:54.809> ahead

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
for one ohm certified let me go ahead

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.689 
for one ohm certified let me go ahead
and<00:00:55.020> unpause<00:00:55.379> my<00:00:55.590> track<00:00:58.129> not<00:00:59.129> expecting<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
and unpause my track not expecting a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.389 
and unpause my track not expecting a
whole<00:00:59.730> lot<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.469> percent<00:01:01.770> distortion

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
whole lot up to one percent distortion

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:19.429 
whole lot up to one percent distortion
but<00:01:02.640> we'll<00:01:02.940> see

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.700 

383<00:01:20.439> watts<00:01:21.329> we<00:01:22.329> are<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.509> long<00:01:22.840> ways<00:01:23.140> off<00:01:23.350> from

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
383 watts we are a long ways off from

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.870 
383 watts we are a long ways off from
1050<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:26.439> was<00:01:26.619> at<00:01:27.180> 13.04<00:01:28.180> volts<00:01:29.759> all<00:01:30.759> right

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
1050 that was at 13.04 volts all right

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.460 
1050 that was at 13.04 volts all right
let<00:01:31.030> me<00:01:31.060> go<00:01:31.180> ahead<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.390> retune<00:01:31.810> this<00:01:32.049> and<00:01:32.289> we

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
let me go ahead and retune this and we

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.060 
let me go ahead and retune this and we
will<00:01:32.590> do<00:01:32.799> a<00:01:33.479> uncertified<00:01:34.479> run<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.079> then<00:01:35.710> some

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
will do a uncertified run and then some

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.830 
will do a uncertified run and then some
dynamic<00:01:36.640> charge<00:01:37.000> back<00:01:37.299> up<00:01:37.570> I'm<00:01:38.399> at<00:01:39.399> 1<00:01:39.939> ohm<00:01:40.119> we

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
dynamic charge back up I'm at 1 ohm we

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.240 
dynamic charge back up I'm at 1 ohm we
just<00:01:41.470> reset<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.039> voltage<00:01:42.490> on<00:01:42.640> my<00:01:42.960> dummy<00:01:43.960> load

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.740 

there<00:01:48.850> we<00:01:48.970> go<00:01:49.980> all<00:01:50.980> right<00:01:51.040> here<00:01:51.670> goes

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
there we go all right here goes

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:13.080 
there we go all right here goes
uncertified<00:01:52.750> one<00:01:53.110> ohm

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:21.250

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
466 and 12 point 7 8 so voltage was a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.920 
466 and 12 point 7 8 so voltage was a
little<00:02:21.560> bit<00:02:21.680> down<00:02:21.890> but<00:02:22.250> still<00:02:23.120> nowhere<00:02:23.510> near

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
little bit down but still nowhere near

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.340 
little bit down but still nowhere near
the<00:02:24.280> 1050<00:02:25.280> all<00:02:25.970> right<00:02:26.150> hopefully<00:02:26.360> dynamic<00:02:27.140> I

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
the 1050 all right hopefully dynamic I

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.260 
the 1050 all right hopefully dynamic I
can<00:02:28.040> should<00:02:28.459> be<00:02:28.520> able<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.670> keep<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.940> voltage

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
can should be able to keep the voltage

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.199 
can should be able to keep the voltage
up<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.540> little<00:02:29.690> higher<00:02:29.900> with<00:02:30.170> dynamic<00:02:30.709> and

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
up a little higher with dynamic and

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.620 
up a little higher with dynamic and
hopefully<00:02:32.209> we'll<00:02:32.360> get<00:02:32.540> at<00:02:32.720> least<00:02:32.930> close<00:02:34.630> I

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
hopefully we'll get at least close I

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.960 
hopefully we'll get at least close I
don't<00:02:36.110> see<00:02:37.040> that<00:02:37.220> happening

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
don't see that happening

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.150 
don't see that happening
all<00:02:38.330> right<00:02:38.540> I'll<00:02:38.780> set<00:02:39.080> up<00:02:39.200> for<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.410> dynamic<00:02:39.620> run

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
all right I'll set up for a dynamic run

all right I'll set up for a dynamic run

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
up to 1050 watts so I mean this thing

up to 1050 watts so I mean this thing
cost<00:03:11.380> like<00:03:12.360> $104<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:13.690> think<00:03:14.020> the<00:03:14.110> most<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.560> saw

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.440 
cost like $104 I think the most I saw
anywhere<00:03:15.280> on<00:03:15.460> this<00:03:15.580> thing<00:03:15.820> was<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.000> hundred<00:03:16.330> and

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
anywhere on this thing was a hundred and

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.290 
anywhere on this thing was a hundred and
fifty<00:03:16.810> dollars<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:18.220> it's<00:03:18.610> not<00:03:18.790> like<00:03:19.000> it's<00:03:19.180> an

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
fifty dollars so it's not like it's an

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.680 
fifty dollars so it's not like it's an
expensive<00:03:19.870> amp<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:22.090> mean<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:22.450> wasn't

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
expensive amp so I mean I wasn't

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.430 
expensive amp so I mean I wasn't
expecting<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:23.380> whole<00:03:23.530> lot<00:03:23.590> out<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.010> it<00:03:24.190> anyway

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
expecting a whole lot out of it anyway

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.380 
expecting a whole lot out of it anyway
but<00:03:28.050> that's<00:03:29.050> what<00:03:29.290> pisses<00:03:29.500> me<00:03:29.770> off

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
but that's what pisses me off

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.800 
but that's what pisses me off
2,100<00:03:31.390> watts<00:03:33.030> they<00:03:34.030> can't<00:03:34.270> even<00:03:34.360> do<00:03:34.540> what<00:03:34.690> it

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
2,100 watts they can't even do what it

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.320 
2,100 watts they can't even do what it
actually<00:03:34.990> says<00:03:35.410> for<00:03:35.590> RMS<00:03:36.060> like<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.120> said<00:03:37.300> I

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
actually says for RMS like I said I

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.410 
actually says for RMS like I said I
don't<00:03:37.570> care<00:03:37.720> if<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:38.140> 14<00:03:38.740> point<00:03:39.100> 4<00:03:39.340> volts

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
don't care if that is 14 point 4 volts

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.930 
don't care if that is 14 point 4 volts
there's<00:03:40.420> no<00:03:40.780> way<00:03:40.990> you're<00:03:41.470> getting<00:03:41.790> 1050<00:03:42.790> watts

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
there's no way you're getting 1050 watts

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.090 
there's no way you're getting 1050 watts
out<00:03:43.210> of<00:03:43.330> this<00:03:43.450> thing

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
out of this thing

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.440 
out of this thing
okay<00:03:45.100> just<00:03:45.340> for<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.550> hell<00:03:45.670> of<00:03:45.700> it<00:03:45.880> I<00:03:46.000> ramped<00:03:46.420> up

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
okay just for the hell of it I ramped up

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.240 
okay just for the hell of it I ramped up
my<00:03:46.600> voltage<00:03:46.990> on<00:03:47.170> my<00:03:47.290> power<00:03:47.530> supply<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:48.130> we're

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
my voltage on my power supply so we're

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.310 
my voltage on my power supply so we're
going<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.400> do<00:03:48.520> one<00:03:48.700> more<00:03:48.730> dynamic<00:03:49.420> test<00:03:49.660> this

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
going to do one more dynamic test this

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.840 
going to do one more dynamic test this
should<00:03:50.590> get<00:03:50.710> us<00:03:50.830> closer<00:03:51.100> to<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.430> fourteen

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
should get us closer to the fourteen

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.970 
should get us closer to the fourteen
point<00:03:52.120> four<00:03:52.330> volts<00:03:52.750> let's<00:03:53.500> see<00:03:53.710> what<00:03:53.860> we<00:03:53.950> can

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
point four volts let's see what we can

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:09.250 
point four volts let's see what we can
get<00:03:54.160> out<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.490> it<00:03:58.470> 869<00:03:59.470> watts<00:04:02.130> at<00:04:03.210> 16<00:04:04.210> volts<00:04:06.210> okay

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.430 

869<00:04:10.260> watts<00:04:10.620> that's<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.870> that<00:04:12.870> was<00:04:12.960> at<00:04:13.080> a<00:04:13.110> full

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
869 watts that's it that was at a full

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.620 
869 watts that's it that was at a full
16<00:04:13.980> volt<00:04:14.340> first<00:04:16.310> no<00:04:17.310> damn<00:04:17.670> way<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.269> thing<00:04:18.510> is

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
16 volt first no damn way this thing is

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:26.980 
16 volt first no damn way this thing is
getting<00:04:18.780> anywhere<00:04:19.260> near<00:04:19.609> 1050

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.370 

okay<00:04:27.699> 706<00:04:28.699> watts<00:04:29.330> I<00:04:29.360> turned<00:04:29.840> down<00:04:29.930> my<00:04:30.169> power

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
okay 706 watts I turned down my power

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.730 
okay 706 watts I turned down my power
supply<00:04:30.680> just<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:31.009> little<00:04:31.280> bit<00:04:32.169> so<00:04:33.169> that<00:04:33.199> was<00:04:33.620> at

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
supply just a little bit so that was at

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.439 
supply just a little bit so that was at
fourteen<00:04:34.250> point<00:04:34.610> two<00:04:34.669> three<00:04:35.060> volts<00:04:35.509> a<00:04:37.449> lot

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
fourteen point two three volts a lot

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.230 
fourteen point two three volts a lot
closer<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.680> fourteen<00:04:40.550> point<00:04:40.819> four<00:04:41.030> that

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
closer to the fourteen point four that

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.089 
closer to the fourteen point four that
it's<00:04:41.389> rated<00:04:41.720> at<00:04:41.949> and<00:04:43.330> not<00:04:44.330> anywhere<00:04:44.780> near<00:04:45.099> 1050

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
it's rated at and not anywhere near 1050

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:54.100 
it's rated at and not anywhere near 1050
watts<00:04:47.560> so<00:04:48.560> I<00:04:49.030> call<00:04:50.509> on<00:04:50.630> this<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.990> am<00:04:53.110> we

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
watts so I call on this I am we

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.570 
watts so I call on this I am we
said<00:04:54.349> it<00:04:54.470> wasn't<00:04:54.590> expecting<00:04:55.069> much<00:04:55.220> out<00:04:55.370> of<00:04:55.430> it

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
said it wasn't expecting much out of it

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.120 
said it wasn't expecting much out of it
anyway<00:04:55.940> but<00:04:56.479> alright<00:04:57.259> stay<00:04:57.530> tuned<00:04:57.710> guys<00:04:57.919> I'll

anyway but alright stay tuned guys I'll

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.630 
anyway but alright stay tuned guys I'll
