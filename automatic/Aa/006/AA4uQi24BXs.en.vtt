00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.500
 until 2013 with the brand new 16 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.180
 5 inch full hd smartphone without lc 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.010
 for the time being though that my hand by battery 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.230
 our industry quite favorable to the 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.889
 market september not mine 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.180
 camera 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.550
 no, so joking that's really here 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.050
 first a triple a stamp that 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.550
 means you have a few programs 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.990
 by Alcatel into their lives can see 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.580
 it's nice and fast 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.050
 quad-core processor of course and also 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.380
 the complete technical data can 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.419
 you really on a camera 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.010
 we can have loudspeakers here 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.100
 finally a few keys and the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.680
 indicate as indicated four points 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.460
 1 installed then we'll have a look 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.710
 bit of 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.719
 we have a strong headphone connection 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.720
 and of course each other off switch 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.160
 volume control respectively 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.480
 out already two big heads 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.100
 below i have a usb and a microphone 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.829
 and on the other side we have here 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.940
 finally a SIM card reader too 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.399
 each one can be done accordingly 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.360
 take out 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.150
 on the back we still have here 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.770
 an 8 megapixel camera is still lightning 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.170
 microphone and a rubberized surface 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.610
 which is really nice to look at 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.710
 and how it feels very well 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.360
 and to the speaker here, of course 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.210
 I want to show also can 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.530
 of course, now the keyboard 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.320
 were there seem teltarif ever 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.290
 before every date here too 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.210
 just go tech kfw and 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.220
 wonderful as said that 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.700
 of course the right software myself 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.380
 mistyped 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.610
 so park back briefly while there 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 show that 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.160
 exactly screen teams look very slow 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.100
 the very early start is likely 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.360
 also about a lot more I can 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.360
 the brand new one 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.190
 alcatel one did not do anything on the left 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.979
 say but it seems really chic 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.280
 display to have five inches full hd beautiful 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.600
 fast and very good to look at and to 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.310
 probably use that with 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.110
 final software and price 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.909
 probably baller also play the part 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.619
 initially funded 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.619
 with the currently 1
