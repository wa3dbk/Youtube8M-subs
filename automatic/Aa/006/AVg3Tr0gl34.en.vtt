do it so I think that's pretty cool to

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.070 
do it so I think that's pretty cool to
set<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.730> fingerprint<00:01:25.270> scanner<00:01:25.570> for<00:01:25.780> those<00:01:25.930> of

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
set the fingerprint scanner for those of

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.720 
set the fingerprint scanner for those of
you<00:01:26.170> are<00:01:26.290> wondering<00:01:26.500> all<00:01:26.950> you<00:01:27.130> do<00:01:27.310> it's<00:01:27.490> gone

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
your finger scanner will be there then

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.500 
your finger scanner will be there then
you<00:01:40.240> can<00:01:40.420> manage<00:01:40.600> your<00:01:40.720> fingerprints<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:41.650> can

swipe it different ways you can use
different<00:01:45.160> fingers<00:01:45.580> so<00:01:46.150> that's<00:01:46.330> definitely<00:01:46.540> a

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
different fingers so that's definitely a

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.359

plus<00:01:48.420> I've<00:01:49.420> taken<00:01:49.660> this<00:01:49.840> pan<00:01:50.080> out<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.500> lot

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
plus I've taken this pan out of the lot

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.469 
plus I've taken this pan out of the lot
and<00:01:52.360> I'm<00:01:52.450> just<00:01:52.600> using<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.140> flick<00:01:53.350> through

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and I'm just using it to flick through

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.270 
and I'm just using it to flick through
do<00:01:55.479> some<00:01:55.690> things<00:01:56.250> using<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.680> let's<00:01:59.979> pretend

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
do some things using it so let's pretend

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.520 
do some things using it so let's pretend
with<00:02:00.460> left<00:02:00.670> RS<00:02:01.030> pen<00:02:01.300> and<00:02:01.810> we've<00:02:02.050> gone<00:02:02.229> on<00:02:02.380> them

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
with left RS pen and we've gone on them

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:15.010 
with left RS pen and we've gone on them
on<00:02:02.650> a<00:02:02.710> little<00:02:03.460> walk

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.740 

so<00:02:16.020> once<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.350> got<00:02:16.440> about<00:02:16.620> five<00:02:16.920> meters<00:02:17.340> away

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
so once I got about five meters away

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.880 
so once I got about five meters away
this<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.260> message<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.710> was<00:02:20.340> displayed

this is the message that was displayed

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.130 
this is the message that was displayed
with<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.920> little<00:02:23.640> alarm<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.330> not<00:02:24.540> fail<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.990> that

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
is the heart rate monitor let's go on so

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.890 
is the heart rate monitor let's go on so
you<00:02:34.530> go<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.890> s<00:02:35.190> health<00:02:35.550> ok<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:36.780> I'll<00:02:36.870> just
