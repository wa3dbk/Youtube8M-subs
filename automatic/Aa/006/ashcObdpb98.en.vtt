00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.490
 welcome here back to artur x time 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.590
 and well this time we are going to make a 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.410
 small test about what is the mortal 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.450
 kombat complete edition and good here 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.920
 let's go to options and remember that this 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.050
 game is approved and is running 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:26.250
 about 7,750 king don jaime gave of 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.460
 an ok and good giga here we will see in 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.740
 video and we're going to see that this game is 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.320
 tremendously well optimized is in 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.260
 full hd resolution 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.510
 high quality and texture the highest quality 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.370
 of the high shadows 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.769
 let's really put it high to see what 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.820
 no, and now we are going to put him 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:53.789
 smoothed in 4x and apart let's put 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.649
 an anise filter another peak in 16 x ok this 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.589
 game is tremendously well optimized 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.269
 because it does not come down from the 60 sentences ok now 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.930
 yes what next thing we're going to do 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.780
 it's going to be play we're going to do the test 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.729
 ok right now I'm recording and he left me in 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.070
 the game is running at 60 fraps 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.850
 therefore without recording should go to 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.860
 about 80 about 100 I would say ok here 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.200
 let's choose our character in 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.200
 the PC version the complete edition 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.450
 includes the vlc characters that had 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.140
 come out to console scarlett that in 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.149
 chin rain and freddy krueger that this is 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.729
 the exclusive version of xbox 360 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.959
 the only one that is not strata that is that 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.369
 exclusive of the version of 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:37.440
 Playstation 3 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.649
 ok here we are going to choose sonya blade and 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.470
 well let's put it half because 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.280
 I 'm really not very good at this game 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.830
 I also tell them that I'm using 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.560
 a command 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.120
 and runs with editing there I have the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.610
 unboxing in case you want to see it is a 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.080
 pretty good control and pretty father 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.960
 It has never failed me 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.270
 and good now the game is still 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.070
 still running with the high shadows in 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.020
 60% or 60 of france without going down and 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.899
 the graphics I feel that it has a 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.810
 very good improvement in what is graphics 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.660
 as 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.160
 Now that the game is pretty much 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.780
 well optimized the truth surprised me 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.069
 the optimization of this game since the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.270
 most fighting games 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.270
 they are usually not so good 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.610
 optimized and I never expected a game of 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.870
 mortal kombat not like that now that what 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.150
 I've been waiting for quite some time 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.550
 but I was afraid that my pc did not 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.300
 I could run and now we can see 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.360
 than any mid-range PC and one of 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.200
 high end can not run that much 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.930
 It's pretty good 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.569
 now yes that graphical improvement over 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.250
 everything depends on the filters that you read that 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.870
 has the game because if you 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.690
 they have high quality and 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.519
 and only full hd will be noticed 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.960
 exactly as with the version of 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.840
 console 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.550
 now they need to put it to 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.010
 notice a graphic improvement the anti 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.020
 aliasing and all the and have a good 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.070
 TV capacity with motion blue 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.160
 or cheat with that and this one will be 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.860
 let say 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.860
 is having an optimal graphic quality 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.739
 because the rays look exactly the same 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.420
 that the console ones very good and I do not think 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.019
 that here we can do fatalities jones 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.019
 and if to see 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:35.750
 it was in particular movements to see we are going 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.020
 to check if they look to see fine former king 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.020
 eta 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.020
 He did not come out good no matter now we are going to 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.640
 take us fight this video 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.560
 right now they should be seeing it in 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.510
 1080p since it tries to put the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.710
 maximum quality to the video indeed 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.910
 even this network in bristling now if 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.120
 rendering now as is the case of 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.850
 that is not converted to another format 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.820
 this how was recorded what went up I think that 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.880
 Weighed two points will weigh 2.5 you arrive 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.470
 3 but good overall quality since 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.209
 I want you to see all the quality that 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.340
 has the world that is the deadly kombat 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.140
 complete edition that in most 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.840
 the first ones were here and now 106 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.390
 more to see that we hope they do 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.890
 please is exactly the same but for me 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.180
 It is one of the best deliveries of mortal 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.270
 kombat 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.520
 therefore what 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.960
 that it was a version that only 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.700
 I was waiting for consoles and then 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.840
 they repented and announced it here well 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:44.270
 father for for our pc is something that 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.860
 we should normally take advantage of me 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.610
 I like more to buy the games I started 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.330
 why 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.500
 this I feel that they have a better in this 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.919
 and I also find many offers 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.569
 in the shops in steam and apart 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.330
 that 's excellent because always 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:01.680
 they have offers in summer and that's 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.210
 It's convenient because the time is what I 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.340
 spend in a console game I can 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.770
 spend on pc games 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.020
 Now I do not know if you had already 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.780
 commented that I was going to change 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:18.330
 graphic card to a 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:21.660
 it seems to me that give to 3.870 17 1870 of 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.090
 jaime noise and now I if 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.460
 planned to do I'm just waiting 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.169
 a little out and whiteout to see if 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.880
 they include it with the card or to see 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.290
 they give me because I want to play the 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.200
 white boxes of that if I'm going to be the same 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.500
 and good friends, I hope you like them 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.520
 is pleasing this video now yes that 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.770
 I am very pleased with the 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.010
 playability and does not keep them going down from 60 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.560
 fraps has an incredible performance by 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.130
 true the other specifications of the 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.040
 pc are 16 gigs of ram is not version 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.080
 gamer is a normal field only with 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.260
 16 gigas of ram now yes bought high 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.180
 than a normal brand that is called a data 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.340
 the truth is not a very good brand for 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.810
 gamer but it's pulling in from very good 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.919
 way in any game 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.300
 have been in Madrid this beautiful east and 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:15.160
 the other the processor 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:20.410
 it's an 8,120 fx 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:22.660
 from 8 cores to 3.1 per core east 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.280
 let's say it's the equivalent to the core i7 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:28.389
 d 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:32.290
 of this 20 obviously does not compare anymore 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:36.790
 that really a core i5 of intel is 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:38.500
 higher this to fx 8.120 I would 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.190
 I would recommend that if they have money they 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.500
 will buy the 8.350 s fx if it came out with very 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.889
 good results in the bises marx me 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.950
 it seems that if that's the name 8,350 and 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:53.380
 Now I recommend it a lot 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.850
 same if you want something economic 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.320
 here and that it serves them to play any 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.510
 game like the video you are watching 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.420
 right now 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.190
 this is and the 8.120 is also very good 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.530
 but they are already demanding gamers because 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.750
 comprises a core i7 extreme edition that 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:10.590
 it's going to last for some I do not know 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:13.790
 about six years this fucking trabalón 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.790
 colero but 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.420
 I already take the truth 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.470
 come on let's show I focused there 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.470
 Concentrate 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.660
 now you fort damn 

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:39.370
 total friends well in if this was the 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.770
 video the truth I hope you have them 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.860
 pleased and do not have the comments 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.719
 Now, yes, above all, what most 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.969
 matter of the users is that I 

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:51.909
 comment now if this seems to you in 

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:53.860
 the comments this one if you guys 

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:56.050
 It seems good that I told you not to 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.189
 comment then you say things 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.189
 so well the touch i 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:06.210
 and then we'll know this later how 

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:08.790
 we can evolve the videos and good 

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:11.160
 friends this already became July here 

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.780
 but there is no fart and good friends 

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.400
 this was all I hope you have 

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.400
 enjoyed and until next time
