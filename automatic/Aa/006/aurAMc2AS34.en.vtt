00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.780 
got their ones where every four kilo I
was<00:03:22.459> brought<00:03:22.640> back<00:03:22.879> down<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.890> cabin<00:03:25.190> the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
was brought back down the cabin the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.940 
was brought back down the cabin the
seats<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.799> that<00:03:27.799> I<00:03:27.980> think<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.760> spacing<00:03:29.390> is

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
seats of that I think the spacing is

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.949 
seats of that I think the spacing is
it's<00:03:30.950> tight<00:03:31.340> but<00:03:31.640> it's<00:03:31.760> even<00:03:32.090> worth<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.599> it's

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
it's tight but it's even worth it it's

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.570 
it's tight but it's even worth it it's
okay<00:03:33.290> on<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.590> emergency<00:03:33.980> exit<00:03:34.340> you've<00:03:34.489> got

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
okay on the emergency exit you've got

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.910 
okay on the emergency exit you've got
plenty<00:03:34.790> of<00:03:35.000> legroom<00:03:35.180> there<00:03:35.629> and<00:03:35.870> there's<00:03:36.830> two

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
plenty of legroom there and there's two

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.729 
plenty of legroom there and there's two
three<00:03:37.580> rows<00:03:37.819> they've<00:03:38.120> got<00:03:38.269> these<00:03:38.420> buttons<00:03:38.739> on

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
three rows they've got these buttons on

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.789 
three rows they've got these buttons on

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
top with a drop down sent a bit but

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.140 
top with a drop down sent a bit but
they're<00:03:42.980> uh<00:03:43.010> neither<00:03:43.340> three<00:03:43.730> in<00:03:43.849> the<00:03:43.910> middle

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
they're uh neither three in the middle

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.589 
they're uh neither three in the middle
here<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.420> rest<00:03:44.599> of<00:03:44.720> them<00:03:44.810> don't<00:03:45.019> have<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:46.599> as

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
here the rest of them don't have it as

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.900 
here the rest of them don't have it as
our<00:03:47.780> sails<00:03:48.019> I<00:03:48.230> go<00:03:48.410> back<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.709> bit<00:03:48.860> further<00:03:49.220> blue

very<00:03:55.790> clean<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.629> tiny<00:03:56.900> spacious<00:03:57.700> but<00:03:58.700> one<00:03:59.269> of

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
very clean and tiny spacious but one of

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.740 
very clean and tiny spacious but one of
the<00:03:59.450> problems<00:03:59.930> I<00:04:00.200> think<00:04:01.160> is<00:04:01.370> not<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.209> pitch<00:04:02.569> of

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
the problems I think is not the pitch of

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.460 
the problems I think is not the pitch of
the<00:04:02.840> seat<00:04:03.110> or<00:04:04.069> seat<00:04:04.310> bottom<00:04:04.790> it's<00:04:05.540> from<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
the seat or seat bottom it's from the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.690 
the seat or seat bottom it's from the
front<00:04:07.459> from<00:04:07.760> there<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.569> there<00:04:08.810> is<00:04:09.370> very<00:04:10.370> long

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
front from there to there is very long

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.910 
front from there to there is very long
and<00:04:11.000> it's<00:04:11.660> even<00:04:11.989> giving<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:12.380> less<00:04:12.590> this

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
and it's even giving you less this

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.280 
and it's even giving you less this
legroom<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.579> I<00:04:13.790> think<00:04:14.090> that's<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:14.480> seat

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
legroom and I think that's the seat

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.979 
legroom and I think that's the seat
design<00:04:15.530> as<00:04:16.010> opposed<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.880> pitch<00:04:17.720> of<00:04:17.870> the

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
design as opposed to the pitch of the

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.330 
design as opposed to the pitch of the
seats

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
seats

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.440 
seats
very<00:04:19.789> nice<00:04:19.970> seats<00:04:20.299> but<00:04:20.590> but<00:04:21.590> they<00:04:21.680> have<00:04:21.799> a<00:04:21.829> very

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
very nice seats but but they have a very

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.320 
very nice seats but but they have a very
wide<00:04:23.450> bottom

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
wide bottom

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.880
