00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
indentations as well all right put the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.230 
indentations as well all right put the
headlight<00:01:53.640> back<00:01:53.850> in

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.780 

pretty<00:01:57.240> much<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.690> same<00:01:57.870> steps<00:01:58.200> over<00:01:58.790> other

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
pretty much the same steps over other

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.310 
pretty much the same steps over other
ones<00:02:00.060> thinking<00:02:00.330> one<00:02:00.780> infer<00:02:01.670> if<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:03.030> to

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
ones thinking one infer if I have to

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.650 
ones thinking one infer if I have to
often<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.500> much<00:02:04.740> easier<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:05.510> we're<00:02:06.510> just

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
often be much easier but we're just

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.700 
often be much easier but we're just
saving<00:02:06.840> some<00:02:07.580> time<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.790> ing<00:02:09.530> alright<00:02:10.530> once

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
saving some time and ing alright once

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.100 
saving some time and ing alright once
you<00:02:10.830> get<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.130> headlight<00:02:11.430> back<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:12.110> on

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
you get the headlight back in on

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.860 
you get the headlight back in on
carefully<00:02:13.710> slide<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.370> place<00:02:17.600> you<00:02:18.600> want<00:02:18.780> to

they're<00:02:22.590> pretty<00:02:22.800> much<00:02:22.920> straightforward<00:02:23.870> they

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
they're pretty much straightforward they

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.690 
they're pretty much straightforward they
all<00:02:24.990> connect<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.560> certain<00:02:25.860> place<00:02:26.040> can't
