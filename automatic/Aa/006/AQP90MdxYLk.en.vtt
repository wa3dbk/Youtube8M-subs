poor what's up how bizarre listen morrow
Go<00:02:16.190> Go<00:02:20.000> taught<00:02:21.000> me<00:02:21.209> no<00:02:21.750> that's<00:02:22.019> not<00:02:22.230> force

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.990 

saying<00:02:30.329> a<00:02:30.510> sharpie<00:02:31.280> dog<00:02:32.280> meat<00:02:32.489> is<00:02:32.640> actually

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
saying a sharpie dog meat is actually

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.729 
saying a sharpie dog meat is actually
more<00:02:33.209> expensive<00:02:33.329> than<00:02:33.810> for<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.349> this<00:02:34.470> would

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
more expensive than for it so this would

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.610 
more expensive than for it so this would
be<00:02:34.769> an<00:02:35.099> oxidation<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:37.049> way<00:02:37.140> our<00:02:37.260> describe

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
be an oxidation so the way our describe

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.830 
be an oxidation so the way our describe
this<00:02:37.769> is<00:02:37.950> almost<00:02:38.280> like<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:39.299> don't<00:02:39.510> know<00:02:39.660> what<00:02:39.810> a

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
this is almost like I don't know what a

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.949 
this is almost like I don't know what a
ferry<00:02:40.799> horn<00:02:40.920> sorry<00:02:41.370> go<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:42.420> would<00:02:42.660> say<00:02:42.810> it's

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
ferry horn sorry go I would say it's

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.800 
ferry horn sorry go I would say it's
more<00:02:43.019> like<00:02:43.760> most<00:02:44.760> like<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.940> jello<00:02:45.239> consistency

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
more like most like a jello consistency

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.839 
more like most like a jello consistency
the<00:02:48.260> stuff<00:02:48.470> itself<00:02:48.800> doesn't<00:02:49.310> have<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.580> flavor

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
the stuff itself doesn't have a flavor

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.540 
the stuff itself doesn't have a flavor
so<00:02:50.209> I<00:02:50.239> need<00:02:50.450> stuff<00:02:50.780> on<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.080> outside<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:52.430> be

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
so I need stuff on the outside to be

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.520
