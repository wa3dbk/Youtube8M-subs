00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.450 

there<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:50.620> is<00:01:51.510> nunchucks<00:01:52.510> lies<00:01:52.720> in<00:01:52.930> here<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
there it is nunchucks lies in here and

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.430 
there it is nunchucks lies in here and
the<00:01:54.520> wire<00:01:54.670> goes<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.150> side<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:56.140> basically

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
the wire goes to the side and basically

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.680 
the wire goes to the side and basically
just<00:01:56.710> snaps<00:01:56.950> back<00:01:57.130> on<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.640> then<00:01:58.300> this<00:01:58.450> little

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
just snaps back on and then this little

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:17.030 
just snaps back on and then this little
attachment<00:01:59.290> piece<00:02:00.420> goes<00:02:01.420> into<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.350> Wemo

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.220 

right<00:02:18.360> as<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.480> can<00:02:19.570> see<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.900> design<00:02:20.200> is

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
right as you can see the design is

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.830 
right as you can see the design is
extremely<00:02:21.100> flawed<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.910> requires<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.570> chill<00:02:22.720> a

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
extremely flawed it requires to chill a

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.150 
extremely flawed it requires to chill a
batteries<00:02:23.200> but<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:23.470> does<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.680> other<00:02:23.770> one<00:02:23.980> but

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
batteries but so does the other one but

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160 
batteries but so does the other one but
I<00:02:24.400> mean<00:02:24.940> all<00:02:25.150> this<00:02:25.270> thing<00:02:25.480> really<00:02:25.630> does<00:02:25.930> is

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
I mean all this thing really does is

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.600 
I mean all this thing really does is
it's<00:02:26.380> just<00:02:26.530> like<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.130> Sharpshooter

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
it's just like the Sharpshooter

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.840 
it's just like the Sharpshooter
attachment<00:02:28.120> it's<00:02:28.300> really<00:02:28.750> dumb<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:30.580> put<00:02:30.760> it

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
attachment it's really dumb to put it

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.250 
attachment it's really dumb to put it
back<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.390> have<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.540> slide<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.900> wire

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
back on you have to slide the wire

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.780 
back on you have to slide the wire
through<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.040> little<00:02:33.310> piece<00:02:33.520> right<00:02:33.730> there

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
through that little piece right there

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.330 
through that little piece right there
and<00:02:34.300> pray<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.230> God<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.500> can<00:02:35.740> actually<00:02:35.890> get<00:02:36.190> it

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
and pray to God you can actually get it

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.449 
and pray to God you can actually get it
to<00:02:36.490> snap<00:02:36.910> back<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:38.040> then<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.130> put<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:39.400> the

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
to snap back on and then you put in the

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.110 
to snap back on and then you put in the
batteries<00:02:40.260> close<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.410> up<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.740> then<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:42.640> use

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
batteries close it up and then you use

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.180 
batteries close it up and then you use
this<00:02:43.269> annoying<00:02:43.630> piece<00:02:43.959> there<00:02:44.769> just<00:02:45.040> kind<00:02:45.160> of

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
this annoying piece there just kind of

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.650 
this annoying piece there just kind of
adds<00:02:45.340> more<00:02:45.519> weight<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.760> your<00:02:45.910> nunchuck<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:46.450> it

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
adds more weight to your nunchuck and it

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.350 
adds more weight to your nunchuck and it
was<00:02:46.750> annoying<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.440> put<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:47.769> but<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.940> one<00:02:49.120> that

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
was annoying to put on but the one that

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.150 
was annoying to put on but the one that
I<00:02:49.420> really<00:02:49.750> do<00:02:49.989> prefer<00:02:50.350> is<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.400> one<00:02:52.080> elbow<00:02:53.160> we

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
I really do prefer is the one elbow we

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.710 
I really do prefer is the one elbow we
usually<00:02:54.459> don't<00:02:54.850> expect<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.330> best<00:02:55.480> from<00:02:55.540> you

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
usually don't expect the best from you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.940 
usually don't expect the best from you
elbow<00:02:55.900> but<00:02:56.170> I<00:02:56.200> don't<00:02:56.440> say<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:56.800> probably

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
elbow but I don't say this is probably

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.290 
elbow but I don't say this is probably
their<00:02:57.310> best<00:02:57.459> product<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.030> they've<00:02:58.180> ever
