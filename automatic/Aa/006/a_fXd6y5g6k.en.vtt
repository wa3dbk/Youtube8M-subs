those wondering these accounts are
registered<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> me<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.720> that

hacking anybody else go ahead and try to
use<00:01:17.450> bogus<00:01:18.450> passwords<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.830> it's

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
use bogus passwords you can see it's

again do this again they're letting me

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.090 
again do this again they're letting me
make<00:01:41.869> multiple<00:01:42.350> attacks<00:01:42.619> on<00:01:42.770> multiple

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.870 
crasher and list them all into a single
array<00:02:02.960> then<00:02:03.740> they'd<00:02:04.070> have<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.250> dictionary<00:02:04.460> of

know<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.010> returns<00:02:31.280> false<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.299> user<00:02:32.480> and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
know it returns false so that user and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.930 
know it returns false so that user and
pass<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:33.019> failed<00:02:33.310> otherwise<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.700> know<00:02:34.790> return

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
pass is failed otherwise you know return

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.850 
pass is failed otherwise you know return
true<00:02:35.299> and<00:02:35.450> it's<00:02:35.569> hacked<00:02:35.750> this<00:02:36.260> function<00:02:36.680> is

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
true and it's hacked this function is

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.350 
true and it's hacked this function is
basically<00:02:37.340> just<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.880> encapsulation

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
basically just the encapsulation

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.080 
basically just the encapsulation
function<00:02:38.840> for<00:02:39.049> hacking<00:02:39.319> a<00:02:39.380> user<00:02:39.640> if<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:40.850> true

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
function for hacking a user if it's true

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.880 
function for hacking a user if it's true
if<00:02:41.359> you<00:02:41.630> know<00:02:41.750> shows<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.260> broken<00:02:42.500> pass<00:02:42.650> where

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
if you know shows the broken pass where

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.380 
if you know shows the broken pass where
it<00:02:42.980> gives<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.280> user<00:02:43.310> name<00:02:43.670> shows<00:02:44.269> the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
it gives the user name shows the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.990 
it gives the user name shows the
password<00:02:44.780> yeah<00:02:45.380> just<00:02:45.560> ways<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:45.859> there<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:46.910> is

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
password yeah just ways it there this is

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.789 
password yeah just ways it there this is
the<00:02:47.060> main<00:02:47.180> function<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:48.470> is<00:02:48.560> basically

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
the main function and this is basically

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.289 
the main function and this is basically
all<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.040> logic<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.430> it's<00:02:49.670> just<00:02:49.880> two<00:02:50.000> nested

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
all the logic is it's just two nested

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.199 
all the logic is it's just two nested
for<00:02:50.480> loops<00:02:51.100> you<00:02:52.100> have<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> foreach<00:02:52.579> so<00:02:52.970> for<00:02:53.150> each

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
for loops you have a foreach so for each

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.949 
for loops you have a foreach so for each
password<00:02:53.720> as<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:54.019> pass<00:02:54.650> in<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.400> array<00:02:55.959> you

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
password as a pass in the array you

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.530 
password as a pass in the array you
select<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.650> user<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:59.000> basically<00:02:59.299> you're<00:02:59.420> going

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
select a user so basically you're going

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.420 
select a user so basically you're going
to<00:02:59.600> try<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.750> first<00:02:59.959> password<00:03:00.500> in<00:03:00.769> this<00:03:01.190> array

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
to try the first password in this array

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.960 
to try the first password in this array
on<00:03:01.640> every<00:03:02.180> single<00:03:02.329> user<00:03:02.630> name<00:03:02.840> in<00:03:02.989> this<00:03:03.109> list

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
on every single user name in this list

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.370 
on every single user name in this list
this<00:03:04.970> way<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.569> know<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:05.690> never<00:03:05.930> get<00:03:06.139> locked

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
this way you know you never get locked

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.349 
this way you know you never get locked
out<00:03:06.500> on<00:03:06.650> any<00:03:06.829> given<00:03:06.950> user<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:08.000> can<00:03:08.030> try<00:03:08.299> the

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
out on any given user you can try the

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.020 
out on any given user you can try the
you<00:03:08.660> know<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.139> password<00:03:09.260> password<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.190> you

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
you know the password password and you

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.690 
you know the password password and you
know<00:03:11.150> all<00:03:11.359> 500<00:03:12.049> users<00:03:12.230> that<00:03:12.410> you<00:03:12.530> have<00:03:12.700> and

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
know all 500 users that you have and

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.340 
know all 500 users that you have and
then<00:03:13.880> when<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.209> fails<00:03:14.450> or<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:14.840> crack<00:03:15.019> some<00:03:15.049> of

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
then when that fails or it crack some of

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.319 
then when that fails or it crack some of
them<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.739> know<00:03:15.829> that<00:03:15.950> post<00:03:16.160> that's<00:03:16.430> fine<00:03:16.609> and

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
them you know that post that's fine and

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.729 
them you know that post that's fine and
then<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.510> try<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.720> second<00:03:18.049> password<00:03:18.200> on<00:03:18.560> all

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
then you try the second password on all

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.979 
then you try the second password on all
the<00:03:18.859> users<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:20.420> know<00:03:20.510> are<00:03:20.600> in<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.780> list

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
the users that you know are in the list

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.319 
the users that you know are in the list
better<00:03:21.920> logic<00:03:22.310> would<00:03:22.400> strip<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.700> users<00:03:23.180> that

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
better logic would strip the users that

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.910 
better logic would strip the users that
have<00:03:23.389> obviously<00:03:23.840> been<00:03:23.959> authenticated<00:03:24.560> so

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
have obviously been authenticated so

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.170 
have obviously been authenticated so
you're<00:03:25.040> not<00:03:25.160> making<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.489> tax<00:03:25.730> on<00:03:25.880> something

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
you're not making a tax on something

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.720 
you're not making a tax on something
that<00:03:26.209> doesn't<00:03:26.329> exist<00:03:27.130> they<00:03:28.130> don't<00:03:28.310> lock<00:03:28.459> out

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
that doesn't exist they don't lock out

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.670 
that doesn't exist they don't lock out
on<00:03:28.910> IP<00:03:29.180> but<00:03:29.810> even<00:03:29.930> if<00:03:30.109> they<00:03:30.230> did<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.530> would<00:03:30.590> be

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
on IP but even if they did it would be

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.650 
on IP but even if they did it would be

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
trivial to write scripts that cycle

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.140 
trivial to write scripts that cycle
through<00:03:32.870> proxies<00:03:33.350> that<00:03:33.980> would<00:03:34.489> you<00:03:34.730> know<00:03:34.819> make

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
through proxies that would you know make

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.220 
through proxies that would you know make
this<00:03:35.299> attack<00:03:35.630> still<00:03:36.200> successful

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
this attack still successful
