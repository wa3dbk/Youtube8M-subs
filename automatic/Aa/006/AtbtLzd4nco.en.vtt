00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.450 
they can not only see the slide you're
referencing<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.739> they<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:55.949> see<00:00:56.100> your<00:00:56.250> face

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460

at the same time now the full-screen
view<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.789> here<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.629> probably<00:01:00.930> best<00:01:01.140> for

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
view we have here is probably best for

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.650 
view we have here is probably best for
introducing<00:01:01.859> yourself<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.460> your<00:01:02.609> topic<00:01:03.000> once

you've started the slides themselves

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.830 
you've started the slides themselves
you'll<00:01:05.760> want<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.000> switch<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.420> something<00:01:06.630> like

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
you'll want to switch to something like

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.679 
you'll want to switch to something like
this<00:01:06.990> which<00:01:07.229> puts<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> focus<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.280> slides

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
this which puts the focus on the slides

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.880 
this which puts the focus on the slides
however<00:01:09.689> at<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> same<00:01:09.900> time<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:10.650> in

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
however at the same time you can see in

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.649 
however at the same time you can see in
the<00:01:11.070> bottom<00:01:11.310> corner<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.790> always<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> view

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the bottom corner we always have a view

the bottom corner we always have a view
of<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> speaker

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
of the speaker

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.819 
of the speaker
now<00:01:15.329> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.540> flip<00:01:15.810> through<00:01:15.960> your<00:01:16.170> slides<00:01:16.350> and

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
now you can flip through your slides and

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.249 
now you can flip through your slides and
introduce<00:01:17.729> each<00:01:17.909> one<00:01:18.149> discuss<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> topics

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
introduce each one discuss the topics

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.200

when<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.220> something<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.579> this<00:01:20.700> where

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
when you get something like this where

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.969 
when you get something like this where
the<00:01:21.329> video<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.659> obscuring<00:01:22.259> some<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.619> text

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the video is obscuring some of the text

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.620 
the video is obscuring some of the text
perhaps<00:01:23.369> some<00:01:23.939> important<00:01:24.360> piece<00:01:24.509> of

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
perhaps some important piece of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.630 
perhaps some important piece of
information<00:01:24.899> that<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.500> audience<00:01:26.220> needs<00:01:26.460> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
information that the audience needs to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.359 
information that the audience needs to
see<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.509> simple<00:01:27.869> matter<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.280> flicking<00:01:29.280> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
see it's a simple matter of flicking to

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.910 
see it's a simple matter of flicking to
a<00:01:29.399> full<00:01:29.880> screen<00:01:30.180> slide<00:01:30.689> view<00:01:30.899> and<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.799> can

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
a full screen slide view and you can

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.609 
a full screen slide view and you can
change<00:01:32.130> back<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.490> forth<00:01:32.640> between<00:01:33.060> these

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
change back and forth between these

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.600 
change back and forth between these
quite<00:01:34.619> easily<00:01:36.229> now<00:01:37.229> another<00:01:37.560> option<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.429> have

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
quite easily now another option we have

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.730 
quite easily now another option we have
here<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.659> call<00:01:39.810> speaker<00:01:40.200> mode<00:01:40.439> this

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
puts the focus back on the speaker but

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.990 
puts the focus back on the speaker but
at<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> same<00:01:43.200> time<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.679> see<00:01:43.920> which<00:01:44.640> slide

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
at the same time you can see which slide

this<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.929> good<00:01:49.140> if<00:01:49.319> your<00:01:49.619> audience<00:01:49.920> has<00:01:50.190> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
this is good if your audience has a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.800 
this is good if your audience has a
printout<00:01:50.700> perhaps<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.270> PowerPoint

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
it on their own side so they don't it's

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:00.949 
it on their own side so they don't it's
not<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.759> important<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.270> they're<00:02:00.600> able<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
not so important that they're able to

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:02.809 
not so important that they're able to
read<00:02:01.170> what's<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.619> life<00:02:01.860> more<00:02:02.640> than

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
read what's on this life more than

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.340 
read what's on this life more than
they're<00:02:03.000> able<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.299> see<00:02:03.690> what<00:02:03.869> you're<00:02:04.020> saying

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
they're able to see what you're saying

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.120 
they're able to see what you're saying
and<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:05.369> which<00:02:05.520> slide<00:02:05.819> you're<00:02:06.030> referencing

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
and see which slide you're referencing

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.039 
and see which slide you're referencing
our<00:02:08.130> final<00:02:08.519> option<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.940> side<00:02:09.390> by<00:02:09.569> side<00:02:09.840> mode

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
our final option is side by side mode

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.660 
our final option is side by side mode
and<00:02:10.289> basically<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:11.009> gives<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.340> good

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and basically just gives a good

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.820 
and basically just gives a good
full-screen<00:02:12.420> view<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.260> slide<00:02:13.530> you're
