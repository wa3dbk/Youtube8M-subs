color to the inner parts photo edge
pieces<00:00:41.809> they<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:43.340> pretty<00:00:44.340> good<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.690> not

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
pieces they are pretty good and not

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.360 
pieces they are pretty good and not
really<00:00:47.450> loose<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.870> guess<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:50.840> didn't<00:00:52.010> how<00:00:53.010> we

really loose I guess I didn't how we

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
really loose I guess I didn't how we
call<00:00:53.610> using<00:00:53.850> any<00:00:54.120> glue<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.750> only<00:00:55.020> glue<00:00:55.289> i<00:00:55.320> use

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
kind of hard to secretly see when get

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.429 
kind of hard to secretly see when get
some<00:01:04.769> light<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.420> back<00:01:07.080> piece

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
some light on there so that back piece

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.100 
some light on there so that back piece
so<00:01:07.860> that's<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.360> first<00:01:09.600> time<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.900> work

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
so that's this is the first time we work

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.490 
so that's this is the first time we work
with<00:01:10.350> them<00:01:11.990> photo<00:01:12.990> edge<00:01:13.200> pieces<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.320> what

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
with them photo edge pieces and so what

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.600 
with them photo edge pieces and so what
some<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.100> them<00:01:17.189> were<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> little<00:01:18.020> slanted<00:01:19.610> you

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
know I want to be really anal about it I

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.350 
know I want to be really anal about it I
could<00:01:22.770> tell<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.420> I'm<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.720> gonna<00:01:24.869> leave<00:01:25.049> it

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
could tell but I'm just gonna leave it

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.649 
could tell but I'm just gonna leave it
it's<00:01:27.360> not<00:01:27.630> very<00:01:28.439> noticeable<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.810> she<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.470> see

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
it's not very noticeable and she can see

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.640 
it's not very noticeable and she can see
some<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:35.340> detailing<00:01:36.020> pen<00:01:37.020> aligning<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
some of the detailing pen aligning and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.100 
some of the detailing pen aligning and
things<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:41.460> was<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:42.060> pain<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.899> get

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
things like that so it was a pain to get

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.719 
things like that so it was a pain to get
Sony<00:01:44.240> those<00:01:45.240> white<00:01:45.570> pieces<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> armor

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
Sony those white pieces in to the armor

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.200 
Sony those white pieces in to the armor
because<00:01:48.180> they<00:01:48.689> don't<00:01:48.869> really<00:01:49.229> fit<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.799> well

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
because they don't really fit that well

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:58.280 
because they don't really fit that well
so<00:01:51.210> again<00:01:51.720> some<00:01:53.210> shaving<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.540> stuff<00:01:56.479> so

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
so again some shaving and stuff so

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.160 
so again some shaving and stuff so
so<00:01:59.810> yeah<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> didn't<00:02:01.200> get<00:02:01.350> too<00:02:01.710> far<00:02:02.990> bring<00:02:03.990> this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
so yeah I didn't get too far bring this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.900 
so yeah I didn't get too far bring this
together<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:06.230> trying<00:02:07.230> to<00:02:07.470> detail<00:02:08.460> it<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.820> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
together and trying to detail it at the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.160 
together and trying to detail it at the
same<00:02:09.119> time<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.990> take<00:02:10.200> some<00:02:10.229> time<00:02:10.910> I

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
same time it's going to take some time I

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.550 
same time it's going to take some time I
also<00:02:13.170> ordered<00:02:15.080> some<00:02:16.580> resistors<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:18.330> fix<00:02:18.600> that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
also ordered some resistors to fix that

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.820 
also ordered some resistors to fix that
led<00:02:20.600> hopefully<00:02:21.600> if<00:02:21.720> we<00:02:21.750> here<00:02:22.020> tomorrow<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:22.710> I

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
led hopefully if we here tomorrow so I

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.350 
led hopefully if we here tomorrow so I
can<00:02:22.920> start<00:02:23.370> testing<00:02:23.970> out<00:02:24.270> fix<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:26.360> but

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
can start testing out fix it so but

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.420 
can start testing out fix it so but
anyway<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:30.660> kind<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:34.430> what

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
anyway this is what kind of like what

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:45.380 
anyway this is what kind of like what
the<00:02:36.800> LED<00:02:39.740> so<00:02:43.130> decides<00:02:44.130> flicking<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.970> little<00:02:45.240> bit

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
the LED so decides flicking a little bit

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.770 
the LED so decides flicking a little bit
cuz<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.840> connection<00:02:46.490> from<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.780> backpack

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
cuz the connection from the backpack

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.110 
cuz the connection from the backpack
armor<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.730> that<00:02:50.730> side<00:02:51.440> but<00:02:52.440> looks<00:02:53.090> okay<00:02:54.090> right

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
armor to that side but looks okay right

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.650 
armor to that side but looks okay right
now<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:56.180> yeah<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:57.770> bright<00:02:58.770> um<00:02:59.390> yeah<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.450> is

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
now so yeah it's bright um yeah it is

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
now so yeah it's bright um yeah it is
brighter<00:03:01.080> than<00:03:02.090> even<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.330> think<00:03:03.390> my<00:03:03.780> two<00:03:04.530> one

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
brighter than even I think my two one

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:15.729 
brighter than even I think my two one
for<00:03:04.920> my<00:03:05.100> master<00:03:05.400> gray<00:03:07.130> new<00:03:08.130> condom<00:03:08.850> burka<00:03:10.489> but

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.530 

get<00:03:16.739> some<00:03:17.810> beautiful<00:03:18.890> so<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:20.730> see<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.090> LEDs

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
get some beautiful so you see the LEDs

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.479 
get some beautiful so you see the LEDs
go<00:03:21.570> on<00:03:23.540> but<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.930> video<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.410> just<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.920> show<00:03:26.280> the

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
go on but this video is just to show the

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.009 
go on but this video is just to show the
armor<00:03:27.000> pieces<00:03:27.239> are<00:03:27.630> kind<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.230> done<00:03:29.090> slowly<00:03:30.090> but

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
armor pieces are kind of done slowly but

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:39.380 
armor pieces are kind of done slowly but
surely<00:03:33.709> again<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.920> photo<00:03:35.190> h<00:03:35.489> points<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:39.209> can

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
surely again the photo h points you can

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.780 
surely again the photo h points you can
see<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.780> kinda<00:03:40.080> hard<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.380> see<00:03:40.410> probably<00:03:41.010> and

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
see it kinda hard to see probably and
