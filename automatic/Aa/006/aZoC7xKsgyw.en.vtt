sure what we do next is the right thing
because<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:30.080> know<00:02:30.200> if<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.650> don't<00:02:30.890> do<00:02:31.100> well

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
because you know if you don't do well

because you know if you don't do well
the<00:02:31.580> next<00:02:31.790> thing<00:02:31.910> around<00:02:32.210> it<00:02:32.450> could<00:02:32.630> be<00:02:32.750> very

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
the next thing around it could be very

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.260 
the next thing around it could be very
difficult<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.680> recover<00:02:33.830> from<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.490> so<00:02:34.670> we're

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
difficult to recover from it so we're

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.200 
difficult to recover from it so we're
just<00:02:35.300> taking<00:02:35.570> our<00:02:35.840> time<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.880> we're<00:02:37.880> having<00:02:38.150> a
