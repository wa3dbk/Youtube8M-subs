 in all countries but it is not unfounded 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.689
 and so it's important that 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.669
 indeed rank the mark the difference between the concept of skills such

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.079
 or in the background 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.089
 the notion of competence has replaced that of qualification

 precariousness burst flexibility at the expense of these workers that's 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.980
 a reality 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.470
 for you then we can use the concept of skills management of 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.200
 human resources against people 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.780
 at the same time or even in the corporate world the recognition 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.720
 the concept of competence is an acknowledgment of the complexity of 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.090
 work even low-skilled work 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.610
 from the intelligence to the work of all the workers even those who line

 everybody 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.700
 fingers appreciated situations that are not in the manual that are not 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.650
 standards 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.550
 everyone must take the risk to think even in the works 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.300
 relatively simple 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.120
 contrary to what is often believed 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.120
 and therefore recognize competence at work 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.410

 skills 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.260
 from this point of view, the school pursues the same fight

 change the society and is part of it you must not make her responsible 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.270
 but it is obviously not necessary to ask him for the cross 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.140
 and that's why it's very important who actually 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.930

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:20.449
 refers to an ability to analyze situations 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:24.009
 to understand where does the situation come from what's the problem what are the 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.149
