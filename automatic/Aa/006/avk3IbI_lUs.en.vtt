alright now time for the archer Queen

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.530 
alright now time for the archer Queen
and<00:04:02.100> it<00:04:02.610> looks<00:04:02.760> like<00:04:02.940> there's<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.239> lot<00:04:03.360> of

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
and it looks like there's a lot of

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.390 
and it looks like there's a lot of
Splash<00:04:03.840> Damage<00:04:03.870> on<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.560> upper<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.160> right

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
Splash Damage on the upper and right

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.310 
Splash Damage on the upper and right
side<00:04:05.670> so<00:04:05.940> we're<00:04:06.090> going<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.269> attack<00:04:06.570> from<00:04:06.840> the

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
side so we're going to attack from the

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.380 
side so we're going to attack from the
bottom<00:04:08.130> left<00:04:08.910> side<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:10.220> I<00:04:11.239> think<00:04:12.239> we<00:04:12.329> should

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
bottom left side and I think we should

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.520 
bottom left side and I think we should
be<00:04:12.859> able<00:04:13.859> to<00:04:14.100> avoid<00:04:14.310> all<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.640> splash<00:04:14.910> towers

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
be able to avoid all the splash towers

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.650 
be able to avoid all the splash towers
these<00:04:16.530> walls<00:04:16.799> here<00:04:17.070> are<00:04:17.130> pretty<00:04:17.850> strong<00:04:18.329> but

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
these walls here are pretty strong but

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.080 
these walls here are pretty strong but
luckily<00:04:18.930> we<00:04:19.200> have<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.620> jump<00:04:19.890> spell<00:04:20.190> so<00:04:20.970> we

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
luckily we have a jump spell so we

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.730 
luckily we have a jump spell so we
shouldn't<00:04:21.330> have<00:04:21.390> any<00:04:21.510> problems

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
shouldn't have any problems

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.820 
shouldn't have any problems

where I wanted to well at least the

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.040

I'm<00:05:08.639> gonna<00:05:08.940> drop<00:05:09.210> a<00:05:09.270> jump<00:05:09.570> spell<00:05:09.780> here

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
I'm gonna drop a jump spell here

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.540 
I'm gonna drop a jump spell here
hopefully<00:05:10.560> after<00:05:10.830> she<00:05:10.979> takes<00:05:11.160> out<00:05:11.370> these

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
hopefully after she takes out these

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.249 
hopefully after she takes out these
buildings<00:05:11.970> she<00:05:12.539> was<00:05:12.630> gonna<00:05:12.720> jump<00:05:13.020> over<00:05:13.110> the

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
buildings she was gonna jump over the

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.390 
buildings she was gonna jump over the
walls<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:13.979> I<00:05:14.669> think<00:05:14.970> she<00:05:15.360> will<00:05:15.570> because<00:05:15.930> the

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
walls and I think she will because the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.249 
walls and I think she will because the
closest<00:05:17.400> buildings<00:05:18.000> are<00:05:18.300> in<00:05:18.330> the<00:05:18.570> center

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
closest buildings are in the center

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.260 
closest buildings are in the center
she's<00:05:19.889> definitely<00:05:20.400> taking<00:05:20.669> her<00:05:20.729> time<00:05:20.909> taking

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
she's definitely taking her time taking

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.670 
she's definitely taking her time taking
out<00:05:21.360> these<00:05:21.479> buildings<00:05:21.870> though<00:05:21.990> I'm<00:05:22.259> hoping
