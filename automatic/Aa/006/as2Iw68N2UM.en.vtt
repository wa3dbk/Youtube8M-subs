00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.100 

fantastic<00:01:51.230> exhaust<00:01:51.620> oh<00:01:51.890> the

fantastic exhaust oh the

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.280 
fantastic exhaust oh the
see<00:01:53.290> flowers<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.980> exhaust<00:01:54.220> so<00:01:55.140> while<00:01:56.140> it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
see flowers in the exhaust so while it

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.200 
see flowers in the exhaust so while it
sounds<00:01:56.590> great<00:01:56.800> on<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.100> racetrack<00:01:57.310> if<00:01:58.090> you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
sounds great on the racetrack if you

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.600 
sounds great on the racetrack if you
drive<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.570> quietly<00:01:58.930> on<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.260> road<00:01:59.440> the<00:02:00.280> sound

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
drive it quietly on the road the sound

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.270 
drive it quietly on the road the sound
is<00:02:00.820> much<00:02:01.000> more<00:02:01.270> so

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:14.440 

down<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.180> right-hander<00:02:05.479> third<00:02:06.200> gear

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.970 

short<00:02:15.200> straight<00:02:15.470> into<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.180> final<00:02:17.180> curve

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
short straight into the final curve

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.680 
short straight into the final curve
we've<00:02:18.980> modified<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.569> front<00:02:20.569> suspension

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
we've modified the front suspension

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.040 
we've modified the front suspension
uprights<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.769> make<00:02:21.950> them<00:02:22.250> stiffer<00:02:22.930> giving<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
uprights to make them stiffer giving the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.830 
uprights to make them stiffer giving the
car<00:02:24.260> increased<00:02:24.879> precision<00:02:25.879> as<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:27.170> limit

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
car increased precision as a limit

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.720 
car increased precision as a limit
okay<00:02:29.349> so<00:02:29.410> punching<00:02:29.980> out<00:02:30.160> onto<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.580> main

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
okay so punching out onto the main

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.670 
okay so punching out onto the main
straight<00:02:31.030> at<00:02:31.180> 40<00:02:31.540> now<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:32.290> can<00:02:32.440> really<00:02:32.590> feel

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
straight at 40 now you can really feel

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.190 
straight at 40 now you can really feel
the<00:02:32.860> benefit<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.670> increased<00:02:34.060> power<00:02:34.989> and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
the benefit of the increased power and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.450 
the benefit of the increased power and
torque<00:02:36.120> 550<00:02:37.120> horsepower
