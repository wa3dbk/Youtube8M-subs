00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
I just saw it let you guys know because

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.580 
I just saw it let you guys know because
it<00:02:03.180> was<00:02:03.270> only<00:02:03.420> announced<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:04.020> Twitter<00:02:04.290> which

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it was only announced on Twitter which

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.690 
it was only announced on Twitter which
was<00:02:04.740> kind<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:04.979> strange<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.399> thought<00:02:05.520> we'd

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
was kind of strange I thought we'd

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.520 
was kind of strange I thought we'd
probably<00:02:05.969> drop<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> video<00:02:06.869> or<00:02:07.110> something<00:02:07.320> like

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
probably drop a video or something like

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.990 
probably drop a video or something like
that<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.920> know<00:02:08.069> because<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.670> think<00:02:08.729> they<00:02:08.940> were

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
that you know because I think they were

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.249 
that you know because I think they were
talking<00:02:09.149> about<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.629> little<00:02:09.840> while<00:02:10.020> so

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
talking about it for a little while so

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.300 
talking about it for a little while so
it<00:02:10.319> would<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.500> been<00:02:10.590> nice<00:02:10.739> for<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:11.009> video<00:02:11.280> to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it would have been nice for a video to

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.250 
it would have been nice for a video to
be<00:02:11.459> dropped<00:02:11.819> at<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.000> same<00:02:12.209> time<00:02:12.450> but<00:02:12.720> they're

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260

lot<00:03:45.880> more<00:03:45.910> people<00:03:46.300> in<00:03:46.390> than<00:03:46.570> usual<00:03:46.959> so<00:03:47.140> that

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
lot more people in than usual so that

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.870 
lot more people in than usual so that
was<00:03:47.440> crazy<00:03:47.740> I<00:03:48.070> try<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.400> keep<00:03:48.520> doing<00:03:48.730> that<00:03:48.820> I

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
was crazy I try to keep doing that I

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.250 
was crazy I try to keep doing that I
want<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.060> stream<00:03:49.240> a<00:03:49.270> lot<00:03:49.420> more<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.990> I<00:03:50.200> think

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
this is a good chance to do that so

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.370
