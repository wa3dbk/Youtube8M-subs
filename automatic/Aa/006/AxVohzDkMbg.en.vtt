obviously there's a 90 degree angle sign
above<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.060> door<00:00:03.210> so<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.750> square<00:00:03.990> has<00:00:04.170> for<00:00:04.560> the

2 1 3 there we go I've been going
through<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.730> next<00:00:17.910> level<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.480> one's<00:00:18.690> very

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
through the next level this one's very

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.779 
through the next level this one's very
simple<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.350> define<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.980> left<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.430> pick<00:00:20.640> up

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
simple to define to the left and pick up

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.240 
simple to define to the left and pick up
the<00:00:20.910> rock<00:00:21.140> select<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.380> your<00:00:22.500> inventory<00:00:22.740> and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
throw it at that glass you'll see the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.890 
throw it at that glass you'll see the
pattern<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.260> 7<00:00:25.830> 8<00:00:26.039> 3<00:00:26.430> 4<00:00:26.820> enter<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.689> into<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
pattern is 7 8 3 4 enter that into the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.720 
pattern is 7 8 3 4 enter that into the
keypad<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.560> you'll<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.400> your<00:00:29.429> way

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
keypad and you'll be on your way

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.920

so<00:00:30.140> 7<00:00:32.600> 8<00:00:33.600> 3<00:00:34.260> 4<00:00:35.300> you're<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.630> next<00:00:36.809> level

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
so 7 8 3 4 you're up to the next level

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.139 
so 7 8 3 4 you're up to the next level
if<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.950> level<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.250> very<00:00:38.309> easy<00:00:38.640> pick<00:00:38.910> up<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
if this level is very easy pick up the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.990 
if this level is very easy pick up the
ice<00:00:39.270> tray<00:00:39.660> selected<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> inventory<00:00:41.000> and

ice tray selected in the inventory and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.119 
ice tray selected in the inventory and
put<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.270> under<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> tap<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.800> turn<00:00:43.980> them

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
put it under the tap and to turn them

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.299 
put it under the tap and to turn them
into<00:00:44.250> ice<00:00:44.399> cubes<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.059> want<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.739> press<00:00:46.739> minus<00:00:47.070> 0

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
into ice cubes you want to press minus 0

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.920 
into ice cubes you want to press minus 0
which<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.610> freezing<00:00:47.969> point<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.420> once<00:00:48.870> again

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
which is freezing point if once again

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.290 
which is freezing point if once again
this<00:00:49.200> level<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.559> very<00:00:49.590> simple<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.149> do<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
this level is very simple just do the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.360 
this level is very simple just do the
one<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.600> Left<00:00:51.809> first<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
one on the Left first and do it on the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.670 
one on the Left first and do it on the
right<00:00:53.520> second<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.449> door<00:00:54.719> opens<00:00:55.079> if<00:00:55.379> in

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
right second and then door opens if in

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.709 
right second and then door opens if in
this<00:00:56.340> level<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:56.760> follow<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> pattern<00:00:57.539> that

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
this level just follow the pattern that

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.680 
this level just follow the pattern that
I<00:00:57.809> do<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.530> start<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.160> left<00:00:59.460> go<00:01:00.420> all<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> way

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
I do so start at the left go all the way

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.959 
I do so start at the left go all the way
down<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:01.890> from<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.489> go<00:01:02.760> all<00:01:02.789> the
