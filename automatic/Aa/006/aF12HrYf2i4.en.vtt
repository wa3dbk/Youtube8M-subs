Fahrenheit<00:00:31.070> just<00:00:31.279> about<00:00:31.460> right<00:00:31.700> on<00:00:31.849> the

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
Fahrenheit just about right on the

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.810 
Fahrenheit just about right on the
button<00:00:32.149> so<00:00:32.419> 10<00:00:33.230> degrees<00:00:33.500> F<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:34.309> it<00:00:34.520> was<00:00:34.610> on<00:00:34.730> the

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
button so 10 degrees F and it was on the

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.270 
button so 10 degrees F and it was on the
solar<00:00:35.030> cooking<00:00:35.390> group<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.750> other<00:00:35.870> day<00:00:36.160> on<00:00:37.160> the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
solar cooking group the other day on the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.830 
solar cooking group the other day on the
website<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:37.910> saw<00:00:37.940> someone<00:00:38.420> answer<00:00:38.750> a

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
website and I saw someone answer a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.710 
website and I saw someone answer a
question<00:00:39.700> if<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:40.880> global<00:00:41.270> Sun<00:00:41.510> Oven<00:00:42.340> was

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
question if the global Sun Oven was

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.370 
question if the global Sun Oven was
functional<00:00:44.720> in<00:00:44.930> cold<00:00:45.260> climates<00:00:46.160> well<00:00:46.520> I<00:00:47.390> think

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
functional in cold climates well I think

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.319 
functional in cold climates well I think
the<00:00:48.650> specific<00:00:49.310> question<00:00:49.670> was<00:00:49.820> would<00:00:50.000> it<00:00:50.060> work

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
the specific question was would it work

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.340 
the specific question was would it work
in<00:00:50.800> say<00:00:51.800> mid-teens<00:00:52.610> Fahrenheit<00:00:53.510> well<00:00:53.750> 10

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
in say mid-teens Fahrenheit well 10

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.220 
in say mid-teens Fahrenheit well 10
degrees<00:00:54.650> I<00:00:54.860> guess<00:00:55.040> that's<00:00:55.280> mid-teens<00:00:56.230> anyway

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
degrees I guess that's mid-teens anyway

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.630 
degrees I guess that's mid-teens anyway
we'll<00:00:57.380> take<00:00:57.530> a<00:00:57.560> walk<00:00:57.620> over<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.250> oven<00:00:58.370> I've

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
we'll take a walk over to the oven I've

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.370 
we'll take a walk over to the oven I've
had<00:00:58.760> it<00:00:58.880> out<00:00:59.030> for<00:00:59.060> about<00:00:59.329> an<00:00:59.480> hour<00:00:59.630> hour<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:00.290> a

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
had it out for about an hour hour and a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.430 
had it out for about an hour hour and a
half<00:01:00.820> it's<00:01:01.820> just<00:01:02.390> about<00:01:02.600> 12:30<00:01:03.200> in<00:01:03.380> the

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
half it's just about 12:30 in the

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.830 
half it's just about 12:30 in the
afternoon<00:01:04.420> as<00:01:05.420> I<00:01:05.479> say<00:01:05.720> On<00:01:05.869> January<00:01:06.079> 15th<00:01:06.890> and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
afternoon as I say On January 15th and

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.980 
afternoon as I say On January 15th and
beautiful<00:01:08.840> wabash<00:01:09.200> een<00:01:09.380> northern<00:01:10.070> ontario

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
beautiful wabash een northern ontario

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.560 
beautiful wabash een northern ontario
and<00:01:11.990> let's<00:01:12.259> look<00:01:12.439> in<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.649> oven<00:01:12.770> here<00:01:13.479> look<00:01:14.479> at

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
and let's look in the oven here look at

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.809 
and let's look in the oven here look at
that<00:01:15.850> 320<00:01:16.850> degrees<00:01:17.149> Fahrenheit<00:01:17.719> so<00:01:18.460> an<00:01:19.460> answer

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819 
that 320 degrees Fahrenheit so an answer

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:21.669 
that 320 degrees Fahrenheit so an answer
to<00:01:19.909> that<00:01:19.939> question<00:01:20.509> and<00:01:20.810> this<00:01:21.200> isn't<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.530> goal

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
to that question and this isn't the goal

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.090 
to that question and this isn't the goal
of<00:01:21.770> global<00:01:21.920> Sun<00:01:22.609> Oven<00:01:23.270> this<00:01:23.869> is<00:01:24.049> a<00:01:24.079> 60<00:01:24.710> 30<00:01:24.859> of
