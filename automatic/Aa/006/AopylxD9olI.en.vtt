00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.960
 sheet that I found in my backyard. 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.489
 House 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.960
 salt with salt crystals a clove 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.730
 Believe if you want this is in your 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.090
 face because of a broken form 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.070
 concrete and the pixels of the mobile screen 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.050
 displays a white image 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.250
 we will be able to increase the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.950
 power of the layer our cell phone 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.610
 using only three times a tape 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.860
 Crepe 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.899
 a hair clip and one is bought in 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.530
 any 99 store with the first 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.079
 people will need to take the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.140
 laser is a lens inside and for that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.360
 you may be using your hands or 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.479
 pliers and how are you? 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.880
 using good pliers of nozzle 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.250
 The first thing you 'll do is take the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.040
 and here it is 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.080
 as you can see in a search this 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.600
 black bad she then goes loose 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.030
 turn counterclockwise use 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.640
 Mary Kate as recommended to us 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.220
 will reach the lens 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.220
 look here in addition this lens that the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.439
 People want to use it as she takes it. 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.720
 have a coin and also the rest of the laser 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.619
 guard ready in case you need for projects 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.110
 future 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.540
 is now have good clip f group is 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.360
 simply to serve as support for 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.060
 then you learn the lens of this 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.909
 form the support 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.280
 There you pick up your cell phone and 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.280
 lens on the bed exactly 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.910
 then with a piece of tape 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.660
 I recommend crepe tape because it does not leave 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:12.530
 glue on fixed cell phone or stroll scrambled 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:15.830
 place a staple now personal let's 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.420
 test to see if it's good and I'll use it 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.700
 a coin is for us to see the details 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.070
 of the currency and for what it is very legal 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.270
 that 's the way it is without a photo 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:29.000
 but when I get closer I can 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.580
 observe all currency details 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.170
 You take awesome photo frames only. 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.030
 used disease only 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.950
 then just take the tape and save for 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.010
 next time you pull you want to take 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.660
 amazing photos with your cell phone 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.090
 And let's take a peek at the next one. 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.550
 project that is already under construction and is 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.800
 people who like music 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.739
 I believe it's easier pedalboard 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.400
 to make Sunday for you to do on 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.400
