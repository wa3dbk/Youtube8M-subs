00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.410
 hello good to see how you know everything 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.360
 installous because he has died and no longer 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.240
 we can be able to download applications and 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.800
 for from this page and well then 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.540
 you are always asking me for alternatives 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.849
 etcetera etcetera I in its day I made a 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.440
 video tutorial dv sar here you have the 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.150
 link in case you want to see what the 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.710
 truth to me personally nothing very well 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.390
 but I'm making comments 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.699
 that heavy teapot files 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.619
 etcetera as a game for example not 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.720
 just download it and the truth is 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.750
 connection speed because it leaves a little 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.399
 what to wish well we are already looking for and 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.110
 There are several programs, these are 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.660
 those that I have to download crystals 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.850
 as you see now to move any voucher of these 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.149
 Caesar and pastor who is also very 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.969
 interesting and both and fun box I'm going to 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.460
 make a video to be able to use it 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.969
 because the problem that this has 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.879
 program is that it is in Chinese vale 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.920
 man intuitively you will be able to 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.530
 handle perfectly but well there 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.509
 some options that I would like to what 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.430
 you would have and also say that and fun 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.440
 box scaled us from any repository 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.470
 with which today we are going to get into 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.390
 newspapers 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.580
 the repository that you have to download 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.410
 well we started the first thing we have 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.360
 what to do as always we are going to get 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.650
 in cirÃ­a obviously if you are watching this 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.960
 it's because your phone is with the 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.550
 jailbreak if you do not have it then you can 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.500
 turn off the video perfectly because no 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.970
 it's going to be worth nothing to you once 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.310
 let's go in cydia 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.960
 We will leave the main menu you see 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.180
 how it came up in addition to this video 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.310
 you can look at these are the s hs h that I 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.200
 I have stored there you have all good 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.060
 with which I can go to any god 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.350
 that is available there is worth it because 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.390
 Many people ask me what they want to spend 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.030
 from 6 1 to 5 and so on, well, you have 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.770
 have those shs stored in one 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.930
 middle of the topic and what we have to 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.840
 do is add a repository we 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.000
 let's go as always to handle 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.670
 sources and we're going to add this 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.930
 repository that we see below the whole www 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.180
 good http center to apt point 178 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.070
 dotcom bar what are you seeing there 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.530
 ok for the video if you want to be able 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.110
 add the repo and once you already 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.930
 let's have the repository installed 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.819
 we're just going to go find we're going to 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.159
 give it from the beginning 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.260
 and fun box bay as you see is already with 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.700
 called by the vee because I already have it 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.349
 installed well up there all right 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.290
 truth as you choose the whole description 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.639
 in japan from the cetera well because a 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.819
 Once we have our 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:36.590
 device the icon of the fan box that 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.989
 we have here in charge and we are going to open it 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.629
 and well, I already tell you the problem of 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.220
 This is because it is in Japanese, 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.080
 not really do not know because 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.060
 I understand but well I tell you that it is 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.010
 very intuitive and how good this has 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.870
 unlike using and the other that I am 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.330
 I of shepherds is that this is not going to 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.519
 need to put any type of captcha 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.379
 it's not going to advertise you either 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.810
 I really like it is the one that most 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.640
 like and as a final point is that the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.010
 download that has the truth is pretty 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.780
 quickly, well, we are going to guide 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.519
 because here I imagine that they will be the most 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.970
 highlighted the popular and so on 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.489
 etcetera if we are going to be lash 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.470
 Well, imagine, let's imagine what 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.180
 will then be updates that you can 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.160
 have but economic that I'm not interested 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.340
 is the magnifying glass in which we are going to 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.030
 to be able to find the application that we 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.670
 we want to put for example 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.770
 the most famous whatsapp 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.720
 and as you will see, he is already there to 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.849
 can install it simply we have to 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.670
 give the little eyelash this blue that I imagine 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.410
 which will be download voucher and once 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.940
 we downloaded it, it's going to the 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.640
 download tab that is the star 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.050
 is here and we see it the truth is that I 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.239
 I would like to see how good speed is with 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.430
 that downloads that is very very considerable 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.410
 look at 360 obviously this is going to depend 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.569
 of the taste you have but good you look at 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.830
 the speed that is valid if we pass the 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.410
 finger on the right we can erase 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.989
 that yes no to put will be erasing ya what 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.610
 I say, in fact, we give it and well, this 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.140
 it's also a game that lowers me where 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.420
 test to see if it worked and 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.680
 it really worked, it has not 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.500
 liked the game visited but 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.780
 well the objective of the program is that 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.340
 well as you will see in the tab below 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.940
 where the dots are, this will be in 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.160
 settings 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.560
 all this is intuitive but good , and 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.910
 I have tried and it is how it is and everything that 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.479
 is activated because it means that 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.080
 automatically install that you the 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.060
 download automatically etc 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.069
 so do not touch anything in setting 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.930
 dance etc for Chinese or Japanese and what 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:34.120
 you can set the tastes but good 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.219
 I would like you simply to try it 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.469
 something a bit in particular just 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:40.689
 with the search engine and good for you to see 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:42.250
 the speed that you can also put me 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:44.080
 in the comments if you go down some 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.699
 very heavy game that I know the cipf to 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.099
 this one that was going down all the people 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.509
 to see if it really works already 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.699
 that for not doing the test I'm not going to 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.990
 download now a gig and well then it's the 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.139
 program already explained the 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.090
 repository there is and fun box me 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.759
 I would like you to try it and well then 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.039
