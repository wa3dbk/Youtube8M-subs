when making their own garage I kind of

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.310 
when making their own garage I kind of
do<00:00:54.530> it<00:00:54.620> here<00:00:54.859> and<00:00:55.719> make<00:00:56.719> a<00:00:56.750> good<00:00:56.989> quality

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
first step in creating one of these

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.750 
first step in creating one of these
decoys<00:01:05.290> is<00:01:05.500> make<00:01:05.680> yourself<00:01:05.800> a<00:01:06.130> template

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
decoys is make yourself a template

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
for the decoy and then I just kind of go

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.980 
for the decoy and then I just kind of go
from<00:01:21.130> there<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.370> draw<00:01:21.640> them<00:01:21.790> myself<00:01:22.000> they're

and<00:01:51.970> I<00:01:52.780> just<00:01:53.290> use<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.500> pencil<00:01:53.860> and<00:01:54.130> draw<00:01:54.190> a

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
and I just use a pencil and draw a

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.820 
and I just use a pencil and draw a
pattern<00:01:54.640> down<00:01:54.970> I<00:01:55.240> like<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:56.080> go<00:01:56.200> ahead<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.740> on

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
pattern down I like to go ahead and on

pattern down I like to go ahead and on
at<00:01:56.950> least<00:01:57.270> one<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.420> patterns<00:01:58.869> for

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
at least one of the patterns for

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.320 
at least one of the patterns for
whatever<00:01:59.290> species<00:01:59.680> I'm<00:02:00.070> doing<00:02:00.430> I'd<00:02:01.030> like<00:02:01.210> to

whatever species I'm doing I'd like to

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.820 
whatever species I'm doing I'd like to
go<00:02:01.420> ahead<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.780> lay<00:02:01.869> out<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.170> feather<00:02:02.380> package

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
go ahead and lay out the feather package

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.850 
go ahead and lay out the feather package
it<00:02:02.920> must<00:02:03.070> be<00:02:03.190> quite<00:02:03.399> as<00:02:03.520> detailed<00:02:03.700> as<00:02:04.090> this<00:02:04.210> but

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
it's good to kind of know where you want

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.950 
it's good to kind of know where you want
to<00:02:07.539> go<00:02:07.690> with<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:07.990> decoy<00:02:08.380> before<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:08.950> start

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
to go with the decoy before you start

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.440 
to go with the decoy before you start
otherwise<00:02:10.960> each<00:02:11.920> decoy<00:02:12.460> look<00:02:12.790> different<00:02:13.240> and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
otherwise each decoy look different and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.650 
otherwise each decoy look different and
your<00:02:13.960> quality<00:02:14.380> from<00:02:14.950> equal<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.370> decoy<00:02:15.730> whereas

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
your quality from equal to decoy whereas

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.120 
your quality from equal to decoy whereas
if<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.930> go<00:02:17.050> ahead<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.410> do<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.680> you'll<00:02:17.980> know

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
if you go ahead and do this you'll know

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.920 
if you go ahead and do this you'll know
when<00:02:18.340> you're<00:02:18.459> 22<00:02:18.760> decoys<00:02:19.150> going<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.540> look<00:02:19.660> like

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
when you're 22 decoys going to look like

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.080 
when you're 22 decoys going to look like
in<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.260> home<00:02:20.470> it'll<00:02:21.250> look<00:02:21.370> more<00:02:21.580> like<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.819> flock

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
in the home it'll look more like a flock

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.890 
in the home it'll look more like a flock
of<00:02:22.120> ducks<00:02:24.030> alright<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.150> next<00:02:25.209> step<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.780> going

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
of ducks alright the next step is going

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.930 
of ducks alright the next step is going
to<00:02:25.959> be<00:02:26.050> delay<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.500> or<00:02:26.800> patterns<00:02:27.220> out<00:02:27.459> on<00:02:27.730> your

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
to be delay you or patterns out on your

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.900 
to be delay you or patterns out on your
piece<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.330> plywood<00:02:29.520> try<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.580> get<00:02:30.730> them<00:02:30.850> as

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
piece of plywood try to get them as

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.180 
piece of plywood try to get them as
close<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.720> line<00:02:31.930> as<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.350> can<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.830> save<00:02:33.040> as

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
close to the line as you can to save as

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.040 
close to the line as you can to save as
much<00:02:33.340> wood<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:33.910> get<00:02:34.090> more<00:02:34.270> decoys<00:02:34.690> out<00:02:34.900> of

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
much wood so you get more decoys out of

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.390 
much wood so you get more decoys out of
each<00:02:35.170> sheet<00:02:35.530> but<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:37.060> just<00:02:38.050> use<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> pencil<00:02:38.830> that

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
each sheet but I just use a pencil that

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.890 
each sheet but I just use a pencil that
I<00:02:39.459> think<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.760> like<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.030> do<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.330> whichever<00:02:40.660> side

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
I think I like to do is whichever side

I think I like to do is whichever side
you've<00:02:41.080> got<00:02:41.230> your<00:02:41.380> pattern<00:02:41.560> on<00:02:42.069> use<00:02:42.340> the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
you've got your pattern on use the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.510 
you've got your pattern on use the
opposite<00:02:43.030> side<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:44.230> trace<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.310> way<00:02:45.400> if

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
opposite side to trace so that way if

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
all right now get my patterns laid out

before<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.020> start<00:03:08.110> cutting<00:03:08.530> make<00:03:08.830> sure

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
before you start cutting make sure

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.320 
before you start cutting make sure
there's<00:03:09.130> ninety<00:03:09.340> spots<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:09.819> missed<00:03:10.060> or<00:03:10.239> any
