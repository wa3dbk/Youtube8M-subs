 paranormal occurring in mexico tourists 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.450
 stop to start braking 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.690
 the goal in the Saints shirt on top of the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.119
 vehicle building front vehicle is 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.240
 what is the correct procedure the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.340
 correct procedure is you use the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.590
 depth view 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.830
 the mac is this your good marcel is the vision of 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.680
 depth that option you do not 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.200
 you are only observing the vehicle that is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.420
 the front of the vehicle but the vehicle 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.509
 ahead of what is ahead of 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.690
 other vehicles and front buses are 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:12.300
 there you have visibility for this 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:14.130
 and also how much 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.720
 brake 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.030
 the right technician 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.520
 decree while the vehicle is in the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.140
 front, ie the vehicles in front of the 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.840
 vehicle in front of you and start 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.580
 the braking you check the vehicle only 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.480
 slowing down or slowing down 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.740
 speed is stopping at is you should 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.690
 also start braking here because the 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.810
 first because you are going to have a space 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.300
 to go through braking 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.310
 bigger than you would have if you went there 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.770
 on top of the vehicle 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.290
 the president to have his other front 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.819
 thing is that is the key point now it's 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.910
 all key points 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:05.190
 when you step on the brake the lamp there is 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.900
 from the brake to the brake light with the 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:13.709
 stop it light up then as soon as possible 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.580
 you rise to stop health is better 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:20.610
 for the driver who comes after you 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.190
 so if you brake before you are 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.940
 warning the driver to come behind 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.330
 you 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.040
 well before the traffic is stopping 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.040
 I do not need to turn off the alert because the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.310
 alert you only use in case of 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.440
 emergency traffic stopped a further 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.000
 emergency so you can only really 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.330
 use the light stop lights or 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.330

 Well then you only refused then you 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.540
 ideal is that you start braking before 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.990

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.020
