bike shops and kind of figuring out what

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.190 
bike shops and kind of figuring out what
a<00:00:25.710> custom<00:00:26.160> frame<00:00:26.340> builder<00:00:26.759> was<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.660> had

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
a custom frame builder was and I had

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.409 
a custom frame builder was and I had
always<00:00:28.349> enjoyed<00:00:28.590> machining<00:00:29.430> and<00:00:29.640> welding<00:00:29.700> and

always enjoyed machining and welding and

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.870 
always enjoyed machining and welding and
so<00:00:31.110> sort<00:00:31.770> of<00:00:31.829> put<00:00:31.980> two<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.160> two<00:00:32.430> together<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
so sort of put two and two together and

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.970

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
thought you know I've got to try that

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.090 
thought you know I've got to try that
and<00:00:35.220> it<00:00:35.610> took<00:00:35.760> me<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.970> while<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> get<00:00:36.510> there<00:00:37.470> but

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and it took me a while to get there but

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.280

eventually<00:00:38.370> learned<00:00:39.300> how<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.960> and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
eventually learned how to do that and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.020 
eventually learned how to do that and
started<00:00:40.680> working<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.070> my<00:00:41.220> own<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:41.880> some

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.139 
started working on my own and with some
others<00:00:42.620> builders<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:44.010> kind<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.609> learn<00:00:44.789> stuff

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
others builders to kind of learn stuff

things about building bikes I just love
what<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.730> do<00:00:53.960> it's<00:00:54.960> also<00:00:55.170> really<00:00:55.589> exciting<00:00:56.070> to

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.510 
cyclocross bikes and I'll also been
doing<00:01:17.120> a<00:01:17.210> lot<00:01:17.420> of<00:01:17.720> adventure<00:01:18.230> road<00:01:18.410> bikes<00:01:18.680> do<00:01:19.460> I

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
doing a lot of adventure road bikes do I

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.790 
doing a lot of adventure road bikes do I
do<00:01:19.610> them<00:01:19.820> both<00:01:19.970> in<00:01:20.210> steel<00:01:20.510> and<00:01:20.540> titanium<00:01:21.170> and

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
do them both in steel and titanium and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.300 
do them both in steel and titanium and
the<00:01:22.790> titanium<00:01:23.540> has<00:01:23.720> been<00:01:23.900> a<00:01:24.380> great<00:01:24.830> option

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
the titanium has been a great option

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.340 
the titanium has been a great option
especially<00:01:25.460> for<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.150> kind<00:01:26.900> of<00:01:26.960> bikes<00:01:27.110> like

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
especially for the kind of bikes like

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.570 
especially for the kind of bikes like
that<00:01:27.530> that<00:01:27.800> see<00:01:28.160> some<00:01:28.550> dirt<00:01:29.090> because<00:01:29.600> of<00:01:29.810> the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
that that see some dirt because of the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.980 
that that see some dirt because of the
toughness<00:01:31.580> of<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.730> material<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:32.600> smoothness

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
toughness of the material the smoothness

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.680 
toughness of the material the smoothness
of<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.170> ride<00:01:33.230> and<00:01:34.240> you<00:01:35.240> don't<00:01:35.390> need<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.510> it

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
of the ride and you don't need it it

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.930 
of the ride and you don't need it it
doesn't<00:01:35.840> require<00:01:36.110> any<00:01:36.410> paint<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.580> it's

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
doesn't require any paint so it's

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.980 
doesn't require any paint so it's
totally<00:01:38.420> rust<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.620> corrosion<00:01:39.950> proof<00:01:40.930> just<00:01:41.930> a

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
totally rust and corrosion proof just a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.410 
totally rust and corrosion proof just a
really<00:01:42.410> amazing<00:01:42.710> material<00:01:43.370> I<00:01:43.550> think<00:01:44.060> that

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
really amazing material I think that

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.080 
really amazing material I think that
people<00:01:44.780> who<00:01:45.020> like<00:01:45.710> that<00:01:45.980> sort<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.460> riding<00:01:46.730> the

have the opportunity to be around the
ocean<00:02:54.110> more<00:02:54.320> but<00:02:55.040> really<00:02:55.250> it's<00:02:55.580> this<00:02:55.790> huge

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
ocean more but really it's this huge

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.240 
ocean more but really it's this huge
thing<00:02:56.570> that<00:02:56.600> is<00:02:57.110> such<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.500> huge<00:02:57.739> part<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.130> our

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
thing that is such a huge part of our

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.030 
thing that is such a huge part of our
planet<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.700> yet<00:02:58.880> we're<00:02:59.120> not<00:02:59.570> very<00:03:00.470> engaged<00:03:00.860> in

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
planet and yet we're not very engaged in

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.500 
planet and yet we're not very engaged in
that<00:03:01.220> it's<00:03:01.430> traditionally<00:03:01.970> been<00:03:02.090> something

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
that it's traditionally been something

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.920 
that it's traditionally been something
that<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.810> environmental<00:03:03.440> movement

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
that the environmental movement

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.819 
that the environmental movement
has<00:03:04.140> not<00:03:04.829> really<00:03:05.129> put<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.310> lot<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.549> emphasis<00:03:05.640> on

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
has not really put a lot of emphasis on

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.289 
has not really put a lot of emphasis on
but<00:03:07.829> for<00:03:08.010> me<00:03:08.129> I<00:03:08.159> just<00:03:08.280> have<00:03:08.549> always<00:03:08.879> been<00:03:09.120> kind

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
but for me I just have always been kind

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.839 
but for me I just have always been kind
of<00:03:09.390> fascinated<00:03:10.109> by<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.530> attracted<00:03:11.069> to<00:03:11.310> some

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
of fascinated by and attracted to some

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.149 
of fascinated by and attracted to some
of<00:03:11.969> the<00:03:12.150> ocean<00:03:12.900> creatures<00:03:13.319> particularly<00:03:14.069> the

of the ocean creatures particularly the

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.270 
of the ocean creatures particularly the
bigger<00:03:14.370> ones<00:03:14.670> like<00:03:15.030> some<00:03:15.329> of<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.510> sharks

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
bigger ones like some of the sharks

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.959 
bigger ones like some of the sharks
whales<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:18.409> that<00:03:19.409> was<00:03:19.680> sort<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.189> motivating

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:20.969 
whales and that was sort of a motivating

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.970 
whales and that was sort of a motivating
factor<00:03:21.359> to<00:03:21.389> direct<00:03:21.810> some<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.290> proceeds
