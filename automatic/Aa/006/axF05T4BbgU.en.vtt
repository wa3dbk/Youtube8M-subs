00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.419 

okay<00:00:00.840> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.410> last<00:00:01.589> generator<00:00:02.250> we

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
okay this is the last generator we

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.019 
okay this is the last generator we
making<00:00:02.850> movie<00:00:03.240> it's<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.870> generator<00:00:04.290> three<00:00:04.650> type

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029 
making movie it's a generator three type

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.930 
making movie it's a generator three type
it's<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.210> high<00:00:06.359> efficiency<00:00:06.960> generator<00:00:07.940> so

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
it's a high efficiency generator so

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:17.230 
it's a high efficiency generator so
let's<00:00:09.210> just<00:00:09.510> this<00:00:09.660> generator<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:13.370> will<00:00:14.370> zoom<00:00:14.400> in

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:30.820 

like<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:23.449> let's<00:00:24.449> test<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.930> with<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> low<00:00:25.380> rpm

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:46.040 

let's<00:00:31.830> say<00:00:32.070> 100<00:00:32.790> rpm<00:00:33.920> say<00:00:34.920> 12<00:00:35.280> volts<00:00:41.030> 100<00:00:45.050> don't

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
let's say 100 rpm say 12 volts 100 don't

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.689 
let's say 100 rpm say 12 volts 100 don't
be<00:00:46.200> right<00:00:48.920> 140<00:00:50.360> rpms<00:00:51.360> will<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:52.050> few<00:00:53.570> 1517<00:00:54.570> volts

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
be right 140 rpms will be few 1517 volts

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:07.700 
be right 140 rpms will be few 1517 volts
okay<00:00:56.699> let's<00:00:56.969> take<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.480> power<00:00:57.660> drill<00:01:06.710> let's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
okay let's take the power drill let's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:19.790 
okay let's take the power drill let's
test<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.220> again

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.800 

falling<00:01:20.800> on<00:01:20.890> those<00:01:21.100> are<00:01:21.280> Pierre

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.480 

50<00:01:25.810> poles

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.340 

500<00:01:31.490> rpm

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:44.390 

six<00:01:36.530> people<00:01:36.950> for<00:01:37.190> something

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:52.830 

1,000<00:01:45.400> off<00:01:45.550> yet<00:01:45.940> they<00:01:46.600> give<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:47.190> 120<00:01:48.190> whole<00:01:51.840> 15

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
1,000 off yet they give you 120 whole 15

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.550 
1,000 off yet they give you 120 whole 15
omelette<00:01:53.290> economic<00:01:54.160> rpm<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:55.090> give<00:01:55.300> you<00:01:55.560> all

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
omelette economic rpm to give you all

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:08.309 
omelette economic rpm to give you all
those<00:01:56.830> who<00:01:57.160> own<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.370> Pope

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:16.649 

yeah

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:22.449 

that's<00:02:17.659> nice<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:19.900> gives<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.590> good<00:02:21.890> voltage

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
that's nice that gives you good voltage

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:38.400 
that's nice that gives you good voltage
by<00:02:23.180> very<00:02:23.629> low<00:02:23.900> rpm<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.989> it's<00:02:26.989> at<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.470> generator

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.470
