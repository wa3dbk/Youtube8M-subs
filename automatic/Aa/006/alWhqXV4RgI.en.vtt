00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.580
 the incredible world of rubber in the series 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.589
 to take the first step to a change 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.440
 different in cardboard tree thrown in 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.290
 2011 in four current seasons and 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.450
 many more behind this are full 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.850
 of questions and curiosities about this 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.070
 magnificent series in this video you 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.730
 I will show 20 things that probably do not 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.730
 you knew how to eat 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.820
 the series is the first production 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.220
 British cardboard something ironic is that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.220
 the creator of bombay is French 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.280
 most of the characters in the series 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.590
 they are rejected projects for our 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.750
 television all of them are left in the 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.059
 bimbo's portfolio believes that later 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.460
 would give life to his first project on 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.460
 future is in the past do not believe 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.449
 in the beginning the series would be for sweet 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.159
 the adult section of upsetting word 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.530
 would try a reformatory to 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.420
 characters rejected to cardboard does not 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.700
 I liked the idea very much but the animation 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.100
 It was very well received what bachelet 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.799
 redesign combat great and the series that 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.869
 now we know something about that you can see 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.140
 in the pilot and in some episodes of 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.140
 the series 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.670
 in the designs of 2007 when they were 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.450
 rejected characters bombal in a cat 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.180
 black 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.760
 richard a blue dog the director brown 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.160
 it was more hairy pink more to me 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.470
 it was a purple cloud and the young lady 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.520
 Seed would resemble light and the first 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.520
 child who walks upright 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.810
 according to what I focused on, the water are 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.420
 caricatured versions of his family 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.400
 including up to the rubber as its version 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.110
 of the child that he defines as 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.110
 naive and pretty stupid 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.329
 Convalia is one of the series that most 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.039
 work and time take to be done since 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.009
 they use various elements and types of 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.470
 animation for example two creating 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.629
 3D images by computer and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.220
 real scenarios whereby it leads 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.760
 about a month and finish a 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.760
 episode 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.880
 Santa Claus and freight rates 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.180
 they are the only human characters in the 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.180
 series 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.510
 curiously both in Latin America in 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.330
 japan the voice is shared is the same 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.489
 of naruto since in Latin America it is 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.650
 interpreted by Isabella Martin and in 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.650
 Japan is played by Yuko Takeuchi 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.620
 on some occasions they have shown 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.629
 real people like the commercial ones of 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.030
 television with street advertising 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.879
 an example is the cosmetics brand 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.590
 daniel hernÃ¡n that actually daniel is 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.180
 the president of cartoon network the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.180
 world open studio europe 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.519
 Darwin has the longest name in all 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.220
 the series also ryan caspian has 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.409
 owned niko years and four are third and 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.310
 is a clear reference to the theory of 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.310
 evolution of charles darwin 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.630
 initially give a character come 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.400
 for a series about creatures in the 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.100
 patio later 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.290
 ok the redesign in 3d for the pilot of 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.330
 rubber but because of the complications of 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.050
 animation stayed with the design that 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.050
 we know now 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.600
 despite being a series with 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.730
 classification for over 7 years has 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.070
 been the only series in which more says 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.690
 the word nipples compared to 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.850
 now the adventure that has 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.800
 higher ranking and has never said the 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.799
 word people in the show 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:12.330
 the 61 nipples in the past the present 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.330
 and the future 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.090
 the design of tina rex is inspired by 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.919
 movies like king kong and 'jurassic 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.180
 park 'coming to have a similarity 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.180
 pretty big 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.300
 rock and wear t-shirts that are 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.340
 references to bands like ac / dc and keys 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.740
 altering the name as an official abc 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.740
 French word meaning weight 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.360
 the only real characters or the 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.340
 evasion and the whole series are his children and 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.880
 his family that are ben recordings 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.490

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.650
 and his girlfriend the butterfly and daisy the 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.790
 burrita on television of which 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.790
 there is a puppet 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.070
 the scenarios of the series are real the 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.900
 school the north is an altered image 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.480
 from abraham lincoln and san school 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.580
 francisco and the house of the water are 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.410
 california houses california what 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.950
 assumes that the mont is based on 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.950
 California 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.889
 harris is surrounded by references 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.319
 starting with his name carrey kruger 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:33.169
 emblematic characters of the cinema of 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:35.689
 terror its original design was similar to 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.639
 the ghost of mario bros and his design 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.439
 in 3d is based on the movies 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:42.550
 horror classics that used this 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.550
 effect to be scary 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.570
 the series requires the work of three 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.150
 Most 3d animation studios 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.730

 by cartoon herbal palave in studio 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.590
 the series as the seasons pass 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.510
 changed the type of animation to the 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.190
 more detailed of all the aspects 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.100
 this would be much better to the characters 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.760
 3d and light effects and animation of 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.760
 the stages 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.449

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.510
 mentioned in the video tim in the 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.510

 I am ban and pp but before judging us 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.000
 think about this rap music video games 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:12.770
 internet television everything making us 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.840
 wish things that to your generation 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.379
 push and choke to become more 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.029
 rich who is the real victim here 

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:21.919
 think who is the true culprit the 

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:23.840
 victim of the corrupt society or the 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:26.379
 man who could have avoided it said that 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.379
 occur
