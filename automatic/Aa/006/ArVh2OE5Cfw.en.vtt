long to release a full video with a big

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.880 
long to release a full video with a big
the<00:01:00.539> game<00:01:00.719> could<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.440> 10-15

gonna go with this game so we're gonna
sneak<00:03:37.650> an<00:03:38.070> overlord<00:03:38.519> over<00:03:39.239> he<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.780> bit<00:03:39.959> slow

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
sneak an overlord over he is a bit slow

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.190 
sneak an overlord over he is a bit slow
but<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:41.070> know<00:03:41.160> you'll<00:03:41.370> get<00:03:41.519> there<00:03:41.760> eventually

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
but you know you'll get there eventually

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.080 
but you know you'll get there eventually
leave<00:03:43.200> them<00:03:43.320> alone<00:03:43.530> guys<00:03:43.859> evolution<00:03:44.850> apply

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
leave them alone guys evolution apply

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.610 
leave them alone guys evolution apply
still<00:03:45.390> down<00:03:45.540> away<00:03:45.720> does<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.079> sound<00:03:46.380> instead

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
still down away does that sound instead

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.410 
still down away does that sound instead
of<00:03:46.739> upgrade<00:03:47.070> complete<00:03:47.340> like<00:03:47.609> on<00:03:47.940> my<00:03:48.299> other

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
of upgrade complete like on my other

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.940 
of upgrade complete like on my other
account<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.959> does<00:03:49.079> look<00:03:49.109> great<00:03:49.350> complete<00:03:49.769> but

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
account it does look great complete but

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.890 
account it does look great complete but
this<00:03:50.070> one<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.370> like<00:03:50.519> evolution<00:03:51.060> com<00:03:51.630> plate

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
this one is like evolution com plate

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.569 
this one is like evolution com plate
we're<00:03:52.410> gonna<00:03:52.500> go<00:03:52.620> ahead<00:03:52.769> throw<00:03:53.370> down<00:03:53.549> that
