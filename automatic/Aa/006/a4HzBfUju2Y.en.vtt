is our relay is going to plug directly
into<00:02:05.049> that's<00:02:06.049> going<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.289> go<00:02:06.350> right<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.530> the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
into that's going to go right to the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.800 
into that's going to go right to the
relay<00:02:07.009> now<00:02:07.369> you've<00:02:07.520> got<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.880> long<00:02:08.179> red<00:02:08.660> and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
relay now you've got a long red and

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.630 
relay now you've got a long red and
black<00:02:08.959> wire<00:02:09.259> this<00:02:09.739> needs<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.100> be<00:02:10.160> ran<00:02:10.429> up<00:02:10.610> to

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
black wire this needs to be ran up to

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.340 
black wire this needs to be ran up to
the<00:02:10.910> battery<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.690> relay<00:02:11.900> can<00:02:12.049> pull<00:02:12.230> its

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
the battery so the relay can pull its

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.690 
the battery so the relay can pull its
power<00:02:12.560> from<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.799> battery<00:02:13.130> instead<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.519> from

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
power from the battery instead of from

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.699 
power from the battery instead of from
the<00:02:13.730> bikes<00:02:13.970> wiring<00:02:14.450> system<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:14.989> that'll<00:02:15.590> give

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
the bikes wiring system and that'll give
