00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.116
What a great performance!

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.856
Your voice is priceless!

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.014
We enjoyed your pure and clean voice.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.459
Let's hear our judges' comments. Mr. Jang?

00:02:47.988 --> 00:02:58.541
I was worried that the genre called 'countertenor' might be recognized as simply 'different' to people.

00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:05.780
I thought it would be great if the talent could go beyond 'freshness' and deliver inspirational something.

00:03:06.322 --> 00:03:08.307
But I was worried what if it doesn't.

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:12.329
However that was an unncessary concern. I enjoyed a lot.

00:03:15.235 --> 00:03:17.406
Ms. Song, what did you think?

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:27.956
It's only the second semi-final, but I dare say that...

00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:40.605
among all the semi-finalists, you are one of the most improved ones.

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:44.673
I was really surprised at your performance.

00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:48.585
I could imagine how much you have practiced.

00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:49.704
It was a great stage.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.077
So, she recognized how hard you practiced.

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.461
Let's hear Ms. Park's comments.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:05.125
I know how much audiences love you and your performance.

00:04:06.926 --> 00:04:11.149
So I might be targeted if I say this to you.

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:16.615
Yes, you did improve a lot.

00:04:17.982 --> 00:04:22.826
But as I said before, you still have a long way to go.

00:04:23.116 --> 00:04:28.376
If you get to go to the final, you should try singing with your eyes open.

00:04:28.377 --> 00:04:31.366
Then it would be a whole lot different for you as well.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.003
Don't block us from you, but be with us. It was a good performance.

00:04:40.963 --> 00:04:42.955
Thank you for the comments.

00:04:43.287 --> 00:04:46.871
If you think Mr. Gyu Jing Sung should be in the final,

00:04:47.016 --> 00:04:53.937
please put #2 on your cell phone screen and send it to #0700.

00:04:54.662 --> 00:04:58.525
The vote won't be counted if you only write his name, so please write NUMBER 2.

00:04:58.963 --> 00:05:02.077
Don't vote now and wait until the end of our last act for tonight.

00:05:03.034 --> 00:05:05.580
Let's give a round of appaluse for Gyu Jing Sung!
