00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.320
 let's make butter cookies 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:17.070
 but let's use the gun 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.550
 for this we need 340 grams of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.590
 butter at room temperature 1 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.859
 egg 1 tablespoon of vanilla essence 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:33.150
 2 tablespoons of milk 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:37.250
 525 grams of flour 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.220
 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.070
 and a spoonful plus a teaspoon of 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.170
 yeast 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.990
 and for once they are made to 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.830
 to bathe we are going to use chocolate nestlÃ© 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.830
 I'm going to use 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.090
 these three discs 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.200
 but you can use the form you want or 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.210
 you can even use short pasta but I 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.559
 I bought this gun and I'm going to 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.559
 experiment to see how it goes 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.189
 in our dora mass we are going to put the 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:13.189
 Butter 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.500
 and the sugar 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.500
 and the minimum speed we're going to mix 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.479
 we see that we already have the two pose 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.450
 integral and now here I have both 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:48.610
 tablespoons of milk and the tablespoon of 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.610
 vanilla and we're going to add it too 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.459
 now 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.759
 we must add let's add now the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.759
 egg 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.410
 for the yeast we mix it with the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.050
 flour 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.580
 and the sieve masters we are going to incorporate 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.040
 to the mass in about two or three times 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.680
 first we mix at low speed to 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.299
 do not lift raise dust 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.849
 and then later when we see 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.840
 that is already well integrated we return 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.840
 to add more flour 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:00.220
 We collect all the mass that is stuck 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:04.030
 through the walls and we will change 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.670
 instead of the shovel to the hook because 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.970
 it is being heavier in mass and it costs 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.970
 more work 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:26.409
 we fill the pastry bag with the dough 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.799
 we put the disk that we want and enter 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.799
 fields 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:37.620
 We preheat the oven to 170 degrees and in 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:41.430
 a baking sheet of paper without 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:45.680
 grease the let's put it to remember that 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.680
 you do not have to oil or put paper 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.370
 we put the gun at the base of the 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.900
 oven tray 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.700
 we squeeze and lift 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.380
 we support 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:04.750
 we squeeze and lift 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.750
 we support squeeze and lift 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.700
 a very simple way of doing dances 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.629
 if you do not have the person 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.139
 because this mass you will have to put in 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:47.139
 the fridge 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.950
 for the cold 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.050
 now 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.889
 for the chocolate bath we are going to 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:14.110
 need 75 milliliters of cream 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.569
 a chocolate bar in the extra 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.899
 final but a little butter 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:23.270
 we are going to heat the cream and 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:27.189
 when it boils, we are going to add 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.189
 the chopped chocolate tablet 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:32.879
 we already have the well-melted chocolate 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:36.760
 we add butter and melt it 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:39.900
 well this is to give it shine 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.900
 to chocolate 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:46.110
 we take the cookie 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:50.210
 we bathe it half 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.210
 and we put it in a grid 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.400
 so all the cookies that we want 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.620
 well this is the result of 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.650
 already finished cookies I 've had 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.770
 15 minutes 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.530
 this is so with nuts you're so with 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.569
 peach jam and you're with a 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.439
 chocolate bath 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:19.409
 I'm going to give you some advice if you do not have two 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:23.980
 oven trays to go while 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:27.010
 one round is made you mount the other 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:31.960
 you have to wait about ten minutes 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:34.360
 one from one bake to another because with the 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.120
 hot plate is not going to stick the 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.260
 mass then the tray has to be 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.260
 cold so that it sticks 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.180
 Well, I do not expect anything that I have 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.180
 liked
