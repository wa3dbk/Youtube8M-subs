00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
perks that I had set on but you actually

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.850 
perks that I had set on but you actually
get<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:45.479> specials<00:01:46.140> balance<00:01:46.439> which<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.740> was

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
get your specials balance which I was

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.410 
get your specials balance which I was
very<00:01:46.890> surprised<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.939> was<00:01:48.060> kind<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.240> happy

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
very surprised and I was kind of happy

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.990 
very surprised and I was kind of happy
because<00:01:48.810> uh<00:01:49.020> huh<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:50.189> kind<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.549> rewarding

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
because uh huh it's kind of rewarding

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.090 
because uh huh it's kind of rewarding
when<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.180> actually<00:01:51.420> get<00:01:51.659> something<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
when you actually get something but the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.639 
when you actually get something but the
real<00:01:53.460> reason<00:01:53.820> why<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.570> wanted<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.960> do<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.290> was

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
real reason why I wanted to do this was

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.069 
real reason why I wanted to do this was
because<00:01:55.710> every<00:01:56.610> time<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.030> play<00:01:57.240> call<00:01:57.899> duty

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
because every time you play call duty

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.340 
because every time you play call duty
it's<00:01:58.829> always<00:01:59.310> about<00:01:59.430> trying<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.000> achieve<00:02:00.780> that

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
it's always about trying to achieve that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.440 
it's always about trying to achieve that
next<00:02:01.680> kill<00:02:01.860> streak<00:02:02.130> or<00:02:02.310> achieve<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:03.090> next

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
next kill streak or achieve that next

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.630 
next kill streak or achieve that next
perk<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.979> basically<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.250> want<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.520> do

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
perk and basically you want to do

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.789 
perk and basically you want to do
whatever<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.750> rewarded<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.560> a

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
whatever you can to be rewarded in a

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.320 
whatever you can to be rewarded in a
game<00:02:08.039> own<00:02:08.220> especially<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.789> certain<00:02:08.940> destroyed

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
game own especially in certain destroyed

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.059 
game own especially in certain destroyed
where<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.569> kills<00:02:09.780> are<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.050> limited<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.590> feels

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
where the kills are so limited it feels

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.050 
where the kills are so limited it feels
a<00:02:11.190> whole<00:02:11.220> lot<00:02:11.400> better<00:02:11.730> when<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.060> get<00:02:12.330> a

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
a whole lot better when you get a

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.520 
a whole lot better when you get a
that<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.420> work<00:02:13.630> for<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:13.930> feels<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.319> whole<00:02:14.349> lot

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
that you work for it feels a whole lot

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.559 
that you work for it feels a whole lot
more<00:02:14.800> satisfying<00:02:15.340> but<00:02:15.790> nothing<00:02:16.090> else<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.420> more

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
more satisfying but nothing else is more

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.809 
more satisfying but nothing else is more
satisfying<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:17.410> not<00:02:17.650> using<00:02:17.860> any<00:02:18.250> streaks<00:02:18.670> at

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
satisfying for not using any streaks at

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.760 
satisfying for not using any streaks at
all<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.209> actually<00:02:19.690> getting<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.380> very<00:02:20.620> good

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
all and actually getting a very good

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.430 
all and actually getting a very good
gameplay<00:02:21.280> just<00:02:21.580> using<00:02:22.120> your<00:02:22.569> bare<00:02:22.870> bones<00:02:23.110> kit

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
gameplay just using your bare bones kit

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.530

your guns and your equipment and your

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.690 
your guns and your equipment and your
perks<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.020> that's<00:02:26.170> really<00:02:26.560> why<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.310> thought

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
perks and that's really why I thought

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.550 
perks and that's really why I thought
this<00:02:27.880> would<00:02:28.090> have<00:02:28.209> been<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.690> difficult

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
this would have been a difficult

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.080 
this would have been a difficult
challenge<00:02:30.069> but<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.430> actually<00:02:30.640> really

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
challenge but I actually really
