a multiple award-winning proved
enormously<00:00:20.100> popular<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.240> how<00:00:21.390> do<00:00:21.450> the<00:00:21.570> two

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
enormously popular so how do the two

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.590 
enormously popular so how do the two
phones<00:00:21.960> measure<00:00:22.320> up<00:00:22.560> well<00:00:23.370> here's<00:00:23.610> the<00:00:23.670> new<00:00:23.880> s3

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
phones measure up well here's the new s3

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.020 
phones measure up well here's the new s3
and<00:00:24.780> here's<00:00:25.620> the<00:00:25.770> previous<00:00:26.100> version<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.520> s2

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.030 
and here's the previous version the s2

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.610 
and here's the previous version the s2
as<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.600> can<00:00:27.720> see<00:00:27.900> they're<00:00:28.140> both<00:00:28.320> large

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:28.620 
as you can see they're both large

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.460 
as you can see they're both large
devices<00:00:29.039> from<00:00:29.640> both<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> touchscreens<00:00:30.600> now

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
devices from both of touchscreens now

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.220 
devices from both of touchscreens now
the<00:00:31.530> s3<00:00:31.920> has<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.129> large<00:00:32.610> 4.8<00:00:33.570> inch<00:00:33.870> touch<00:00:34.200> screen

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the s3 has a large 4.8 inch touch screen

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.279 
the s3 has a large 4.8 inch touch screen
with<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.680> resolution<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:35.280> 1280<00:00:35.850> by<00:00:36.120> 720<00:00:36.629> pixels

with a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:40.720 
with a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels
whereas<00:00:38.039> the<00:00:38.129> s2<00:00:38.670> has<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.089> 4.3<00:00:39.780> inch<00:00:40.140> screen

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
whereas the s2 has a 4.3 inch screen

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.770 
whereas the s2 has a 4.3 inch screen
actually<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:41.789> you<00:00:41.850> compare<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.359> two<00:00:42.510> devices

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
actually if you compare the two devices

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.750 
actually if you compare the two devices
together<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.589> new<00:00:43.710> s3<00:00:44.129> doesn't<00:00:44.489> seem<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
together the new s3 doesn't seem that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.329 
together the new s3 doesn't seem that
much<00:00:45.210> larger<00:00:45.719> sure<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.499> big<00:00:46.710> device<00:00:47.010> but

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
much larger sure it's a big device but

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:48.739 
much larger sure it's a big device but
it<00:00:47.429> fits<00:00:47.670> quite<00:00:47.819> comfortably<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.569> your<00:00:48.629> hand

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
it fits quite comfortably in your hand

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.200 
it fits quite comfortably in your hand
and<00:00:49.229> although<00:00:49.949> it<00:00:50.069> is<00:00:50.190> big<00:00:50.519> it<00:00:50.760> doesn't<00:00:51.089> weigh

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and although it is big it doesn't weigh

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.790 
and although it is big it doesn't weigh
a<00:00:51.239> lot<00:00:51.479> so<00:00:51.749> you<00:00:51.809> know<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.199> use<00:00:52.499> it<00:00:52.620> pretty

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
a lot so you know you can use it pretty

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.849 
a lot so you know you can use it pretty
comfortably<00:00:53.539> now<00:00:54.539> when<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.809> tested<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> s2<00:00:55.649> in

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
comfortably now when we tested the s2 in

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.709 
comfortably now when we tested the s2 in
2011<00:00:56.639> we<00:00:56.699> were<00:00:56.819> incredibly<00:00:56.969> impressed<00:00:57.539> by<00:00:57.659> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
2011 we were incredibly impressed by the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.229 
2011 we were incredibly impressed by the
screen<00:00:58.109> resolution<00:00:58.729> pictures<00:00:59.729> and<00:00:59.940> videos

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
screen resolution pictures and videos

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.239 
screen resolution pictures and videos
look<00:01:00.449> extremely<00:01:01.260> sharp<00:01:01.499> and<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.889> colors

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.249 
look extremely sharp and the colors

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.520 
look extremely sharp and the colors
bright<00:01:02.729> and<00:01:02.999> you<00:01:03.479> know<00:01:03.569> seemed<00:01:03.929> to<00:01:04.080> leap<00:01:04.379> off

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
bright and you know seemed to leap off

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.580 
bright and you know seemed to leap off
the<00:01:04.589> phone<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.000> comparison<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.840> s3<00:01:07.320> blows

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the phone but in comparison the s3 blows

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.350 
the phone but in comparison the s3 blows
it<00:01:07.740> away<00:01:07.800> we<00:01:08.370> are<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.730> impressed<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.270> our

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
it away we are really impressed in our

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.300 
it away we are really impressed in our
short<00:01:09.600> hands<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.140> trial<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.040> really

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
short hands on trial and you can really

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.980 
short hands on trial and you can really
notice<00:01:11.520> differences<00:01:12.090> when<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.480> have<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> two

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
notice differences when you have the two

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.900 
notice differences when you have the two
phones<00:01:13.200> next<00:01:13.440> to<00:01:13.620> each<00:01:13.740> other<00:01:13.830> another<00:01:14.760> key

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
phones next to each other another key

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.340 
phones next to each other another key
difference<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> s3<00:01:16.050> is<00:01:16.080> they're

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
difference with the s3 is they're

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.290 
difference with the s3 is they're
announced<00:01:16.800> battery<00:01:17.250> now<00:01:17.370> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.910> 20

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
announced battery now this is up to 20

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.810 
announced battery now this is up to 20
100<00:01:18.780> milli<00:01:18.990> amp<00:01:19.170> hour<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.650> should<00:01:20.250> ensure<00:01:20.580> that

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
100 milli amp hour so should ensure that

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.220 
100 milli amp hour so should ensure that
the<00:01:21.030> phone<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.390> keep<00:01:21.600> running<00:01:21.900> without<00:01:22.080> you

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
the phone can keep running without you

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.450 
the phone can keep running without you
having<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.440> reach<00:01:22.620> for<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> charge<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.250> every

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
having to reach for the charge or every

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.840 
having to reach for the charge or every
five<00:01:23.640> minutes<00:01:25.130> something<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.220> also<00:01:26.490> enhanced

five minutes something of also enhanced

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.730 
five minutes something of also enhanced
the<00:01:26.910> processor<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.900> processor<00:01:28.410> in<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
the processor now the processor in the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740 
the processor now the processor in the
s2<00:01:29.340> was<00:01:29.550> at<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.820> time<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.090> cutting-edge

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
s2 was at that time a cutting-edge

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.840 
s2 was at that time a cutting-edge
dual-core<00:01:31.290> processor<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.280> we've<00:01:32.430> now<00:01:32.670> have

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
dual-core processor but we've now have

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.090 
dual-core processor but we've now have
moved<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.390> quad<00:01:33.660> core<00:01:33.900> processes<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
moved on to quad core processes so the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.130 
moved on to quad core processes so the
processing<00:01:35.610> power<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> s3<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.750> probably

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
processing power in the s3 is probably

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.530 
processing power in the s3 is probably
unmatched<00:01:37.850> now<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.030> way<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.480> really

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
unmatched now one way we can really

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.270 
unmatched now one way we can really
demonstrate<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:40.350> power<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.830> new<00:01:40.980> quad

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
demonstrate the power of this new quad
