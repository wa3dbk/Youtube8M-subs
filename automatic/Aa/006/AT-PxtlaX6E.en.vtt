little<00:00:56.250> won't<00:00:56.370> dangle<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:58.320> then<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.649> can

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
little won't dangle and then you can

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.459 
little won't dangle and then you can
just<00:00:58.980> pull<00:00:59.160> your<00:00:59.250> rotor<00:00:59.460> off<00:01:00.109> now<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.260> here

complete<00:01:50.140> circle<00:01:50.590> is<00:01:50.680> just<00:01:50.890> one<00:01:51.100> piece<00:01:51.399> you<00:01:52.240> do

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
complete circle is just one piece you do

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.600 
complete circle is just one piece you do
not<00:01:52.420> have<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.899> take<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.259> axle<00:01:53.649> off<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:54.310> get<00:01:54.460> it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
not have to take the axle off to get it

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.760 
not have to take the axle off to get it
out<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:55.060> just<00:01:55.659> have<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:56.049> kind<00:01:56.259> of<00:01:56.380> fiddle<00:01:56.680> it

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
out you just have to kind of fiddle it

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.940 
out you just have to kind of fiddle it
around<00:01:57.039> here<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:58.869> off<00:01:58.990> one<00:01:59.320> side<00:01:59.619> then<00:01:59.920> the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
around here get off one side then the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:15.240 
around here get off one side then the
other<00:02:00.070> side<00:02:00.280> rotate<00:02:00.789> it<00:02:01.180> around<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:14.130> then<00:02:15.130> it

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
other side rotate it around and then it

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.300 
other side rotate it around and then it
comes<00:02:15.459> off<00:02:15.870> okay<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.930> put<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.410> new<00:02:17.799> shoe<00:02:18.069> on

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
comes off okay to put the new shoe on

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.550 
comes off okay to put the new shoe on
you<00:02:18.880> basically<00:02:19.330> do<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.630> same<00:02:19.660> thing<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.260> hold

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
you basically do the same thing you hold

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.990 
you basically do the same thing you hold
it<00:02:20.739> up<00:02:20.860> there<00:02:21.010> in<00:02:21.130> place<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:22.350> put<00:02:23.350> in<00:02:23.470> one<00:02:23.680> side

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
it up there in place and put in one side

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.190 
it up there in place and put in one side
pry<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.060> just<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.360> little<00:02:25.480> bit<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.840> twist<00:02:26.080> it

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
pry it just a little bit and twist it

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.820 
pry it just a little bit and twist it
around<00:02:27.810> goes<00:02:28.810> back<00:02:29.019> in<00:02:29.170> place<00:02:31.560> make<00:02:32.560> sure<00:02:32.739> you

the bottom left side down here you'll
see<00:02:37.959> this<00:02:38.230> little<00:02:38.530> clip<00:02:39.030> I've<00:02:40.030> got<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.269> make

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
see this little clip I've got to make

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.690 
see this little clip I've got to make
sure<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.930> clip<00:02:41.230> fits<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:42.160> shoe<00:02:42.430> goes

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
sure that that clip fits the shoe goes

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.840 
sure that that clip fits the shoe goes
over<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.090> clip<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.750> slide<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.260> in<00:02:44.410> like<00:02:44.440> this
