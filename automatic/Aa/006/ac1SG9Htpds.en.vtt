time<00:02:06.929> we've<00:02:07.049> ever<00:02:07.140> lost<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.560> game<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.009> here

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
time we've ever lost a game and so here

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.710 
time we've ever lost a game and so here
we<00:02:08.310> are<00:02:08.340> we're<00:02:08.820> dealing<00:02:08.940> with<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.270> shadow<00:02:09.539> of

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
we are we're dealing with the shadow of

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.510 
we are we're dealing with the shadow of
the<00:02:09.840> 1919<00:02:10.440> being<00:02:10.740> you<00:02:11.039> know<00:02:11.100> this<00:02:11.250> team<00:02:11.400> will

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
the 1919 being you know this team will

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.860 
the 1919 being you know this team will
never<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.850> great<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.210> those<00:02:12.570> players

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
never be as great is that those players

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.150 
never be as great is that those players
and<00:02:13.020> we're<00:02:13.320> in<00:02:13.410> our<00:02:13.470> first<00:02:13.620> Olympics<00:02:13.950> without

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
and we're in our first Olympics without

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.710 
and we're in our first Olympics without
those<00:02:14.280> players<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:15.060> we<00:02:15.150> lose<00:02:15.240> our<00:02:15.360> first<00:02:15.569> game

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
those players and we lose our first game

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.910 
those players and we lose our first game
so<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.170> had<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.410> burden<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.770> our<00:02:16.800> shoulders

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
so we had that burden on our shoulders

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.570 
so we had that burden on our shoulders
when<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.580> loss<00:02:17.760> against<00:02:18.090> Norway<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:19.500> was<00:02:19.800> my

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
when the loss against Norway that was my

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.380 
when the loss against Norway that was my
first<00:02:20.940> loss<00:02:21.330> with<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.440> team<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:23.670> was<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:24.240> was

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390

tough but then I thought we have now we
really<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.530> choice

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.960 
Norway but we still have a chance we
could<00:02:43.319> still<00:02:43.590> get<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.920> final<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.580> wasn't

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
could still get to the final it wasn't

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.729 
could still get to the final it wasn't
over<00:02:45.239> we<00:02:45.480> could<00:02:45.690> still<00:02:45.989> make<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.230> through<00:02:46.560> with

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
over we could still make it through with

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.880 
over we could still make it through with
with<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> loss<00:02:47.489> in<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.849> opening<00:02:48.209> game<00:02:48.650> we<00:02:49.650> just

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
with a loss in the opening game we just

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.369 
with a loss in the opening game we just
we<00:02:50.160> dug<00:02:50.370> deep<00:02:50.610> from<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.180> game<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:51.989> we

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
we dug deep from that game on and we

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.809 
we dug deep from that game on and we
continued<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.950> work<00:02:52.980> together<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.760> think

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
continued to work together and I think

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.539 
continued to work together and I think
the<00:02:54.180> togetherness<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:55.080> what<00:02:55.319> got<00:02:56.010> us<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.340> end

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
the togetherness is what got us that end

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.910 
the togetherness is what got us that end
result<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.329> will<00:02:57.810> say<00:02:58.049> our<00:02:58.200> confidence<00:02:58.560> didn't

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
result I will say our confidence didn't

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.280 
result I will say our confidence didn't

defensively I mean just I think about

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.199 
defensively I mean just I think about
the<00:05:00.959> backline<00:05:01.409> and<00:05:01.489> hope<00:05:02.489> and<00:05:02.669> how<00:05:02.759> many<00:05:02.939> saves
