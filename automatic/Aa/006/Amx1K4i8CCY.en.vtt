some<00:02:23.340> people<00:02:23.580> timing<00:02:24.000> themselves<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.690> a

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
some people timing themselves is a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.990 
some people timing themselves is a
really<00:02:25.500> helpful<00:02:25.710> kind<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.400> structure<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.880> go

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
really helpful kind of structure to go

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.610 
really helpful kind of structure to go
by<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.600> those<00:02:27.750> people<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.110> think<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.500> is

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
by and to those people I think that is

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.950 
by and to those people I think that is
great<00:02:28.950> or<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.520> want<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.850> try<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.300> go<00:02:30.690> for

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
great or if you want to try that go for

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.600 
great or if you want to try that go for
it<00:02:30.990> part<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.830> developing<00:02:32.400> your<00:02:32.550> own

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
it part of like a developing your own

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.640 
it part of like a developing your own
healthy<00:02:33.210> process<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.990> trying<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.410> lot<00:02:34.530> of

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
healthy process is trying a lot of

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.260 
healthy process is trying a lot of
different<00:02:34.680> things<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.370> mean<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.850> course<00:02:36.030> I

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
different things I mean of course I

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.900 
different things I mean of course I
still<00:02:36.480> have<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> relationship<00:02:37.410> with<00:02:37.830> time<00:02:38.490> and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
still have a relationship with time and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.250 
still have a relationship with time and
the<00:02:39.030> thing<00:02:39.210> that's<00:02:39.240> different<00:02:39.600> about<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.990> now

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
the thing that's different about it now

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.410 
the thing that's different about it now
is<00:02:40.440> it's<00:02:40.710> just<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.070> much<00:02:41.250> more<00:02:41.670> healthy

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
is it's just a much more healthy

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.820 
is it's just a much more healthy
relationships<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.500> think<00:02:43.680> that's<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
relationships and I think that's the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.680 
relationships and I think that's the
most<00:02:43.950> important<00:02:44.430> thing<00:02:44.490> recognizing<00:02:45.450> when

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
most important thing recognizing when

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.760 
most important thing recognizing when
you<00:02:45.750> have<00:02:45.840> relationship<00:02:46.380> with<00:02:46.500> something<00:02:46.710> in

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
you have relationship with something in

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.140 
you have relationship with something in
your<00:02:46.830> life<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.070> like<00:02:47.280> affects<00:02:47.700> your<00:02:47.910> mood

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
your life that like affects your mood

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.580 
your life that like affects your mood
and<00:02:48.360> affects<00:02:48.720> things<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.110> care<00:02:49.320> about<00:02:49.380> and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
and affects things you care about and

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.620 
and affects things you care about and
then<00:02:49.920> finding<00:02:50.370> ways<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.730> make<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.300> the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
then finding ways to make it of the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.590 
then finding ways to make it of the
health<00:02:51.840> ideal<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.650> want<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.250> at<00:02:53.600> if

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
health ideal you want it to be at if

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.300 
health ideal you want it to be at if
there's<00:02:54.930> one<00:02:55.170> thing<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.470> will<00:02:55.770> make<00:02:55.800> you

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
think about your use of time it is

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.590 
think about your use of time it is
getting<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.160> flu<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.430> not<00:02:59.880> being<00:03:00.060> able<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.420> do
