00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
a house there's a lot more involved I

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.350 
a house there's a lot more involved I
think<00:01:52.740> sometimes<00:01:53.520> architects<00:01:53.970> wish<00:01:54.180> they

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
think sometimes architects wish they

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.609 
think sometimes architects wish they
could<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.540> sit<00:01:54.780> down<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:55.110> one<00:01:55.140> spot<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
could just sit down in one spot and

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.920 
could just sit down in one spot and
design<00:01:55.890> all<00:01:55.920> day<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.850> I've<00:01:57.149> tasted<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
design all day so I've tasted a

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.209 
design all day so I've tasted a
generally<00:01:58.380> covering<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.829> whole<00:01:58.950> lot<00:01:59.130> of

an architect the hardest part is is

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.610 
an architect the hardest part is is
reconciling<00:02:50.750> your<00:02:51.050> clients<00:02:51.380> expectations

mean is there much work out there for

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.050 
mean is there much work out there for
architects<00:03:01.010> at<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.190> moment<00:03:01.490> I<00:03:01.610> think<00:03:01.730> there's

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
architects at the moment I think there's

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.140 
architects at the moment I think there's
it's<00:03:02.300> look<00:03:02.720> it's<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:03.200> really<00:03:03.410> varying<00:03:03.920> wave<00:03:04.150> and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
it's look it's a really varying wave and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.660 
it's look it's a really varying wave and
particularly<00:03:05.930> in<00:03:05.990> this<00:03:06.110> boom<00:03:06.560> state<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.490> seems

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
particularly in this boom state it seems

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.920 
particularly in this boom state it seems
really<00:03:07.940> connected<00:03:08.330> to<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.540> amount<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:08.750> money

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
really connected to the amount of money

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.770 
really connected to the amount of money
that<00:03:09.020> that<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.950> state<00:03:10.160> has<00:03:10.400> here<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:11.060> less

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
that that the state has here this less

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.660 
that that the state has here this less
work<00:03:12.140> currently<00:03:12.740> for<00:03:12.980> architected<00:03:13.430> in<00:03:13.520> kind

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
work currently for architected in kind

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.970 
work currently for architected in kind
of<00:03:13.700> European<00:03:13.910> nations<00:03:14.510> at<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.560> moment<00:03:15.860> but

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
of European nations at the moment but

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.500 
of European nations at the moment but
there's<00:03:16.160> always<00:03:16.280> work<00:03:16.550> in<00:03:16.760> in<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.120> realm<00:03:17.420> of

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
there's always work in in the realm of

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.450 
there's always work in in the realm of
design<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.080> so<00:03:18.410> someone<00:03:18.770> wanted<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.070> become

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
design and so someone wanted to become

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.160 
design and so someone wanted to become
an<00:03:19.550> architect<00:03:19.700> what's<00:03:20.270> one<00:03:20.510> piece<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:20.930> advice

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
an architect what's one piece of advice

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.570 
an architect what's one piece of advice
you<00:03:21.320> would<00:03:21.410> give<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:21.800> think<00:03:21.980> it's<00:03:22.280> really<00:03:22.430> about

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
you would give I think it's really about

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.130 
you would give I think it's really about
kind<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:22.910> immersing<00:03:23.390> themselves<00:03:23.540> within<00:03:24.050> the

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
kind of immersing themselves within the

wonderful<00:03:40.970> Jesse<00:03:41.210> okay<00:03:41.630> first<00:03:42.350> question<00:03:42.520> what

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
wonderful Jesse okay first question what

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.250 
wonderful Jesse okay first question what
characteristics<00:03:44.330> does<00:03:44.480> someone<00:03:44.840> need<00:03:44.990> to<00:03:45.140> be

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
characteristics does someone need to be

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.530 
characteristics does someone need to be
an<00:03:45.350> architect<00:03:45.740> I<00:03:45.950> think<00:03:46.610> very<00:03:46.970> much<00:03:47.120> the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
an architect I think very much the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.530 
an architect I think very much the
creativity<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.890> also<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.490> kind<00:03:49.610> of<00:03:49.760> science

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
creativity and also the kind of science

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.930 
creativity and also the kind of science
base<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.380> ability<00:03:51.740> to<00:03:51.770> hold<00:03:52.430> a<00:03:52.520> number<00:03:52.670> of

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
base the ability to hold a number of

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.520 
base the ability to hold a number of
different<00:03:53.360> aspects<00:03:53.660> in<00:03:53.750> their<00:03:53.900> head<00:03:54.080> at<00:03:54.320> once

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
different aspects in their head at once

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.740 
different aspects in their head at once
whether<00:03:55.490> they're<00:03:55.730> pragmatic<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.390> creative

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
whether they're pragmatic and creative

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.480 
whether they're pragmatic and creative
aspects<00:03:57.140> being<00:03:57.740> able<00:03:57.830> to<00:03:57.950> sort<00:03:58.190> of<00:03:58.220> deal<00:03:58.460> with

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
aspects being able to sort of deal with

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.790 
aspects being able to sort of deal with
some<00:03:58.730> such<00:03:58.940> Center<00:03:59.270> and<00:03:59.540> if<00:03:59.930> you<00:04:00.140> could<00:04:00.380> end<00:04:00.590> up

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
some such Center and if you could end up

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.920 
some such Center and if you could end up
where<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.460> are<00:04:01.580> today<00:04:01.730> but<00:04:02.360> do<00:04:02.510> one<00:04:02.720> thing

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
where you are today but do one thing

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.300 
where you are today but do one thing
differently<00:04:03.080> what<00:04:03.770> would<00:04:03.860> that<00:04:03.920> be

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
differently what would that be

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.940 
differently what would that be
probably<00:04:04.940> um<00:04:05.480> yeah<00:04:06.350> it's<00:04:06.530> been<00:04:06.650> more<00:04:06.800> time

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
probably um yeah it's been more time

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.190 
probably um yeah it's been more time

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
architecture accreditation accepts which

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.580 
architecture accreditation accepts which
actually<00:04:33.330> very<00:04:33.480> difficult<00:04:33.630> exams<00:04:34.200> tell<00:04:34.500> me

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.700 
to that water safety yeah okay so if you
like<00:04:57.180> building<00:04:57.570> Lego<00:04:57.870> or<00:04:58.050> playing<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.440> scenes

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710
