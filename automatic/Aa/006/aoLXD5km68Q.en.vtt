only background is in corporate affairs

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.910 
only background is in corporate affairs
to<00:01:04.180> try<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.420> do<00:01:04.600> a<00:01:04.630> job<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:04.960> at<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.890> very

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
to try to do a job that at the very

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.550 
to try to do a job that at the very
least<00:01:06.220> is<00:01:06.400> going<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.610> take<00:01:06.820> you<00:01:07.690> know<00:01:07.810> 10<00:01:08.320> years

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
deserves that he commands and be led to

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.210 
deserves that he commands and be led to
do<00:01:15.700> his<00:01:15.820> job<00:01:15.850> America<00:01:16.840> stands<00:01:17.350> way<00:01:17.950> better
