00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:13.320
 the comrade my intention again 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.520
 we left the wing bestbuy 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.040
 and we already bought our graphic card 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.190
 It was not the one I asked for, it was not the one I 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.190
 wanted to 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.830
 but we get more or less 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.280
 although I did not get what I wanted a 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.980
 super person because it was not compatible 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.950
 with the card 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.950
 but we get is what it's called 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:58.780
 Tex tex giffords and 250 sentences of 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.879
 more games 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.160
 these recent lords and after 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.520
 a superstition 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.270
 that almost the human parts of samuel do not 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.630
 have him now, we are already on our way 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.630
 to home 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.450
 and let's go to more 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:34.479
 well I do not see any care you're going to 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.900
 crash someone 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.900
 you arrive at the house 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.310
 we have made good that we already have it 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.310
 we also have 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:58.790
 Internal external hardware of 2 GB 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:04.310
 but the 22 and 20 to fill it 1 for 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:07.940
 gaming and 1 for my bag that's why not for 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.040
 video for non-stop video games and one 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.540
 it seems my personal use three videos 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.940
 family parties 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.210
 Well, I do not think I'm going to go up but maybe 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.460

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.880
 Let's enjoy Alexis at night 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.420
 dinners is the same but with lights now and 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:32.000
 more expensive because they all come out 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.990

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.750
 then then the computer and have 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:55.950
 an i7 processor with that wake tells me 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.950
 it was going to be much faster 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.450
 we're going to put the 16 of ram but 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.270
 you said the processor is much better 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.720
 that the one that has right now 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:13.920
 that because processors that is the same 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.260

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.989
 I remember the amount but it is more 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.360
 much better than what will remain as a 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.360
 card did not have 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:43.530
