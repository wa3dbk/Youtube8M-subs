00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello humans here we are one more 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.200
 gathered to show you 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:16.580
 something interesting in the world 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:21.380
 in fact we are with the game because it is 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:25.500
 playing and when suddenly so much andrÃ© 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.369
 we found a playground 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:35.160
 Can you enter the playground? 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:49.890
 replied that you can actually enter the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:57.180
 playground was my second question 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:02.070
 You can play on the slide and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.219
 I suddenly discovered that I can play in the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.219
 slide 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.380
 until I decided to stay here 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:44.150
 there we roll we discover that a 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.770
 theory that had been widely disseminated 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.770
 time of the good resident and 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.110
 I gave your confirmation 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:06.340
 I particularly think it's crazy is 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:31.760
 well this was one of the pearls and 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.510
 do not forget also the longing 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.510
 Just kidding
