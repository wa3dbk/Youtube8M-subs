 Coordinator is a children's party on the Bult 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.059
 and yes that is about 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.230
 one of his best children is liquid 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.090
 but we also need to change that to the point 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.519
 a team Deathmatch 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.820
 otherwise our KERS played as percent FSK with Excel Macs 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.460
 to be parents is opened Euro 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.410
 and Marton 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.899
 his only one heavier than usual 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.349
 and I do not have that much, at least in public 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.610
 More than three and a half percent has been calculated 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.610
 in order to play a market segment a little more defensive 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.900
 so if I use myself then that is or they are in II 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.149
 be complete so 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.530
 completely or around Reyna "and over and over again this is the way of racing but 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.949
 I'll be off so fast 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.340
 In addition probably does not want the age for good times 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.170
 come to the other side of the Messe Basel as quickly as possible 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.649
 our top 4 percent policy intervention is unfortunately not yet fulfilled 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.309
 and barricading it around the races with a large entourage 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:02.660
 and 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.229
 so should the opponents so intercept 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.450
 and always were and always are not 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.420
 SOS for man rarely stops in front of all children all LG exactly my apartment 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.320
 At some point, everyone just wanted to kill everyone and that was not known at all 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.250
 Kind of play but if we get it done quite well, according to Maria Peitz 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.530
 he goes support 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.940
 the first one wants the very small bays at most around everyone 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.020
 serious game 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.450
 quite as bad as big 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.990
 then you can achieve this by setting up stores it's just always just 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.930
 found himself 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.110
 Natter percent as customers would do what because clearly the opponents around van 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.600
 but also want to run and insert 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.490
 to get used to simple as in anticipation of speed 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.330
 and yes, yes 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.010
 the process and so this is so there are normal so there is me 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.570
 it's me now i'm going to put on dress and then finally normal 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.540
 So I'm just as aggressive as some of us, but we see I do it 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.470
 somehow always thoughtful and I want, I'm just me again 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.630
 without problems around Reyna Â«and 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.909
 against opponents like elimination and it's like the warm-up why 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.769
 best tactics are needed ", said Vettel 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:10.729
 and 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.019
 sorry, Israeli kids do not care about us too much with us 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.989
 on the case that you next topic percent 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.569
 Century the case no longer the principle locations blue light 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:26.089
 because i am this year i am what is this system recognizes you with Robert 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:28.129
 Fico and I hate it that way 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.860
 I had mine in the big one 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.779
 and design and Wupper designed 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:36.209
 Simply embarrassing invites you to play and capture the flag more 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.289
 but how 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.079
 both sides are standing and not only interested 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.459
 and then one - albeit under changed plants in red handed 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.769
 they secure or 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.730
 Somehow something like that in Tirol is what I try and I have 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.880
 also do not want to make Mischa feel like in the 50s once 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.520
 Google wants in the fall a dollar or two on the iPad 2 - 2 seconds and 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.980
 Visum handicapped target after initially so Hartmann and let's wait is 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.320
 and Playa Dorada we do not mind 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.219
 what some fail 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:10.839
 Casey Chan 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.859
 Pauli be stopped 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.020
 finally 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.099
 after a hundred years again the 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.599
 behind the small airfield around 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.489
 For a good four years he was quite surprised when she saw him again 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.140
 as he great work the website in our society like that 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.699
 not even edgier 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:32.059
 financially self-made but with the man who decided to do so 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:34.149
 have to be on Schalke and 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:37.769
 Dirk some DDR no longer completely record or cut 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:43.209
 because of Jan Feddersen's importance as well, therefore, the work for it must be done 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.099
 So to a filmed holding wet wipes everything found 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.840
 and this must be my next percent 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:56.749
 later the 3m is also because a German many asked if 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:58.859
 I need that at all 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.939
 Yes, as in the previous year 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.749
 because overtake the 3d technology 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:06.129
 a very different than a threesome 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.669
 Percentage points increased 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.829
 new is the idea and came across here and 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.099
 because only game modes 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.849
 based on the 2 at which to visit which know what post 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:21.169
 I think about that I think I'm giving the beta 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.999
 But this limit weight of a ton 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:26.839
 I know how up-to-date every Pieper will be in Central Bohemia 

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:30.779
 but we with Siemens and Zettel is mp3 Dieter Koopmann already then 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.930
 you can read them 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.270
 probably must but as in Monza in September he should be ready then 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.539
 has to settle in nicely as always and there I can love for 3d 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:41.340
 play again 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.729
 it will certainly expect a lot 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.309
 Process on the heels but been 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:47.310
 necessary 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.300
 not quite sure 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.379
 there you have something completely different 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.110
 It has been achieved so that they have blue cubes 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.189
 People now from Cofidis too 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:57.680
 Vettel is missing 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.410
 adapted to be so Martha 3 is always percent of my everyday life and the 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.180
 the view will always be my number one that's always what they are 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.180
 most Rosendahl no matter what 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:15.139
 and then we all got away from us that our claims wanted to escape 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.210
 I already mentioned at a first show 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.599
 in Tibet human 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.539
 Percent what i know 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.119
 What is a pity both times is that it looks partly from the Erler 

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:28.020
 The most important thing is that they need to enumerate the winning picture 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.389
 to expect 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.299
 Percent on 8 points submitted by Jenny Theme 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.379
 bought around us a few years ago 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:37.839
 around 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:40.130
 Euro in any case I never know 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.990
 a bit stupid as Wikis deliver 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.249
 by behavior 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:48.360
 with RAM the PCR sometimes you can grow some joggers 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.149
 but ultimately the Mettmanner three times the entire team off 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:56.119
 Umberto Boccioni the door too and federal army below 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:58.889
 well sometimes the round is athletic fair 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.270
 Broder and they do not even go with me at most no hearing 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.190
 There is a danger that it will have an effect on itself 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.460
 inconsistent and you always like that 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.100
 It also feels like you have to leave and there is something to come and I hope so 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.990
 mp3 that will be a bit different 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.290
 Both winners of the game against Basel are already mentioned but I have 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:18.330
 even in the 7th 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.130
 had this aspect out of sight 30 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.920
 some see what in the end with Astro Multiplayer, however, it has recognized 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.680
 that it should be now because in the end it was all right and John Howett 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.680
 Signs that one has as criticism do not know 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.349
 So I hope that as they have to be more consistent with this 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.219
 yes what percent on the case that people expect so 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:46.059
 b2 is so great what I leave open even disturb the virtual 

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:48.419
 Reality is humorous percent yesterday 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:49.990
 Palmer information 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.029
 I still understand well mid 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:57.529
 Biel developer Bioware Information will not know Alma Mater until today 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.819
 Seen multiple, Auslese says a meadow a second behind 

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:05.449
 but sovereign and I have to title win, Porsche had next to 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:09.179
 Battlefield 3 is also a PC is already in the closed beta 

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:10.580
 played 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.060
 Of course, everyone knew that a few people are doing what we posted on it 

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:18.599
 and diamonds Luxembourg seen by the Federation and countries of the i3 

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:21.360
 and then either nothing at all 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.990
 and yes I would like to be there as well a plus there it is 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.800
 of course in marketing strategies 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.510
 and yes that was great the gm-plans said that even needs 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.510
 that is why twice daily of 21 9 

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:37.369
 it's not going to be easy Med 

00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:40.430
 so please who the video league on wednesday the incredible optics 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.259
 not be clarified 

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:44.409
 and they advise playful onlookers 

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:45.739
 after protests
