00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.259 
it should be pumping to the zone
let<00:02:35.470> me<00:02:35.560> sound<00:02:35.800> like<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.069> is<00:02:36.370> though<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:38.380> hot

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
let me sound like it is though so hot

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.090 
let me sound like it is though so hot
that<00:02:40.269> is<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.720> want<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.290> check<00:02:41.470> if<00:02:41.650> this<00:02:41.799> system

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
that is I want to check if this system

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.539 
that is I want to check if this system
pump<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.670> actually<00:02:42.880> pumping<00:02:45.510> okay<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:48.430> is

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
pump is actually pumping okay it is

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.670 
pump is actually pumping okay it is
pumping<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.569> could<00:02:49.750> probably<00:02:49.900> hear<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.440> same

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
pumping you could probably hear the same

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.840 
pumping you could probably hear the same
thing<00:02:51.010> where's<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.459> mics<00:02:51.670> on<00:02:51.850> this<00:02:52.000> thing<00:02:52.620> you

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
thing where's the mics on this thing you

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.309 
thing where's the mics on this thing you
put<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:54.880> screwdriver<00:02:55.150> up<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.690> your<00:02:55.810> ear<00:02:56.140> and

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
put a screwdriver up to your ear and

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:08.850 
put a screwdriver up to your ear and
then<00:02:57.310> put<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.730> on<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.120> pump

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:19.330 

you<00:03:09.860> can<00:03:09.980> hear<00:03:10.160> it<00:03:10.220> running<00:03:16.930> so<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:19.010> system

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
you can hear it running so the system

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.070 
you can hear it running so the system
pump<00:03:19.550> is<00:03:19.970> cooking<00:03:20.540> away<00:03:22.840> something<00:03:23.840> if<00:03:23.990> I<00:03:24.050> had

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
pump is cooking away something if I had

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.100 
pump is cooking away something if I had
to<00:03:24.290> do<00:03:24.410> some<00:03:24.620> playing<00:03:24.860> than<00:03:25.190> figure<00:03:25.580> in<00:03:25.730> and

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
to do some playing than figure in and

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.750 
to do some playing than figure in and
see<00:03:27.110> if<00:03:27.200> I<00:03:27.290> can<00:03:27.440> figure<00:03:27.650> out<00:03:27.770> why<00:03:28.220> this<00:03:28.280> water

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
see if I can figure out why this water

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.300 
see if I can figure out why this water
is<00:03:28.940> just<00:03:29.090> turning<00:03:29.450> in<00:03:29.690> here<00:03:30.070> figured<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.190> out

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
is just turning in here figured it out

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.260 
is just turning in here figured it out
the<00:03:32.060> house<00:03:32.300> zone<00:03:32.780> is<00:03:33.140> on<00:03:33.770> probably<00:03:34.640> bolt<00:03:34.970> zones

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
the house zone is on probably bolt zones

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.430 
the house zone is on probably bolt zones
because<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.690> heats<00:03:35.840> been<00:03:36.020> off<00:03:36.110> for<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.350> while

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
because the heats been off for a while

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.180 
because the heats been off for a while
and<00:03:37.430> when<00:03:38.030> that's<00:03:38.180> on<00:03:38.450> man<00:03:38.960> those<00:03:39.230> those<00:03:39.770> pumps

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
and when that's on man those those pumps

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.670 
and when that's on man those those pumps
are<00:03:40.310> powerful<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.060> basically<00:03:41.210> just<00:03:41.680> all

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
are powerful and it basically just all

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.980 
are powerful and it basically just all
goes<00:03:43.040> this<00:03:43.250> way<00:03:43.460> and<00:03:43.700> this<00:03:43.820> pump<00:03:44.090> had<00:03:44.810> never

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
goes this way and this pump had never

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.420 
goes this way and this pump had never
been<00:03:45.140> started<00:03:45.560> so<00:03:45.710> kinda<00:03:45.950> had<00:03:46.070> some<00:03:46.190> hair<00:03:46.400> in

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
been started so kinda had some hair in

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.370 
been started so kinda had some hair in
it<00:03:46.640> so<00:03:46.820> you<00:03:46.910> can<00:03:47.060> hear<00:03:47.270> it's<00:03:47.420> now<00:03:47.630> not<00:03:47.930> making

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
it so you can hear it's now not making

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.940 
it so you can hear it's now not making
all<00:03:48.500> that<00:03:48.620> noise<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:49.190> here<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.000> air<00:03:50.150> comes

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
all that noise and here the air comes

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.450 
all that noise and here the air comes
being<00:03:51.950> pushed<00:03:52.220> down<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.840> finding<00:03:54.560> its<00:03:54.710> way<00:03:54.770> so

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
being pushed down and finding its way so

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.840 
being pushed down and finding its way so
the<00:03:56.120> airs<00:03:56.360> going<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.570> work<00:03:56.690> itself<00:03:56.900> out<00:03:57.080> system

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
the airs going to work itself out system

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:08.070 
the airs going to work itself out system
keep<00:03:58.850> watching<00:03:59.480> what's<00:03:59.780> going<00:03:59.840> on

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080
