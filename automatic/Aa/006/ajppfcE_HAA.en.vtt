how to catch floats on the back of your
work<00:00:04.920> while<00:00:05.339> doing<00:00:05.670> stranded<00:00:06.210> knitting<00:00:06.440> we're

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
work while doing stranded knitting we're

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.370 
work while doing stranded knitting we're
going<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.770> be<00:00:07.890> doing<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.309> series<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:09.380> nine

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
going to be doing a series of nine

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.499 
going to be doing a series of nine
stitches<00:00:11.070> with<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.370> white<00:00:11.550> yarn<00:00:11.880> followed<00:00:12.360> by

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
stitches with the white yarn followed by

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.020 
stitches with the white yarn followed by
seven<00:00:12.990> stitches<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.799> blue<00:00:14.040> then<00:00:14.490> nine<00:00:14.730> of

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
seven stitches of the blue then nine of

seven stitches of the blue then nine of
the<00:00:15.179> white<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:15.870> we're<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.170> want<00:00:16.350> to

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
the white and so we're going to want to

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.570 
the white and so we're going to want to
catch<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.520> flow<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.940> behind<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.720> work

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
catch the flow to behind the work

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.040 
catch the flow to behind the work
generally<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.789> rule<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.180> thumb<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.630> if<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
generally the rule of thumb is if the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.560 
generally the rule of thumb is if the
float<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.529> going<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:23.100> an<00:00:23.340> inch<00:00:23.970> or<00:00:24.180> longer

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
float is going to be an inch or longer

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.029 
float is going to be an inch or longer
you'll<00:00:24.720> want<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.019> catch<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.590> back<00:00:25.890> of

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
you'll want to catch it on the back of

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.349 
you'll want to catch it on the back of
the<00:00:26.130> work<00:00:26.250> anything<00:00:26.730> longer<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.240> you're

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
the work anything longer and you're

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.720 
the work anything longer and you're
Fingal's<00:00:27.779> fingers<00:00:28.380> will<00:00:28.590> catch<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
Fingal's fingers will catch in the

one that's the middle it doesn't have to
be<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> middle<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.149> chose<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.780> then

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
be in the middle I just chose that then

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.560 
be in the middle I just chose that then
we're<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> take<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.579> blue<00:00:47.850> yarn<00:00:48.210> and

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
throw it over the needle as if we're

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.850 
throw it over the needle as if we're
going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> make<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> stitch<00:00:51.350> we<00:00:52.350> want<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> catch

the<00:00:53.070> blue<00:00:53.190> yarn<00:00:53.430> that's<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:53.850> we're<00:00:54.000> doing

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the blue yarn that's what we're doing

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.389 
the blue yarn that's what we're doing
then<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.930> put<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> white<00:00:55.469> yarn<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:55.890> if<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.219> make

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
then we put the white yarn as if to make

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.689 
then we put the white yarn as if to make
a<00:00:56.430> stitch<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.239> take<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.660> blue<00:00:57.989> yarn<00:00:58.289> off
