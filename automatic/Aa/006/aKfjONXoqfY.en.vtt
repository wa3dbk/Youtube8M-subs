00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:15.899
 in this landscape today dominated by arid soil and pieces of debris 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.649
 once stretched a lush and flowery garden of Charente and 

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:23.919
 palm 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.749
 ancient documents indicates that an euphrates arm and many channels 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.519
 to cross to the group which made of it a real resistance 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.430
 the German geophysicist there is in front of an hour to make a magneto 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.980
 grams of the entire site to get a representation of his 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.220
 subsoil 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.080
 to this end 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.530
 it is delimited squares of 40 meters by 40 each 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.010
 the measuring segments confirm the indications of the old documents 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.840
 as shown by the magneto grams a network of squared streams 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.840
 actually to the group 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.409
 the commercial metropolis was traversed by wide waterways and 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.409
 small canals to avoid gardens 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.970
 there may have even been a fluvial traffic to the group 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.060
 why is it not boring following the magnetic measurements carried out in 2001 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.230
 and 2002 an escalator we had to completely review our vision of the 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.430
 town he sticks today I think she was much greener 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.900
 is more watered with streams as experts believe tracked is this 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.340
 that it's also worth it that a channel runs all around the distant city with 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.670
 him and that in the opinion of many small pebbles irie that she is on the spot what 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.860
 Saturday without tie 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.280
 so it was a region of very green franÃ§ois sauvadet is increased a 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.830
 at the base to this race and style 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.270
 other geological surveys have confirmed this analysis 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.270
 and allowed to further explain the presence of these strange world 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.229
 these are sediments that have settled at the bottom of the canals over 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.259
 centuries 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.599
 their hardness 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.850
 Helped them to better resist erosion 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.850
 unlike arable soil 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.599
 with his discoveries 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.109
 this is the first time that researchers have observed a concordance between 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.969
 data collected in the field and texts 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.969
 of the time 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.059
 know how to take advantage of water 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:38.149
 show great ingenuity 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.149
 and a revolutionary drink for his day 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.959
 the city have at least one water door to access these three 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.049
 body 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.419
 to bring goods it was necessary to go through this is of course 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.419
 Yes 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:07.819
 thanks to satellite photos of Iraqi reliefs 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.829
 we can now reconstruct the map of this region of the world ago 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.079
 5000 years 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.829
 gourcuff 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.849
 and I received main city of the Sumerian civilization 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.999
 so it was established in a totally different landscape 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:27.859
 at that time the confluence of the tiger and the euphrates was more 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.859
 North 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.419
 on this clay tablet that feature the plan of the city of Stern Nis 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.499
 we can see the exact location of the temple and the enclosure that protected 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.689
 the city 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.010
 to the west of the wall sink the frac part of which had been 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:51.009
 diverted to overcome the rise of the city 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.449
 the big cities were built on the water's edge 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.220
 this ultimate round is located 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.679
 in the middle of four thousand hectares of cereal fields 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:13.649
 at the harbor received merchants from the Persian Gulf 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:17.359
 and exports food thousands of miles away to 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.169
 Arabian Peninsula 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.580
 all the activity of the city crystallize around the temple 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.830
 place of prayer in which all political decisions economy 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.289
 behind a wall eight meters high 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.360
 houses pile up into a motley ensemble 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.490
 in the narrow and winding streets 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.460
 the drain is nonexistent 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.449
 the garbage did not want to copy the facades when she was not 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.029
 simply head allies on the pavement 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:01.879
 the three-storey buildings rub shoulders with the buildings arte a single level 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:05.839
 no dwelling was aligned with its neighbor 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.059
 port-au-prince some ventilation holes 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.270
 the faÃ§ades had practically no opening 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.370
 inhabitants denounce protect as well as heat and devoid of 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.860
 dust
