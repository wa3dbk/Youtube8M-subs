 our team was in the minority and 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.030

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.140
 implementation of the majority 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.620
 There were moments among the Russians in the first period 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.650
 but such self-reliance and 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.450
 fly they that by and large nothing 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.350
 do not let a serious drug 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.050
 this moment when stealing from profitable 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.330
 positions could not be abandoned further 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.030

 gates well and your goal is mostly ours 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.880
 the team managed to build later in this 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:48.610
 episode unlucky Onishchenko inept 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.610
 send the puck into the goal 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.480
 it rallied together on a bench 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.000
 the danish team thinks that ours 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.120

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.900
 Sorokin himself Tolchinsky technical 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.450
