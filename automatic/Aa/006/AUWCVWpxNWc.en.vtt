00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:10.000
So! Today 
we have no homework!
That's good! It means I can immediately study now!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Yes! Tomorrow we are writing an exam in biology. I don't want to fail at it!

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.500
Oh yes!

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.400
Oh no, the book..! It's gone!

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:35.300
Hahaha - Today we didn't even have biology! Yes! It's in my desk! Yes! Let's search for it now.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.300
Aah! There it is!

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.800
"Erlebnis Biologie" (Experience Biology) - My favourite book!

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.900
So.. it was.. page number.. 172, exactly.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.800
Heh! I'm a smart "Gockel".

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:08.800
So.. the ecosystems. Explain ecosystem, biotope and biocenosis. Use the words "living space and community"

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.900
Yeah! I shall take this information from the book! And tomorrow I will know everything.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.500
What do YOU want?

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.100
I wanted to ask you if you could lend me that one CD, I want to burn it.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:34.900
BURN IT? You mean.. creating a pirate copy of it? That's violating the law! It's ILLEGAL!

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:47.000
Just wait you rascal! I'm gonna knock the nonsense out of your head! Get out of here! I don't wanna have to do anything with you and your criminal wheeling and dealing!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.300
Hold on.. you are reported! Yeah yeah..

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.000
Yeah.. the last time I let him go, when he stole the sweets from the bakery.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.700
He came home and was like "I'm a real gangster, I'm doing this and that" - but this time he went too far!

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:17.700
Yeah.. they are gonna put him in a institution, and they are gonna make a better person out of him! Yeah yeah.. that madman..

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.800
No! There is no excuse, you bandit! You're reported! It's too late now!

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.000
Yeah. Is this the police? Good day. I want to report that my brother acts illegal.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400
He creates pirate copies of CD's!

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:59.500
But I don't have a car to.. to.. to drive to you. You have to come here! Search through his house! That's your task! YOU MANIAC!

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:10.800
Hold on.. woah.. the police from today.. she doesn't care about anything anymore! You have to do everything by yourself! That's a insolence..!
