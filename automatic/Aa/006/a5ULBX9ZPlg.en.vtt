00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.880 

so<00:05:17.570> we've<00:05:17.750> left<00:05:17.930> Havana<00:05:18.140> and<00:05:18.530> reached<00:05:18.710> our

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
so we've left Havana and reached our

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.830 
so we've left Havana and reached our
targets<00:05:19.220> hideout<00:05:19.580> here<00:05:20.240> we<00:05:20.420> can<00:05:20.570> see<00:05:20.690> that

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
distance so we'll have to go through

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.940 
distance so we'll have to go through
this<00:05:24.320> jungle<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.890> get<00:05:25.040> to<00:05:25.160> him
