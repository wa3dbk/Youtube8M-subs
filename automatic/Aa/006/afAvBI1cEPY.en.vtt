switch to the videomic pro this is the
videomic<00:01:19.920> pro<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.400> its<00:01:20.549> normal<00:01:20.970> setting<00:01:21.360> uh

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
videomic pro on its normal setting uh

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.620 
videomic pro on its normal setting uh
all<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.560> these<00:01:22.799> audio<00:01:23.310> clips<00:01:23.640> will<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.970> totally

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
all of these audio clips will be totally

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.830 
all of these audio clips will be totally
unaltered<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.250> everything's<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.360> totally

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
unaltered so everything's just totally

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.520 
unaltered so everything's just totally
as<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.380> straight<00:01:28.740> out<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> camera

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
as it is straight out of the camera

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.550 
as it is straight out of the camera
except<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.770> might<00:01:32.430> adjust<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.960> volume

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
except I might adjust to just the volume

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.560 
except I might adjust to just the volume
of<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.640> playback<00:01:36.180> because<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.979> example

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
of the playback because like for example

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.390 
of the playback because like for example
you<00:01:39.570> don't<00:01:39.750> want<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.290> having<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.829> turn

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
you don't want to be like having to turn

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.520 
you don't want to be like having to turn
up<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.790> down<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:41.970> speakers<00:01:42.659> speak<00:01:42.960> all<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
up and down your speakers speak all the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.350 
up and down your speakers speak all the
time<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.850> getting<00:01:45.030> louder

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
time because it's like getting louder

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.460 
time because it's like getting louder
and<00:01:45.509> softer<00:01:46.040> but<00:01:47.040> here's<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.750> did<00:01:48.960> notice

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
and softer but here's what I did notice

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.789 
and softer but here's what I did notice
on<00:01:49.860> all<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.090> other<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:52.140> all<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
on all of the other or all of the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.090 
on all of the other or all of the
built-in<00:01:53.750> microphone<00:01:54.750> shots<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.409> pretty<00:01:56.009> much

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
built-in microphone shots I pretty much

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.630 
built-in microphone shots I pretty much
left<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.790> audio<00:01:57.210> level<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.899> final<00:01:58.439> cut<00:01:58.640> at

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
left the audio level and final cut at

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.230 
left the audio level and final cut at
zero<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:02.159> it's<00:02:02.310> at<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.909> normal

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
zero and so it's at it's just normal

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.530 
zero and so it's at it's just normal
level<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.020> all<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.250> rode<00:02:05.520> videomic<00:02:05.729> pro

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
level and all of the rode videomic pro

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.570 
level and all of the rode videomic pro
audio<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:08.420> had<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.629> bring<00:02:10.050> down<00:02:10.440> because<00:02:11.039> it

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
audio I had to bring down because it

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.820 
audio I had to bring down because it
plays<00:02:11.940> back<00:02:12.330> really<00:02:13.290> loud

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
plays back really loud

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.550 
plays back really loud
so<00:02:14.460> here<00:02:14.910> if<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.150> bring<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.570> volume<00:02:15.750> back<00:02:16.110> up<00:02:16.350> to

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
so here if I bring the volume back up to

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.640 
so here if I bring the volume back up to
where<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.830> would<00:02:17.070> normally<00:02:17.430> be<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.440> how

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
where it would normally be this is how

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.360 
where it would normally be this is how
loud<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.310> would<00:02:20.550> be<00:02:20.730> talking<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:22.770> can<00:02:22.950> hear

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
loud I would be talking and you can hear

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.810 
loud I would be talking and you can hear
depending<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.450> have<00:02:24.630> your<00:02:24.780> speaker's<00:02:25.050> up

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
depending if you have your speaker's up

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.090 
depending if you have your speaker's up
or<00:02:26.820> if<00:02:27.240> your<00:02:27.630> prison<00:02:28.380> whatever<00:02:28.710> reason

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
or if your prison whatever reason

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.880 
or if your prison whatever reason
adjusting<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.090> lower<00:02:30.330> like<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.840> should<00:02:31.650> be

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
adjusting it lower like I should be

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.050 
adjusting it lower like I should be
doing<00:02:32.070> right<00:02:32.250> now<00:02:33.980> like<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.250> can<00:02:35.460> hear<00:02:35.880> all

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
doing right now like you can hear all

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.450 
doing right now like you can hear all
the<00:02:36.630> static<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.380> oh<00:02:39.290> what<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.500> actually<00:02:41.010> kind

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
the static and oh what I actually kind

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.530 
the static and oh what I actually kind
of<00:02:41.550> like<00:02:41.610> is<00:02:42.410> because<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.620> records<00:02:44.190> stuff<00:02:44.730> so

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
of like is because it records stuff so

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.680 
of like is because it records stuff so
loud<00:02:45.900> it's<00:02:46.710> kind<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.040> hard<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:47.970> explain<00:02:48.210> but

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
loud it's kind of hard to explain but

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.380 
loud it's kind of hard to explain but
because<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.530> records<00:02:49.860> stuff<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.610> loud<00:02:50.910> you

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
because it records stuff so loud you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.390 
because it records stuff so loud you
have<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.660> bring<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.110> down<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.770> it's<00:02:52.950> not<00:02:53.100> at

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
have to bring it down so it's not at

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.660 
have to bring it down so it's not at
like<00:02:53.640> an<00:02:54.020> irritating<00:02:55.020> loudness<00:02:55.950> or<00:02:56.430> it's<00:02:56.580> an

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
like an irritating loudness or it's an

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.270 
like an irritating loudness or it's an
actual<00:02:57.090> like<00:02:57.300> realistic<00:02:57.959> audio<00:02:58.410> level<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.010> have

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
actual like realistic audio level I have

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.670 
actual like realistic audio level I have
to<00:02:59.459> bring<00:02:59.700> it<00:02:59.820> down<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.630> all<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.020> static<00:03:01.350> that

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
to bring it down so all the static that

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.460 
to bring it down so all the static that
you'd<00:03:01.890> hear<00:03:02.250> would<00:03:02.730> be<00:03:03.120> brought<00:03:03.540> down<00:03:03.870> as<00:03:04.230> well

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
you'd hear would be brought down as well

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.010 
you'd hear would be brought down as well
so<00:03:04.800> then<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.310> don't<00:03:05.490> hear<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.970> static<00:03:06.209> so

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
so then you don't hear the static so

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.150 
so then you don't hear the static so
again<00:03:07.730> unaltered<00:03:08.730> everything<00:03:09.390> audio<00:03:10.160> totally

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
again unaltered everything audio totally

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.660 
again unaltered everything audio totally
just<00:03:11.390> right<00:03:12.390> out<00:03:12.570> of<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.750> camera<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.320> now<00:03:14.250> i'm

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
just right out of the camera and now i'm

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.390 
just right out of the camera and now i'm
going<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.030> keyframe<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.020> bring<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.410> down<00:03:16.650> to

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
going to keyframe it to bring it down to

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.759 
going to keyframe it to bring it down to
where<00:03:17.520> it<00:03:17.580> actually<00:03:17.940> should<00:03:18.209> be<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.410> final

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
where it actually should be in the final

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.970 
where it actually should be in the final
composite<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:21.060> again<00:03:21.300> testing<00:03:22.050> testing<00:03:22.290> 123

composite so again testing testing 123
and<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:24.420> testing<00:03:24.930> testing<00:03:25.550> 321<00:03:26.550> to<00:03:27.000> mix<00:03:27.300> it<00:03:27.480> up<00:03:27.570> a

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
and a testing testing 321 to mix it up a

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.540 
and a testing testing 321 to mix it up a
bit<00:03:29.540> yeah<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.570> don't<00:03:30.840> know<00:03:30.900> either<00:03:31.110> so<00:03:31.950> again

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
bit yeah I don't know either so again

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.820 
bit yeah I don't know either so again

this<00:03:38.730> setting<00:03:39.230> there<00:03:40.230> are<00:03:40.500> pretty<00:03:41.130> much<00:03:41.280> three

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
this setting there are pretty much three

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.479 
this setting there are pretty much three
settings<00:03:42.090> will<00:03:42.390> ones<00:03:43.050> off<00:03:43.440> then<00:03:44.190> there's

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
settings will ones off then there's

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.729 
settings will ones off then there's

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
normal setting in a high-pass filter and

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.220 
normal setting in a high-pass filter and
what<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.340> high-pass<00:03:47.820> does<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.959> highs

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
what the high-pass does is the highs

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.830 
what the high-pass does is the highs
pass<00:03:49.800> and<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.280> lows<00:03:50.459> don't<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.510> if<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:51.690> have

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
pass and the lows don't so if you have

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.310

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.720 
like air conditioner rumble or some low
sound<00:03:56.630> that<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.900> don't<00:03:58.110> want<00:03:58.380> in<00:03:58.620> your<00:03:58.730> audio

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
sound that you don't want in your audio

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.479 
sound that you don't want in your audio
recording<00:04:00.209> that's<00:04:00.780> when<00:04:01.050> you<00:04:01.170> turn<00:04:01.440> it<00:04:01.590> on<00:04:01.739> but

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489

right now there's no low rumbling sounds

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.400 
right now there's no low rumbling sounds
so<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:05.880> wouldn't<00:04:06.630> you<00:04:06.870> wouldn't<00:04:07.110> hear<00:04:07.380> a

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
so I wouldn't you wouldn't hear a

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.009 
so I wouldn't you wouldn't hear a
difference<00:04:07.830> if<00:04:08.730> I<00:04:08.880> turn<00:04:09.060> that<00:04:09.239> sitting<00:04:09.600> on<00:04:09.750> and

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
difference if I turn that sitting on and

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.470 
difference if I turn that sitting on and
there's<00:04:10.650> three<00:04:11.160> more<00:04:11.430> settings<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.239> that's

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
there's three more settings and that's

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.159 
there's three more settings and that's
just<00:04:12.810> recording<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.650> one<00:04:14.459> audio<00:04:14.970> level<00:04:15.540> you

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
just recording the one audio level you

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.409 
just recording the one audio level you
want<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.560> record<00:04:16.890> at<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.489> i'm<00:04:17.970> going<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.239> show

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
want to record at and i'm going to show

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.129 
want to record at and i'm going to show
you<00:04:18.450> that<00:04:18.720> on<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.169> mic<00:04:19.410> right<00:04:20.209> here

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.559 

as<00:04:25.139> you<00:04:25.349> can<00:04:25.470> see<00:04:25.680> there<00:04:26.280> is<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.699> on<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.389> off

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:27.569 
as you can see there is the on and off

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.439 
as you can see there is the on and off
and<00:04:27.629> that's<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.470> high<00:04:28.710> pass<00:04:29.039> over<00:04:29.490> there<00:04:29.699> then

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
and that's the high pass over there then

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.080 
and that's the high pass over there then
right<00:04:31.379> now<00:04:31.530> it's<00:04:31.710> on<00:04:31.860> normal<00:04:32.310> which<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.490> zero

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
right now it's on normal which is zero

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.249 
right now it's on normal which is zero
and<00:04:33.469> the<00:04:34.469> plus<00:04:34.770> 20<00:04:35.310> is<00:04:35.460> for<00:04:36.180> recording<00:04:36.750> really

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
and the plus 20 is for recording really

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.670 
and the plus 20 is for recording really
really<00:04:37.919> soft<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.699> quiet<00:04:39.210> sounds<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.139> it

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
really soft and quiet sounds and it

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.420 
really soft and quiet sounds and it
boosted<00:04:41.340> 20<00:04:42.030> decibels<00:04:42.569> and<00:04:43.050> then<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.039> minus

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
boosted 20 decibels and then the minus

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.029 
boosted 20 decibels and then the minus
10<00:04:44.699> is<00:04:44.729> for<00:04:45.120> recording<00:04:46.110> really<00:04:46.439> really<00:04:46.770> loud

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
10 is for recording really really loud

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.459 
10 is for recording really really loud
sounds<00:04:47.759> so<00:04:48.330> like<00:04:48.509> if<00:04:48.689> I<00:04:48.930> don't<00:04:49.080> know<00:04:49.289> maybe

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:49.469 
sounds so like if I don't know maybe

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:51.830 
sounds so like if I don't know maybe
fireworks<00:04:50.250> or<00:04:50.520> you're<00:04:50.729> blowing<00:04:51.270> something<00:04:51.539> up

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
fireworks or you're blowing something up

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.740 
fireworks or you're blowing something up
you<00:04:52.560> know<00:04:52.650> because<00:04:53.009> why<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.400> hell<00:04:53.610> not<00:04:53.750> the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
you know because why the hell not the

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.490 
you know because why the hell not the
sound<00:04:55.050> won't<00:04:55.409> clip<00:04:56.120> as<00:04:57.120> much<00:04:57.900> depending<00:04:58.409> on

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
sound won't clip as much depending on

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.950 
sound won't clip as much depending on
how<00:04:58.680> loud<00:04:58.949> it<00:04:59.129> is<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.789> sound<00:05:00.060> won't<00:05:00.240> clip<00:05:00.659> when

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
how loud it is the sound won't clip when

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.070 
how loud it is the sound won't clip when
it's<00:05:01.139> on<00:05:01.409> negative<00:05:02.400> 10<00:05:02.669> so<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:03.539> negative<00:05:03.870> 10

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
it's on negative 10 so the negative 10

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.830 
it's on negative 10 so the negative 10
essentially<00:05:04.620> just<00:05:05.090> records<00:05:06.090> it<00:05:06.210> at<00:05:06.360> a<00:05:06.569> lower

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
essentially just records it at a lower

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.649 
essentially just records it at a lower
level<00:05:06.990> oh<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:08.580> if<00:05:08.729> you're<00:05:08.819> wondering<00:05:08.879> why<00:05:09.419> my

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:23.219 
better now all right now I'm talking

better now all right now I'm talking
normal<00:06:23.879> with<00:06:24.060> the<00:06:24.300> setting<00:06:24.870> on<00:06:25.110> negative<00:06:25.710> 10

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
normal with the setting on negative 10

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.929 
normal with the setting on negative 10
so<00:06:26.729> you<00:06:26.789> should<00:06:27.710> my<00:06:28.710> voice<00:06:28.949> should<00:06:29.249> be<00:06:29.550> at<00:06:29.789> a

so you should my voice should be at a

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.409 
so you should my voice should be at a
lower<00:06:30.270> volume<00:06:30.650> on<00:06:31.650> the<00:06:31.889> recording<00:06:32.400> and<00:06:32.580> you're

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
lower volume on the recording and you're

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.510 
lower volume on the recording and you're
probably<00:06:33.810> not<00:06:34.319> going<00:06:34.589> to<00:06:34.680> hear<00:06:34.889> me<00:06:35.039> whisper<00:06:35.490> I

probably not going to hear me whisper I

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.110 
probably not going to hear me whisper I
don't<00:06:35.849> know<00:06:35.909> how<00:06:37.310> how<00:06:38.310> much<00:06:38.639> it<00:06:38.939> actually

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
don't know how how much it actually

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.110 
don't know how how much it actually
records<00:06:39.839> or<00:06:39.990> what<00:06:40.139> the<00:06:40.289> range<00:06:40.560> of<00:06:40.830> volume<00:06:41.460> if

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
records or what the range of volume if

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:58.769 
records or what the range of volume if
you<00:06:42.300> will<00:06:42.479> is

00:06:58.769 --> 00:06:58.779 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:01.179 

so<00:06:59.779> that<00:06:59.930> should<00:07:00.139> give<00:07:00.169> you<00:07:00.439> an<00:07:00.559> idea<00:07:00.680> of<00:07:00.919> what
