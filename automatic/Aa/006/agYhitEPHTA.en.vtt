00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:18.680
 here is in spanish panda this new 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.900
 ducati multistrada 12/100 s version 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.720
 touring with 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.099
 lateral it's just an evolution is 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.020
 especially an evolution that touches one goes 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.270
 say the multiplicity of models 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.790
 multistrada because today he goes there 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.540
 have in the catalog 4 multistrada 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.910
 different 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.559
 a soft without soft multistrada in 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.400
 before we called standard and who 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.620
 is called a multi strana 12/100 s 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.760
 touring so that we have with a 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.280
 pair of side cases 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.699
 a version called gran turismo 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.339
 with even bigger suitcases a 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.170
 fairing protecting lamps 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.170
 additional heated grips 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.100
 standard livery and a version always 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.549
 sweet without s not explain reference 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.760
 to the machine that made this times 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.520
 are the ones that the famous 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.680
 visually the multistrada evolves enough 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.780
 little can we say for this remodeling 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.210
 the front side was a little bit 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.670
 redesigned with one who calls the beak 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.310
 he has a little less prominent then 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.300
 the full headlights remain traditional 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.280
 Arcade rooms of the bulbs 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.380
 traditional but fires 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.250
 crossing and night light smells 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.280
 now using 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.860
 we go back a little bit to talk 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.700
 as of this small change that 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.950
 is about the bubble 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.000
 before he had unscrewed with 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.820
 wheels to adjust the height 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.490
 today a kind of tongs that 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.979
 unlocks the bubble and she slips on 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.690
 six positions as big different and 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.200
 which makes that by rolling a single 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.310
 hand we can climb it lower it 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.960
 especially that I do about 1 m 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.520
 80 is in the upper position 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.380
 we do not really have that turbulence 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.420
 it's not bad about the engine of 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.479
 this multistrada we find the famous 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.000
 testastretta then your modification 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.440
 he wins at all the pictures the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.790
 power remains the same ie 150 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.080
 shows in power 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.540
 as well as saying that there are really 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.200
 enough and above all it's very simple 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.610
 picture 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.709
 it also helps to gain a little bit 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.750
 as a couple so we go from 12 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:26.340
 m kg at 12.7 m kg and at go-around 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.340
 too much his essay not bad 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.019
 this is the basic version until the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.629
 most advanced version and read the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.610
 traction control plus drop 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.989
 no need to add in August there are 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.790
 quite free is original but mostly 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:51.360
 the little thing of his models 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.180
 2013 this ducati worked on the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.810
 suspensions to review the management 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.790
 electric driving way the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.620
 hydraulic management of the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.440
 prestressing and relaxation of 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.450
 suspensions with a system that 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.030
 is called skyhook so that's a 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.709
 voyeur is a little pearl of the service 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.540
 marketing model it's hard to know 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.430
 exactly what does that mean 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.680
 all we know is that it's a 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.420
 system we already saw in 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.670
 the automobile and the one that comes back in the 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.640
 motorcycle ie the suspension 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.060
 continuously analyzes the state in the 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.299
 route and adjust the settings accordingly 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.890
 the degradation of this one compared to 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.420
 these to the system before it's not the 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.980
 revolution 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.930
 good and I think he'll have to 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.540
 we push the tests even further 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.430
 to see if it's really there 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.560
 really brings something because 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.780
 we are not 100% convinced 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.989
 in any case what we offer is the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.290
 ducati approach to try not 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.810
 to bring more security his 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.330
 motorcycle behavior this is the second 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.709
 question also which has significant enough and 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.220
 we are going to ask is the question of 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.900
 aging 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.180
 what will become of these advanced systems or 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.920
 who ask in any case a state of the 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.660
 perfect harness what 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.599
 that it will become in time is this 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.010
 that I will be able to sell it without 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.169
 worries or so will we have to 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:23.000
 to look at the aging of its 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:25.880
 sensors its taken we do not know I you 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.440
 say very soon in the magazine mode 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.479
 paper with letting this count 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.250
 multistrada and then mostly will want 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.580
 gives us an appointment in the years to 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.889
 come 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.370
 not to see a little bit the mine he 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.370
 is all this 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.490
 well my work allows to intervene 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.380
 also are pre-settings of 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:04.960
 suspension he fell to 18 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:07.150
 it was able to walk and their noses 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.790
 put on a mode in the office what 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.790
 novel we pick up all red
