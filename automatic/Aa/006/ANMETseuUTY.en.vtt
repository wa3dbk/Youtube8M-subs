bank of batteries there's a 1.2 volt
batteries<00:01:34.130> each<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.759> as<00:01:35.359> I've<00:01:35.569> been<00:01:35.719> charging

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
batteries each and as I've been charging

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.599 
batteries each and as I've been charging
them<00:01:36.560> up<00:01:36.710> they've<00:01:36.890> been<00:01:37.009> holding<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.369> charge

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
them up they've been holding a charge

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.819 
them up they've been holding a charge
these<00:01:38.539> are<00:01:38.689> all<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.929> other<00:01:38.960> ones<00:01:39.319> I<00:01:39.469> just<00:01:39.500> got

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
these are all the other ones I just got

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.969 
these are all the other ones I just got
to<00:01:39.920> come<00:01:40.039> up<00:01:40.069> with<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.369> wire<00:01:40.549> connectors<00:01:41.119> for

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
to come up with the wire connectors for

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.709 
to come up with the wire connectors for
and<00:01:42.979> hook<00:01:43.189> them<00:01:43.369> up<00:01:43.429> some<00:01:44.119> of<00:01:44.240> these<00:01:44.329> have<00:01:44.509> got

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
and hook them up some of these have got

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.190 
and hook them up some of these have got
broken<00:01:45.079> off<00:01:45.200> terminals<00:01:45.770> like<00:01:45.950> this<00:01:46.130> one<00:01:46.310> here

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
broken off terminals like this one here

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.949 
broken off terminals like this one here
but<00:01:48.200> basically<00:01:49.099> to<00:01:49.759> recondition<00:01:50.539> them<00:01:50.630> I've

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
but basically to recondition them I've

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.819 
but basically to recondition them I've
been<00:01:51.020> actually<00:01:52.179> just<00:01:53.179> pouring<00:01:54.109> rain<00:01:54.469> water

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
been actually just pouring rain water

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.440 
been actually just pouring rain water
into<00:01:55.159> them<00:01:55.399> because<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.609> haven't<00:01:55.849> got<00:01:56.240> any

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
into them because I haven't got any

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.809 
into them because I haven't got any
distilled<00:01:56.810> water<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.950> couple<00:01:58.189> of<00:01:58.399> my<00:01:58.490> brain

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
distilled water and a couple of my brain

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.760 
distilled water and a couple of my brain
doubt<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.270> were<00:01:59.450> dead<00:02:00.110> shorted<00:02:00.590> out<00:02:00.709> or

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
doubt that were dead shorted out or

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.580 
doubt that were dead shorted out or
whatever<00:02:01.239> I've<00:02:02.239> drained<00:02:02.750> out<00:02:02.989> the<00:02:03.140> fluid<00:02:03.469> to

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
whatever I've drained out the fluid to

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.440 
whatever I've drained out the fluid to
keep<00:02:03.739> it<00:02:03.920> because<00:02:04.009> I<00:02:04.159> don't<00:02:04.369> have<00:02:04.610> any<00:02:04.819> Koh<00:02:05.270> at

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
keep it because I don't have any Koh at

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.569 
keep it because I don't have any Koh at
this<00:02:05.599> present<00:02:06.020> time<00:02:06.049> so<00:02:06.469> we<00:02:07.039> fell<00:02:07.250> on<00:02:07.369> these

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
this present time so we fell on these

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.300 
this present time so we fell on these
batteries<00:02:07.969> do<00:02:08.119> not<00:02:08.269> run<00:02:08.509> on<00:02:08.920> sulfuric<00:02:09.920> acid

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
batteries do not run on sulfuric acid

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.009 
batteries do not run on sulfuric acid
like<00:02:10.429> normal<00:02:10.819> LED<00:02:11.000> batteries<00:02:11.390> these<00:02:11.750> ones

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
like normal LED batteries these ones

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.770 
like normal LED batteries these ones
actually<00:02:12.230> run<00:02:12.650> on<00:02:13.090> Koh<00:02:14.090> which<00:02:14.299> is<00:02:14.450> potassium

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
actually run on Koh which is potassium

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.530 
actually run on Koh which is potassium
hydrochloride<00:02:15.700> which<00:02:16.700> is<00:02:16.940> kind<00:02:17.299> of<00:02:17.360> difficult

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
hydrochloride which is kind of difficult

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.380 
hydrochloride which is kind of difficult
to<00:02:17.870> get<00:02:18.140> but<00:02:18.470> once<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.769> get<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.180> you're<00:02:20.180> in<00:02:20.299> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
to get but once you get it you're in the
