00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.010
 darling bro and with you alex weak stars 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.260
 somehow one of the subscribers threw the ball 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.960
 chelendzh show fight where I take mida 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.590
 fuck that I did it 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.650
 let's go for a start I would like to say 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.380
 that this is not my first such medal on 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.600
 old replays are not preserved in this battle 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.059
 I went out just to test how u 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.300
 I went to collect fashion assembly came on 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.370
 half the workers but the fight turned out 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.180
 royal for those who themselves can all broken 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.120
 are the heater 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.879
 I explain what kind of medal and and gives 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.610
 to the player playing the art in that case 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.339
 if he does 10 times more damage 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.680
 than the strength of his art, that is, if 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.900
 take such an award into it means that 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.860
 do you really know how to play your 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.799
 car than for me is the 404 possible 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.900
 say that this is nostalgia for su-26 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.780
 maybe some still remember the times 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.320
 when drying is just fucking overt all 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.570
 living in the sand of her tower completely 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.079
 spinning hard to damage 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.149
 200 250 line almost everyone with whom 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.759
 she got there were me 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.280
 and when it was so fast that her 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.590
 dignity called the only tank 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.679
 who could take the military for a minute on 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.960
 I had her and 1 Radley Walters could well 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.600
 would be from either it was issued on the technique 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.990
 below level five okay something i'm quite 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.710
 distracted from us the video is not drying out why I 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.560
 so compare 300 foursome and old 26 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.869
 very small circle of attention and pretty 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.539
 quick when up to some regular 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.999
 nerve and where cut when mixing and 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.880
 projectile speed is small 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:59.130
 Briton generally mercilessly bent when without 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.560
 rammer was about 10 with something 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.270
 seconds rammer enemy 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.729
 who put on the harp 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.610
 and he was without repair and without pumped 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.800
 scope chance of survival was no longer any 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.470
 eight in this position already thought 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.390
 she than go to the next battle now 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.150
 business foot push buttons are a bit 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.390
 better projectile now flies by two seconds 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.400
 and there is a chance to have time to leave again with 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.150
 subject to rammer when you can reset 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.310
 to give 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.290
 on the site seconds with a penny given 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.980
 time of flight of the projectile start to 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.989
 to breathe 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.840
 and by the time the opponent is almost 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.390
 repaired a guslya to throw another suitcase 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.819
 which again with them is harp and cycle 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.299
 start repeating again and the guys without 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.560
 1 without frame in randomness to live as much as that 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.890
 can not but rejoice 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.500
 what are the advantages of someone 304 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.750
 of course the parabola of the flight of the projectile 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.359
 due to the fact that the projectile sent 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.389
 almost to throw in space for all sorts 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.310
 houses and stones goes perfectly like 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.680
 the enemy did not try to tighten 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.109
 salvation for enemy vehicles can 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.480
 become either a three-story building or 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:10.079
 10-meter cliffs in other cases 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.090
 no chance but there are downsides would she 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.459
 certainly not so bad 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.859
 when compared with scoops but too 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.620
 they are often lacking and have to be redone 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.780
 come down that on the sixth level is not very 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.840
 happy because the technique is pretty there 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.239
 nimble with we hear too pechalka 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.060
 it's almost gone and making direct hits 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.989
 it is important to us uncritically thanks 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.569
 quick code 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.639
 but it is better not to miss from the field 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.609
 on top of 300 fours gaining 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.739
 slowly but if already gained and terrain 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.230
 all mountains lost not much 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.569
 most likely you will not be able to catch up 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.730
 so you can even troll opponents 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.220
 if you stay alone against several 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.379
 enemy tanks and they decide to get 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.690
 last frag by the way 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.329
 opponents throw us due to the sixth 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.459
 level eight although most often throws 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.379
 only to the seventh and eighth truth happens 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.940
 that casts even to fourth-fifth 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.849
 where is going on 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.430
 beating babies there guys and so not 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.430
 very understand what to do and against the plume 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.879
 every 10 11 seconds and nothing at all 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.250
 can not do the word alpha we have 450 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.739
 at least there are crashes and more so far 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.519
 my when alpha will pass alone 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.919
 Serbian 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.460
 ordinary houses that passes me this 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.139
 one hundred two hundred caps up to the sixth level 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.479
 we have no opponents and our land mines 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.789
 enter the enemy like a knife in butter 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.710
 I personally like to throw the village there 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.409
 after photo 300 fours 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.110
 from them remains cripples with a bunch of crit 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.719
 and several dozen capa principle 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.669
 even at levels 7 and 8 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:46.679
 some problem we may be 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.899
 Soviet of 3 

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:53.339
 thanks to its sky armor cheater and 

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:54.629
 Americans t29 and t-34 thanks to quite good 

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:57.059
 armor in the forehead of the tower 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:59.819
 but you can deal with them in throwing 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:02.939
 for the tower there we have the engine compartment with 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:05.819
 weak booking roof there and alpha 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:06.899
 will pass and the German motor crit either in general 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.689
 you are not calico 

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:12.029
 there is also a chance of arson 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.369
 the enemy will lose his puncture there 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:17.159
 the fire extinguisher will either burn like 

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:19.559
 Christmas tree for me personally some 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:22.889
 a serious problem usually forehead 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:25.469
 KV-5 but they donâ€™t make it right 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.869
 shots without damage have a plus 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:30.779
 poor radio operator 05 

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:32.610
 if he is even brought back to life next 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.369
 sho there he is again Kant Street 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.919
 oh how much have I heard enough on this 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:40.979
 about the owners of the white-headed duck, as it were 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.740
 neither wanted for praise fv304 but it is not 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:46.229
 get some really good 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.209
 Damage results are rare in 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.550
 mainly and failures will have to endure 

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:53.039
 thousand and a half damage and not even because 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.679
 That hands curves overview she almost 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:58.409
 No, and often the question we can not 

00:05:55.679 --> 00:06:00.629
 reach the opponent lighted us 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:03.209
 each time you have to keep around 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:05.699
 lines of fire where we can catch any 

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:08.249
 crazy projectile that could not even 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:11.279
 target us but it is fun 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:13.050
 bring a lot of words can not convey how 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:15.659
 nice to look at the next 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.909
 life winner who is rare 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.389
 first aid kits either did not exist either they 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:23.759
 run out and he just stands and 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:26.360
 helplessly turns the tower then we will 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:29.579
 finish if you like the release 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.589
 like and subscribe to the channel 

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:33.059
 do not forget to subscribe to the public 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:35.999
 alexa lobster so 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:38.759
 and bunker tankers VKontakte all links 

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:41.449
 In the description under the video, well, that's all 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:41.449
 until
