thought it was a great idea have him

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.970 
thought it was a great idea have him
walk<00:02:59.180> down<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.630> street<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.170> get<00:03:00.500> shot<00:03:00.799> in<00:03:00.950> the

numerous homosexual sex scenes

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.000 
numerous homosexual sex scenes
throughout<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.420> film<00:03:17.660> with<00:03:17.840> me<00:03:18.049> we<00:03:18.799> actually

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
throughout the film with me we actually

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.190 
throughout the film with me we actually
wouldn't<00:03:19.700> even<00:03:20.030> get<00:03:20.209> into<00:03:20.359> a<00:03:20.480> plot<00:03:20.840> of<00:03:20.870> any

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
wouldn't even get into a plot of any

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.530 
wouldn't even get into a plot of any

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.870 
sort until the last 15 minutes of the
film<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.109> thought<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.100> would<00:03:25.250> have<00:03:25.400> gotten<00:03:25.640> him

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
film I thought it would have gotten him

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.940
