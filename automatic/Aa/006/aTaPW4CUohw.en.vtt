00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.240
Zebedee is a four-year-old hackney cross Dartmoor gelding.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.600
He had been sent to another

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.510
trainer to be broken to drive

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.260
however

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.080
after 4 weeks his owner was told that he wasn't enjoying driving and he had started

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.620
rearing

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.590
when he was put to and that therefore
driving wasn't for him.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.340
Deb's owner sent him to us for an
assessment to see if this was indeed the

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.930
case.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.500
In our opinion Zeb's rearing was not down to him hating driving

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.370
but not understanding what was being
asked of him, i.e

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.520
a lack of clear instruction and correct
teaching resulting

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.000
in him misunderstanding and getting
confused.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.820
As proof of this, here we are showing
that Zeb does not rear when we put

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.880
him to.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.520
We show Sarah, myself

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.140
and Fletcher putting him to on different occasions which shows he will behave

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.330
even when different people

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.390
are handling him.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.670
Notice how his leg is

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.360
at rest; he is not fidgeting about when the carriage is brought up to him.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.189
He is happy to stand still calmly

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.729
while one person puts him to, changing from either side

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.729
as we do do up the tugs,  attach the traces and secure the breeching.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.750
Having one person put him to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.020
obviously takes longer and having no
groom at his head

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.600
shows that he has not been distracted by anyone feeding him titbits

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.570
in order to keep him quiet while someone else attaches him to the carriage.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.640
His attention is focused on being put to;

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.240
although he is free to rear should he
choose to do so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.880
he remains calm and relaxed.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.670
When he is asked to move of after being put to, notice how he walks away calmly

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.670
without plunging into the collar, rearing up or lunging sideways.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.870
Zeb does not fidget while he is being
to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.530
or while we are adjusting harness,

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.280
moving backwards and forwards from the carriage to him in order to put on the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.290
reins for example

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.540
but he will still move over when asked to

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.659
so that we can put the shafts on him
squarely.

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.890
He will remain standing still even when we make a noise with the reins on the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.970
carriage behind him

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.769
or when the driver gets on the carriage
and prepares to move off.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.200
He's also happy to remain standing

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.810
while other things are going on around him, for example here

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.810
when we walk another horse back into the stables behind him.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.480
When Fletcher

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.220
gets on the carriage this time we ask him to take his time sorting out the reins

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.950
making noise and making the carriage
move about behind him

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.450
to show that Zeb will still stand still
happily and not rear.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.260
Notice as well when Sarah lets Zeb off,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.120
he is happy to remain standing still and does not start rearing or fidgeting

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.870
even though he knows that he is about to go out on a drive.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.269
He will then walk on calmly when asked to

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.769
on a loose rein, bearing in mind he is only being driven

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.200
in a soft rubber bit.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.860

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.140
