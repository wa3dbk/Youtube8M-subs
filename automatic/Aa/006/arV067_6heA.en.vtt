00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.719
 hello together today again 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.429
 housing tests by the player uncle and indeed 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.619
 Here it is already the corsair obsidian 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.970
 750 de So the obsidian series of 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.740
 corsair is well known is the new 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.180
 update for example a very big it 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.830
 gives the 350 de 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.470
 that is was a little just for me 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.720
 micro atx boards now we have each one 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.300
 750 reingekriegt were, the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.109
 mediocre midi tower and there we look 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.600
 take a look 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.750
 First we make the lever of the animal 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.350
 and then I notice the back doctor 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.090
 can not do anymore 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.510
 the device is not that easy 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.100
 because it is not just steel 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.219
 So she did not just steal 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.079
 but also aluminum and 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.420
 This is wood for example 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.980
 here at the front is aluminum the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.620
 Cover will aluminum be the doors 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.449
 while the frame say that rhyme 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.960
 housing where the mainboard then comes in 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.120
 is from all normal steel, there is a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.549
 also firmer we just start from 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.960
 but we do it without them 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.920
 before I put on the lid now 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.990
 I already see the first one open 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.000
 special feature of this device up here the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.950
 dust protection actually nothing one 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.640
 not particularly work that case 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.909
 is a fine thing 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.430
 As you can see here are magnets and that 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.850
 means you can lose weight and easy 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.729
 so again drauflegen this is already a 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.049
 beautiful thing has me every housing 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.640
 second thing here is full this flap 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.259
 I was to see straight, we found 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.770
 Just outside told me already 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.909
 It also consists of plastic but is 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.920
 coated with aluminum 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.790
 there you come when you open the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.689
 did you come here from then on 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.759
 front fan on it 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.700
 we can see that I can do that 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.040
 take this tape is still one 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.100
 carton 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.960
 Here you can then two 140 mm fan 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.189
 installed 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.340
 that's a nice thing in front of everyone 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.600
 that kind of montageart fold 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.460
 however, this whole number has one 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.340
 hook that I already have the 350th 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.030
 He criticized and the 900 is de 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.979
 not great either 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.079
 this bracket is very peaceful and 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.390
 it breaks down very quickly 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.440
 means one should avoid it constantly 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.900
 open and close 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.560
 that's such a tip from me then 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.390
 it is very nice 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.360
 the suddenly those little things that 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.640
 break very thin fragile so that would be 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.610
 We'll see how we look 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.830
 already here connections 2 x usb 2.0 2 x 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.989
 usb 3.0 synonymous standard synonymous needed so 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.840
 I think if only two are one 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.700
 a little bit the typical and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.050
 audio connections here from the one 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.300
 switch that is also lit. 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.560
 otherwise fan control not 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.989
 not available either 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.630
 Displays for the fan control the 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.880
 So not good then have a look 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.790
 I start the punches there you can 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:54.299
 no longer see that maybe better 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:57.060
 as if it is so first time falls 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.640
 On good also here is a beautiful one 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.560
 slice in the side part that 's out 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.940
 Alu you can definitely be right 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.310
 Stylish inside it immediately attracts attention 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.959
 here the hard disk cages are modular 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.110
 Do not talk about the seats here 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.970
 but next to each other can of course 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.620
 also be set on what but one 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.160
 Advantage is you have a lot here 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.560
 space for a video card i capital 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.450
 there you can do everything is a lot that is called 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.269
 So it can be a really big map 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.920
 and we still have space 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.489
 normal for his housing of this size 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.390
 up here 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.130
 3 x 5 1 4 inch slots that's it 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.630
 actually standard gutmann big tower 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.319
 you usually only have one sometimes 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.760
 two more 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.650
 down here the 51 the three a half 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.139
 can also be used for two and a half 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.569
 customs ssds can be used that one sees 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:52.019
 screw here this is typical 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.760
 for corset is this insulation that is 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.160
 it is a dreamless man you do not break 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.709
 is set the plate as the one 300 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.859
 inch hdd for example has then here though 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.329
 so the rubber rings are to find the dams 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.230
 I do not optimally solved there 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.120
 other solutions 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.709
 they are a little better and yet 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.989
 more two games it has really big 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.060
 Bold screws with rubber insert though 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.209
 good on the hearings available 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.979
 we have six screws here 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.229
 here one can see you can yes 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.190
 install some although you have here 1 2 3 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:25.830
 4 5 6 7 8 9 slots so that means 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.819
 in this mainboard also fit xl 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.229
 atx boards that means the size is here 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:35.580
 no problem that is very nice 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.800
 up here you can see that is great 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.000
 best place is and there you could go to 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.860
 example, you can see that in the back 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.719
 You could possibly be a radiator 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.419
 install 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:48.840
 otherwise three times 120 or even 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.250
 three times 140 mm fan possible although he 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.219
 in his description only indicates that 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.780
 only two fit but you can get up here 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:57.449
 to put one more behind that is possible 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.569
 already good original fan assembly man 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.159
 saw we had 240 in front 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.159
 There is also one here 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:07.229
 that's pretty good too 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.210
 Of course, the upper one could still be 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.949
 Stocking you would have to buy then 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.060
 and must say good if I am now 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.830
 here still wants to have three 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.159
 blow the air out 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.050
 Of course I still have to pick them up 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.719
 we have a special feature 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.669
 Now look at it but if the devices 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:25.259
 cutting edges are free and that is here 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.379
 everything went well if you like that 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:31.289
 feels there is nothing in the installation one 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:34.379
 could move though if 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.729
 you look at it I like it 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:38.250
 not at all and I do not know 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.840
 why that must be so here at the 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.550
 especially where it the power supply impressive 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.659
 These things here you can see it fits 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.889
 I do not want it either 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.139
 otherwise we still have the demonstration 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.800
 people who can not see blood 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.659
 lie corner 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.940
 that's not good that's right 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.169
 dangerous so i would say that 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.210
 you can certainly solve differently 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.800
 Just by here in full profile 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.770
 makes where the screw is attached so 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.719
 it does not have to be that way 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.240
 another nice feature of this 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:05.900
 device that can be found when the in 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.900
 other wall solved 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.460
 on the back of the mainboard 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.160
 holder 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.110
 Here we see you 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.760
 this is the one I think that really is 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.020
 that is very well done that he very much 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.590
 very very nice equipment 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.880
 Namely, up to 42 inches have to fit here 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.070
 ssds purely 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.140
 you just screw without any screws 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.400
 if you get just reinschiebt 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.670
 and you can also wonderful here 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.710
 this cable tray that out cable 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.030
 lead and then that is called 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.650
 how to retrofit if you are now to 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.200
 example operating system on the ssd 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.760
 packed over and then retrofitted 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.710
 This is relatively easy to take so 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.580
 just a flap away puts the pure 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.040
 and good 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.650
 so what else is there to say so 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.480
 notes valued processed clearly mine 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:58.560
 the materials are also right 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:03.480
 torsion-resistant should also keep cool 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:05.880
 so be with the claim that the device 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.530
 the hardware chilly holds the 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.930
 we will then test the same 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:15.680
 You can then read this in the article 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:18.060
 and otherwise I would say 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.190
 150 euros are called out that's one 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.750
 fair price just because of the good 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.760
 processing quality and features 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.979
 Clear the little ones down here 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.479
 but otherwise you can say that 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:28.680
 is a good housing and is too 

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:30.870
 really a good refresher of this 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.240
 row that on the contrary to the new 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.620
 advice I have such a huge housing 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.560
 but here are small is something 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.160
 smaller compact so it pleases 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.160
 very good
