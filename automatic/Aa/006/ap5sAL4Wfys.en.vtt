00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.689
 and if I think of my table thou 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.699
 young concepts meet for a 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.980
 new video and this time for the 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.970
 presentation of a town hall 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.480
 level 9 with the air thruster so 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.339
 it's gone then the air thruster it 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.120
 here is touques 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:45.730
 I explained to you already there you have a 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.720
 first anti-aircraft defense here you 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.489
 have a second there a third and 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.229
 a fourth 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.970
 so here you have four tusks 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.780
 antiaircraft and it will actually play 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.229
 that's really what will play at the level 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.449
 of the technique 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:09.580
 in addition with the thruster der deutsche 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:14.080
 then there is the air thruster that 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.680
 wander his attac doc area here so there 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.810
 you see her, she's here we are 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.400
 so here you can in fact you 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.250
 can actually see there the circle of the 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.890
 anti-aircraft defense and just what they 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.380
 chain here see if look up 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.749
 here see that it connects, that is to say 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.509
 that there is not really up space 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:36.310
 level there is not so spaced so 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.929
 you have a wave of balloon coming 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.090
 is apparently space for him 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:45.819
 can therefore avoid the attacks against 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.100
 airs from here hop right now he 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.659
 must really be it I'm not going 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.060
 say paste but fake papers 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.950
 separation really or very little because 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.020
 that if there are usually balloons they 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.310
 put them online so at worst are 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.109
 will have one or two who will pass but they 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.409
 have everything else they will take themselves 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.649
 damages 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.149
 therefore of the air thruster or 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.219
 anti-aircraft defenses and that's it 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.879
 this is the rate of the technique so there it 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.450
 there is the air booster up here the defense 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.190
 anti air 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.720
 see there then you will tell me ah yes 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.220
 it's eating a little bit on the village I 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.480
 agree that it eat a little bit 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.450
 on the village so what I could have 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.830
 to do is to trade with the gold mine 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.910
 you see for example here time we're going the 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.860
 leave it there because I put it back all 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.000
 afterwards and there it is true that it 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.519
 would have been also not too bad but the 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.010
 problem is that I really wanted 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:41.090
 she's in defense so I'm 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.980
 said there at least there will be the tower of 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.299
 sorcerer already to protect so well 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.430
 it is better that she be a little bit 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.500
 more go back you see after sochaux 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.940
 1-1 really me I introduce myself to this 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.940
 way there you can if you want 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.109
 do it traded with the gold mine but 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.069
 here is me it is finally to choose 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.989
 really the choice is because here is 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.340
 I wanted to really close and then 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.660
 look anyway when the 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.060
 balloons they arrive here so early 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.780
 from the village when they arrive for 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.090
 attack your village 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.530
 you see that it's directly at 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.209
 beginning and if we look with the 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.260
 air thruster in all cases the 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.970
 propeller returns for so 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.530
 to remove the troops that will be deployed 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.030
 at the beginning of your village you see 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.290
 so dad the technique then but that 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.299
 depends if you directly want you 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.720
 put a big defense 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.480
 as soon as the person moved too much but 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.549
 it's also not bad because as soon as it 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.709
 will start to attack claim the 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.180
 first ramparts here he will have 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.560
 directly from who will go first 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.010
 ramparts your opponent will have 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.120
 directly damage it's good on 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.680
 will take an example here as I 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.690
 said on these balloons six deposits with 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.569
 his balloons so then we go on 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.730
 with the third anti-aircraft defense 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.720
 so the same is exactly not and me 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.130
 I really played in defense so 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.530
 there after what you can do is 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.569
 up traded with the tower darche and so 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.290
 the way the lazenby machine shaves a lot 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.669
 in addition because there is not the 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.560
 air thruster so that's true 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.750
 it's not bad at last but like it's 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.040
 a little less protected so finally you 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.090
 will have roughly equivalent in May 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.170
 well and she's pretty frankly 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.850
 she is here too the lyrics but 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.070
 it was also to balance well by 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.070
 compared to the one just above 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.010
 so this one here it is at the level 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.630
 so the same protects well here 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.670
 there sanchez look tac 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.380
 see if it stops there and hop it 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.700
 resume here so really stopped for that 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.690
 I did not want to stick them to this 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.130
 level there because I told you like 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.600
 he often puts them online and balloon 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.750
 when it attacks it's good it depends on 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.580
 people it really depends here and there 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.020
 you have since since then I have 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.930
 no air thruster so really 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:43.490
 so good I do not really have any 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.910
 air thrusters but that would have been 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.060
 not bad 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.490
 yeah it's also perhaps put 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.280
 a little more here see there but the 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.780
 problem is that after bath this one 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.930
 she would have been too stuck compared 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.010
 and you already see that high level me 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.330
 I really play on the defense of 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.290
 village in the sense that as soon as they 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.810
 pass the ramparts must directly 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.160
 that it's boring at this level so that's it 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.850
 life and the two sailboats six attacks 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.120
 from above up here and there directly 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.860
 is going to type and there it plays on a little bit 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.919
 the outside is the same if it plays on 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.060
 the outside you see pretty much there 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.590
 how did I do it a little bit 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.320
 like that here it plays a little bit on 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.450
 outside and also but mostly on 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.180
 inside it's really about that 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.400
 so here I hope that 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.640
 this presentation of the city hall 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.740
 level 9 with the air thruster 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.880
 so defense everything that is really there 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.900
 high level really enters the defenses 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.419
 antiaircraft and yes and that's right 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.000
 I was going to forget you have everything around 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:47.210
 aerial bombs here you have them 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.440
 one there you have another here at 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.450
 the inside inside well 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.220
 obviously inside there you have 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.680
 a research mine 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.229
 there is another one more here 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.460
 else there they are a little collar it's 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.100
 true that I could have the spaces and by 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.120
 example ok I do not know if I like them 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.430
 there is a high here it is 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.260
 I could have put this dish there 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.270
 but I found it at home yes yes 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.470
 so was not that bad at last here 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.340
 after wanted to have a little like you 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.870
 wish it 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.280
 the bombs all that is really 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.810
 anti-aerial bomb and after he also 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.770
 are the skeletal traps that I them 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.669
 really delivered to the center 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.100
 this is certainly I hope this 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:27.949
 video on the presentation of the hotel de 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.479
 level 9 city with defenses 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:32.120
 antiaircraft the propeller besides 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.860
 and the traps so for the shot of everything 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.330
 what is really aerial 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.590
 I hope it made you happy 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.540
 and then me on this I tell you to the 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.080
 press to the next for a whole 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.770
 new video 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.770
 by everyone
