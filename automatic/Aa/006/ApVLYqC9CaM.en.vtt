00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:05.520
 space 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.790
 exaggerate times 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.010
 right loud ba so we are right now 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.570
 here in the middle when I'm turning other 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.939
 men in court the three uci 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.330
 broken because the three boys 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.419
 season has the deeds and so on 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.970
 Mega galle ghettoblaster without the boys 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.329
 without us here and there it is too much 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.679
 drink 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.829
 Now comes even more, I have to 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.829
 write 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.610
 so now you are not that one 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.090
 you do not think that anybody thinks something away 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.489
 posed 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.379
 I see no problem you have to 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.980
 Admit this, too, that's it 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.330
 Do not really care about that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.040
 yes we will continue we will contact you 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.829
 later again until your chips but 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.900
 also something like that is okay for me only goes 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.380

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.210

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.880
 the city but full in the idyll 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.530
 friends and now come even small ones 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.899
 People looking for any autograph 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.500
 So what should I say it was 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:22.080
 really not set so nice but measured 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.740
 the signature is shit out though 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.340

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.700
 The man behind it makes the camera behind the camera 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:37.280
 will definitely do something nice magic 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:40.380

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:47.130

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.200
 I am a little scared 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.100
 move because with my 81 kilo or 280 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.930
 or so maybe 100 I stand 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.240
 on this roof a bit in the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.520
 worry that I'll go away right away 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.780
 But I'm down so it will not work 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.119
 happen and when I'm about to leave 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.220
