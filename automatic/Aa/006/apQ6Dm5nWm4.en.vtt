00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
were they were more mentally shaken by

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.740 
were they were more mentally shaken by

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
because many of them have lost friends

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.120 
because many of them have lost friends
in<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.970> Avalanche<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.779> or<00:00:28.140> close<00:00:28.560> members<00:00:28.949> of

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
in the Avalanche and or close members of

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.400 
in the Avalanche and or close members of

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
injured or fatality so I think they they

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.670 
injured or fatality so I think they they
they<00:00:35.180> had<00:00:36.180> dodged<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.660> bullet<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> speak<00:00:37.469> by
