00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.769
 third place stayed pedro tinoco nÃ© 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:09.090

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:19.350
 opinion here and I already played a good 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.759
 here the boat taxed here he wrote here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.280
 the ark of hell is not 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.530
 Good, I'll tell you why I chose it. 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.509
 this boat for being a place 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.290
 It's up here first , okay? 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.090
 cool the decoration the baby is ours 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.220
 formal galley for attack 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.479
 up here is cool, even decorating it 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.420
 he did not 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:45.060
 on the various animals the sheep 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:48.720
 different colors annie and beauty is cool 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.950
 only what I found a bit annoying that 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.979
 he should have done 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.649
 the anger aacs de lag I quite liked 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.320
 It was from here too, share this part here 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.479
 than in the case would be the rest of the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.009
 sailor say that there's who 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.060
 I think it's very cool. 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.729
 only on the bottom was the boat's 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.129
 I still have no flu here I went down 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.380
 running on the bottom of the boat 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.920
 galley is 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.300
 a little medium as I can tell one 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.550
 little unmade not done and he did not 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.330
 closed that part here, but that's okay 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.490
 he took second place is great already good 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.490
 Too good, it 's logical. 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.430
 I like the guy, I liked it so much, why bother? 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.400
 on a boat that size is not work 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.830
 it's not easy 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.400
 Good, and next I'll move on to the 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.640
 next boat 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.520
 Good guys, we came back here with the boat. 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.650
 winner of the maurice teixeira and the 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.910
 second place I did not say is the 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.520
 gustavo crispim 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.340
 so congratulations to him and we are 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.760
 two here in this titanic scene of life 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:09.680
 and it was no longer calm 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.680
 if they die with the guy he jumped is 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.300
 sorry then go away then 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.700
 Geez, I'm going to tell you the criteria I 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.960
 I used to choose this thump as the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.870
 first place 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.210
 the first thing is that we already 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.070
 broke the glasses here but he left 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.680
 this little plaque that in case of monsters 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.430
 break and let that bunch of bug made 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.830
 this mini pixel art here and people like 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.970
 every old boat has a sail or 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.200
 He has this candle I like to fuck 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.570
 and it takes us a long time to 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.890
 make one more and shut it must have taken time 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:53.000
 it is true then and also like every boat 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.490
 has your cinema has a flag only that 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.560
 As you can see I also chose 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.330
 only because of this the criterion that I 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.440
 I also used was the following was the part 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.420
 of the boat 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.790
 here he did in case of emergency not 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:11.310
 breaking the glass will break right but only 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.800
 sucking is the exchange is not pity the 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.670
 face to face did so so right deal 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.930
 for me to break 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.150
 we put back here opa 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.820
 I think I got it wrong. 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:29.940
 you put put the other beauty ball 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.759
 down now good 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.919
 a business that I chose also for 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:38.340
 cause I chose it was much more 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:40.440
 similar to a closer one than I 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.600
 I wanted to, I practically wanted it. 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.210
 Noah's Ark, something like that. 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.860
 practicing this way and he managed to 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.490
 did he put the space for the 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.090
 right bugs is that this is a man 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.750
 place 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.400
 It's an exciting ball so he put it 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.400
 space here for the bugs have a chest 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.380
 with food that I thought was really cool 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.139
 this too, on this side here 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.190
 so I also liked that part that 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:15.720
 he finished the bottom of the boat here right? 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:18.510
 As you can see there he did the 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.520
 business for a little bird and one 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.280
 walls here very nice diamond 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.120
 It's also in a won format, right? 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:31.289
 Yeah, I should have made a map 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.599
 Dude, it was cool, but so on. 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.430
 You're going to drink that much iron to do that. 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.430
 but tell me not to err 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.560
 Our brusque was locked and is galley 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.940
 something else I liked even beyond it 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.280
 have finished it all here 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.880

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.979
