the bottom of the phone and that has to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.300 
the bottom of the phone and that has to
make<00:01:36.240> contact<00:01:36.689> with<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.200> center<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.740> the

exact<00:01:40.560> charging<00:01:40.950> dock<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.340> basically

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
exact charging dock but basically

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.910 
exact charging dock but basically
because<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.390> back<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> Nexus<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.380> so

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
