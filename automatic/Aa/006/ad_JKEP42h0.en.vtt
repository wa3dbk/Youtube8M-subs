00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.920 
then each one of them has a whole power
cord<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.660> plug<00:04:28.720> into<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.080> outlet<00:04:29.670> so<00:04:32.700> then

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
cord to plug into the outlet so then

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.350

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
all I don't have enough ball pythons to

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.490 
all I don't have enough ball pythons to
fill<00:05:09.100> those<00:05:09.550> bottom<00:05:10.000> three<00:05:10.560> rows<00:05:11.560> anyways<00:05:12.210> but

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
fill those bottom three rows anyways but
what<00:05:14.500> I'm<00:05:14.590> gonna<00:05:14.740> be<00:05:14.890> doing<00:05:15.220> is<00:05:15.310> getting

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
what I'm gonna be doing is getting

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.400 
what I'm gonna be doing is getting
another<00:05:15.760> power<00:05:16.060> strip<00:05:16.390> and<00:05:16.600> I'll<00:05:16.960> be<00:05:17.110> plugging

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
another power strip and I'll be plugging

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.620 
another power strip and I'll be plugging
that<00:05:17.590> into<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:18.400> second<00:05:19.090> hole<00:05:19.180> put<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:19.360> herb

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
that into the second hole put the herb

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.840 
that into the second hole put the herb
stand<00:05:19.900> -<00:05:20.110> and<00:05:20.380> then<00:05:21.100> what<00:05:21.490> I'll<00:05:21.580> do<00:05:21.640> is<00:05:21.760> I'll

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
stand - and then what I'll do is I'll

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.080 
stand - and then what I'll do is I'll
put<00:05:22.000> my<00:05:22.090> probe<00:05:22.360> in<00:05:22.600> the<00:05:22.750> middle<00:05:23.050> so<00:05:23.950> that<00:05:24.820> probe

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
put my probe in the middle so that probe

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.150 
put my probe in the middle so that probe
will<00:05:25.270> be<00:05:25.390> on<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:26.320> second<00:05:26.740> level<00:05:26.920> and<00:05:27.720> then

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
will be on the second level and then

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.960 
will be on the second level and then
it'll<00:05:30.160> be<00:05:30.280> right<00:05:30.460> in<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:30.610> middle<00:05:30.760> of<00:05:30.880> the

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
it'll be right in the middle of the

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.520 
it'll be right in the middle of the
other<00:05:31.090> seven<00:05:31.510> levels<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:31.990> upper<00:05:32.230> seven

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
other seven levels the upper seven

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.970 
other seven levels the upper seven
levels<00:05:32.880> so<00:05:33.880> that<00:05:37.290> will<00:05:38.290> be<00:05:38.410> how<00:05:38.650> I<00:05:38.680> have

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
levels so that will be how I have

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.600 
levels so that will be how I have
everything<00:05:39.460> and<00:05:40.710> now<00:05:41.710> all<00:05:41.950> you<00:05:42.190> do<00:05:42.310> is<00:05:42.400> get<00:05:42.550> the

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
everything and now all you do is get the

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.720 
everything and now all you do is get the
ball<00:05:42.700> pythons<00:05:43.150> in<00:05:44.160> and<00:05:46.919> put<00:05:47.919> it<00:05:48.040> in<00:05:48.190> this<00:05:48.310> spot

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
ball pythons in and put it in this spot

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.760 
ball pythons in and put it in this spot
and<00:05:49.080> move<00:05:50.080> everything<00:05:50.320> out<00:05:50.500> of<00:05:50.560> the<00:05:50.680> other

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
and move everything out of the other

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.140 
and move everything out of the other
racks<00:05:51.070> that<00:05:51.220> I<00:05:51.370> have

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
racks that I have

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.120 
racks that I have
oh<00:05:52.199> look<00:05:53.199> here<00:05:53.440> I'll<00:05:53.530> show<00:05:53.650> you<00:05:53.680> another<00:05:53.830> tub

oh look here I'll show you another tub

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.400 
oh look here I'll show you another tub
so<00:05:57.130> I<00:05:57.190> got<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:57.550> cup<00:05:58.030> holder<00:05:58.330> the<00:05:58.990> deli<00:05:59.169> cup

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
so I got the cup holder the deli cup

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.580 
so I got the cup holder the deli cup
holder<00:05:59.650> so<00:06:00.330> then<00:06:01.330> they<00:06:01.600> can't<00:06:02.260> move<00:06:02.380> it<00:06:02.470> around

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
holder so then they can't move it around

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.439 
holder so then they can't move it around
or<00:06:02.830> anything<00:06:03.010> it's<00:06:03.310> in<00:06:03.460> there<00:06:03.669> they<00:06:04.150> can<00:06:04.270> wrap

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 
or anything it's in there they can wrap

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.400 
or anything it's in there they can wrap

stuff and then let me take this off here
you'll<00:06:14.320> see<00:06:14.470> the<00:06:14.590> ventilation<00:06:16.410> holes<00:06:17.410> that

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
you'll see the ventilation holes that

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.110 
you'll see the ventilation holes that
say<00:06:17.740> ARS<00:06:18.250> and<00:06:18.460> then<00:06:18.550> there's<00:06:18.699> a<00:06:18.760> little<00:06:18.970> bit<00:06:19.090> of

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
say ARS and then there's a little bit of

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.570 
say ARS and then there's a little bit of
ventilation<00:06:19.810> on<00:06:20.229> the<00:06:20.290> side<00:06:20.500> of<00:06:20.530> that<00:06:20.770> that's

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
ventilation on the side of that that's

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.779 
ventilation on the side of that that's
all<00:06:21.880> they<00:06:22.150> need<00:06:22.330> for<00:06:22.510> ventilation<00:06:23.110> because

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
all they need for ventilation because

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.310 
all they need for ventilation because
there's<00:06:24.789> nothing<00:06:25.000> in<00:06:25.150> the<00:06:25.270> back<00:06:25.449> there<00:06:25.750> it'll

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
there's nothing in the back there it'll

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.100 
there's nothing in the back there it'll
be<00:06:26.530> good<00:06:27.100> for<00:06:27.210> humidity<00:06:28.210> and<00:06:28.510> stuff<00:06:28.810> like<00:06:28.960> that

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
be good for humidity and stuff like that

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.740 
be good for humidity and stuff like that
especially<00:06:29.380> I'm<00:06:30.240> ready<00:06:31.240> to<00:06:31.419> shed<00:06:31.630> and

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
especially I'm ready to shed and

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.510 
especially I'm ready to shed and
everything<00:06:32.139> and<00:06:33.600> keep<00:06:34.600> the<00:06:35.130> heat<00:06:36.130> in<00:06:36.310> there

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
everything and keep the heat in there

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.469 
everything and keep the heat in there
and<00:06:36.880> the<00:06:37.570> hot<00:06:37.750> spot<00:06:38.020> heat<00:06:38.260> will<00:06:38.410> be<00:06:38.530> nice<00:06:39.400> and

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
and the hot spot heat will be nice and

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.219 
and the hot spot heat will be nice and
restrained<00:06:40.479> in<00:06:40.600> the<00:06:40.690> back<00:06:40.840> there<00:06:41.110> without

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 
restrained in the back there without

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:44.340 
restrained in the back there without
having<00:06:41.650> any<00:06:42.120> much<00:06:43.120> area<00:06:43.300> to<00:06:43.449> exclude<00:06:43.960> escape

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
having any much area to exclude escape

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:53.010 
having any much area to exclude escape
so<00:06:45.660> there<00:06:46.660> you<00:06:46.780> have<00:06:46.840> it<00:06:47.139> the<00:06:49.470> 30<00:06:50.470> bin<00:06:51.660> CB<00:06:52.660> 70

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
so there you have it the 30 bin CB 70

00:06:53.020 --> 00:07:02.510 
so there you have it the 30 bin CB 70
ARS<00:06:53.470> rack<00:06:57.030> really<00:06:58.030> really<00:06:58.389> nice<00:06:59.340> I'll<00:07:00.340> do<00:07:00.729> a

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
ARS rack really really nice I'll do a

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.210 
ARS rack really really nice I'll do a
ball<00:07:03.520> python<00:07:04.320> collection<00:07:05.320> update<00:07:05.500> in<00:07:05.889> here
