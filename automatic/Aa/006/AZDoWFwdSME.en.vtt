going to be this green and unscrew the

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.179 
going to be this green and unscrew the
cap<00:02:39.969> is<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.239> little<00:02:40.450> bit<00:02:40.540> old<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:40.989> put<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.859> couple

cap is a little bit old and put a couple
of<00:02:42.370> drops<00:02:42.639> of<00:02:42.909> this<00:02:43.239> green<00:02:43.629> onto<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.500> tin<00:02:44.680> foil

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
of drops of this green onto the tin foil

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.619 
of drops of this green onto the tin foil
the<00:02:45.159> reason<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:45.549> we're<00:02:45.760> using<00:02:45.879> tin<00:02:46.329> foil

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
the reason that we're using tin foil

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.349 
the reason that we're using tin foil
rather<00:02:47.560> than<00:02:47.739> paper<00:02:48.010> towel<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.579> because<00:02:48.909> this

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
rather than paper towel is because this

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.670 
rather than paper towel is because this
won't<00:02:49.599> soak<00:02:50.049> up<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.500> polish<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.189> so<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.519> can

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
won't soak up the polish and so you can

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.970 
won't soak up the polish and so you can
like<00:02:53.680> not<00:02:53.889> waste<00:02:54.519> as<00:02:54.879> much<00:02:54.939> polish<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.709> put

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
like not waste as much polish and put

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.229 
like not waste as much polish and put
just<00:02:57.159> a<00:02:57.250> little<00:02:57.310> bit<00:02:57.609> more<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.879> don't<00:02:58.030> know<00:02:58.120> how

just a little bit more I don't know how
much<00:02:58.689> amenities<00:02:59.549> but<00:03:00.549> you<00:03:01.450> know<00:03:01.599> just<00:03:01.780> kind<00:03:01.989> of

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
much amenities but you know just kind of

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.289 
much amenities but you know just kind of
like<00:03:02.579> guesstimate<00:03:03.579> how<00:03:03.730> much<00:03:04.060> you're

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299

about half way to two thirds down my
nail<00:03:26.469> i'm<00:03:27.370> going<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:27.579> start<00:03:27.790> sponging<00:03:28.389> on<00:03:29.190> the

nail i'm going to start sponging on the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.219 
nail i'm going to start sponging on the
color<00:03:30.430> i<00:03:30.760> want<00:03:31.329> the<00:03:31.449> color<00:03:31.659> to<00:03:31.840> be<00:03:31.959> really

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:32.229 
color i want the color to be really

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:36.420 
color i want the color to be really
really<00:03:32.319> dense<00:03:33.359> towards<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:34.989> tip<00:03:35.440> but<00:03:36.099> really

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:38.229 
really sparse towards the bottom so you

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:44.360 
really sparse towards the bottom so you
might<00:03:38.530> want<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:38.799> start<00:03:39.190> with<00:03:40.409> the<00:03:41.409> tip<00:03:41.859> first

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370

might want to start with the tip first
to<00:03:45.370> get<00:03:45.519> a<00:03:45.790> majority<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.389> the<00:03:46.479> color<00:03:46.810> off<00:03:47.049> and

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
to get a majority of the color off and

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.860 
to get a majority of the color off and
then<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.979> gradually<00:03:48.370> go<00:03:49.060> large<00:03:49.359> towards<00:03:49.750> the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
then it gradually go large towards the

then it gradually go large towards the
bottom

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.740 

to<00:03:53.769> make<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:53.950> more<00:03:54.099> of<00:03:54.370> like<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:55.180> gradient

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
to make it more of like the gradient

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.640 
to make it more of like the gradient
effect<00:03:55.900> that<00:03:56.349> you<00:03:56.379> want<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:58.140> that's<00:03:59.140> what

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
effect that you want and that's what

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.640 
effect that you want and that's what
looks<00:04:00.580> like<00:04:00.790> now<00:04:01.629> I'm<00:04:01.900> just<00:04:02.200> going<00:04:02.319> to

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
looks like now I'm just going to

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.050 
looks like now I'm just going to
continue<00:04:02.799> doing<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.459> through<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.760> rest<00:04:03.909> of

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
continue doing this through the rest of

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.580 
continue doing this through the rest of
the<00:04:04.180> nails<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.780> almost<00:04:05.379> speed<00:04:05.799> you<00:04:06.040> up<00:04:09.840> ok<00:04:10.840> so

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
the nails and almost speed you up ok so

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.500 
the nails and almost speed you up ok so
now<00:04:11.709> you<00:04:11.799> can<00:04:12.069> see<00:04:12.099> that<00:04:12.310> we<00:04:12.549> just<00:04:12.790> have<00:04:13.030> we

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
now you can see that we just have we

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.170 
now you can see that we just have we
went<00:04:13.750> about<00:04:14.010> two-thirds<00:04:15.010> of<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.459> way<00:04:15.610> down<00:04:15.849> I

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
went about two-thirds of the way down I

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.659 
went about two-thirds of the way down I
try<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.810> keep<00:04:17.079> it<00:04:17.229> as<00:04:17.410> dense<00:04:17.829> as<00:04:18.010> I<00:04:18.160> could<00:04:18.430> to

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
try to keep it as dense as I could to

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.969 
try to keep it as dense as I could to
the<00:04:18.790> tip<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.389> like<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:20.410> know<00:04:20.440> kind<00:04:20.769> of<00:04:20.829> make

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
the tip and like you know kind of make

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:26.189 
the tip and like you know kind of make
it<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.160> little<00:04:21.310> bit<00:04:23.729> more<00:04:24.729> sparse<00:04:25.150> towards<00:04:26.020> like

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
it a little bit more sparse towards like

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.770 
it a little bit more sparse towards like
the<00:04:26.380> bottom<00:04:26.620> third<00:04:27.220> of<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.610> nail<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:28.479> next

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
the bottom third of the nail the next

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.439 
the bottom third of the nail the next
thing<00:04:28.930> we're<00:04:29.050> going<00:04:29.080> to<00:04:29.440> take<00:04:29.650> is<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.520> gold

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
thing we're going to take is the gold

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.120 
thing we're going to take is the gold
and<00:04:31.750> we're<00:04:31.870> pretty<00:04:32.080> much<00:04:32.320> just<00:04:32.560> going<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:33.010> do

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
and we're pretty much just going to do

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.680 
and we're pretty much just going to do
the<00:04:33.310> same<00:04:33.490> thing<00:04:33.789> just<00:04:33.820> take<00:04:34.270> some<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.600> the

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
the same thing just take some of the

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.629 
the same thing just take some of the
gold<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:37.900> am<00:04:38.440> doing<00:04:38.710> this<00:04:38.830> right<00:04:39.039> away<00:04:39.220> like

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
gold and I am doing this right away like

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.689 
gold and I am doing this right away like
you<00:04:39.820> could<00:04:40.030> probably<00:04:40.270> let<00:04:40.840> your<00:04:41.260> polish<00:04:41.800> dry<00:04:42.669> a

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
you could probably let your polish dry a

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.950 
you could probably let your polish dry a
little<00:04:43.120> bit<00:04:44.550> but<00:04:45.550> to<00:04:45.729> me<00:04:45.820> I'm<00:04:46.000> like<00:04:46.030> I<00:04:46.539> think

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
little bit but to me I'm like I think

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.100 
little bit but to me I'm like I think
that<00:04:47.139> if<00:04:47.289> they<00:04:47.530> do<00:04:48.000> melt<00:04:49.000> together<00:04:49.630> a<00:04:49.900> little

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
that if they do melt together a little

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.080 
that if they do melt together a little
bit<00:04:50.289> or<00:04:50.470> if<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:51.070> know<00:04:51.190> it's<00:04:51.550> not<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:51.910> end<00:04:51.940> of

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
bit or if you know it's not the end of

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.330 
bit or if you know it's not the end of
the<00:04:52.150> world<00:04:52.360> because<00:04:52.510> it's<00:04:52.810> trying<00:04:53.160> like<00:04:54.160> I'm

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
the world because it's trying like I'm

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.460 
the world because it's trying like I'm
trying<00:04:54.760> to<00:04:54.910> kind<00:04:55.120> of<00:04:55.180> make<00:04:55.510> more<00:04:55.810> of<00:04:55.840> like<00:04:56.229> a

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
trying to kind of make more of like a

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.440 
trying to kind of make more of like a
seamless<00:04:57.190> transition<00:04:57.340> like<00:04:58.060> kind<00:04:58.270> of<00:04:58.330> an

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
seamless transition like kind of an

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.100 
seamless transition like kind of an
actual<00:04:58.750> gradient<00:04:59.500> so<00:04:59.860> if<00:05:00.729> it<00:05:01.030> blends<00:05:01.810> a<00:05:01.870> little

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
actual gradient so if it blends a little

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.010 
actual gradient so if it blends a little
bit<00:05:02.260> I'm<00:05:02.440> not<00:05:02.740> that<00:05:03.039> upset<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.700> so<00:05:03.970> I'm<00:05:04.690> kind

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
bit I'm not that upset and so I'm kind

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.400 
bit I'm not that upset and so I'm kind
of<00:05:05.080> just<00:05:05.289> going<00:05:05.470> down<00:05:05.830> one<00:05:06.729> third<00:05:07.539> of<00:05:08.400> my<00:05:09.400> nail

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
of just going down one third of my nail

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.940 
of just going down one third of my nail
so<00:05:11.410> as<00:05:11.800> you<00:05:11.860> can<00:05:12.160> see<00:05:12.520> my<00:05:12.910> camera<00:05:13.210> just<00:05:13.240> kind<00:05:13.660> of

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
so as you can see my camera just kind of

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.010 
so as you can see my camera just kind of
stopped<00:05:14.950> filming<00:05:15.430> for<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:15.820> minute<00:05:16.030> but<00:05:16.539> I<00:05:16.750> try

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
stopped filming for a minute but I try

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.560 
stopped filming for a minute but I try
to<00:05:17.050> keep<00:05:17.320> it<00:05:17.500> as<00:05:17.620> dense<00:05:18.280> as<00:05:18.490> I<00:05:18.669> could<00:05:19.000> towards

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
to keep it as dense as I could towards

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.290 
to keep it as dense as I could towards
the<00:05:19.960> tip<00:05:20.200> and<00:05:20.410> then<00:05:20.560> gradually<00:05:21.280> faded<00:05:21.760> it<00:05:21.880> away

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
the tip and then gradually faded it away

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.589 
the tip and then gradually faded it away
and<00:05:22.780> so<00:05:23.590> I'm<00:05:23.830> going<00:05:24.099> to<00:05:24.160> do<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.820> rest<00:05:25.000> of<00:05:25.300> my

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
and so I'm going to do the rest of my

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.400 
and so I'm going to do the rest of my
nails<00:05:25.870> and<00:05:27.120> hopefully<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:28.479> i<00:05:28.870> will<00:05:29.050> be<00:05:29.080> right

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
nails and hopefully and i will be right

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.310 
nails and hopefully and i will be right
back<00:05:29.800> so<00:05:30.639> you<00:05:30.729> just<00:05:30.789> see<00:05:31.210> that<00:05:33.870> all<00:05:34.870> right<00:05:35.020> this

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
back so you just see that all right this

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.830 
back so you just see that all right this
is<00:05:35.530> one<00:05:36.010> hand<00:05:36.340> done<00:05:36.669> you<00:05:36.849> can<00:05:37.060> kind<00:05:37.300> of<00:05:37.360> I<00:05:37.539> keep
