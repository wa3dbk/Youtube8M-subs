nice thing about Windows 8 is we still

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.099 
nice thing about Windows 8 is we still
have<00:01:09.579> the<00:01:09.759> old<00:01:09.789> traditional<00:01:10.359> desktop<00:01:10.780> now<00:01:10.929> on

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:11.109

have the old traditional desktop now on
Windows<00:01:11.439> RT<00:01:11.619> I<00:01:11.859> think<00:01:12.189> the<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.579> desktop<00:01:12.999> isn't

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:13.209 
Windows RT I think the the desktop isn't

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:15.599 
Windows RT I think the the desktop isn't
particularly<00:01:14.139> useful<00:01:14.740> I<00:01:15.069> mean<00:01:15.219> really<00:01:15.399> the

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
particularly useful I mean really the

exciting final management's a little

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:23.609 
exciting final management's a little
easier<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.569> move<00:01:22.659> stuff<00:01:22.929> around<00:01:23.020> in<00:01:23.319> this<00:01:23.439> old

keeping this old traditional desktop

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.039 
keeping this old traditional desktop

intact even on the RT tablets it's it's

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.539 
intact even on the RT tablets it's it's
a<00:03:26.139> benefit<00:03:26.409> I'm<00:03:26.530> sure<00:03:26.680> it's<00:03:26.799> not<00:03:26.950> intended

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
a benefit I'm sure it's not intended

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.819 
a benefit I'm sure it's not intended
that<00:03:27.730> Microsoft<00:03:28.419> you<00:03:28.900> know<00:03:28.989> had<00:03:29.230> any<00:03:29.439> idea

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
that Microsoft you know had any idea

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.470 
that Microsoft you know had any idea
that<00:03:29.889> that's<00:03:30.219> what<00:03:30.730> people<00:03:31.060> were<00:03:31.150> going<00:03:31.299> to<00:03:31.359> be

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
that that's what people were going to be

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.420 
that that's what people were going to be
doing<00:03:31.659> with<00:03:32.019> Internet<00:03:32.739> Explorer<00:03:33.099> on<00:03:33.219> the<00:03:33.310> old

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
doing with Internet Explorer on the old

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.339 
doing with Internet Explorer on the old
desktop<00:03:33.760> but<00:03:34.329> it<00:03:34.450> at<00:03:34.540> least<00:03:34.569> helps<00:03:35.019> us<00:03:35.139> with

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
desktop but it at least helps us with
