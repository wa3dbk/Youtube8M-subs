is actually

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.520 
is actually
out<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.180> customs<00:02:12.569> but<00:02:12.810> once<00:02:13.019> they<00:02:13.230> find<00:02:13.439> out

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
out of customs but once they find out

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.140 
out of customs but once they find out
the<00:02:13.709> value<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.040> us<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.489> they<00:02:14.549> put<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> charge<00:02:14.999> on

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150

us<00:02:15.269> they<00:02:15.480> don't<00:02:15.569> really<00:02:15.840> care<00:02:16.079> and<00:02:16.319> were

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
us they don't really care and were

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.920 
us they don't really care and were
unlikely<00:02:16.769> they<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.219> release<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.719> so<00:02:18.719> I<00:02:18.749> hope
