00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.580
 what's up 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.120
 today I will try to show you there 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.320
 how to make a new record with 111 of 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.800
 ball 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.800
 love 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.019
 this one is in the game 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:43.059
 What can also be good, let's go by 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.809
 parts that I'll try to explain to 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:50.820
 How did you do the drums that I go? 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.820
 use a simple battery of nine others 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.880
 the iaaf 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.630
 although explaining the reason of the game I 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.590
 I cut that piece of the battery that is the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.580
 softer piece of velcro and five 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.580
 other minor ones 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:40.860
 then I picked it up and just put to 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.860
 put the battery later here 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.640
 I just get 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:03:01.000
 and I keep her on top of the ong 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:07.079
 after I squeezed it all she just 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.079
 clip the battery clip and connect 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:38.889
 very cool at night to walk on the street 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:04:35.849
 so I'm alone I left the 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:04:35.849
 longboard on top of a ribbon one side 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:52.840
 but the quality of the video but that's what I 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.940
 I could do 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.690
 who liked the video and gives a jewel and 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:02.520
 I studied there, shares, does what I want 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:05.409
 Did not like what you want. 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.240
 who has 10 more to make a 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:11.379
 longboard iscte bike that goes there 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.779
 Tell us we'll find a way 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:17.189
 That's it, thanks for the 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:17.189
 view that is more
