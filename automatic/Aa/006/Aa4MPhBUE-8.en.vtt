obviously<00:01:27.570> that's<00:01:27.750> an<00:01:27.900> open<00:01:28.020> question<00:01:28.320> but

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
obviously that's an open question but

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.940 
obviously that's an open question but
one<00:01:30.479> thing<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.290> now<00:01:31.500> release

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.429 
on the things you've heard here tonight
for<00:01:55.619> example<00:01:55.680> anything<00:01:56.340> jump<00:01:56.549> out<00:01:56.670> at<00:01:56.820> you

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
for example anything jump out at you

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.740 
for example anything jump out at you
well<00:01:58.439> yes<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.460> particularly<00:02:00.210> positive

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
well yes and the particularly positive

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.310 
well yes and the particularly positive
thing<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:02.030> each<00:02:03.030> one<00:02:03.540> each<00:02:03.930> was

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
thing is that each one each was

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.160 
thing is that each one each was
complimenting<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.280> other<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.750> that's

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
complimenting the other and and that's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.999 
complimenting the other and and that's
to<00:02:07.649> me<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.160> was<00:02:08.310> music<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.759> my<00:02:08.910> ears<00:02:09.360> because

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
to me that was music to my ears because

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.430 
to me that was music to my ears because
obviously<00:02:11.009> they<00:02:11.310> seemed<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:11.760> they<00:02:12.150> both

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
obviously they seemed like they both

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.490 
obviously they seemed like they both
feeling

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
feeling

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.550 
feeling
comfortable<00:02:14.220> with<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.900> agreement<00:02:16.440> they

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
comfortable with the agreement they

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.410 
comfortable with the agreement they
reached<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:18.240> again<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.500> think<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:21.210> one

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
reached and and again I think the one

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.150 
reached and and again I think the one
thing<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.900> always<00:02:22.200> remain<00:02:22.800> up<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
thing that I always remain up the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.260 
thing that I always remain up the
optimistic<00:02:24.060> about<00:02:24.210> is<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.840> at<00:02:25.830> least

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
optimistic about is that at least

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.150 
optimistic about is that at least
whenever<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.360> had<00:02:27.600> dialogue<00:02:28.110> with<00:02:28.380> each<00:02:28.650> one<00:02:28.980> of

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
whenever I had dialogue with each one of

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.970 
whenever I had dialogue with each one of
them<00:02:29.280> separately<00:02:29.870> they<00:02:30.870> both<00:02:31.140> agreed<00:02:31.950> that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
them separately they both agreed that

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.060 
them separately they both agreed that
yes<00:02:32.459> this<00:02:32.760> needs<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.450> be<00:02:33.600> done<00:02:33.840> but<00:02:34.020> we<00:02:34.860> don't

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
yes this needs to be done but we don't

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.640 
yes this needs to be done but we don't
know<00:02:35.160> how<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.780> Tony<00:02:36.780> used<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.990> say<00:02:37.260> I'd<00:02:37.380> love

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
to do it yes we need to do it I just

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.620 
to do it yes we need to do it I just
don't<00:02:40.260> know<00:02:40.440> how<00:02:40.680> yet<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.430> they<00:02:41.910> finally<00:02:42.360> found

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
don't know how yet so they finally found

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.729 
don't know how yet so they finally found
the<00:02:42.959> how<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:44.150> again<00:02:45.230> that's<00:02:46.230> what<00:02:46.410> we've<00:02:46.590> been

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
the how and again that's what we've been

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
ways I heard a fan talk about that it's

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.270 
ways I heard a fan talk about that it's
all<00:03:14.940> one<00:03:15.180> way<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.480> know<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.890> Champ<00:03:17.190> Car

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
all one way you know that the Champ Car

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.520 
all one way you know that the Champ Car
side<00:03:17.880> are<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.510> ones<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.810> are<00:03:18.989> giving<00:03:19.140> giving

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
side are the ones that are giving giving

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.620 
side are the ones that are giving giving
I<00:03:19.860> don't<00:03:20.580> think<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.000> think<00:03:21.269> it's<00:03:21.420> going<00:03:21.600> to

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
I don't think so I think it's going to

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.360 
I don't think so I think it's going to
be<00:03:21.810> both<00:03:22.080> sides<00:03:22.410> gonna<00:03:22.769> have<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.130> give

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
be both sides gonna have to give

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.430 
be both sides gonna have to give
somewhat<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:25.730> it's<00:03:26.730> going<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.030> be<00:03:27.440> a

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
somewhat and and it's going to be a

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.440 
somewhat and and it's going to be a
while<00:03:28.890> before<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.580> sort<00:03:29.910> out<00:03:30.060> all<00:03:30.090> these

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
while before you sort out all these

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.800 
while before you sort out all these
things<00:03:30.720> about<00:03:31.110> how<00:03:31.350> many<00:03:31.560> ovals<00:03:32.010> do<00:03:32.130> we<00:03:32.250> run

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
things about how many ovals do we run

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.500 
things about how many ovals do we run
road<00:03:33.810> courses<00:03:34.380> all<00:03:34.620> we<00:03:34.799> know<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.510> there

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
road courses all we know is that there

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.199 
road courses all we know is that there
are<00:03:36.540> many<00:03:37.200> good<00:03:37.590> assets<00:03:38.160> out<00:03:38.459> there<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:39.030> take

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
are many good assets out there to take

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.330 
are many good assets out there to take
advantage<00:03:39.390> of<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.590> that's<00:03:41.070> what<00:03:41.190> you're

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
advantage of and and that's what you're

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.819 
advantage of and and that's what you're
gonna<00:03:41.459> do<00:03:41.760> you're<00:03:41.940> gonna<00:03:42.060> try<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:43.500> pick

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
then and make the series the way it

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.630 
then and make the series the way it
should<00:03:48.780> be<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.980> be<00:03:50.100> honest<00:03:50.370> with<00:03:50.489> you
