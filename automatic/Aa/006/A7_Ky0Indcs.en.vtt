00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
to the other side and look how it

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.330 
to the other side and look how it
covered<00:04:09.560> her<00:04:10.400> pigmentation<00:04:11.359> now<00:04:11.989> you<00:04:12.049> can<00:04:12.590> use

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
one or two layers because this is
