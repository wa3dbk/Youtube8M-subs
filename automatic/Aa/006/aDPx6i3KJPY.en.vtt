00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello hello now I will tell in this 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.560
 video about the gospel of the Essenes of such 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.719
 the gospel in which is written and about the barn 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.230
 genius and even about fasting in cleansing 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.290
 of the body 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.990
 I'll tell you the facts and their opinion in brief 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.240
 what is there about raw food eating even 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.420
 manat even middle and fasting 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.480
 first about the facts found this gospel 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.050
 from the Essenes in the ancient vatican vaults 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.880
 and transferred to the audacious philologist there 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.949
 copy of this gospel on 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.200
 Old Slavic language well stored on to 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.719
 Unfortunately, we are not in Slavic 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.489
 territories and in queens in royal 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.570
 Library hectares spouses and it belongs 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.760
 austria 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.789
 well, at least in Austria there is still 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.239
 this branch is a branch 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.489
 from the Jews and they existed before birth 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.190
 Christ and many of them were 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.430
 followers of christ disciples you it 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.129
 the bombard is a hungarian philologist who 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.260
 translated these scrolls in secret vault 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.600
 the Vatican he found them began to translate 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.689
 found that they are very similar to others 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.189
 ancient sacred texts and he them 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.229
 unveiled that is the first person 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.880
 who began to publicly tell 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.729
 talk about it publish articles and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.189
 so now about what tells 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.750
 again gospel about syroedeniya fasting 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.640
 cleanse the body therefore I will say my 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.150
 opinion in this all lead the results so 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.850
 say a chat this topic talks about 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.650
 is that the best option is power 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.360
 Of course, young exactly and raw food there 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.280
 manat is not said exactly and among 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.890
 no such word no just need 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.700
 eat once a day for life 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.250
 was long and not know the disease and not 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.430
 mixing food with each other is allowed 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.680
 two types of products to mix with each other 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.110
 in one meal and again I repeat 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.740
 one meal once a day not 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.049
 more 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.450
 still recommended one day of the week 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.969
 dedicate to god to devote 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.950
 spiritual and generally forget about this 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.680
 generally very very traditional advice 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.840
 this tradition seems to me age-old because 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.460
 what so many say talk about 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.470
 one day you can devote 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.700
 spiritual lord and not 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.830
 there is forget about not 9 even the words themselves 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.830
 sunday but sunday has always been 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.110
 bright that is, it was this day 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.300
 bright festive spiritual and 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.950
 sunday no cause diode needed 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.690
 be sure to go to church to devote 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.160
 myself 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.110
 spirituality not only cheese 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.480
 visions but even about how to come to 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.470
 raw food there tells the story of 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.150
 how come 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.370
 our patients are crippled in our slang 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.260
 bums can be called so to speak 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.900
 send these bubbles sorry for the expression 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.540
 to Jesus they say that to us to do us 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.170
 such a miserable life we are not happy 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.470
 no life we ​​are sick 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.450
 mutilated and he gives them recommendations what 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.430
 first you need to clean the body 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.610
 enema tell us how to do an enema 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.800
 under these conditions that is 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.520
 do the pumpkin enema yourself 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.680
 pumpkin stalk and pumpkin 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.610
 scrub the cavity to pumpkin stalk 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.250
 became a hose oh to clean the taipu 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.769
 pour the water there pumpkin lift up 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.650
 where so tree to attach and to water 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.100
 butt through the hose went into the back 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.360
 pass 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.850
 make so many enemas so many of these 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.040
 here are the cleaning procedures so far 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.840
 do until it comes out clean 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.970
 clear water, I also think that it is quite 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.720
 correct because the enema is real 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.610
 should be done exactly that time until 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.440
 comes out really clean water without 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.660
 any impurities and after fasting 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.420
 you can already eat eat food in 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.180
 do not kill her fresh 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.000
 eat with fire once a day and not 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.000
 mixing up there are a maximum of two kinds of food 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.030
 two kinds of fruit in one meal and 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.980
 eat food according to the season and then the years in 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.200
 yours will be long you will not know 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.440
 disease I really like, I admire 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.660
 just that this is a great example of a true 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.850
 from the hotel there is truth to eat once in 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.019
 day without mixing that something most san 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:15.480
 ears option and of course it is again 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.620
 still one step to prano studies from such 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.700
 food labs I don't want 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.760
 to rant 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.840
 and debate about find 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.420
 because so many different opinions 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.350
 will be including the controversial release 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.760
 at least this kind of food, I think it's 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.190
 the finest food of course gospel 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.590
 shakes is not canonical but she 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.190
 can not be canonical if 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.190
 exists 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.080
 the other four gospels are very 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.670
 Naturally which are greatly altered 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.030
 far from intact 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.670
 published as but can with them 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.810
 agree if 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.470
 the gospel of the Essenes speaks completely about 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.420
 friend and how dads will then do 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.480
 their work go to church and and communicate 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.210
 with people preaching lead if they 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.240
 recognize that everything else is to be yes 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.980
 these are the wrong traditions unhealthy 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.720
 traditions that may even be directed 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.670
 against man against and about health 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.310
 against the goodness of man just to 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.470
 turn a man into an animal is about to 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.720
 very good words i just said 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.370
 make man animal controlled 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.590
 an animal that cannot think which 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.050
 nothing can itself which is just 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.900
 forced to follow 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.300
 forced to obey and abide by the rules 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.280
 of the law and being weak for fine 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.170
 I understand that in the Middle Ages it is very 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.750
 strong was the persecution today 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.390
 traditional all that against that 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.670
 power which was against the church against 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.050
 politicians of kings therefore it is quite 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.780
 normal for me absolutely 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.300
 believable something and the gospel was in 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.510
 that keep all the vatican and of course no one 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.340
 I did not want to make it public because 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.050
 would cause a total system crash she’s not 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.600
 could exist how could anyone 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.890
 to manage such people because of course 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.020
 i give rub links to this book 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.460
 read if you do not know though it 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.400
 quite famous book in a circle 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.320
 raw foodists write your opinions about this 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.330
 the book is of course very interesting to me or 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.610
 about some new information which 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.729
 has to do there for example about how 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.550
 the church is raw food 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.930
 and vegetarianism to cleanse the body 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.529
 still wanted to add what actually 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.930
 church posts 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.300
 they used to be fasting that is 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.759
 while church posts earlier generally 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.259
 it was impossible to eat food later 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:28.270
 they perverted systole 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:30.639
 that's what they are now yours 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.180
 a little bit already manifest themselves in 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:36.639
 nutrition is shy but it's already 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.830
 perverted post is not original 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:42.219
 fasting for example in Islam remained 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.710
 Ramadan post such lasts 30 days or 31 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:48.249
 day love can from month almost month 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.139
 during ramadan one cannot eat but that 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:51.909
 their condition is allowed to eat after sunset 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:55.270
 sun but i think of course this 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:58.539
 was meant not to eat 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:01.330
 in general, while there is sun while it is shining 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:04.289
 the sun can not eat for a month they 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:07.629
 now very muslim 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:10.990
 perverted this tradition and not just eat 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:14.409
 against again after sunset they 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:16.330
 overeat they feasts arrange how 

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:18.729
 only the sun goes down they go to 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.990
 restaurant walk don't sleep all night because 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:22.020
 that they like it is not easy 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.129
 transition to nocturnal is easier 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.879
 Happy Ramadan Day 

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:29.499

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:31.749
