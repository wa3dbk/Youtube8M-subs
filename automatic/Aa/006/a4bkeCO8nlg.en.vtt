00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
was they didn't function very well the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.900 
was they didn't function very well the
paper<00:00:27.810> dolls<00:00:28.109> were<00:00:28.680> paper<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.310> when<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.699> went

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
paper dolls were paper and when you went

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.959 
paper dolls were paper and when you went
to<00:00:30.060> rip<00:00:30.300> them<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.080> paper<00:00:31.470> page

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
to rip them out of the paper page

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.240 
to rip them out of the paper page
inevitably<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.270> would<00:00:33.630> rip<00:00:34.020> them<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
inevitably I would rip them and the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.040 
inevitably I would rip them and the
outfits<00:00:35.610> would<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.880> torn<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.899> other

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
outfits would be torn and the other

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.869 
outfits would be torn and the other
thing<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.559> really<00:00:37.770> frustrated<00:00:38.550> me<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.790> they

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
thing that really frustrated me is they

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.030 
thing that really frustrated me is they
had<00:00:39.030> those<00:00:39.210> tabs<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:40.050> sort<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.350> make<00:00:40.680> them<00:00:40.860> so

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
had those tabs that sort of make them so

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.670 
had those tabs that sort of make them so
they<00:00:41.160> fit<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.820> doll<00:00:42.000> but<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.140> tabs<00:00:43.410> never

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
they fit on the doll but the tabs never

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.680 
they fit on the doll but the tabs never
worked<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.760> outfits<00:00:45.120> always<00:00:45.420> sort<00:00:45.660> of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
worked and the outfits always sort of

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.510 
worked and the outfits always sort of
came<00:00:45.960> half<00:00:46.260> off<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.530> doll<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.100> they<00:00:47.219> never

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
came half off the doll so they never

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.850 
came half off the doll so they never
looked<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.270> they<00:00:48.450> really<00:00:48.719> fit<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.170> doll<00:00:49.530> I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
looked like they really fit the doll I

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.139 
looked like they really fit the doll I
