00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
tin but I've left the top of it slightly

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.740 
tin but I've left the top of it slightly
rough<00:02:39.700> because<00:02:40.700> what<00:02:41.000> I'm<00:02:41.120> going<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.330> do<00:02:41.510> now

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
talk a little bit rough helps to add to

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.440 
talk a little bit rough helps to add to
the<00:02:56.330> marbling<00:02:56.810> effect<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:58.790> I'm<00:02:58.910> now<00:02:59.090> going<00:02:59.360> to

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
spoon over the rest of the mixture and

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.160

then I'm going to drizzle over the rest

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:15.950 
then I'm going to drizzle over the rest
of<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.590> chocolate

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.870 

now<00:03:16.960> to<00:03:17.020> help<00:03:17.410> mix<00:03:17.740> it<00:03:18.040> for<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.430> marbling

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
now to help mix it for the marbling

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.570 
now to help mix it for the marbling
effect<00:03:18.970> i'm<00:03:19.420> using<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.840> skewer<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.860> i'm<00:03:21.400> just

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
effect i'm using a skewer and i'm just

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.270 
effect i'm using a skewer and i'm just
going<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.940> swirl<00:03:22.120> gently<00:03:23.250> through<00:03:24.250> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
going to swirl gently through the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.410 
going to swirl gently through the
mixture<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:26.280> don't<00:03:27.280> want<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.550> mix<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:27.970> in<00:03:28.150> too

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
mixture I don't want to mix it in too

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.200 
mixture I don't want to mix it in too
much<00:03:28.690> or<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.980> will<00:03:30.040> just<00:03:30.280> become<00:03:30.550> all<00:03:31.030> of

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
much or it will just become all of

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:39.979 
much or it will just become all of
chocolate<00:03:31.630> cake

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.449 

so<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.110> cake<00:03:41.319> needs<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.890> go<00:03:42.010> in<00:03:42.160> an<00:03:42.310> oven

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
so the cake needs to go in an oven

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.140 
so the cake needs to go in an oven
that's<00:03:42.849> being<00:03:43.209> preheated<00:03:44.110> to<00:03:44.800> 160<00:03:45.790> degrees

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
that's being preheated to 160 degrees

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.410 
that's being preheated to 160 degrees
centigrade<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:47.140> that<00:03:48.069> will<00:03:48.190> take<00:03:48.400> between<00:03:48.700> 50

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
centigrade and that will take between 50

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.089 
centigrade and that will take between 50
and<00:03:49.450> 60<00:03:49.930> minutes<00:03:52.019> so<00:03:53.019> when<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.349> cake<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:53.560> cold

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
and 60 minutes so when the cake is cold

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.110 
and 60 minutes so when the cake is cold
you<00:03:54.760> can<00:03:54.970> peel<00:03:55.239> back<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.540> lining<00:03:56.170> paper<00:03:56.709> and

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
you can peel back the lining paper and

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.809 
you can peel back the lining paper and
sliced<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.390> I<00:03:58.660> find<00:03:59.410> it's<00:03:59.590> easiest<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.220> use<00:04:00.370> a

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
sliced it I find it's easiest to use a

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.119 
sliced it I find it's easiest to use a
knife<00:04:01.030> with<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.450> serrated<00:04:01.720> blade<00:04:02.379> rather<00:04:02.830> than

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
knife with a serrated blade rather than

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.930 
knife with a serrated blade rather than
a<00:04:03.400> plain<00:04:03.730> blade<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.769> hopefully<00:04:05.769> when<00:04:06.310> is<00:04:06.640> cut

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
a plain blade and hopefully when is cut

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.870 
a plain blade and hopefully when is cut
you'll<00:04:07.750> see<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.170> nice<00:04:08.349> swirls<00:04:08.830> of<00:04:09.190> chocolate

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.370 

so<00:04:15.880> that's<00:04:16.090> my<00:04:16.299> finished<00:04:16.660> chocolate<00:04:17.139> marble
