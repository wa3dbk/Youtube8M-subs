00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
what's really important here is that the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.670

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and that way it would Brown otherwise

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.880 
and that way it would Brown otherwise
it'll<00:01:18.390> get<00:01:18.570> soggy<00:01:20.360> whoa<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:22.259> simmering<00:01:22.710> away
