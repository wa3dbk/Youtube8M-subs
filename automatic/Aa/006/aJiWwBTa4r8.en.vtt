 I wish you a good and a 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.680
 happy new year and a merry christmas to this because 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.810
 it does not seem like I did two 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.910
 videos where I said where I wish a 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.470
 merry christmas so good here it is done on 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.930
 now goes to the gameplay finally 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:56.270
 gameplay at the small to the second video 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:59.030
 of the possible mallesons by so in 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.380
 the first one I showed you here 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.790
 was his coming well so I 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.170
 did my little research again 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.060
 and fixed turbine hand intrigued me so 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.490
 I told myself fixed turbine six turbines 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.830
 it makes me think of what on the map 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.509
 turbine so I leave you there and we get 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.649
 found immediately on the map 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:24.020
 turbine at all and well a return the 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.429
 world we are then on this map 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.429
 turbine I just regret a little trick 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:31.159
 to a nice secret passage good to know 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:33.560
 so in passing a small secret passage 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.329
 that I had never discovered I finally 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.310
 do not find it useful but here I am 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.009
 you show it these gifts so we're going 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:45.049
 immediately move on to the second 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:49.069
 part of the zombie so already I wanted 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.389
 finally show you everything all 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.189
 the zombies stuff will happen in 

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:55.460
 this room there in this great room 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:59.090
 is here so first of all I'm going to you 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.799
 show that here also nothing to the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.030
 zombie are coming zombies are coming 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.720
 zombies are coming here so that makes 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.890
 three areas bihar coming that's 4 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.120
 and if I'm wrong there is a 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.170
 fifth month the leggings coming five 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:23.450
 men I had not count on the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:25.680
 6 7 and 8 9 9 here I am there are nine 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.660
 I hope I 'm not wrong 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.970
 so that's normally there are nine if 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.040
 to tell you more about it and so much the better 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.460
 for you expected more but I 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.800
 I counted nine there so we get 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.510
 find here so we're not here to 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.270
 talk about the turret of course we 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.530
 was talking about the zombie so you see like 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.860
 me you are not blind you are 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.330
 not said bill either see the figure 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.760
 finally the number 12 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.970
 so that immediately made me think of 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.870
 that the shit out we will go into 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.180
 October that supporting too much too much 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.720
 the loose what fucking but that's in 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.580
 find a 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.050
 here at worst it's okay we're going 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.310
 go back on the other you understood 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.440
 that it was the 12th 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:13.200
 so that immediately made me think of 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.410
 that that zombie finally that a dlc 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.940
 possible could come out on the 12th 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.260
 so what I do not know but 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.670
 but according to the information I think 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.680
 not to leave the skin to chance 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.060
 the developers still did the 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.890
 map them and I would see them badly finally say 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.580
 it is possible but I would see them badly 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.010
 to say bullshit say bullshit 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.570
 just so here we are sailboats 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.630
 are bi still 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.820
 so I think the zombie will come out on 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.580
 12 the 12th of which wood I do not know 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.140
 finally I do not know I'm going to you 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.000
 show something else that will 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.660
 maybe enlighten you then as you 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.970
 see here there is a small computer and 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:02.459
 it's weird to January January so 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.230
 jean January 12 is soon time 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.450
 where finally the day I'm doing this 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.280
 video is the 2 so I will not delay 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.130
 to post it either 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.319
 I think I put it on the 2 or 3 6 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.670
 if I have something else to do but everything 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.370
 case I ask you very dense and zola 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.340
 so do not worry you'll be at 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.590
 current before 12 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.919
 so why not why it would not be 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.530
 possible that finally be jc french this 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.910
 that I said but I would see a 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.889
 small dlc go out January 12 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.210
 it would be consistent with what is here 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:41.910
 which is sure the computers though 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:45.330
 sorry but I noticed that the 12 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.540
 it was a then sunday mondays chief of 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.000
 wings ok it was a Wednesday and I 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.180
 watched on on my computer the 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.169
 schedule is unfortunately this is not 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.760
 not that's not quite it's not 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.130
 not that does not quite fit 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:07.280
 given that two seconds I check 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:10.350
 and the timetable as the 12 / 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:14.630
 on the real calendar 2013 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:18.479
 it would be a Saturday and not a 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.370
 Wednesday so listen I do not know if 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.590
 that to see with each other 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.479
 I do not know if there will really be a 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.090
 dlc all i can tell you is 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.710
 that these are assumptions and that he does 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.600
 do not take them seriously anyway 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.340
 we just are not bullshit 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.200
 I do not think that I finally 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.479
 did not do that I said to myself ah 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.080
 are we going to run a rumor and 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.450
 turning 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.890
 not at all I explored the maps 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:45.180
 I looked a little bit at 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:47.520
 passed on the maps and we see that we 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.770
 see some information that kind 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:56.700
 stop at 00:01 that 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.650
 that this is it in January and that the 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.430

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.350
 the 12 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.610
 so that's all I can you 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.320
