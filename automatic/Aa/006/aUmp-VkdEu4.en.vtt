00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.779
 The farm freedom is in the municipality of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.469
 uirapuru in the region of the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.870
 382 kilometers from the capital is 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.089
 here that if gilberto ex fisherman 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.369
 dedicates to the creation of pirarucu one of the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.619
 larger freshwater fish of the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.150
 world 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.039
 This is very rewarding. 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.590
 people still invest even more and 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.400
 believe that it is possible to preserve 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.630
 and have success and still have income in 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.510
 zero farm is possible is both 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.730
 together making money with preservation 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.890
 the pirarucu project is authorized and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.260
 monitored by ibama since 2001 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.210
 interest in creation came when the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.670
 producer realized that the species was 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.309
 disappearing from Brazilian rivers 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.410
 today the farm has 35 tanks that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.160
 more than three thousand copies of the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.050
 fish 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.660
 nurseries are interconnected and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.480
 supplied by this huge dam of 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.000
 over 15 hectares of extension that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.369
 time of year is spawn time 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.979
 to increase production today on the farm 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.200
 of his gilberto there are 170 animals that 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.390
 are ready are arrays and will 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.970
 continue giving more productivity 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.130
 Gilberto, how much do you want to give? 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.810
 sequence in this production rather clear 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.460
 We want to continue this there. 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.900
 because when we talk in 170 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.240
 selected arrays 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.729
 this is a fish that is already so fit 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.909
 to happen the first spawning means 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.759
 a fish has already reached 45 years around 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.200
 from 40 to 50 kilos and through these 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.810
 animals that we make and go 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.840
 selecting couples is selecting a 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.880
 couple poses to separate puts one in 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.000
 nursery will have a treatment 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.649
 where spawning takes place. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.180
 has been going to say is a 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.790
 work we've been doing this 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.590
 here means a few years plus one of the 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.439
 successfully because you already have several 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.360
 spawning results in nurseries no longer 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.090
 we separate the animals 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.430
 the kilo of the fish is sold for 31 reais 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.610
 the pirarucu can gain weight up to 10 kilograms 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.239
 in a year and is beaten early around 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.360
 14 months after breeding the fingerlings 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.600
 are removed from the nurseries and taken 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.180
 breeding tank 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.730
 It is in this space that puppies learn 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.160
 the feed ration with the step that 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.480
 weight gain of the fry 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.230
 impressive 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.230
 look at a fish with less than 30 days already 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.530
 is reaching around the hedge that 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.680
 about 17 centimeters or so is a 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.570
 adapted fish eating ration is already leaving 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.030
 here from the farm with a guide with note 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.750
 fiscal is this beast here inside the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.830
 maximum and 15 to 20 days it can go already 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.920
 for fattening 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.190
 already the adapted text to eat ration is a 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.650
 fish that will not have problem anymore with 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.480
 adaptation of living if we follow the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.000
 capture of some animals that are 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.220
 being treated for 14 months in treatment 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.470
 with feed once a day 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.440
 but the interesting thing is that every pirarucu 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.710
 has its own digital and differentiate 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.510
 male to female is not easy task key 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.610
 and tourist both here in the head the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.320
 drawings as in the tail 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:20.020
 here on the tail here is this is hardly 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.320
 could you really guarantee that the 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.050
 male and female because if you 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.820
 You can only distinguish between it and a complaint 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.820
 and will reach in its 30 kilos 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.200
 only six months working on the farm 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.990
 if you were unable to develop a 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:44.750
 Special way of treating fish thing 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:48.380
 I never did my job in Sao Paulo 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.290
 and here comes this nature comes here has 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.630
 important presence is this you because 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.050
 you make everything you like 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.280
 spoiled-pleasure dried singing dane 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.990
 I was a guy I was 20 today 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.700
 forgotten that in addition to the production 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.460
 your gilberto managed to 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.610
 domesticate some pirarucus that arrive at 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.250
 weigh 140 kilos and here in the 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.989
 The way he uses them to feed them has 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.810
 called attention no no no it 's a 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.720
 The rare form of treatment is with 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.100
 nature of the domesticated or 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.900
 inspirational course 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.550
 I think it's very beautiful, it's not the first 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.350
 time I see is the second time she 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.180
 comes is always a way to show the 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.180
 proximity to the fish with Mr. Mexico
