mod<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:27.259> as<00:00:28.259> I<00:00:28.439> said<00:00:28.470> called<00:00:28.980> dwarfcraft<00:00:29.429> and

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
mod it's as I said called dwarfcraft and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.440 
mod it's as I said called dwarfcraft and
it<00:00:30.119> basically<00:00:30.679> turns<00:00:31.679> into<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.070> dwarf<00:00:32.430> if<00:00:32.670> you

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
it basically turns into a dwarf if you

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.530 
it basically turns into a dwarf if you
think<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.900> the<00:00:34.110> likes<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.470> mine<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:35.010> pony

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
think of the likes of mine little pony

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.030 
think of the likes of mine little pony
it's<00:00:36.540> something<00:00:37.020> similar<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.530> changes<00:00:37.920> your

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
it's something similar it changes your

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.970 
it's something similar it changes your
player<00:00:38.340> model<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.080> it's<00:00:40.080> quite<00:00:40.620> interesting

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
player model and it's quite interesting

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.520 
player model and it's quite interesting
I<00:00:41.520> believe<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.330> guy<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.660> made<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.050> mod<00:00:43.320> is

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
I believe the guy that made this mod is

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.790 
I believe the guy that made this mod is
actually<00:00:44.310> creating<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.970> for<00:00:45.000> use<00:00:45.540> in<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.050> series

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
actually creating it for use in a series

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.050 
actually creating it for use in a series
that<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.100> producing<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.760> that'll<00:00:47.970> be

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
that is producing so that'll be

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.170 
that is producing so that'll be
interesting<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.690> how<00:00:48.810> that<00:00:48.990> pans<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.500> I

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
interesting to see how that pans I I

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.170 
interesting to see how that pans I I
feel<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.570> probably<00:00:53.180> something

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
feel that this is probably something

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.090 
feel that this is probably something
similar<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.900> mine<00:00:55.050> little<00:00:55.230> pony<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.740> the<00:00:55.770> sense

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
similar to mine little pony in the sense

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.650 
similar to mine little pony in the sense
that<00:00:56.540> should<00:00:57.540> you<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.520> a<00:00:59.520> friend<00:00:59.670> also<00:01:00.510> have

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
this installed you will see them as a

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.429 
this installed you will see them as a
dwarf<00:01:02.880> if<00:01:03.330> they<00:01:03.450> have<00:01:03.540> a<00:01:03.600> custom<00:01:03.930> skin<00:01:04.259> you

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
dwarf if they have a custom skin you

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
that they have went to this extent and

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.879 
that they have went to this extent and
actually<00:01:49.259> provided<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:50.990> alternate<00:01:51.990> form<00:01:52.740> of

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
least a helmet should be sitting off of

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.539 
least a helmet should be sitting off of
the<00:01:58.529> head<00:01:58.740> and<00:02:00.350> perhaps<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.069> boots<00:02:02.310> as

it's<00:02:07.889> just<00:02:08.159> my<00:02:08.280> arms<00:02:08.610> intersecting<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:10.530> armor

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
it's just my arms intersecting the armor

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.460 
it's just my arms intersecting the armor
it's<00:02:11.280> very<00:02:11.700> weird<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.360> very<00:02:12.420> interesting

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
it's very weird it's very interesting

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.740 
it's very weird it's very interesting
but<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.920> can<00:02:14.910> see<00:02:15.060> what<00:02:15.180> they<00:02:15.240> did<00:02:15.300> here<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.690> I

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
but I can see what they did here and I

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.850 
but I can see what they did here and I
really<00:02:16.710> do<00:02:16.890> enjoy<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.850> mod<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.480> quite

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
really do enjoy this mod that is quite

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.300 
really do enjoy this mod that is quite
quirky<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.190> quite<00:02:20.400> weird<00:02:22.040> granted<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
quirky and quite weird granted the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.460 
quirky and quite weird granted the
camera<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.660> little<00:02:25.290> bit<00:02:25.470> odd<00:02:26.150> because<00:02:27.470> when

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
camera is a little bit odd because when

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.960 
camera is a little bit odd because when
you're<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.770> third<00:02:28.950> person<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.490> camera<00:02:29.850> is

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
you're on third person the camera is

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.390 
you're on third person the camera is
still<00:02:30.120> centered<00:02:30.710> just<00:02:31.710> above<00:02:31.920> your<00:02:31.980> head

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
still centered just above your head

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.480 
still centered just above your head
really<00:02:32.820> when<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.840> are<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.380> first<00:02:34.770> person<00:02:35.040> you

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
really when you are in first person you

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.090 
really when you are in first person you
still<00:02:35.850> seem<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.180> be<00:02:36.300> two<00:02:36.570> blocks<00:02:36.870> high<00:02:37.140> when<00:02:38.010> in

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
still seem to be two blocks high when in

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.880 
still seem to be two blocks high when in
reality<00:02:38.280> you're<00:02:38.760> only<00:02:38.940> one<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.660> don't<00:02:40.230> know<00:02:40.740> if

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
reality you're only one I don't know if

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.220 
reality you're only one I don't know if
that<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.190> something<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.090> can<00:02:42.300> be<00:02:42.390> changed<00:02:42.420> in

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
that is something that can be changed in

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.470 
that is something that can be changed in
Minecraft<00:02:43.770> I've<00:02:43.980> never<00:02:44.250> really<00:02:44.640> seen<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.060> done

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
Minecraft I've never really seen it done

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.610 
Minecraft I've never really seen it done
but<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.470> would<00:02:46.680> quite<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.959> don't<00:02:48.959> know<00:02:49.500> I

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
but I would quite like to I don't know I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.290 
but I would quite like to I don't know I
would<00:02:49.890> quite<00:02:50.040> like<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.310> feel<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:50.940> am<00:02:51.090> in

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
would quite like to feel that I am in

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.770 
would quite like to feel that I am in
fact<00:02:51.450> one<00:02:51.840> block<00:02:52.230> high<00:02:52.620> or<00:02:53.000> am<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.180> am<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.480> I'm<00:02:54.720> a

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
fact one block high or am I am I I'm a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.770 
fact one block high or am I am I I'm a
little<00:02:55.290> bit<00:02:55.470> taller<00:02:55.740> than<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.070> block<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:57.630> there

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
little bit taller than a block so there

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.750 
little bit taller than a block so there
is<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.900> reason<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.530> can't<00:02:58.890> fit<00:02:59.160> through<00:02:59.340> one

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
is a reason that I can't fit through one

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.540 
is a reason that I can't fit through one
block<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:00.709> even<00:03:01.709> at<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:01.860> as<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.220> can<00:03:02.370> see

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
block but even at that as you can see

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.160 
block but even at that as you can see
here<00:03:04.130> realistically<00:03:05.130> speaking<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:06.120> would<00:03:06.720> be

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
here realistically speaking I would be

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.380 
here realistically speaking I would be
targeting<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:07.800> block<00:03:08.070> at<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.280> bottom<00:03:08.580> but<00:03:09.330> I

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
targeting that block at the bottom but I

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.840 
targeting that block at the bottom but I
punch<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:09.930> had<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.110> one<00:03:10.230> above<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.850> it's

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
punch and I had the one above it so it's

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.160 
punch and I had the one above it so it's
a<00:03:11.970> little<00:03:12.120> bit<00:03:12.240> weird<00:03:12.600> if<00:03:12.780> you're<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> fan<00:03:13.140> of

a little bit weird if you're a fan of

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.020 
a little bit weird if you're a fan of
playing<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.620> third<00:03:13.860> person<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.520> don't<00:03:14.790> know<00:03:14.910> if

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
playing in third person I don't know if

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.840 
playing in third person I don't know if
anyone<00:03:15.300> is<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:15.780> if<00:03:16.020> you<00:03:16.709> are<00:03:16.740> it's<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.280> little

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.270 
anyone is but if you are it's a little
