00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:13.860
 well in moodle animals 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:16.260
 lay ducks and teamwork for two weeks 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.980
 late the complexion result is a box full 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.289
 flour long 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.930
 at these insect farms 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.850
 become 100,000 kilos of mealworms every year 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.789
 I know when to be both in you 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.439
 lost son 99% serves as food for 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.539
 birds fish and reptiles 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.710
 what remains is for human 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.390
 consumption 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.430
 these are freeze-dried mealworms that 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.989
 we at the hospitality wholesale form 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.969
 you can sell human consumption 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.110
 experience wok dishes or mix in nuts 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.780
 to do 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.829
 and here are the put utility and bubbles that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.690
 are made from chicken fillet and mealworms 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.309
 the mealworms are on the rise 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.780
 as food for humans 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.640
 they are easy and environmentally friendly 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.070
 to grow and can be a solution 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.899
 for the food shortage in the world with 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.280
 that growing world population is also 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.949
 a growing prosperity causing people 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.600
 start eating more meat and we get it 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.970
 no longer for each other on this globe 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.189
 so mealworms that are cold-blooded 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.290
 need little and they can 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.420
 non-animal proteins do offer that 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.060
 we need for healthy growth 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.340
 from us to body and the mail horn 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.590
 certainly in combination with chicken but taste 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.000
 good and therefore has top restaurant noma 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.470
 in Copenhagen 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.270
 all with a few mealworms 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.439
 Experimented the response we had 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.000
 is that they really have a few beautiful ones 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.470
 have experienced products 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.700
 she will look at how we can be a good one there 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.619
 to be able to give taste 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.180
 but also that they are our products again 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.520
 improve in taste 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.000
 foreign interest is nice but how 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.250
 is it with the restaurants in Brabant 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.570
 so we make it something for you 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.390

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.149

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.720
 arrange the customer for them 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.220
 yes I find him something unpleasant 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.119
 the standing still needs something to be done yes 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.119
 more normal work
