00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.919 
driving at a red light to a telephone
pole<00:02:08.119> bottoms<00:02:09.119> first<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.599> would<00:02:09.660> hit<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
pole bottoms first that would hit the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.690 
pole bottoms first that would hit the
hole<00:02:10.080> underneath<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.679> truck<00:02:10.979> almost<00:02:11.220> it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
hole underneath of the truck almost it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.199 
hole underneath of the truck almost it
was<00:02:11.819> like

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
was like

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.550 
was like
that's<00:02:13.209> how<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.450> did<00:02:13.569> it<00:02:13.689> almost<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:14.290> kind<00:02:14.500> of

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
that's how it did it almost is kind of

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.770 
that's how it did it almost is kind of
weird<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.700> bent<00:02:15.909> my<00:02:16.030> frame<00:02:16.299> a<00:02:16.329> little<00:02:16.659> bit

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
weird and it bent my frame a little bit

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.210 
weird and it bent my frame a little bit
but<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.019> probably<00:02:17.200> can't<00:02:17.439> tell<00:02:17.500> because<00:02:17.980> I

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
but you probably can't tell because I

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.009 
but you probably can't tell because I
got<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.400> hammer<00:02:18.670> bent<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.150> back<00:02:19.260> um<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:21.780> plan<00:02:22.780> on

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
got a hammer bent it back um I plan on

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.380 
got a hammer bent it back um I plan on
get<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.379> TCS<00:02:24.159> crawlers<00:02:24.610> one<00:02:24.819> of<00:02:25.060> course

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
get the TCS crawlers one of course

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.319 
get the TCS crawlers one of course
sooner<00:02:25.750> or<00:02:25.840> later<00:02:25.900> um<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.849> then<00:02:28.030> each<00:02:28.180> of

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
sooner or later um and then each of

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.660 
sooner or later um and then each of
these<00:02:28.450> wires<00:02:28.750> were<00:02:29.079> split<00:02:29.379> open<00:02:29.709> well<00:02:30.340> these

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
these wires were split open well these

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.490 
these wires were split open well these
two<00:02:30.730> were<00:02:31.030> not<00:02:31.239> this<00:02:31.480> last<00:02:31.720> one<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:32.290> I

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
two were not this last one but I

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.289 
two were not this last one but I
individually<00:02:33.400> wrapped<00:02:33.610> with<00:02:33.760> all<00:02:33.879> these<00:02:34.030> with

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
individually wrapped with all these with

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.539 
individually wrapped with all these with
electrical<00:02:34.810> tape<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.230> then<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.129> wrapped<00:02:36.370> them

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
electrical tape and then I wrapped them

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.130 
electrical tape and then I wrapped them
all<00:02:36.730> together<00:02:36.879> with<00:02:37.180> one<00:02:37.360> piece<00:02:37.599> of<00:02:37.750> tape<00:02:37.900> and

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
all together with one piece of tape and

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.220 
all together with one piece of tape and
then<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.349> zip<00:02:38.650> tied<00:02:38.829> it<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:40.030> that's<00:02:40.840> what<00:02:41.109> I<00:02:41.140> did

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
then I zip tied it so that's what I did

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.520 
then I zip tied it so that's what I did
there<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.849> then<00:02:42.849> I<00:02:44.010> on<00:02:45.750> he<00:02:46.750> seemed<00:02:47.049> I<00:02:47.200> put<00:02:47.379> all

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
there and then I on he seemed I put all

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.800 
there and then I on he seemed I put all
new<00:02:47.829> heatsink<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.370> all<00:02:48.489> three<00:02:48.730> of<00:02:48.760> these<00:02:48.879> over

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
new heatsink on all three of these over

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.030 
new heatsink on all three of these over
the<00:02:49.930> heatsink<00:02:50.319> that<00:02:50.440> there's<00:02:50.650> already<00:02:50.799> it's

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
the heatsink that there's already it's

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.220 
the heatsink that there's already it's
real<00:02:51.220> tight<00:02:51.459> fit<00:02:51.700> then<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.720> these<00:02:53.019> aren't

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
real tight fit then so these aren't

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.190 
real tight fit then so these aren't
coming<00:02:53.500> out<00:02:53.620> at<00:02:53.859> all<00:02:54.010> now<00:02:54.359> i<00:02:55.359> broke<00:02:56.170> the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
coming out at all now i broke the

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.190 
coming out at all now i broke the
original<00:02:56.349> zip<00:02:56.920> tie<00:02:57.099> if<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.549> can<00:02:57.760> tell<00:02:58.200> there's

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
original zip tie if you can tell there's

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.780 
original zip tie if you can tell there's
the<00:02:59.379> rigid<00:02:59.680> 0<00:02:59.709> zip<00:02:59.920> tie<00:03:00.069> next<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.489> zip<00:03:00.639> tie

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
the rigid 0 zip tie next to the zip tie

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.649 
the rigid 0 zip tie next to the zip tie
stuck<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:03.970> actually<00:03:04.090> fits<00:03:04.359> in<00:03:04.540> this

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
stuck in so and it actually fits in this

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.039 
stuck in so and it actually fits in this
hole<00:03:04.870> over<00:03:05.049> here<00:03:06.629> yeah<00:03:07.629> it<00:03:07.959> fits<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.409> hole

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
hole over here yeah it fits in the hole

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.759 
hole over here yeah it fits in the hole
and<00:03:11.049> that's<00:03:11.109> about<00:03:11.889> it<00:03:13.170> now<00:03:14.170> i'm<00:03:14.290> planning<00:03:14.680> on
