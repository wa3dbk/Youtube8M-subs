00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.629
 Hi very good companies companies 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.869
 of youtube one more day with a new 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:20.560
 tutorial today dedicated to the great bob marley 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.970
 with a very easy song and titled 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.290
 little birds is not a song for 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.290
 all those beginners who want 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.660
 do a righi rhythm and to see that 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.910
 it's easy to take to make this kind of 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.289
 rhythms and more with this song is 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.750
 just take like I said three 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.560
 chords the chords would be 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.970
 the 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.970
 and we already know it clearly 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.250
 and the song would carry this 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.810
 this arrangement of chords let's see 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.030
 we would tell you that we can do what it is 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.030
 well the rhythm down ricky would be 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.380
 but what we have to take care 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.539
 is that it is done 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.700
 after pasting the time we know 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.909
 common and it's like we made the cars 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.420
 that would be 12 but we touch what is the 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.020
 pace down in time second 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.020
 In a second 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.500
 is the pace that we would take 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.500
 in the video 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.710
 and realize that when I'm hitting him 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.710
 to the rhythm what I do is stop something 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.560
 and I turn the strings off again so that 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.560
 he is not ringing 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.140
 because that way it would not sound choppy has 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.140
 that only the cut well 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.570
 we have 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.369
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.369
 very well then 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.660
 the combination of chords would be the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:24.810
 next we would start with with a compass 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.810
 what would those four times be and not 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.770
 is your compass worth we can start with 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.850
 four trips the song more or less 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.520
 singing it like me 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.160
 I can do it in English but for you 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.950
 give an idea of ​​how it is made 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.010
 makeup pauses 12 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.730
 Y 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.080
 ah 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.080
 one year 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.850
 never 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.890
 Y 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.890
 no way 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.100
 at 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.140
 for nothing 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.010
 nothing 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.830
 very good because I would be going to treat 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:47.450
 explain it 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.570
 Apply it as many times as the network and 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.030
 min we would leave four of three measures 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.800
 in the beginning we will dedicate a compass 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.090
 and enters almost the last time 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.660
 we were 12 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.660
 Y 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.040
 it's also worth 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:20.950
 is 2 3 and 1 2 3 and we have Mr. 3 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.950
 compasses we pass the other way open 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.990
 one is worth we go to the live minute three 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.880
 Y 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:48.150
 we go hungry the same thing we're going to do 2 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:48.150
 3 and 1 2 3 and now we're going 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.440
 we went to see 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.530
 one 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.530
 the 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.509
 i 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.820
 to finish 11 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:18.230
 that is, then we are going to 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:22.960
 to review would be three in the 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:25.730
 three cups s agreed with bars 13 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.750
 34 are a compass three fibrous theologians 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:33.460
 times one network is worth we return to the 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:37.970
 another three measures we go back to network one 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:40.550
 we now do two in the voucher and we do 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.979
 one in milk 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.510
 we go down to do we go down the 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.570
 network do you 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:53.009
 we upload it to the other time we make one 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:57.830
 we make my other 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.830
 a king one and the 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.560
 very well that's all that this 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.560
 song 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.130
 I will also do what the 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.539
 introduction point of interest that 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:15.479
 makes the organ that organ so cool that 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:19.080
 take or if you want to do if you want 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:21.620
 do the introduction is the one that does 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.620
 Y 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:31.520
 that would be 22 seconds 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.770
 of 2 seconds in the third is a part 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:38.050
 of the third of the third string and 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:41.540
 we then make air in the second 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:46.000
 we return again to the second finger 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:49.540
 air the first and now 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:54.100
 second grace in the second part in the 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:56.290
 second air in it and we return 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.460
 also where the two breaks so that 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.460
 yourselves what it would 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:16.600
