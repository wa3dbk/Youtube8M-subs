00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
one o'clock in the morning so I saw this

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.900 
one o'clock in the morning so I saw this
watch<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.980> doesn't<00:00:26.279> come<00:00:26.369> with<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> strap

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
watch it doesn't come with a strap

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.820 
watch it doesn't come with a strap
actually<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> only<00:00:27.750> 20<00:00:28.470> millimeter

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
actually this is the only 20 millimeter

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.650 
actually this is the only 20 millimeter
strap<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.279> had<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.699> hand<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.150> would<00:00:30.330> fit

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
strap that I had on hand that would fit

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.170 
strap that I had on hand that would fit
it<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:32.130> just<00:00:32.369> dropped<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.850> there<00:00:33.030> it's

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
it so I just dropped it in there it's

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.069 
it so I just dropped it in there it's
not<00:00:33.420> really<00:00:33.750> matching<00:00:35.630> and<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.719> kind<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.930> looks

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
not really matching and it kind of looks

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.940 
not really matching and it kind of looks
funny<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:38.010> it's<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:39.149> pretty<00:00:39.329> decent<00:00:39.660> size

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
funny but it's it's pretty decent size

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.220 
funny but it's it's pretty decent size
with<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.040> little<00:00:41.219> bit<00:00:41.309> short<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.270> not<00:00:42.570> too

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
with a little bit short so it's not too

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.080 
with a little bit short so it's not too
small<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> lot<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.430> old<00:00:44.550> school<00:00:44.760> watches

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
small like a lot of old school watches

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.090 
small like a lot of old school watches
are<00:00:45.210> but<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:46.079> does<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.379> an<00:00:46.500> acrylic<00:00:46.770> crystal

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
are but it does have an acrylic crystal

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.970 
are but it does have an acrylic crystal
and<00:00:50.329> case<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.539> sort<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.199> base<00:00:52.379> metal<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and case is sort of a base metal with a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.680 
and case is sort of a base metal with a
chrome<00:00:53.250> plating<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.300> can't<00:00:54.539> be

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
chrome plating on it so it can't be

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.010 
chrome plating on it so it can't be
really<00:00:54.930> polished<00:00:56.239> stainless<00:00:57.239> steel<00:00:57.449> back

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.329 

manual<00:01:01.020> winding<00:01:01.230> movement<00:01:03.530> keeps<00:01:04.530> okay<00:01:05.040> time

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
manual winding movement keeps okay time

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.580 
manual winding movement keeps okay time
I<00:01:05.369> think<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:05.970> within<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.780> know<00:01:06.900> 30<00:01:07.170> seconds

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
I think it's within you know 30 seconds

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.000 
I think it's within you know 30 seconds
a<00:01:07.710> day<00:01:07.860> or<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.780> but<00:01:09.780> being<00:01:10.170> there's<00:01:10.500> no<00:01:10.560> second

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
a day or so but being there's no second

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.840 
a day or so but being there's no second
counter<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:12.710> it's<00:01:13.710> not<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.220> easy<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.640> tell

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
counter it's it's not that easy to tell

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.679 
counter it's it's not that easy to tell
but<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:16.020> does<00:01:16.560> jump<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.460> when<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.450> time

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
but it does jump so when the the time

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.469 
but it does jump so when the the time
hits<00:01:18.960> four<00:01:19.470> o'clock<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.920> jumps<00:01:20.689> kind<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.750> cool

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
hits four o'clock it jumps kind of cool

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.710 
hits four o'clock it jumps kind of cool
jumps<00:01:24.479> back<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:28.220> it<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> there's<00:01:30.659> a
