 pony welcome gentlemen to a new 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.350
 tutorial that I'm uploading a new 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:09.730
 video of the new series that came out this 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.970
 but well, let's go to this, which is what 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.350
 Let us chencha look before moving on to 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.499
 what has been the marches of the 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.999
 last week that I happened to upload them 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:21.449
 I will show how it is installed because it is 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:24.009
 a very recurring question within 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.449
 these videos when it's just a pose 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.310
 everybody says it's a hack where 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.769
 you take out that I do not know what of gentlemen does not have 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.079
 no pin joke is simply search 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.630
 the update of the week and download it 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.270
 to say here I have the one that came out of the 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.780
 week 24 that is being 14 of 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.820
 June lady since 2012 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.670
 this is na piolin whiting is in getting 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.010
 the page and download this that is being 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.140
 the client that is the file of this 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.719
 real point of the minecraft ok does not have 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.129
 no joke has no science 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.140
 Now the next thing you're going to do is 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.870
 go to your minecraft key folder that 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.320
 he must be here 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.650
 and this minecraft and here in the folder 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.350
 bing 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.840
 in this is this file that is called 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.270
 Minecraft point is already at its original 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.859
 what they are going to do is make a backup 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.770
 that is, they are going to grab it and they are going to copy it and 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:18.560
 they're going to put it somewhere else away from 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.060
 where from where you can carry it 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.850
 what I'm going to do is because if they have 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.340
 much or something like this who leaves his 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.289
 Minecraft as it was is super 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.259

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.789
 ok you here is this file what 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.170
 The only thing they have to do is put the 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.969
 that went down that is also another 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.619

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.189
 the week that is what they do that 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.049
 base the point file you're already and in the 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.780

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.520
 game information if we what 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.009

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.170
 when winrar as always here we go to 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.810

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.430

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.110
 there really is genre kingdom no 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.170
 even the dragon here they have it 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.990

 week after week 24 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.780

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.230

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.560

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.720
 here we have gentlemen the minecraft with the 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.790
 new this week update 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.720
 there really were no changes so very 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.520
 powerful 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.100
 the changes that there was forgiveness is that you 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.660
 they change fraps the changes that there were 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.660
 They were very simple too, that's why I 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.820
 I encouraged at once to combine everything together 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.120
 with the tutorial the first gentlemen good 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.980
 is the command if you have nights activate a 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.160
 command that will be called public if 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.760
 you put this public that mother 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.300
 what you are going to do is open a server 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.760
 note so that it is automatically 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.150
 you can 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.829
 put your game on your servers 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.290
 match and for example if you already have 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.720
 a network connected to the machi with its 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.400
 other friends if they want to enter their 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.650
 map a map that you have local 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.690
 Well, they're just going to put it on 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.389
 and will automatically give them commands 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.060
 and other things so that you this one 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.160
 have access to friends but not 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.169
 have access to the map and you choose 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.479
 how they come in if they come with chips and chips 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.669
 with game on zinc in mode etcetera is not 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.320
 the to make it easier so that 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.610
 have to put ip is nothing 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.470
 Automatically he is a friend of he will be able to 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.750
 I think I'm going to give you a number 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.669
 still not this one are very well done but 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.680
 I think he's going to give you a number and that 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.080
 number within your friends and ready but 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.940
 they have to be in their same network says 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.120
 which must be in the same land or so 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.580
 less in the lapse now another change 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.870
 good of those of the chests these of the 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.930
 of the right-wing 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.260
 they have a small change do not remember 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.180
 that before when you thundered them 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.280
 the little box was not good now 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.249
 do not stay unless this is the mode 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.209
 creative ok 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:15.589
 but for example if we put a 

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:15.589
 chest when this chest has the 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:23.039
 let's say utility save one 

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:25.740
 thing and that we see another side 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:29.729
 We transport the chest and have the 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.770
 same things in there ok this before 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.449
 it was in the whole game that is all 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.099
 players had the same one that offers 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:39.449
 there were 23 styles games and there were 23 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:42.509
 players on a server and that you're 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:44.939
 playing with these updates this 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.679
 the chest was general for all or you 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:48.149
 you found in all the chests though 

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:50.129
 they were from different person you were 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:52.080
 what you have after what the other 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:54.479
 person put et cetera right now and it's one 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.249
 for each player freedom you get in and 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:59.849
 while your chest is going to appear 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:02.819
 what's yours if the wey even if your chest and 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:05.149
 he opens it will see what he does not do if 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:09.149
 I mean, it's over here in your things 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:12.030
 is chingón and now to break it if we 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:14.460
 we remove the game 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:18.090
 we are not going to get the casket as 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:21.950
 such now what we get instead 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:25.190
 they are with obsidian squares 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.260
 and not return it to Oxidiana 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.270
 what the box is made also by 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.060
 true my ski flush my ski 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:35.180
 I thank my carnal very much that I 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.190
 did such a wichi 5 here is the vice 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.900
 sheep transit by all with my 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:43.130
 sweater chairs that chills here I'm 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:45.170
 in the snow bastards ok now one last 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.720
 upgrade 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:50.510
 I think that the game is nothing if I leave 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.000
 seeing nothing really now what's coming 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.550
 being is the texture you are already going to 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.710
 to be able to change for others already going there 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.500
 are going to have this texture packs already going to 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.290
 can change the textures directito 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.060
 here without doing anything else because I think that 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.740
 in the brand is a little more desmadre 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.510
 put the textures and several pesos good 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.650

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.970
 change textures that easy ok ok let's 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.530

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.150
