00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.500 

got<00:05:14.170> a<00:05:14.200> little<00:05:14.620> bit<00:05:14.800> so<00:05:15.340> what<00:05:16.000> I<00:05:16.060> found<00:05:16.360> out

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
got a little bit so what I found out

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.340 
got a little bit so what I found out
let's<00:05:19.510> see<00:05:19.720> so<00:05:19.990> together<00:05:20.890> know<00:05:21.190> before<00:05:22.350> you

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
let's see so together know before you

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.560 
let's see so together know before you
loo<00:05:23.560> you<00:05:24.040> use<00:05:24.220> less<00:05:25.170> but<00:05:26.170> you<00:05:26.350> still<00:05:26.650> get<00:05:26.920> up

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
loo you use less but you still get up

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.840 
loo you use less but you still get up
get<00:05:28.570> the<00:05:28.750> same<00:05:29.020> flavor<00:05:29.380> some<00:05:30.100> crack<00:05:30.400> that<00:05:30.550> step

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
get the same flavor some crack that step

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.170 
get the same flavor some crack that step
so<00:05:33.180> that<00:05:34.180> means<00:05:34.390> you're<00:05:35.340> taking<00:05:36.340> in<00:05:36.670> less<00:05:36.850> salt

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
so that means you're taking in less salt

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.030 
so that means you're taking in less salt
if<00:05:37.930> that<00:05:38.200> makes<00:05:38.410> any<00:05:38.560> sense

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
if that makes any sense

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.380 
if that makes any sense
