00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.370
 And there I am here in the geek of the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.650
 and this video as you know how 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.040
 defeat the first boss of the 8 ranking 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.690
 what is the rex 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.210
 So let's go to the fight and here 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.460
 fight is thus the mechanics and 1 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.369
 first i hid my black screen 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.519
 and alt + z minions to hide 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.769
 interface and all the following mechanical 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.130
 Your character will be working on the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.020
 center of the arena during the whole fight you 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.380
 you will only have control over the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.670
 skills and your character and the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.129
 and that the objective is as follows: 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.610
 these polygons we are walking in the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.430
 direction of your character and if these 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.809
 polygons to touch the face of your 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.930
 character in the direction in which the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.480
 character is watching you die in the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.230
 time then from where you took rotational 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.470
 your character so that the patience 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.530
 your character is always in the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.000
 of politicians' openings 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:16.460
 so it's very difficult but with 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.460
 quite practical is possible 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.910
 so that's basically what you always do 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.370
 keep make your character come back 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.060
 for the openings 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.060
 do not let the polygons slope in 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.979
 phase of the character until you can 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:44.970
 fight him you will need at least 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.820
 100 cd dpf in constant to power 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.590
 survive his henry that after two 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.180
 minutes 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.869
 then you need 100 kbps weak 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.869
 be able to win 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:06.890
 in my opinion this is one of the bosses 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:11.140
 more difficult scene of the bully and this is the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.140
 people should like it and see you next time.
