so<00:00:00.840> we're<00:00:01.260> going<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.469> launch<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.770> Windows<00:00:02.129> it

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
so we're going to launch a Windows it

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.210 
so we're going to launch a Windows it
has<00:00:02.460> the<00:00:02.700> night<00:00:02.879> or<00:00:03.210> two<00:00:03.689> ec2<00:00:04.560> instance<00:00:04.980> and

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
has the night or two ec2 instance and

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.839 
has the night or two ec2 instance and
configure<00:00:06.120> IES<00:00:06.930> web<00:00:07.740> servers<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.460> launch<00:00:08.639> a

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
configure IES web servers to launch a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.140 
configure IES web servers to launch a
basic<00:00:09.240> HTML<00:00:09.750> page<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.280> can<00:00:11.550> take<00:00:11.700> up<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.910> 15

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
basic HTML page so I can take up to 15

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.440 
basic HTML page so I can take up to 15
to<00:00:12.690> 30<00:00:13.380> minutes<00:00:13.650> for<00:00:14.160> your<00:00:14.400> password<00:00:15.179> to

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
to 30 minutes for your password to

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.960 
to 30 minutes for your password to
become<00:00:15.750> available<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.500> wind<00:00:17.279> up<00:00:17.460> for<00:00:17.699> Windows

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
become available in wind up for Windows

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.689 
become available in wind up for Windows
instances<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.619> meantime<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.520> just

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
instances so in the meantime we can just

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.509 
instances so in the meantime we can just
go<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:20.970> here<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:22.410> can<00:00:22.590> associate<00:00:23.070> I'll

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
go in here and we can associate I'll

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.570 
go in here and we can associate I'll
create<00:00:24.150> an<00:00:24.300> elastic<00:00:24.779> IP<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.800> associated

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
create an elastic IP and associated

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.320 
create an elastic IP and associated
winner<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.680> we've<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:28.710> done<00:00:29.160> that

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
winner is and so we've just done that

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.669 
winner is and so we've just done that
but<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.449> instance<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.170> that's<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> way<00:00:31.560> we

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
but this instance here that's the way we

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.100 
but this instance here that's the way we
do<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.239> so<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.360> go<00:00:33.510> back<00:00:33.540> into<00:00:33.870> where

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
do it and so we go back into where

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.860 
do it and so we go back into where
instance<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.649> page<00:00:35.390> will<00:00:36.390> see<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
instance this page will see that the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.590 
instance this page will see that the
elastic<00:00:37.320> IP<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:38.340> associated<00:00:39.210> with<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.450> there

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
elastic IP is associated with it there

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.549 
elastic IP is associated with it there
so<00:00:41.120> we<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.360> pause<00:00:42.600> while<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.079> wait<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.260> this

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
so we just pause while you wait for this

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.459 
so we just pause while you wait for this
tip<00:00:44.000> for<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> windows<00:00:45.719> password<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.230> become

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
tip for the windows password to become

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.250 
tip for the windows password to become
available<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:48.090> eventually<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.750> password

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
available so eventually the password

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.020 
available so eventually the password
becomes<00:00:49.890> available<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.579> right<00:00:50.760> click

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
becomes available we just right click

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.670 
becomes available we just right click
connect<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.949> we<00:00:52.949> retrieve<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.940> password

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
connect and we retrieve the password

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.529 
connect and we retrieve the password
Alaska's<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.190> verify<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.090> p.m.

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
Alaska's just to verify it with the p.m.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.650 
Alaska's just to verify it with the p.m.
we've<00:00:58.500> said<00:00:58.800> when<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.370> created<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.090> since<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
we've said when we created in since the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.930 
we've said when we created in since the
launch<00:01:00.840> wizard<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.070> let's<00:01:02.219> click<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
launch wizard so let's click on that and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.260 
launch wizard so let's click on that and
if<00:01:03.149> decrypt<00:01:03.750> password<00:01:04.549> and<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.729> always<00:01:05.909> good

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
if decrypt password and it's always good

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.050 
if decrypt password and it's always good
idea<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.840> copy<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.409> information<00:01:08.060> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
idea just to copy this information to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.300 
idea just to copy this information to
your<00:01:09.180> clipboard<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.740> download<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
your clipboard and to download the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.990 
your clipboard and to download the
shortcode<00:01:11.820> file<00:01:12.080> which<00:01:13.080> will<00:01:13.110> enable<00:01:13.650> us<00:01:13.920> to

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
shortcode file which will enable us to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.310 
shortcode file which will enable us to
to<00:01:15.000> open<00:01:15.570> up<00:01:15.659> our<00:01:15.780> rdp<00:01:16.229> connection<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:19.080> can

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
to open up our rdp connection so we can

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.280 
to open up our rdp connection so we can
open<00:01:19.830> up<00:01:20.159> our<00:01:20.400> our<00:01:21.210> windows<00:01:21.630> instance<00:01:22.080> with

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
open up our our windows instance with

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.789 
open up our our windows instance with
this<00:01:22.939> rdp<00:01:23.939> connection<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:24.990> confirm<00:01:25.560> that

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
this rdp connection so just confirm that

it'll<00:01:26.700> ask<00:01:26.820> us<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.509> password<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.170> just

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
it'll ask us for the password we just

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.130 
it'll ask us for the password we just
created<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:30.270> username<00:01:30.659> will<00:01:30.810> always<00:01:31.020> be

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
created the username will always be

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.780 
created the username will always be
administrator<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> decrypted

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
we're going to do is disable that the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.030 
we're going to do is disable that the

the exact term is the Internet Explorer
and<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:58.079> security<00:01:58.920> configuration<00:01:59.570> it's<00:02:00.570> just

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and as security configuration it's just

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.350 
and as security configuration it's just
an<00:02:01.439> annoying<00:02:02.399> sort<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.820> confirmation

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
an annoying sort of confirmation

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.530 
an annoying sort of confirmation
messages<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.229> constantly<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.540> confirm

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
messages we constantly have to confirm

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.389

so<00:02:06.810> we're<00:02:06.930> going<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.170> turn<00:02:07.290> down<00:02:07.380> those<00:02:07.799> those

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
so we're going to turn down those those

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.150 
so we're going to turn down those those
checks<00:02:08.700> off<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.140> open<00:02:10.470> up<00:02:10.560> our<00:02:10.739> server

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
checks off so we just open up our server

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.910 
checks off so we just open up our server
manager<00:02:11.640> dashboard<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.750> we're<00:02:13.470> looking<00:02:13.709> for
