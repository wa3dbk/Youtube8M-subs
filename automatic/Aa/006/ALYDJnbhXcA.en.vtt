00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 the good youtuber weapon right here no 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.899
 I have the Samsung Galaxy Spain phone 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.660
 is a phone that is bought in 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.389
 colombia colombia this phone is like 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.650
 is realized as if it were galaxy 2 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.130
 but it really is the gt s 68 10 which 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.380
 is from the flame marketed in 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.789
 outside is a quad phone of 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.980
 3.5 inches screen tdt 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.460
 its resolutions of 320 x 480 on 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.649
 very fluid phone 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.040
 they have characteristics almost similar to 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.570
 those of a common high-end s 313 mini 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.809
 comes with a lot comes with wi-fi gps 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.290
 bluetooth allows me also comes with 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.870
 sensors like how gyroscope has 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.350
 sensors has on accelerometer of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.420
 compass proximity and allows sharing 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.059
 the internet we would almost like to share 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.470
 our data with other phones is a 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.679
 phone that comes with a very good 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.300
 camera comes with a 5 camera 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:09.870
 megapixels 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.480
 Rear takes very good photos capture 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.370
 video at 640 x 480 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.210
 here we can see the configuration of 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.050
 video to what resolution does video take here 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:27.340
 gives us the maximum resolution of 640 x 480 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:29.260
 that can go down to 136 144 I do not think that 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.080
 someone is going to record video in the 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.650
 lower resolution with how many photos 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.750
 You can take rear photos of different 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.190
 resolutions pulling away from their 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.990
 maximum resolution that is 5 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.000
 megapixels can be lowered a little bit 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.390
 more than case and we would like to go down to take 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.659
 photos to upload social networks 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.409
 in the front camera if we look at it 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.909
 here we can see its characteristics of 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.060
 a 0.3 megapixel bed 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.000
 let's flip the pairs 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.220
 Here we can see a sample of some 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.510
 photos that I already made on the outside of my 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.400
 home 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.680
 These photos were taken in different 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.670
 and argues that ability to configure 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:18.140
 automatic floor made to 100 200 400 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.140
 we can see that if we zoom 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.599
 we can have a lot of detail of the photo 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.599
 so I'll take a very good camera 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.390
 and the video is also very very good 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.180
 another important characteristics 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.730
 of this phone is that it allows a 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.300
 very fluid navigation we are going to enter 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.670
 here to a website so that 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.160
 this one see 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.750
 gives us allows us to navigate as if 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.020
 we were on the computer that is 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.390
 depending on the desk if we have 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.069
 we enter here by configuration it gives 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.959
 Much speaks to the desktop view 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.660
 we can navigate as if we were in 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.580
 the computer 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.010
 just as the page is saying that it does not 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.670
 that the page enters the mobile version 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.890
 of which we are visiting number 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.690
 we can make a good show the whole show 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.340
 that we want and see perfectly the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.650
 page that we are browsing in the case 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.480
 that we want in three pages in your 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.180
 mobile version then we must study 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.650
 here the desktop list version and 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.560
 immediately as done above 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.570
 with that point in the country point 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.460
 it exactly navigates in its versions 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.680
 mobile is the case that you want 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.770
 navigate in the mobile version other 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.470
 interesting feature is that the 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.630
 screen can be flipped 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.910
 and allows that allows us to have a 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.600
 greater reading field of vision for 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.640
 read or browse the different pages 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.660
 another feature of this of this bed 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.060
 its large internal memory capacity 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.760
 let's remember what laws this is then 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.430
 this is a version up to the version 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.000
 2 of colony that really is the flame 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.060
 this phone has basically one 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.500
 internal memory 6 2 gigas of 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.130
 storage to install 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:16.530
 applications as you can see here 1.95 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:18.570
 total space 1.8 jose a 1.36 gigas 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.209
 when the phone is so new to 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.050
 continue installing more applications 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.110
 this phone comes with a series but 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.169
 it arrives so we can expect to expand 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.630
 even more our internal space and it 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:38.520
 can expand this is that phone 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:43.259
 with microsd cards up to 32 girls 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.900
 I also think he accepts to accept micro 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:48.060
 basically they decide 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.690
 these are the characteristics 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.699
 main phone and another with me 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.580
 more to highlight is that it's phone is 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.310
 quadband so well you can 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.420
 expand the different operators comes 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.460
 with a one-giga hertz processor 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.759
 From d 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:11.120
 single-core and internal memory 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:13.370
 of 512 from ram basically that's 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:19.789
 general terms what is the samsung 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:22.270
 galaxy time or what is the gt raya s 68 10 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.270
