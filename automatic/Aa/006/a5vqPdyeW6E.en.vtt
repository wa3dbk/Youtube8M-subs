footprint last time that was taken in
the<00:04:14.370> water<00:04:14.580> he<00:04:15.510> told<00:04:15.930> me<00:04:16.050> where<00:04:16.170> it<00:04:16.200> is<00:04:16.320> we

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
the water he told me where it is we

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.040 
the water he told me where it is we
retrace<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.100> steps<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:18.030> we<00:04:18.150> set<00:04:18.360> it<00:04:18.480> at<00:04:18.810> an

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
retrace the steps and we set it at an

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.900 
retrace the steps and we set it at an
angle<00:04:19.290> so<00:04:19.800> that<00:04:19.830> we<00:04:20.010> can<00:04:20.160> get<00:04:20.310> most<00:04:20.640> of<00:04:20.820> the

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
angle so that we can get most of the

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
angle so that we can get most of the
water<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.390> sure<00:04:22.050> of<00:04:22.080> everything<00:04:22.350> good<00:04:23.340> cover

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
water and sure of everything good cover

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.480 
water and sure of everything good cover
actually<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.770> now<00:04:25.890> we're<00:04:26.040> going<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.190> sit<00:04:26.370> some
