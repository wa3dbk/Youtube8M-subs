look down in there got five heatpipes
contacted<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> GPU<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.329> no<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.960> didn't<00:01:55.350> put

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
contacted to the GPU and no I didn't put

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.969 
contacted to the GPU and no I didn't put
the<00:01:55.710> heatsinks<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.909> RAM<00:01:57.509> units<00:01:57.990> because

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
the heatsinks on the RAM units because

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.219 
the heatsinks on the RAM units because
it<00:01:59.670> comes<00:02:00.000> stocked<00:02:00.479> without<00:02:00.930> them<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it comes stocked without them on the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.819 
it comes stocked without them on the
back<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:01.829> really<00:02:02.070> kind<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.280> pointless

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
back so it's really kind of pointless

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.350 
back so it's really kind of pointless
that's<00:02:04.829> how<00:02:05.009> big<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.670> compared<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that's how big it is compared to the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.270 
that's how big it is compared to the
video<00:02:06.570> part<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:08.810> from<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> other<00:02:10.050> angle<00:02:10.349> it's

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
video part and from the other angle it's

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.460 
video part and from the other angle it's
what<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.550> looks<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.819> in<00:02:12.000> there

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
what it looks like in there

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.580 
what it looks like in there
and<00:02:14.150> what<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.330> real<00:02:15.510> purpose<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.350> is

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
and what the real purpose of this is is

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.640 
and what the real purpose of this is is
to<00:02:17.220> affect<00:02:17.610> these<00:02:18.420> temperatures<00:02:19.170> right<00:02:19.410> here

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
to affect these temperatures right here

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.080 
to affect these temperatures right here
on<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.830> way<00:02:19.920> over<00:02:20.130> here<00:02:20.250> we<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:22.880> all<00:02:23.880> right

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
on the way over here we can all right

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.690 
on the way over here we can all right
here's<00:02:24.480> your<00:02:24.570> Auto<00:02:24.930> temperature<00:02:25.590> now<00:02:26.310> if

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
here's your Auto temperature now if

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.580 
here's your Auto temperature now if
you're<00:02:26.910> wondering<00:02:27.120> what<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:28.080> ambient

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
you're wondering what the ambient

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.770 
you're wondering what the ambient
temperature<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:29.540> when<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.630> hit<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.900> wall

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
temperature is when I hit the wall

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.020 
temperature is when I hit the wall
ambient<00:02:33.780> temperature<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.200> twenty<00:02:34.770> six<00:02:35.160> point

ambient temperature of twenty six point
three<00:02:36.150> degrees<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:38.340> reason<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.180> is

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
three degrees and the reason that is is

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.590 
three degrees and the reason that is is
because<00:02:39.810> down<00:02:40.560> there<00:02:40.830> in<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.220> floor<00:02:41.520> I've<00:02:42.330> got

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
because down there in the floor I've got

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.160 
because down there in the floor I've got
a<00:02:42.630> monitor<00:02:43.620> going<00:02:44.420> mining<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.600> coins<00:02:45.900> just

going to do is wrap the video card up

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.480 
going to do is wrap the video card up
and<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.180> gonna<00:03:03.330> start<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:06.740> I<00:03:07.740> won't<00:03:08.340> even

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
and it's gonna start the I won't even

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.680 
and it's gonna start the I won't even
know<00:03:08.550> where<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.790> thing's<00:03:08.970> followed<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.330> OC

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
know where that thing's followed the OC

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.310 
know where that thing's followed the OC
scanner<00:03:09.990> yes<00:03:10.970> alright<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.090> here's<00:03:12.930> where<00:03:13.170> the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
now with that ramped up and you see it

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.370 
now with that ramped up and you see it
says<00:03:27.830> here<00:03:28.070> is<00:03:28.220> fan<00:03:28.490> speeds<00:03:28.790> 47%<00:03:29.720> I'm<00:03:30.200> gonna

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
says here is fan speeds 47% I'm gonna

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.180 
says here is fan speeds 47% I'm gonna
put<00:03:31.010> this<00:03:31.130> right<00:03:31.190> up<00:03:31.520> against<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:32.980> I'm<00:03:33.980> not

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
put this right up against it I'm not

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.780 
put this right up against it I'm not
sure<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.760> can<00:03:34.910> even<00:03:35.120> hear<00:03:36.790> but<00:03:39.610> and<00:03:40.610> that's

sure you can even hear but and that's

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.080 
sure you can even hear but and that's
what<00:03:40.940> we're<00:03:41.120> looking<00:03:41.420> at<00:03:41.570> 43<00:03:42.880> usually<00:03:43.880> range

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
what we're looking at 43 usually range

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.830 
what we're looking at 43 usually range
between<00:03:44.180> 43<00:03:45.080> to<00:03:45.380> 46<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.490> it's<00:03:47.300> hottest<00:03:47.720> and

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
that's what the room as warm as it is if

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.120 
that's what the room as warm as it is if
I<00:03:50.390> turn<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.990> monitor<00:03:51.200> off<00:03:51.440> in<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.710> room<00:03:51.830> cools

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
I turn the monitor off in the room cools

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.740 
I turn the monitor off in the room cools
down<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.640> about<00:03:52.760> 22<00:03:53.180> degrees<00:03:54.760> 41<00:03:55.760> 42<00:03:56.300> is<00:03:56.510> about

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
down to about 22 degrees 41 42 is about

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.380 
down to about 22 degrees 41 42 is about
all<00:03:56.840> you're<00:03:57.020> gonna<00:03:57.110> see<00:03:59.110> so<00:04:00.110> that's<00:04:00.260> the

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
all you're gonna see so that's the

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.080 
all you're gonna see so that's the
Arctic<00:04:02.390> cooling<00:04:02.720> twin-turbo<00:04:03.410> -<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.890> I<00:04:04.730> highly

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
Arctic cooling twin-turbo - and I highly

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.000 
Arctic cooling twin-turbo - and I highly
recommended<00:04:05.720> it's<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:05.960> little<00:04:06.350> tricky<00:04:06.830> on

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
recommended it's a little tricky on

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.980 
recommended it's a little tricky on
putting<00:04:07.310> it<00:04:07.430> on<00:04:07.520> making<00:04:08.270> sure<00:04:08.300> that<00:04:08.690> it<00:04:08.810> has

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
putting it on making sure that it has

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.050 
putting it on making sure that it has
the<00:04:09.140> right<00:04:09.170> size<00:04:09.560> spacers<00:04:10.040> in<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.310> fun<00:04:10.820> thing

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
the right size spacers in it fun thing

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.660 
the right size spacers in it fun thing
actually<00:04:11.240> did<00:04:11.540> this<00:04:11.690> on<00:04:11.870> two<00:04:12.020> cards<00:04:12.670> first

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
actually did this on two cards first

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.030 
actually did this on two cards first
card<00:04:13.970> did<00:04:14.750> not<00:04:15.020> come<00:04:15.320> with<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.590> correct<00:04:15.860> sized

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
card did not come with the correct sized

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.430 
card did not come with the correct sized
spacer<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:17.030> second<00:04:17.390> one<00:04:17.480> I<00:04:17.510> did<00:04:17.720> had<00:04:18.320> the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
spacer the second one I did had the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.590 
spacer the second one I did had the
right<00:04:18.560> sized<00:04:18.770> spacer<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:20.180> fit

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
right sized spacer and it fit

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.140 
right sized spacer and it fit
wonderfully<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:22.540> so<00:04:23.540> I<00:04:23.870> realized<00:04:24.290> I<00:04:24.530> emailed

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
wonderfully and so I realized I emailed

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.340 
wonderfully and so I realized I emailed
the<00:04:26.150> customers<00:04:26.540> bought<00:04:26.720> with<00:04:26.870> our<00:04:26.900> Arctic

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
the customers bought with our Arctic

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.770 
the customers bought with our Arctic
cooling<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:27.980> they<00:04:28.790> asked<00:04:29.150> for<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.330> copy<00:04:29.510> of<00:04:29.690> the

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
cooling and they asked for a copy of the

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.200 
cooling and they asked for a copy of the
invoice<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.320> they<00:04:30.830> sent<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.310> out<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.700> I<00:04:32.060> had

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
invoice and they sent it out and I had

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.490 
invoice and they sent it out and I had
it<00:04:32.330> three<00:04:32.960> days<00:04:33.110> later

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
it three days later

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.130 
it three days later
so<00:04:33.980> I<00:04:34.010> reset<00:04:34.580> it<00:04:34.790> and<00:04:34.910> for<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.780> receipt

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140
