00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.559
 welcome back to Natalie Brooks The Secrets of the Lost 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.630
 Kingdom of April 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.380
 Percent which in fact is noticed here it stands now that is natural 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.829
 big a detective 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.380
 the Amag whole 24 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.689
 Hours spent their group freeing these children 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.590
 By the way, he still has to make things known 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.410
 Find Allan useless stuff that is the main task that you see here now 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 now see her typical screen full of trinkets 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.640
 there must be a click next to what you are currently interested in the person to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.690
 For example, if he wanted to talk to the fisherman and take a look 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.210
 necessarily the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.210
 yes the dialogue 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.280
 here that probably knows from various other swirls play 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.370
 he just had to 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.690
 Find meaningful things like panda bear Kacar screwdrivers 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.800
 Bern pro 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.820
 there is no scene 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.450
 or screwdriver the carpet to the finish 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.460
 b 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.970
 people 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.220
 The title of the second instruction, therefore, expresses that it is stuck in this game 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.610
 quite difficult because the world is actually the whole place at hand 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.950
 took 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.950
 the dialog really goes wrong 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.740
 then it goes on 3 next 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.300
 In addition to various search game, there are always small puzzles of this percent too 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.530
 crack is true and the story is so beautiful absurd that he simply knows 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.230
 wanted to be spun as the whole thing so I had there 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.130
 really fun with 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.140
 of course, that's not believable if you're in the realistic game of it 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.140
 Certainly you do not want to play this one here 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.820
 Per cent that no one say the cutscenes they are so in the comic 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.260
 Strip the goal held that I liked the most I am the 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.490
 Graphic of the game weight 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.580
 to be shown 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.370
 the case already stands if I'm happy to see him I think 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.549
 that should be right 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.979
 comes from the 4 Enz 1 APA 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:21.980
 now she has here 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.389
 left this list 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.179
 there this list 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:30.169
 the left now simply search things that are required there life 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.799
 Round 17 not at all 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.949
 the crooks struck out City rather 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.949
 Bargain hunting is on 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:41.959
 I have 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.959
 Erfurt 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.549
 2 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.239
 when we have done that 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.650
 currently life matches my conclusion the combination of SUV which and 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.709
 Minigames flavored with a pinch of just fit should dr a bit 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.069
 Graphic results in the bottom line a tasty quarterbacks 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:11.839
 because I've been in a good mood for quite a while, I've got to go for it 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:13.829
 they work pretty well 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.339
 if you are sure that the whole thing calms down a bit sda is 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:20.650
 no problem at all but just the ladder summer and fall 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.139
 Robert 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.589
