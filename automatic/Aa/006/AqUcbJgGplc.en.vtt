00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
and building blocks I'm pretty sure

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
and building blocks I'm pretty sure
we'll<00:01:17.729> you'll<00:01:18.180> need<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> solid<00:01:18.659> blocks<00:01:19.110> so

today I think we use chiseled stone
bricks<00:01:22.409> yes<00:01:23.220> sounds<00:01:24.030> good

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
ice you can find that here I think

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.930 
ice you can find that here I think
packed<00:01:29.880> ice<00:01:30.060> works<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.840> well<00:01:31.520> okay<00:01:32.520> um

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
packed ice works just as well okay um

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.700 
packed ice works just as well okay um
that<00:01:33.390> should<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.720> all<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:33.960> solid<00:01:34.380> block<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.680> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that should be all in solid block so you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.810 
that should be all in solid block so you
want<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> head<00:01:35.040> over<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> redstone

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
just destroy these blocks down here okay

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.490 
just destroy these blocks down here okay
all<00:02:41.900> except<00:02:42.260> your<00:02:42.350> starting<00:02:42.620> block<00:02:43.180> yeah<00:02:44.180> go

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
go and create two blocks off the bottom

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.210 
go and create two blocks off the bottom
of<00:02:50.450> each<00:02:50.630> of<00:02:50.990> these<00:02:51.320> stacks<00:02:51.740> of<00:02:51.890> pistons

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
of each of these stacks of pistons

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.700 
of each of these stacks of pistons
facing<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:53.120> way<00:02:53.560> okay

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
facing this way okay

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.540 
facing this way okay
so<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:55.430> like<00:02:55.550> this<00:02:56.800> yeah<00:02:57.800> just<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.340> can

so just like this yeah just so you can
see<00:02:58.760> what<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.060> looks<00:02:59.240> like<00:02:59.390> just<00:02:59.570> like<00:02:59.690> that

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
see what it looks like just like that

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.990 
see what it looks like just like that
now<00:03:00.770> you<00:03:00.830> want<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.100> connect<00:03:01.370> them<00:03:01.460> all<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.910> the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
now you want to connect them all to the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.210 
now you want to connect them all to the
back<00:03:02.210> piston<00:03:03.250> okay<00:03:04.250> yep<00:03:05.000> just<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:05.990> that<00:03:06.290> yeah

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
back piston okay yep just like that yeah

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.040 
back piston okay yep just like that yeah
exactly<00:03:07.580> like<00:03:07.910> that<00:03:08.270> and<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.570> got<00:03:08.690> sort<00:03:08.990> of

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
exactly like that and you got sort of

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.950 
exactly like that and you got sort of
the<00:03:09.140> letter<00:03:09.320> M<00:03:09.500> shape<00:03:09.890> here<00:03:10.450> which<00:03:11.450> one<00:03:11.600> do<00:03:11.810> now

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
the letter M shape here which one do now

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.870 
the letter M shape here which one do now
is<00:03:12.140> put<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.320> repeater<00:03:12.740> facing<00:03:13.220> all<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.670> these

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
is put a repeater facing all of these

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.480 
is put a repeater facing all of these
Pistons<00:03:14.440> okay<00:03:17.320> just<00:03:18.320> one<00:03:18.440> delay<00:03:18.590> yep<00:03:18.980> just<00:03:19.220> one

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
Pistons okay just one delay yep just one

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.190 
Pistons okay just one delay yep just one
delay<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:20.150> can't<00:03:20.390> put<00:03:20.540> more<00:03:20.690> delay<00:03:20.930> but<00:03:21.170> it

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
delay you can't put more delay but it

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.420 
delay you can't put more delay but it
really<00:03:21.470> doesn't<00:03:21.740> make<00:03:21.800> a<00:03:21.860> difference<00:03:22.010> now

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
really doesn't make a difference now

each wall you want to put one block

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.430 
each wall you want to put one block
towards<00:04:04.730> this<00:04:04.850> way<00:04:05.060> so<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.050> corners<00:04:06.380> should

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
towards this way so the corners should

towards this way so the corners should
touch<00:04:06.860> for<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.280> sticky<00:04:07.490> pistons<00:04:07.880> as<00:04:08.030> well

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
touch for the sticky pistons as well

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.080 
touch for the sticky pistons as well
yeah<00:04:09.020> yep<00:04:09.440> that's<00:04:09.710> good<00:04:09.860> all<00:04:10.370> good<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:10.850> now<00:04:11.030> you

contraption<00:04:14.900> to<00:04:15.050> where<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.350> piston<00:04:15.740> is<00:04:15.940> yeah

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
contraption to where the piston is yeah

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.210 
contraption to where the piston is yeah
and<00:04:17.120> build<00:04:17.870> five<00:04:18.799> blocks<00:04:19.040> down<00:04:19.280> one<00:04:20.210> two<00:04:20.450> three

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
and build five blocks down one two three

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.760 
and build five blocks down one two three
five<00:04:22.220> yep<00:04:22.940> now<00:04:23.270> destroy<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.900> first<00:04:24.200> block<00:04:24.500> and

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
five yep now destroy the first block and

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.150 
five yep now destroy the first block and
the<00:04:25.220> block<00:04:25.250> two<00:04:25.700> blocks<00:04:25.730> under<00:04:26.210> that<00:04:26.920> like<00:04:27.920> so

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
the block two blocks under that like so

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.950 
the block two blocks under that like so
and<00:04:28.370> put<00:04:28.550> redstone<00:04:28.760> torches<00:04:29.330> where<00:04:29.690> they<00:04:29.780> used

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
to be like that yep and as a piston

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.240 
to be like that yep and as a piston
should<00:04:32.990> push<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.470> come<00:04:33.770> back<00:04:33.890> again

to where your lever is up here uh-huh
build<00:04:45.900> two<00:04:46.110> blocks<00:04:46.320> down<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:46.560> destroyed<00:04:47.070> the

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
build two blocks down and destroyed the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.499 
build two blocks down and destroyed the
first<00:04:47.820> block<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.620> put<00:04:49.620> redstone<00:04:49.800> there<00:04:50.509> like

easy yep and you can then destroy
whatever<00:05:00.389> excess<00:05:00.750> blocks<00:05:00.990> there<00:05:01.169> are<00:05:01.490> and

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
whatever excess blocks there are and

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.659 
whatever excess blocks there are and
just<00:05:02.699> hook<00:05:03.180> it<00:05:03.210> up<00:05:03.389> with<00:05:03.419> redstone<00:05:04.550> going<00:05:05.550> all

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
just hook it up with redstone going all
