00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.820
 which means I use in order to avoid 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.179
 acne post acne various comedones 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.510
 black dots and everything else i'm 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.699
 reviewed a huge amount of video 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.189
 on youtube and english girls and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.039
 our made for themselves certain 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.630
 conclusions and I want to show you a little 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.630
 amount of funds that really 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.390
 work reading selected this 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.790
 here is a tonic from kills he goes with herbs 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.360
 specially designed for problem 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.719
 skin 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.180
 here 250 milliliters it smells 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.710
 quite specific but I smell 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.680
 try not to pay any attention 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.640
 because tony works very well on 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:55.140
 oily skin as i use it i apply 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.170
 on sponzhik and sweats zone distributing it and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.539
 I give it 5-7 minutes on impact 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.979
 yourself on the face without putting any 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:08.970
 serum suspension cream and all that he 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.689
 yes hard so let's say absorbed but pores 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.189
 very clean constricted 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.009
 some even so blonde 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.380
 bleached i like its effect but 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.479
 again i don't advise or and not 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.030
 I recommend using it right every 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.259
 a day is literally 3-4 times a week because 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.340
 it is very tough and this one binder 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.220
 some component 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.729
 not quite nice to somehow feel it on 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.750
 face 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.759
 but the effect of it is the effect is good 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.460
 forgot to start your video with such here 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.770
 accessories show them to you now this 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.350
 famous sponge from body shock which i 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.579
 I think you all know great polishes 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.740
 skin scrubs and and i use it 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.979
 in the evening again I urge you not 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.500
 pushing very hard on the skin and 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:03.329
 polish it in a circular motion 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:06.450
 two minutes I try it very often 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.550
 change because bacteria there what is 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.129
 the map is not very nice here 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.260
 using it in the evening and in the morning I 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.209
 I use this brush from 6 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.230
 and yes cool organ ry such 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.299
 her handle is good hairs they are very 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.150
 delicately 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:26.700
 exfoliate the skin and help pores to be 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.709
 clean i like this one this one 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.079
 a brush is good then using your own 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.360
 I use such difficult situations 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.500
 such anti-blemish gel clinics 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.230
 solutions 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.540
 this is my point point i showed u 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.239
 myself recently video girls I like 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.940
 This means I was already so good 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:52.829
 tested what I can say yes well 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:56.519
 smells like alcohol yes but the effect is 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:59.099
 I put literally two droplets on a dot 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.280
 on their some kind of reddening and for the night 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:05.639
 all this stretched the pimple was no longer so 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.940
 red he was already ripe could 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:10.730
 his neatly needle pierce and 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.180
 skin heals faster 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.760
 what is it a little bit of a silicone flock and 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.160
 film that is when you put on 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.730
 your face do you feel that some 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.859
 greenhouse such effect but in principle and 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.349
 it doesnâ€™t bother me either 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:32.430
 was the result and the effect of the result 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:35.459
 there is therefore a wreath from clinique to me 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.709
 as long as I like it I use it for sure 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.859
 I know how it will work on the whole face and 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.650
 plum say serious there shape box 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:46.769
 but one hundred percent point works 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.030
 straight unconditionally clinics like this 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:54.030
 she looks so from the pharmacy from the pharmacy i 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.159
 always take differener take myself gel 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.379
 because I have oily skin if you have 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:02.760
 skin dry take yourself cream he is more 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:04.590
 fluid more so tight and for dry 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.819
 skin will not be like that 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.859
 not dry means gel need 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.609
 use 3-4 months 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:17.130
 there is no effect right away but if you 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:20.280
 apply it regularly in the evening 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.180
 then here prosyanka as they say in 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.620
 common people 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.949
 or cosmetology at term 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.410
 closed comedo you have them 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:32.800
 disappear that is organ lice and these 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:36.070
 here are the skin particles will peel off 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.280
 and the differential in this case will work 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.770
 if some red rash or something 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.070
 some kind of acne here or some 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.750
 you ticks yes then no it doesn't help 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.479
 it will be only from closed 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.360
 comedones and two remedies that I 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.430
 madly in love for myself, I revealed them that 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.520
 they work on my face like this 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.550
 Here are 2 Moroccan jars 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.010
 I brought them a firm from Morocco here 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.729
 there is not a single word in Russian 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:11.650
 let's start here with this black 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:14.289
 soap she is organic not not 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.930
 no some kind of soap base 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.280
 therefore she does not foam does not lather 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.979
 oh well the main thing that she worked 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.889
 it smells like 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:29.860
 tea tree somehow so herbal 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:33.150
 smell and this is also not scary because 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:37.180
 smell 2 5 minutes it disappears 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:40.030
 excellent surfing tool for problem 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:44.289
 skin dries acne very well 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:47.650
 tightens skin pores straight after it 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:50.979
 to squeak shines like very 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:55.949
 I like the only thing I do not know how 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:58.510
 get it somewhere how to buy it but 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:02.110
 means of course good I do not know you 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:05.580
 I can see there I think I can see that here 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.289
 black soap products 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.710
 wonderful and climax 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:15.849
 this is clay rasul read about this 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:19.960
 clay on the internet I think that information 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:22.150
 there is enough for the formulations for use 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.199
 all-all-all will be written there I will say 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.050
 just that the mask really works i 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:31.300
 I do it in a compartment with this one 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.520
 the subject is silicone such a bowl 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.500
 and to not me here such special 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.680
 the blades I breed and 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.580
 one to one with water stir and 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.980
 brush distributing face 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:49.400
 the blood starts to surge to the face very 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.800
 such heart palpitations occur 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:55.100
 because and the smell is so intense and 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.140
 it all burns like something under your skin 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.390
 need to use it if you have some 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.880
 responsible events or there after two 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:05.180
 hours you need to leave the house 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.400
 invest skin should calm down then 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:10.190
 I always do him at night on our 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.640
 straight on the whole face with a thick layer on the t-zone 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.170
 because it is my fat problem 

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.450
 the nose after that may slightly 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.690
 peel off but you have ten minutes 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:24.020
 if you're her straight for 15 by 20 all hundred 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:27.410
 percent will be peeling she like 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.440
 common clay in general but its effect 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:34.160
 the other one is so loose 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:36.730
 little white very well stirred in 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.070
 such gruel to sour cream consistency 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:42.110
 very so homogeneous dust you are all 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.120
 distribute and that's for 10 minutes 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:47.990
 leave the girls I really like 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:50.150
 This effect and mask works yes she 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.200
 This smell is not very pleasant but in general 

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.990
 you can suffer 

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:58.300
 clay, I advise you to someone problematic 

00:07:53.990 --> 00:08:01.460
 skin who have acne necessarily look 

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:03.860
 on the Internet where you can order where you can 

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:07.250
 buy sure you will like me straight 

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:11.150
