00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.950
 that's nice to be the boys many 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.500
 thanks for coming here today 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.150
 I am especially happy because I am 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.210
 yes even the fun paper 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.210
 now and then a little bit around the yard 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.420
 to run and me to the beautiful 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.689
 that will be there to please 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.840
 Today we have four horses 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.880
 assorted kasselmann and family 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.079
 we catch a six-year-old 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.730
 let's get started 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.050
 and then we will do that later 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:48.480
 little bit strong from young horse to 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.820
 trained horses so this horse 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.170
 I have never seen and I think 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.870
 for me, too, again and again 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.469
 exciting if you have a horse for the first 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.899
 Let's see and how that's the same with the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.270
 horses are or if humans 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.659
 When you meet a human then you do 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.200
 yes in the first 23 seconds makes 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.610
 you sure an an idea if he 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.530
 he is sympathetic and he is not 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.390
 is sympathetic and if you like it 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.970
 wants to work or not work anymore 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.630
 So if and now I want it here 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.640
 look at 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.750
 I have to say I like right away 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.360
 very good is a beautiful tall 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.040
 maybe still driving at the age of six 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.900
 not fully grown 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.770
 there will certainly be one 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.770
 but lots do 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.950
 Freddy is staying a while 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.920
 trot that's easy on that one 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.610
 nice and quiet and wear the reins 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 keep it quiet for a tick longer 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.119
 that they can view the all time 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.759
 quiet the a bit longer 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:56.189
 trains so well so if I only him 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.860
 let's try to analyze before we 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.340
 do anything else at all then 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.520
 I think that is very nice in the clock running 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.670
 very evenly he enters with the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.239
 behind by nature already direction 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.620
 I like that very much 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.700
 come here from time to time on the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.230
 circle exactly what I have with young horses 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.480
 can not stand at all 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.599
 that's when the horses are with the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.090
 pointing backwards to the back and the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.489
 Do not call under the guy fast enough 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.819
 focus and that's what I think 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.640
 He is doing great here at the moment 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.930
 he does not blaspheme wine for too long 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.329
 but always takes it pretty much 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.269
 fast forward and always kick 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.609
 beautiful in the main focus 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.459
 front leg third nice just beautiful 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:49.880
 Straight off the shoulder I like that 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.880
 very well 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.660
 it's riding like we do 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.079
 At home we ride the horses on 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.019
 beginning always long and deep freddy's great 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.500
 by step first the goal 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:10.680
 reach 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:13.260
 We have so much time so well in the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.849
 Step over very nice 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.790
 very nice freedom from the shoulder 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.670
 out with the good overpasses from behind 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.170
 Over the track of the front legs so that 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.810
 horse also makes in very sympathetic 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.959
 Impression has a good eye 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.859
 kukksi that here everything in principle 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:37.299
 is it like riding horses? 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:39.849
 that you have to have time it is her 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.760
 need 20 minutes if they are up 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.549
 a horse put up all the blood in the 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.579
 value arrived from above in the joints 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.109
 is and that is something you always have 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.900
 a little bit like forgetting at home 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:56.470
 that you ride too fast 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.239
 it starts usually 20 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.340
 minutes strode ride 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.620
 either you have a home for 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.720
 machine that is in the modern day 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.700
 Stables that did not exist today 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.959
 most have a job for 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.209
 machine man you know ever 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.650
 in the machine and that one 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.389
 then start a little faster 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.370
 but I think it is very important 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.979
 so that you do not damage the horses 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.109
 have that 20 minutes the 4 time 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.840
 give first step to go before you 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.729
 even trot or gallop like that 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.770
 when they start riding 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.750
 then when she gets up in the morning 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.729
 then they do not jump 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.280
 Immediately plays full but catch them 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.560
 Slowly and slowly 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.409
 Begin is she must have the fourth one 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.960
 give reasonable solution phase and the 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:43.780
 Solution phase involves that 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.830
 horse downwards downwards into the deep 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.570
 can serve 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.520
 and there are many 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.830
 Discussions that you keep coming back in 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.470
 the trade journals that is yes too 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.789
 tight and he is rolled up and that is 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.250
 actually all nonsense 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.500
 but you have to be reasonable if you think so 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.930
 makes a horse give the opportunity 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.500
 falling forward down the neck 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.139
 to let 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.419
 in an optimal stretch and stretch 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.310
 attitude and it can be 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.680
 Of course even tell if that's a bit 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.289
 fresher is that you are right up to 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.170
 tight is the important thing is that you 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.180
 have a connection to the horses mouth 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.370
 what makes the rider the rider of the 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:27.610
 nothing else dies than the connection 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.610
 make between backhand and maule
