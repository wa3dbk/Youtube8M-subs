00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:07.090
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.650
 have free internet on a cell phone 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.270
 samsung 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:15.590
 good until now this has only been 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:19.270
 tested in the company third good as 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.570
 can you see here I have a 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:27.130
 a samsung cell phone 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.130
 to 177 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.600
 I used to have it with the Haitian company 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.060
 I do not know if it is possible to distinguish 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.530
 there the logo 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.329
 but 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.800
 unlock it 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.390
 and now be with telcel 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.390
 today we can not distinguish well 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.880
 and good 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.760
 what you have to do then let's go 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.320
 to menu 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.320
 we are going to go to configuration 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.899
 and we're going to go applications 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.550
 and then in applications we will give in 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.550
 browser settings 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.610
 let's go into browser profiles 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.030
 and in server configuration 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.350
 as you can see here is how to create a 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.350
 new apn 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.630
 and here I have the two access points 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.070
 to Internet 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:39.789
 of the sel gprs and the one that came by default 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:44.159
 that is average net that good in my case already 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:49.770
 it does not work well what we are going to do is 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.770
 let's create a new apn 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.890
 in this case I 'm going to show you here 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.280
 the one that I already have created not to battle 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.280
 so much 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.640
 the name of the good profile we are going to 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.640
 put the cel gprs 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.200
 in the url of good start we put you 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.070
 whatever page they want 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.070
 is the home page 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.680
 in next we will not activate it 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.870
 we are going to go on activating also what 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.870
 is the gprs gprs connection 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.890
 We will leave the proxy address 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.320
 empty 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:40.040
 the proxy port we are going to put 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.040
 80 80 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:52.460
 and in apn let's put 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:54.320
 dot internet and dotcom telcel 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.790
 this me as I want I'll let them 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.790
 there in the description of the video 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.540
 here you can not distinguish well 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:13.599
 and the user's name 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.599
 this we are going to put web gprs 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:22.780
 and in the password we are going to put web 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:25.810
 gprs 2003 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.200
 and well it's all we're going to give it in 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.200
 save 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.260
 let's see in save 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.600
 and save 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.150
 and after 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.140
 we will select it as a point of 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.140
 access 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.590
 and now I'm going to show you 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.870
 well in my case so starts the browser 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.609
 because as I told you at the beginning of the video 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.609
 before it will be haiti in you 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.210
 good there are as you can see 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.210
 already in google 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.069
 Y 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.010
 and I have out there 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.010
 the history 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.549
 it was not facebook 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.180
 let's let them carry 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:34.370
 well this also works without balance 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.470
 neither does it spend balance in case 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.420
 come to have I do not know if they have given 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.450
 account that out there when they put some 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.310
 recharge is given mb to browse for free 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.670
 online 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:50.410
 and then it is consuming the good mb 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.410
 as you can see and entered facebook 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.210
 and good 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.050
 this would be all I hope it serves them 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.050
 some doubt or some comment that 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.500
 want to do, you know this too 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:09.580
 serves for android phones 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.830
 also I already set up the optimus 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.980
 pro configure 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.310
 and then also enters the internet like this 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.610
 gratuitously good this would be all we 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.610
 we see
