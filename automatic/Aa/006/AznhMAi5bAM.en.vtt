we're<00:02:14.469> going<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.680> stop<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.099> now<00:02:15.219> and<00:02:15.400> check<00:02:15.640> the

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
we're going to stop it now and check the

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.209 
we're going to stop it now and check the
texture<00:02:16.359> it<00:02:16.719> should<00:02:16.930> be<00:02:17.049> very<00:02:17.260> smooth<00:02:17.769> and

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.219 
texture it should be very smooth and

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.020 
texture it should be very smooth and
spreadable<00:02:18.760> if<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.629> feels<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:20.019> little<00:02:20.319> too

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
spreadable if it feels a little too

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.910 
spreadable if it feels a little too
thick<00:02:22.030> then<00:02:22.329> you'll<00:02:22.900> want<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:23.170> add<00:02:23.319> just<00:02:23.620> a

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
thick then you'll want to add just a

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.880 
thick then you'll want to add just a
little<00:02:23.950> bit<00:02:24.189> more<00:02:24.489> milk<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.560> then<00:02:26.560> you'll<00:02:26.709> run

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
little bit more milk and then you'll run

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.679 
little bit more milk and then you'll run
the<00:02:26.980> machine<00:02:27.340> again<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:34.209> can<00:02:34.359> make<00:02:34.510> this

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
the machine again you can make this

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.569 
the machine again you can make this
frosting<00:02:35.260> ahead<00:02:35.469> of<00:02:35.590> time<00:02:35.769> and<00:02:36.040> store<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.489> in

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
frosting ahead of time and store it in

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.520 
frosting ahead of time and store it in
your<00:02:36.760> refrigerator<00:02:37.139> but<00:02:38.139> you'll<00:02:38.260> have<00:02:38.469> to

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
your refrigerator but you'll have to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.470 
your refrigerator but you'll have to
relive<00:02:39.159> it<00:02:39.219> right<00:02:39.730> before<00:02:39.939> you're<00:02:40.239> going<00:02:40.389> to

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
relive it right before you're going to

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.589 
relive it right before you're going to
decorate<00:02:41.219> you<00:02:42.219> can<00:02:42.370> also<00:02:42.519> make<00:02:42.819> this<00:02:43.000> frosting

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
decorate you can also make this frosting

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.140 
decorate you can also make this frosting
with<00:02:44.200> butter<00:02:44.650> instead<00:02:45.129> of<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.489> shortening<00:02:45.970> or

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
with butter instead of the shortening or

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.819 
with butter instead of the shortening or
the<00:02:46.299> margarine<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:47.230> will<00:02:47.379> have<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.620> better

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
the margarine it will have a better

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.890 
the margarine it will have a better
flavor<00:02:48.250> but<00:02:48.939> it's<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.150> little<00:02:49.389> harder<00:02:49.659> to<00:02:49.750> work

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
flavor but it's a little harder to work

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.599 
flavor but it's a little harder to work
with<00:02:49.959> because<00:02:50.409> the<00:02:50.739> butter<00:02:50.919> is<00:02:51.129> much<00:02:51.370> more

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
with because the butter is much more

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.629 
with because the butter is much more
temperature<00:02:52.120> sensitive
