00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.100 
mine were around $22 for the green
contacts<00:03:45.130> so<00:03:45.850> that's<00:03:46.420> I<00:03:46.600> think<00:03:46.660> that's<00:03:46.810> pretty

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
contacts so that's I think that's pretty

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.990 
contacts so that's I think that's pretty
good<00:03:47.200> price<00:03:47.500> considering<00:03:47.950> they<00:03:48.370> last<00:03:48.610> 90<00:03:48.970> days

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
good price considering they last 90 days

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.680 
good price considering they last 90 days
and<00:03:49.480> in<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.020> UK<00:03:50.519> one<00:03:51.519> day<00:03:51.760> contact<00:03:52.360> lenses

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
and in the UK one day contact lenses

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.229 
and in the UK one day contact lenses
come<00:03:53.140> via<00:03:53.320> around<00:03:53.590> 20<00:03:53.950> pounds<00:03:54.130> so<00:03:54.820> I<00:03:55.120> think

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
come via around 20 pounds so I think

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.850 
come via around 20 pounds so I think
that's<00:03:55.480> great<00:03:55.810> I'm<00:03:56.200> just<00:03:56.260> gonna<00:03:56.530> pop<00:03:56.739> the

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
that's great I'm just gonna pop the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.560 
that's great I'm just gonna pop the
lenses<00:03:57.160> in<00:03:57.280> now<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.970> show<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.180> what<00:03:58.299> they<00:03:58.420> look

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
lenses in now to show you what they look

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.410 
lenses in now to show you what they look
like<00:03:58.630> again<00:03:59.500> these<00:03:59.739> are<00:03:59.980> my<00:04:00.070> eyes<00:04:00.420> normally

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
like again these are my eyes normally

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.250 
like again these are my eyes normally
and<00:04:02.140> now<00:04:03.120> this<00:04:04.120> is<00:04:04.269> what<00:04:04.420> they<00:04:04.510> look<00:04:04.630> like<00:04:04.660> with

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
and now this is what they look like with

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.039 
and now this is what they look like with
contacts<00:04:05.680> in<00:04:05.820> so<00:04:06.820> just<00:04:07.180> put<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.390> contacts<00:04:07.870> in

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
contacts in so just put the contacts in

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.530 
contacts in so just put the contacts in
first<00:04:08.680> time<00:04:08.950> I<00:04:09.190> put<00:04:09.370> them<00:04:09.489> in<00:04:09.670> it<00:04:09.970> took<00:04:10.269> me

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
first time I put them in it took me

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.500 
first time I put them in it took me
around<00:04:10.650> five<00:04:11.650> minutes<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.670> get<00:04:13.209> them<00:04:13.390> in

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
around five minutes to get them in

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.850 
around five minutes to get them in
because<00:04:13.810> obviously<00:04:13.959> it<00:04:14.230> was<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.410> first<00:04:14.620> time

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
because obviously it was the first time

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.409 
because obviously it was the first time
I've<00:04:15.040> done<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:15.370> in<00:04:15.489> my<00:04:15.640> eyes<00:04:15.760> we're<00:04:16.180> just

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
I've done it in my eyes we're just

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.550 
I've done it in my eyes we're just
trying<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:16.780> get<00:04:16.870> used<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.260> it

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
trying to get used to it

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.289 
trying to get used to it
and<00:04:17.680> obviously<00:04:18.519> I<00:04:18.549> didn't<00:04:18.850> want<00:04:19.000> to<00:04:19.060> blind

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
and obviously I didn't want to blind

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.750 
and obviously I didn't want to blind
myself<00:04:19.570> I've<00:04:20.079> taken<00:04:20.350> myself<00:04:20.560> in<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:20.950> eye<00:04:20.979> so

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
myself I've taken myself in the eye so

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.120 
myself I've taken myself in the eye so
it<00:04:22.090> took<00:04:22.270> around<00:04:22.360> five<00:04:22.690> minutes<00:04:23.130> altogether

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
it took around five minutes altogether

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.310 
it took around five minutes altogether
but<00:04:24.700> I've<00:04:24.910> just<00:04:24.940> put<00:04:25.270> them<00:04:25.390> in<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.840> took<00:04:26.050> me

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
but I've just put them in and it took me

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.290 
but I've just put them in and it took me
literally<00:04:26.770> one<00:04:27.160> minute<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.669> get<00:04:27.820> them<00:04:27.940> both<00:04:28.090> in

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
literally one minute to get them both in

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.600 
literally one minute to get them both in
because<00:04:29.200> obviously<00:04:29.590> practice<00:04:30.130> makes<00:04:30.370> perfect

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
because obviously practice makes perfect

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.440 
because obviously practice makes perfect
and<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:33.160> is<00:04:33.370> what<00:04:33.520> they<00:04:33.640> look<00:04:33.820> like<00:04:33.850> I'll

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
and this is what they look like I'll

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.360 
and this is what they look like I'll
probably<00:04:34.810> have<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.140> get<00:04:35.320> some<00:04:35.560> better

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
probably have to get some better

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.680 
probably have to get some better
lighting<00:04:36.700> in<00:04:37.050> because<00:04:38.700> in<00:04:39.700> certain<00:04:40.300> light

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
lighting in because in certain light

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.600 
lighting in because in certain light
they<00:04:40.900> look<00:04:41.050> different<00:04:43.110> as<00:04:44.110> you<00:04:44.229> can<00:04:44.410> see<00:04:44.620> the

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
they look different as you can see the

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.120 
they look different as you can see the
dark<00:04:45.850> green<00:04:46.060> around<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.450> edge<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:47.010> you<00:04:48.010> can

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
dark green around the edge and you can

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.820 
dark green around the edge and you can
just<00:04:48.310> about<00:04:48.400> see<00:04:48.520> my<00:04:49.180> brown<00:04:49.450> eyes<00:04:49.660> in<00:04:50.380> the

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
just about see my brown eyes in the

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.340 
just about see my brown eyes in the
middle<00:04:51.390> that's<00:04:52.390> what<00:04:52.570> they<00:04:52.660> look<00:04:52.840> like<00:04:52.870> in

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
middle that's what they look like in

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.300 
middle that's what they look like in
sunlight<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:55.620> love<00:04:56.620> them<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.860> think<00:04:56.919> they<00:04:57.160> look

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
sunlight I love them I think they look

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
for about six hours which it usually

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:21.710 
for about six hours which it usually
recommends<00:05:19.800> you<00:05:19.860> to<00:05:20.039> have<00:05:20.160> them<00:05:20.280> in<00:05:20.430> or<00:05:20.849> two

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
recommends you to have them in or two

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.290 
recommends you to have them in or two
hours<00:05:22.080> for<00:05:22.349> your<00:05:22.470> first<00:05:23.190> time<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:23.910> then<00:05:24.030> four

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
hours for your first time and then four

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.659 
hours for your first time and then four
hours<00:05:24.440> every<00:05:25.440> time<00:05:25.590> thereafter<00:05:25.919> and

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
hours every time thereafter and

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.129 
hours every time thereafter and
obviously<00:05:26.970> I<00:05:27.030> had<00:05:27.210> them<00:05:27.300> in<00:05:27.389> six<00:05:27.690> hours<00:05:27.870> which

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
obviously I had them in six hours which

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.050
