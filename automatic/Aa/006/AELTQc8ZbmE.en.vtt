defender I kind of want to head towards
the<00:00:21.380> favorable<00:00:22.160> hash<00:00:22.400> for<00:00:22.850> me<00:00:23.060> which<00:00:23.690> would<00:00:23.900> be

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
the favorable hash for me which would be

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.470 
the favorable hash for me which would be
the<00:00:24.380> attackers<00:00:24.980> strong<00:00:25.490> hand<00:00:25.910> she's<00:00:26.210> probably
