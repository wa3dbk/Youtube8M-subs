00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.349
 It was not because I had to ask for help now , 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:14.250
 No, I'm sorry, but I do not have enough of that . 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:20.520
 When I tell you to save it, on the other hand , 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:26.699
 'M not even understand some of his mom had some that it causes 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:31.260
 I'm you understand me. But now I see President Lee Sheds earlier hearing due inde daughter 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.559
 So that greedy little pecking haejugo also want a comfortable fit no Dad 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.120
 I want to fill that vacancy. 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:44.219
 But then again, I care about my mom . 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:49.860
 I am a mother and we are the perfect mother and trust 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:55.410
 Mum 's what, Mom, who's daughter, just because I lived like this 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:00.449
 I also respond to what is called. 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:05.570
 Do not allow people to live a little while rewarding someone That's dwichidakkeori 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:10.650
 I thought that I should not be seeing the light in this way. Something like this 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:15.390
 I want to be a mother without me , and I just go out and work 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:20.280
 That's why I need to do a little more professional fashion like that. 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:25.080
 If it's not perfect for everything , I'd suddenly die 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.200
 I feel like that. So it 's like you have a complex set of presence. 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.729
 I want a little escape Can I be this idea 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.479
 I wanted to rip this more difficult and beyond the real scoop about this but 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.860
 When I want to just abandon someone to deal with anyone outside the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.299
 There is no one. 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:47.579
 And ever since I came to it is that this is the word to get its identity 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:52.259
 Then there will be a few mistakes, and then again, 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:57.780
 Ignore one, because I know that is going to work harder to get rolling 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:02.250
 So if all that just precede the report as just another day doing random day 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:06.659
 And it is in this way rather than rattling it now becomes my life 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.140
 Wasnt me eh no 3 in front of rattling is this idea also hurt 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.140
 Can not
