the<00:01:13.460> quality<00:01:14.119> of<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.300> paper<00:01:14.479> I'm<00:01:14.780> using<00:01:14.810> is

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
the quality of the paper I'm using is

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.210 
the quality of the paper I'm using is
not<00:01:15.860> that<00:01:16.820> good<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:18.410> might<00:01:18.619> see<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.190> paper

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
not that good so you might see the paper

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.609 
not that good so you might see the paper
junking<00:01:22.220> up<00:01:22.369> or<00:01:24.550> becoming<00:01:25.550> into<00:01:25.970> small<00:01:26.300> balls

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
junking up or becoming into small balls

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.190 
junking up or becoming into small balls
if<00:01:27.619> you<00:01:27.770> use<00:01:28.240> even<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.479> half-decent

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
if you use even a half-decent

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.870 
if you use even a half-decent
drawing<00:01:30.680> paper<00:01:30.970> this<00:01:31.970> should<00:01:32.180> work<00:01:32.420> fine<00:01:33.880> as

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
drawing paper this should work fine as

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.300 
drawing paper this should work fine as
you<00:01:35.000> can<00:01:35.180> see<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.840> gunk<00:01:36.170> paper<00:01:36.619> is<00:01:36.830> coming<00:01:37.160> out

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
you can see the gunk paper is coming out

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.190 
you can see the gunk paper is coming out
but<00:01:38.380> if<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.560> use<00:01:39.710> regular<00:01:40.600> drawing<00:01:41.600> paper

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
but if you use regular drawing paper

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.760 
but if you use regular drawing paper
I<00:01:42.410> think<00:01:42.649> they<00:01:42.830> we<00:01:43.039> should<00:01:43.220> be<00:01:43.340> fine<00:01:44.590> these<00:01:45.590> are

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
I think they we should be fine these are

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.870 
I think they we should be fine these are
cheap<00:01:46.039> a<00:01:46.250> force<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.619> but<00:01:48.619> you<00:01:48.740> see<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.580> effect

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
cheap a force so but you see the effect

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.520 
cheap a force so but you see the effect
you<00:01:50.840> can<00:01:51.020> make<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:52.750> watercolor<00:01:53.750> from<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:54.080> color

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
you can make a watercolor from a color

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.679 
you can make a watercolor from a color
pencil<00:01:54.950> let's<00:01:55.640> take<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.000> look<00:01:56.210> at<00:01:56.299> another

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
pencil let's take a look at another

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.250 
pencil let's take a look at another
color<00:01:57.100> now<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.159> shape<00:01:59.030> of<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.390> pencil<00:01:59.810> which

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
color now the shape of the pencil which

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:15.100 
color now the shape of the pencil which
is<00:02:00.310> easy<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.580> hold<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.000> draw

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.980 

and<00:02:15.910> now<00:02:16.910> let's<00:02:17.260> see<00:02:18.260> how<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.530> can<00:02:18.830> spread<00:02:19.220> the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
and now let's see how you can spread the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.640 
and now let's see how you can spread the
color<00:02:20.990> all<00:02:21.350> over<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.890> paper<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:24.290> will<00:02:24.470> come

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
color all over the paper this will come

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.460 
color all over the paper this will come
in<00:02:24.770> handy<00:02:24.800> for<00:02:25.180> artists<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.330> think<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:27.290> can

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
in handy for artists I think you can

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.350 
in handy for artists I think you can
outline<00:02:27.830> with<00:02:28.040> these<00:02:28.250> color<00:02:28.760> pencils<00:02:29.180> and

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
outline with these color pencils and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.080 
outline with these color pencils and
then<00:02:30.080> use<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.350> brush<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.970> complete<00:02:31.970> your

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
then use a brush to complete your

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.230 
then use a brush to complete your
painting<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.850> nice<00:02:35.000> two<00:02:35.300> in<00:02:35.420> one<00:02:35.600> feature

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
painting it's a nice two in one feature

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.780 
painting it's a nice two in one feature
so<00:02:38.240> I<00:02:38.270> don't<00:02:38.690> think<00:02:38.810> paying<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.740> premium<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.310> not

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
so I don't think paying a premium is not

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.780 
so I don't think paying a premium is not
a<00:02:41.690> bad<00:02:41.960> thing<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:43.300> give<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.450> try<00:02:44.690> but<00:02:45.790> these

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
a bad thing so give it a try but these

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.150 
a bad thing so give it a try but these
pencils<00:02:47.270> are<00:02:47.420> hard<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.750> find<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.590> brand<00:02:48.860> is

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
pencils are hard to find the brand is

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.420 
pencils are hard to find the brand is
not<00:02:49.910> available<00:02:50.360> everywhere<00:02:50.540> but<00:02:51.530> if<00:02:52.250> you

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
not available everywhere but if you

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
not available everywhere but if you
search<00:02:52.760> you

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
search you

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.710 
search you
you<00:02:54.320> should<00:02:54.500> find<00:02:54.770> them<00:02:54.980> or<00:02:55.610> try<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.959> Bay<00:02:58.720> you

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
you should find them or try a Bay you

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.870 
you should find them or try a Bay you
can<00:02:59.900> even<00:03:00.110> get<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.290> bigger<00:03:00.709> pack<00:03:01.040> with<00:03:01.280> more

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
can even get a bigger pack with more

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.199

colors<00:03:02.270> if<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:02.810> want<00:03:02.959> but<00:03:03.640> it's<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.760> quite<00:03:04.910> bit

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
colors if you want but it's a quite bit

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.780 
colors if you want but it's a quite bit
costly<00:03:06.110> than<00:03:06.560> this<00:03:06.740> one<00:03:08.650> but<00:03:09.650> love<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.430> idea

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
costly than this one but love the idea

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.960 
costly than this one but love the idea
and<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.770> implementation<00:03:12.770> nicely<00:03:13.640> done<00:03:13.850> later

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
and the implementation nicely done later
