00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
year and then it finally stopped working

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.820 
year and then it finally stopped working
again<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.029> i<00:00:21.109> took<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.140> apart<00:00:22.470> did<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
again and i took it apart did the

again and i took it apart did the
process<00:00:23.310> again<00:00:23.460> at<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> more<00:00:24.150> thermal<00:00:24.539> compound

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
process again at a more thermal compound

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.339 
process again at a more thermal compound
and<00:00:25.730> that<00:00:26.730> worked<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.330> just<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.050> little<00:00:28.230> bit

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349

and that worked for just a little bit
longer<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:29.210> think<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.510> did<00:00:31.140> only<00:00:31.260> lasted<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> day

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
and they come in a kit for these just

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.780 
and they come in a kit for these just
these<00:01:21.479> two<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> they<00:01:22.890> come<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.369> wiring

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
these two and they come with the wiring

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.940 
these two and they come with the wiring
already<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:24.570> these<00:01:24.780> two<00:01:25.049> connect<00:01:25.470> together

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
already just these two connect together

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.440 
already just these two connect together
and<00:01:26.460> then<00:01:27.299> from<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.320> one<00:01:28.880> it<00:01:29.880> comes<00:01:30.090> over<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
and then from this one it comes over and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.050 
and then from this one it comes over and
connects<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.020> there's<00:01:31.439> an<00:01:31.560> additional<00:01:32.060> plug

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
connects and there's an additional plug

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.730 
connects and there's an additional plug
that<00:01:33.299> plugs<00:01:33.360> into<00:01:33.869> where<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> power<00:01:34.439> supply

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
that plugs into where the power supply

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.370 
that plugs into where the power supply
normally<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.670> then<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.630> back<00:01:37.140> up

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
normally is and then you just back up

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.870 
normally is and then you just back up
your<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.829> know<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.220> use<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.610> existing

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
your you know then you use your existing

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.340 
your you know then you use your existing
power<00:01:39.270> supply<00:01:39.780> into<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.740> slot<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:42.350> then

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
power supply into that slot and then

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.410 
power supply into that slot and then
into<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.890> connector<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.909> fan

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
into that connector and then the fan

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
into that connector and then the fan
connects<00:01:45.869> into<00:01:46.049> here<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:47.159> it's

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
connects into here so it's it's

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.609 
connects into here so it's it's
basically<00:01:47.970> just<00:01:48.090> adding<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.810> an<00:01:49.079> additional

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
basically just adding on an additional

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.499 
basically just adding on an additional
but<00:01:50.130> all<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.430> wires<00:01:50.670> come<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.329> so

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
but all the wires come with it so

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.780 
but all the wires come with it so
basically<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.200> plug<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.280> play<00:01:53.490> you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
basically it's just plug and play you

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.830 
basically it's just plug and play you
just<00:01:53.939> plug<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> I'm<00:01:57.119> going

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
just plug it in and go and so I'm going

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.300 
just plug it in and go and so I'm going
to<00:01:57.899> go<00:01:58.020> ahead<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.259> hook<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.070> show

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.949 
and power it up and you can see that
they<00:02:16.030> glow<00:02:16.300> green<00:02:18.510> which<00:02:19.510> will<00:02:19.660> actually

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
they glow green which will actually

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.979 
they glow green which will actually
pretty<00:02:20.140> cool<00:02:20.380> because<00:02:20.620> i'm<00:02:21.630> going<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.750> mod<00:02:22.959> my

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
pretty cool because i'm going to mod my

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.020 
pretty cool because i'm going to mod my
case<00:02:23.470> anyways<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.340> color<00:02:24.580> i<00:02:24.670> want<00:02:24.940> it

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
case anyways and the color i want it

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.630 
case anyways and the color i want it
inside<00:02:25.180> was<00:02:25.630> green<00:02:25.959> so<00:02:26.319> that's<00:02:27.100> why<00:02:27.280> i<00:02:27.310> chose

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
inside was green so that's why i chose

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.210 
inside was green so that's why i chose
chose<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.480> buy<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.630> green<00:02:28.930> kind<00:02:29.200> but<00:02:29.500> as<00:02:29.800> you

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
chose to buy the green kind but as you

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.460 
chose to buy the green kind but as you
can<00:02:30.310> see<00:02:30.750> it's<00:02:31.750> coming<00:02:32.020> up<00:02:32.080> on<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.260> screen

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
can see it's coming up on the screen

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.020 
can see it's coming up on the screen
course<00:02:32.739> don't<00:02:32.950> have<00:02:33.040> my<00:02:33.160> hard<00:02:33.340> drive<00:02:33.640> hooked

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
course don't have my hard drive hooked

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.420 
course don't have my hard drive hooked
up<00:02:34.239> or<00:02:34.870> anything<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:35.620> just<00:02:36.010> giving<00:02:36.340> me

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
up or anything so it's just giving me

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.100 
up or anything so it's just giving me
the<00:02:36.519> basics<00:02:37.739> but<00:02:38.739> it<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.130> working<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:40.110> these

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
the basics but it is working and these

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.880 
the basics but it is working and these
are<00:02:41.170> cooling<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:42.400> heat<00:02:42.580> sinks<00:02:42.910> nicely<00:02:43.890> so

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
are cooling the heat sinks nicely so

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.180 
are cooling the heat sinks nicely so
this<00:02:45.430> should<00:02:45.670> solve<00:02:46.480> any<00:02:46.780> other<00:02:47.190> heatsink

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
this should solve any other heatsink

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.080 
this should solve any other heatsink
issues<00:02:48.750> with<00:02:49.750> overheating<00:02:50.170> in<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:51.160> future<00:02:51.459> so

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
issues with overheating in the future so

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.360 
issues with overheating in the future so
if<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.720> happens<00:02:53.319> again<00:02:53.470> then<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:54.040> course<00:02:54.250> I

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
if it happens again then of course I

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.789 
if it happens again then of course I
will<00:02:54.430> give<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:54.730> an<00:02:54.819> update<00:02:54.910> but<00:02:55.650> doing<00:02:56.650> what<00:02:56.739> I

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
will give you an update but doing what I

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.949 
will give you an update but doing what I
did<00:02:56.920> adding<00:02:57.670> more<00:02:57.790> thermal<00:02:58.269> paste<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.840> all

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
did adding more thermal paste and all

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.600 
did adding more thermal paste and all
that<00:02:59.170> like<00:02:59.799> I<00:02:59.830> did<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.160> previous<00:03:00.340> video

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
that like I did in the previous video

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.970 
that like I did in the previous video
and<00:03:01.090> then<00:03:01.239> if<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.989> keeps<00:03:02.170> doing<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:02.530> for<00:03:02.860> you

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
and then if it keeps doing that for you

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.620 
and then if it keeps doing that for you
the<00:03:03.130> best<00:03:03.310> idea<00:03:03.670> would<00:03:03.790> probably<00:03:04.150> be<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.299> get

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
the best idea would probably be to get

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.600 
the best idea would probably be to get
these<00:03:05.470> teasing<00:03:06.010> fans<00:03:06.190> i<00:03:06.580> think<00:03:07.540> i<00:03:07.630> paid<00:03:07.930> like

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
these teasing fans i think i paid like

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.349 
these teasing fans i think i paid like
39<00:03:09.610> something<00:03:10.360> for<00:03:11.250> including<00:03:12.250> shipping<00:03:12.489> to

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
39 something for including shipping to

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.160 
39 something for including shipping to
get<00:03:13.510> these<00:03:13.810> two<00:03:14.019> together<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:15.760> just<00:03:16.170> let

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
get these two together and I just let

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.039 
get these two together and I just let
let<00:03:17.590> chose<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:18.070> cheapest<00:03:18.519> shipping<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:19.049> that

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
let chose the cheapest shipping and that

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.420 
let chose the cheapest shipping and that
would<00:03:20.200> took<00:03:20.350> about<00:03:20.530> five<00:03:20.769> days<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.160> get<00:03:21.250> here

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
would took about five days to get here

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.410 
would took about five days to get here
so<00:03:22.350> fairly<00:03:23.350> inexpensive<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.310> time-saving<00:03:25.150> I

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
so fairly inexpensive and time-saving I

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.330 
so fairly inexpensive and time-saving I
didn't<00:03:25.630> have<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.870> go<00:03:25.989> out<00:03:26.109> and<00:03:26.350> spend<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.190> time

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
didn't have to go out and spend the time

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.860 
didn't have to go out and spend the time
to<00:03:27.489> build<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.820> pieces<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.420> build<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.720> parts

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
to build the pieces and build the parts

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.039 
to build the pieces and build the parts
and<00:03:29.140> everything<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:30.600> hopefully<00:03:31.600> that<00:03:31.810> fixes

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
and everything so hopefully that fixes

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.140 
and everything so hopefully that fixes
yours<00:03:32.500> if<00:03:32.829> it<00:03:33.070> is<00:03:33.160> still<00:03:33.370> continuing<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:34.060> do

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
yours if it is still continuing to do

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.800 
yours if it is still continuing to do
that<00:03:34.359> and<00:03:35.700> yeah<00:03:36.700> I'll<00:03:36.970> fill<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.329> in<00:03:37.450> if<00:03:37.690> it

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
that and yeah I'll fill you in if it

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.200 
that and yeah I'll fill you in if it
happens<00:03:38.109> again
