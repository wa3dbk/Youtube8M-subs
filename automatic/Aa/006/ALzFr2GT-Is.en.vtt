00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
bit more which is going to create some

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.969 
bit more which is going to create some
more<00:01:12.280> serratus<00:01:13.280> anterior<00:01:13.929> activation<00:01:14.979> okay

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
more serratus anterior activation okay

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.039 
more serratus anterior activation okay
so<00:01:16.369> that's<00:01:16.549> tweet<00:01:16.759> number<00:01:17.030> one<00:01:17.210> also<00:01:17.810> make

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
so that's tweet number one also make

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.870 
so that's tweet number one also make
sure<00:01:18.079> that<00:01:18.560> when<00:01:19.310> you're<00:01:19.460> doing<00:01:19.609> these

sure that when you're doing these

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.029 
sure that when you're doing these
whether<00:01:20.179> your<00:01:20.329> hands<00:01:20.600> are<00:01:20.719> closer<00:01:20.960> for<00:01:21.380> that

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
whether your hands are closer for that

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.260 
whether your hands are closer for that
it's<00:01:22.219> just<00:01:22.280> your<00:01:22.549> shoulder<00:01:22.789> blades<00:01:22.999> a<00:01:23.090> move
