00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
that you can see the difference between

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.920 
that you can see the difference between
the<00:00:38.920> mat<00:00:39.130> and<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.610> regular<00:00:40.000> nail<00:00:40.240> polish<00:00:40.480> and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
shiny with my fluff pick I'm going to

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.960 
shiny with my fluff pick I'm going to
start<00:00:48.190> in<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:49.149> middle<00:00:49.390> of<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.829> diagonal<00:00:51.790> and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
start in the middle of the diagonal and

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.170 
start in the middle of the diagonal and
my<00:00:52.960> nail<00:00:53.230> polish<00:00:53.440> has<00:00:53.950> been<00:00:54.340> studying<00:00:55.059> for

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
my nail polish has been studying for

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.780 
my nail polish has been studying for
about<00:00:55.540> five<00:00:55.840> minutes<00:00:56.140> so<00:00:56.500> it's<00:00:56.739> almost<00:00:57.520> dry

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
about five minutes so it's almost dry

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.819 
about five minutes so it's almost dry
but<00:00:58.090> still<00:00:58.329> workable<00:00:58.750> you<00:00:59.350> want<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.649> make<00:00:59.770> sure

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
but still workable you want to make sure

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.910 
but still workable you want to make sure
that<00:01:00.040> you<00:01:00.460> let<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:00.910> dry<00:01:00.940> for<00:01:01.149> a<00:01:01.450> bit<00:01:01.920> you're

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
that you let it dry for a bit you're

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.149 
that you let it dry for a bit you're
going<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.130> carefully<00:01:03.550> press<00:01:04.390> in<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.920> diagonal

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
going to carefully press in a diagonal

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.820 
going to carefully press in a diagonal
direction<00:01:07.060> one<00:01:07.360> in<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.600> middle<00:01:07.840> one<00:01:08.530> right

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
direction one in the middle one right

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.219 
direction one in the middle one right
now<00:01:08.979> at<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.340> bottom<00:01:09.729> and<00:01:09.850> one<00:01:10.270> on<00:01:10.570> top<00:01:10.930> so<00:01:11.170> I

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
now at the bottom and one on top so I

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:18.800 
now at the bottom and one on top so I
just<00:01:11.440> create<00:01:11.740> three<00:01:12.159> diagonal<00:01:12.970> lines<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
just create three diagonal lines and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.510 
just create three diagonal lines and
then<00:01:19.810> I'm<00:01:19.990> going<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.350> cross<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:20.830> starting<00:01:21.369> in

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
then I'm going to cross it starting in

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.469 
then I'm going to cross it starting in
the<00:01:21.549> middle<00:01:21.940> again<00:01:22.320> with<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.500> diagonal<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
the middle again with a diagonal that

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.740 
the middle again with a diagonal that
it's<00:01:25.690> perpendicular<00:01:29.430> again<00:01:30.430> in<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:31.360> bottom

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
it's perpendicular again in the bottom

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.730 
it's perpendicular again in the bottom
now<00:01:31.900> I<00:01:32.200> just<00:01:32.619> kind<00:01:33.159> of<00:01:33.220> roll<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.930> at<00:01:35.380> the

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
now I just kind of roll it then at the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.550 
now I just kind of roll it then at the
top<00:01:35.770> so<00:01:36.369> three<00:01:36.760> lines<00:01:37.479> again<00:01:37.900> and<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.260> creates

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
top so three lines again and it creates

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.460 
top so three lines again and it creates
a<00:01:38.710> diamond<00:01:39.310> shape<00:01:39.610> I<00:01:39.909> go<00:01:40.689> back<00:01:40.869> over<00:01:41.260> some<00:01:41.439> of

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
a diamond shape I go back over some of

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.270 
a diamond shape I go back over some of
the<00:01:41.619> lines<00:01:41.830> for<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:44.290> glitter<00:01:44.619> placement<00:01:45.159> i'm

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280
