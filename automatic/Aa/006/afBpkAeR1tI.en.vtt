00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
and we do god they're Snickers quietly

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.910 
and we do god they're Snickers quietly
like<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.820> like<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.510> used<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.990> be<00:02:42.260> it's<00:02:43.260> always

like a like it used to be it's always
beautiful<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:45.230> someone<00:02:46.230> we<00:02:47.070> know<00:02:47.970> with<00:02:49.370> like

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.220 

of<00:02:57.070> course<00:02:57.520> we'd<00:02:57.790> like<00:02:59.130> ice<00:03:00.480> hanging<00:03:01.480> around<00:03:01.930> a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
of course we'd like ice hanging around a

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.370 
of course we'd like ice hanging around a
little<00:03:03.510> little<00:03:04.510> closer<00:03:05.050> but<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:06.870> drift<00:03:07.870> away

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
little little closer but it drift away

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.880 
little little closer but it drift away
now<00:03:08.890> this<00:03:09.250> days<00:03:09.640> three<00:03:10.600> four<00:03:10.990> hundred<00:03:11.170> months

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
now this days three four hundred months

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.330 
now this days three four hundred months
away<00:03:12.190> from<00:03:12.550> there

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.830 

last<00:03:17.910> summer<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:19.050> walrus<00:03:19.890> for<00:03:20.510> some<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.690> them

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
last summer the walrus for some of them

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:33.320 
last summer the walrus for some of them
getting<00:03:22.230> tired<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:24.140> beach<00:03:25.140> out<00:03:25.470> here<00:03:26.120> sleep

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.550 

on<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:34.110> beach

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.620 

been<00:03:39.560> changing<00:03:40.250> since<00:03:40.640> I<00:03:40.970> was<00:03:42.280> since<00:03:43.280> I

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
been changing since I was since I

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.570 
been changing since I was since I
started<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:45.080> one-to-one<00:03:45.860> I<00:03:46.990> started<00:03:47.990> to

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
started the one-to-one I started to

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.290 
started the one-to-one I started to
condition<00:03:49.580> my<00:03:49.819> all<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.209> was<00:03:50.750> young<00:03:52.120> now<00:03:53.120> at

condition my all I was young now at

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.370 
condition my all I was young now at
least<00:03:53.540> taste

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.309 

be<00:03:56.980> changing

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
be changing

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.950 
be changing
the<00:03:59.590> world<00:04:00.090> everywhere

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.550 

changing<00:04:04.960> from<00:04:05.530> here

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.500 

the<00:04:09.070> goal<00:04:09.250> was<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.580> go<00:04:09.700> out<00:04:09.730> on<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.030> ice<00:04:10.060> with

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
the goal was to go out on the ice with

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.450 
the goal was to go out on the ice with
someone<00:04:11.200> who<00:04:11.350> looks<00:04:11.470> at<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:11.710> from<00:04:11.980> perhaps<00:04:12.250> a

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
someone who looks at it from perhaps a

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.950 
someone who looks at it from perhaps a
little<00:04:12.670> different<00:04:12.970> perspective<00:04:13.090> so<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.750> try

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
little different perspective so to try

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.750 
little different perspective so to try
to<00:04:14.020> understand<00:04:14.530> when<00:04:14.740> a<00:04:14.770> whaler<00:04:15.190> is<00:04:15.340> driving

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
to understand when a whaler is driving

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.440 
to understand when a whaler is driving
out<00:04:15.850> of<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.060> ice

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
out of the ice

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.630 
out of the ice
what<00:04:17.109> does<00:04:17.200> he<00:04:17.320> see<00:04:17.530> what<00:04:18.010> does<00:04:18.130> he<00:04:18.220> look<00:04:18.370> for

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
what does he see what does he look for

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.240 
what does he see what does he look for
and<00:04:19.060> so<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:20.260> know<00:04:20.320> John<00:04:20.590> would<00:04:20.709> take<00:04:20.950> us<00:04:21.100> out

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
and so you know John would take us out

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.980 
and so you know John would take us out
and<00:04:21.280> would<00:04:21.579> would<00:04:21.940> show<00:04:22.180> us<00:04:22.300> certain<00:04:22.630> features

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
and would would show us certain features

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.850 
and would would show us certain features
or<00:04:23.020> described<00:04:23.590> things<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:26.260> hope<00:04:26.440> was<00:04:26.710> it

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
or described things and the hope was it

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.800 
or described things and the hope was it
in<00:04:26.980> doing<00:04:27.250> that<00:04:27.400> you<00:04:28.060> know<00:04:28.120> that<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.480> students

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
in doing that you know that the students

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.500 
in doing that you know that the students
would<00:04:29.020> be<00:04:30.120> understanding<00:04:31.120> some<00:04:31.300> of<00:04:31.330> the

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
would be understanding some of the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.000 
would be understanding some of the
things<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:31.930> whaler<00:04:32.290> looks<00:04:32.500> at<00:04:32.710> and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
things that a whaler looks at and

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.740 
things that a whaler looks at and
perhaps<00:04:33.460> seeing<00:04:33.880> some<00:04:34.120> of<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.270> connections

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
perhaps seeing some of the connections

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.330 
perhaps seeing some of the connections
with<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.020> other<00:04:35.200> parameters<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:35.890> they<00:04:36.130> then

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
with the other parameters that they then

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.320 
with the other parameters that they then
study<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:38.230> current<00:04:38.470> is<00:04:38.860> uh<00:04:38.890> this<00:04:39.880> time<00:04:40.150> year

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
study the current is uh this time year

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.440 
study the current is uh this time year
the<00:04:40.780> current<00:04:41.020> really<00:04:43.530> get<00:04:44.530> stronger<00:04:45.040> so<00:04:45.490> when

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
the current really get stronger so when

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.140 
the current really get stronger so when
we're<00:04:46.660> out<00:04:46.780> whaling<00:04:47.260> we<00:04:47.410> have<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.970> we<00:04:48.970> have<00:04:49.000> to

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
we're out whaling we have to we have to

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.050 
we're out whaling we have to we have to
keep<00:04:49.510> in<00:04:49.690> mind<00:04:49.720> that<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.980> current<00:04:51.400> is<00:04:51.610> eating

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
keep in mind that the current is eating

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.060 
keep in mind that the current is eating
the<00:04:52.210> ice<00:04:52.390> underneath<00:04:53.140> it's<00:04:53.590> just<00:04:53.890> like

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
the ice underneath it's just like

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.710 
the ice underneath it's just like
running<00:04:54.760> water<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:56.650> us<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:57.070> safe<00:04:57.310> ice<00:04:57.720> the

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
running water to us the safe ice the

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.370 
running water to us the safe ice the
safest<00:04:59.230> ice<00:04:59.440> is<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:01.360> first<00:05:01.690> pressure<00:05:02.050> rich

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
safest ice is the first pressure rich

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.820 
safest ice is the first pressure rich
from<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.980> beach<00:05:03.480> to<00:05:04.480> us<00:05:04.630> that<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:05.169> us<00:05:05.290> because

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
from the beach to us that to us because

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.550 
from the beach to us that to us because
we<00:05:06.130> know<00:05:06.160> that<00:05:06.340> formed<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.210> first<00:05:07.390> and<00:05:07.960> it

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
we know that formed the first and it

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.070 
we know that formed the first and it
that's<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.770> safe<00:05:11.980> aside<00:05:12.340> we<00:05:12.580> got<00:05:12.790> mister<00:05:13.720> ridges

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
that's a safe aside we got mister ridges

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.290 
that's a safe aside we got mister ridges
are<00:05:14.290> just<00:05:14.590> like<00:05:15.300> mountains<00:05:16.300> forming<00:05:16.960> like<00:05:18.300> you

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
are just like mountains forming like you

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.780 
are just like mountains forming like you
know<00:05:19.479> fault<00:05:19.840> like<00:05:20.140> a<00:05:20.470> fault<00:05:21.100> on<00:05:21.340> earthquake

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
know fault like a fault on earthquake

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.630 
know fault like a fault on earthquake
line<00:05:22.240> or<00:05:22.600> whatever<00:05:22.930> we<00:05:23.710> need<00:05:23.740> meet<00:05:24.250> together

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
line or whatever we need meet together

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.850 
line or whatever we need meet together
they<00:05:25.390> just<00:05:25.570> it's<00:05:26.110> just<00:05:26.260> like<00:05:26.590> a<00:05:26.620> little

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
they just it's just like a little

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.600 
they just it's just like a little
mountain<00:05:28.229> that's<00:05:29.229> how<00:05:29.530> pressure<00:05:30.010> ridges<00:05:30.280> are

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
mountain that's how pressure ridges are

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.850 
mountain that's how pressure ridges are
formed<00:05:31.060> and<00:05:31.270> some<00:05:31.900> of<00:05:32.050> them<00:05:32.200> that<00:05:32.410> are<00:05:32.590> in<00:05:32.740> the

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
formed and some of them that are in the

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.730 
formed and some of them that are in the
shallow<00:05:33.130> area<00:05:33.640> will<00:05:33.880> get<00:05:34.090> grounded

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.680 

and<00:05:37.890> this<00:05:38.340> one<00:05:38.550> is<00:05:38.700> breaking<00:05:39.180> up<00:05:39.360> and<00:05:39.510> it's

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
and this one is breaking up and it's

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.710 
and this one is breaking up and it's
piling<00:05:40.200> up<00:05:40.380> it's<00:05:40.590> so<00:05:40.770> heavy<00:05:41.070> it<00:05:41.880> is<00:05:42.030> very<00:05:42.420> heavy

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
piling up it's so heavy it is very heavy

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.120 
piling up it's so heavy it is very heavy
but<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.200> skirt<00:05:43.470> is<00:05:43.800> so<00:05:44.010> strong<00:05:44.370> that<00:05:45.830> it<00:05:46.830> will

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
but the skirt is so strong that it will

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.179 
but the skirt is so strong that it will
keep<00:05:47.370> going<00:05:47.640> until

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:52.189 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:54.639 

I<00:05:52.219> sure<00:05:52.939> will<00:05:53.360> we'll<00:05:53.599> find<00:05:53.899> except<00:05:54.289> under<00:05:54.619> the

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:54.649 
I sure will we'll find except under the

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:56.829 
I sure will we'll find except under the
weakest<00:05:55.129> spot<00:05:55.249> we<00:05:55.610> start<00:05:55.939> finding<00:05:56.209> up<00:05:56.509> in<00:05:56.659> that

00:05:56.829 --> 00:05:56.839 
weakest spot we start finding up in that

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:59.829 
weakest spot we start finding up in that
again<00:05:57.199> but<00:05:57.439> this<00:05:57.619> would<00:05:57.860> stop<00:05:58.479> and<00:05:59.479> it's

00:05:59.829 --> 00:05:59.839 
again but this would stop and it's

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:03.129 
again but this would stop and it's
reduce<00:06:00.369> amazing<00:06:01.369> to<00:06:01.580> us<00:06:01.610> door<00:06:02.389> cell<00:06:02.749> when<00:06:02.959> I

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
reduce amazing to us door cell when I

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.820 
reduce amazing to us door cell when I
was<00:06:03.349> younger<00:06:03.679> when<00:06:03.949> I'm<00:06:04.159> alone<00:06:04.519> I<00:06:05.349> could<00:06:06.349> run

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
was younger when I'm alone I could run

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.889 
was younger when I'm alone I could run
right<00:06:07.189> though<00:06:07.519> scruple<00:06:07.999> there<00:06:08.419> that<00:06:08.659> ice

having for that he I knew what I was

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.990 
having for that he I knew what I was
trick<00:06:34.290> I've<00:06:34.860> seen<00:06:35.130> anything<00:06:35.520> about<00:06:35.760> this

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
trick I've seen anything about this

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.200 
trick I've seen anything about this
place<00:06:36.240> moving<00:06:36.660> and<00:06:36.980> piling<00:06:37.980> up<00:06:38.130> and<00:06:38.430> so<00:06:38.760> it

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
place moving and piling up and so it

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.640 
place moving and piling up and so it
does<00:06:40.080> it<00:06:40.430> going<00:06:41.430> fast<00:06:41.790> then<00:06:42.720> you<00:06:42.960> can<00:06:43.200> write<00:06:43.440> on

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
does it going fast then you can write on

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.090 
does it going fast then you can write on
it<00:06:43.680> and<00:06:44.100> you<00:06:44.520> could<00:06:44.730> just<00:06:45.260> take<00:06:46.260> take<00:06:46.650> off<00:06:46.890> of

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
it and you could just take take off of

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.330 
it and you could just take take off of
it<00:06:47.250> before<00:06:47.960> before<00:06:48.960> it<00:06:49.200> gets<00:06:49.500> too<00:06:49.680> dangerous

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
it before before it gets too dangerous

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.090 
it before before it gets too dangerous
that's<00:06:51.290> something<00:06:52.290> I<00:06:52.410> shouldn't<00:06:52.710> be<00:06:52.860> telling

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
that's something I shouldn't be telling

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.820
