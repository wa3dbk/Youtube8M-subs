hello everyone and welcome to the third
appt<00:00:03.240> submission<00:00:03.990> tutorial<00:00:04.589> in<00:00:04.799> this

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
appt submission tutorial in this

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.309 
appt submission tutorial in this
tutorial<00:00:05.759> I'm<00:00:06.540> going<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.839> be<00:00:06.899> showing<00:00:07.049> you<00:00:07.290> how

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
tutorial I'm going to be showing you how

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.459 
tutorial I'm going to be showing you how
we<00:00:07.620> can<00:00:07.799> register<00:00:08.010> for<00:00:08.670> an<00:00:08.760> app<00:00:08.970> ID<00:00:09.469> for

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
we can register for an app ID for

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.370 
we can register for an app ID for
whatever<00:00:11.070> application<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.790> want<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.090> submit

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
whatever application we want to submit

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.670 
whatever application we want to submit
so<00:00:13.380> an<00:00:13.740> app<00:00:13.950> ID<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.670> basically<00:00:15.330> Apple's<00:00:16.170> way<00:00:16.350> of

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
so an app ID is basically Apple's way of

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.880 
so an app ID is basically Apple's way of
registering<00:00:17.640> your<00:00:18.020> specific<00:00:19.020> application<00:00:19.170> on

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
registering your specific application on

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.910 
registering your specific application on
the<00:00:19.920> App<00:00:20.189> Store<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.730> then<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.390> your<00:00:21.539> system<00:00:21.930> so

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the App Store and then on your system so

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.070 
the App Store and then on your system so
basically<00:00:23.640> any<00:00:23.730> time<00:00:24.060> there's<00:00:24.359> let's<00:00:24.810> say<00:00:24.990> an

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
basically any time there's let's say an

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.080 
basically any time there's let's say an
update<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.740> want<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> issue<00:00:26.400> an<00:00:26.640> update<00:00:26.939> to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
update you want to issue an update to

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.640 
update you want to issue an update to
your<00:00:27.119> application<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.080> probably<00:00:28.349> will

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
your application as you probably will

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.160 
your application as you probably will
then<00:00:29.369> basically<00:00:30.000> you're<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.720> want<00:00:30.900> to

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
then basically you're going to want to

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.799 
then basically you're going to want to
have<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.099> specific<00:00:32.669> app<00:00:32.880> ID<00:00:33.120> that

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
have this specific app ID that

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.260 
have this specific app ID that
references<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.770> specific<00:00:35.399> application<00:00:35.550> and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
references your specific application and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.150 
references your specific application and
so<00:00:36.630> when<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.899> question<00:00:37.410> updates<00:00:37.770> through<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
so when you question updates through the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.479 
so when you question updates through the
app<00:00:38.280> store<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.870> Apple<00:00:39.870> knows<00:00:40.050> which

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
app store and Apple knows which

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.920 
app store and Apple knows which
application<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.640> specifically<00:00:42.390> updating

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
application it's specifically updating

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.650 
application it's specifically updating
on<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.170> system<00:00:43.500> because<00:00:43.890> there's<00:00:44.520> only<00:00:44.660> one

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
on your system because there's only one

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.850 
on your system because there's only one
app<00:00:45.960> ID<00:00:46.350> per<00:00:47.190> application<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.420> every<00:00:49.350> app<00:00:49.620> on

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
app ID per application so every app on

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.380 
app ID per application so every app on
the<00:00:49.950> App<00:00:50.070> Store<00:00:50.100> has<00:00:50.370> its<00:00:50.760> own<00:00:50.940> unique

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the App Store has its own unique

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.959 
the App Store has its own unique
identifier<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.530> that's<00:00:52.890> basically<00:00:53.489> how<00:00:53.789> you

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
identifier and that's basically how you

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.090 
identifier and that's basically how you
can<00:00:54.329> identify<00:00:54.629> which<00:00:55.170> application<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.920> yours

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
can identify which application is yours

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.900 
can identify which application is yours
or<00:00:56.390> yeah<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> idea<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:59.640> that

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
or yeah you get the idea so with that

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.029 
or yeah you get the idea so with that
all<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.750> do<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.109> register<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:01.620> an<00:01:01.949> app

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
all we have to do to register for an app

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.369 
all we have to do to register for an app
ID<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> our<00:01:03.120> developer<00:01:03.750> certificate

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
ID is go to our developer certificate

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.609 
ID is go to our developer certificate
utility<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.750> under<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.869> overview<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.590> can

register our mac app ID here and you can

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.170 
register our mac app ID here and you can
see<00:01:19.710> there's<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.040> only<00:01:20.159> two<00:01:20.400> fields<00:01:21.119> that

so that you know when you go through
your<00:01:49.049> list<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.619> bi<00:01:49.799> DS<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.670> know<00:01:50.880> what

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
your list of a bi DS you know what

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.359 
your list of a bi DS you know what
you're<00:01:51.659> actually<00:01:51.810> looking<00:01:52.170> at<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.979> anyway

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you're actually looking at so anyway

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.219 
you're actually looking at so anyway
name<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:53.850> description<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.390> your<00:01:54.570> app

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
name or description of your app

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.859 
name or description of your app
basically<00:01:55.590> goes<00:01:56.070> there<00:01:56.310> then<00:01:57.270> bundle

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
basically goes there then bundle

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.770 
basically goes there then bundle
identifier<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.219> same<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.759> your<00:01:59.939> CF<00:02:00.450> bundle

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
identifier is the same as your CF bundle

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.050 
identifier is the same as your CF bundle
identifier<00:02:00.899> which<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.619> your<00:02:01.799> unlight<00:02:02.610> edifier

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
identifier which is your unlight edifier

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.100 
identifier which is your unlight edifier
in<00:02:03.329> Xcode<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.710> if<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.189> go<00:02:05.430> over<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:06.000> xcode<00:02:06.810> four

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
in Xcode so if you go over to xcode four

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.529 
in Xcode so if you go over to xcode four
and<00:02:07.380> under<00:02:08.340> whatever<00:02:08.910> project<00:02:09.420> you're

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
and under whatever project you're

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.260 
and under whatever project you're
working<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.590> select<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> project<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
working on you select the project and

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.030 
working on you select the project and
select<00:02:12.510> your<00:02:12.570> target<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.290> you'll<00:02:13.770> see<00:02:14.010> that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
select your target and you'll see that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.620 
select your target and you'll see that
your<00:02:14.310> bundle<00:02:14.700> identifier<00:02:14.910> for<00:02:15.480> your

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
your bundle identifier for your

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.180 
your bundle identifier for your
application<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.230> right<00:02:16.470> there<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:16.920> that's

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
application is right there and that's

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.310 
application is right there and that's
what<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.430> want<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.700> copy<00:02:17.880> in<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.990> field

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
what you want to copy in to the field

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.820 
what you want to copy in to the field

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
over here so ours for this example its

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.610 
over here so ours for this example its
combat<00:02:23.340> my<00:02:23.970> name<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.540> again<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.410> is

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.720 
the name of the app ID what you're going
to<00:02:47.910> want<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.150> do<00:02:48.300> is<00:02:48.510> just<00:02:48.540> edit<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.110> right<00:02:49.350> here

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.240 
and so I meant look there we go and you
can<00:02:54.600> see<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:54.960> you<00:02:55.020> can<00:02:55.170> change<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.710> text<00:02:56.130> of

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
can see that you can change the text of

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.620 
can see that you can change the text of
the<00:02:57.290> Xcode<00:02:58.290> project<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.370> will<00:02:59.550> in<00:03:00.300> turn

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
the Xcode project and that will in turn

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.620 
the Xcode project and that will in turn
change<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.470> name<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.130> app<00:03:02.370> ID<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:03.060> that's

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
change the name of the app ID so that's

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.750 
change the name of the app ID so that's
what<00:03:04.380> you're<00:03:04.440> going<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.650> want<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.890> do<00:03:05.100> for

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
what you're going to want to do for

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.960 
what you're going to want to do for

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
changing that app ID right there and you

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.060 
changing that app ID right there and you
can<00:03:09.060> also<00:03:09.240> change<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.080> info<00:03:10.800> section

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
can also change it in the info section

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.730 
can also change it in the info section
if<00:03:11.460> you<00:03:11.880> override<00:03:12.630> this<00:03:13.110> section<00:03:13.560> right<00:03:13.590> here

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
if you override this section right here

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.070 
if you override this section right here
and<00:03:14.160> what<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.580> is<00:03:14.700> whatever<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.150> want<00:03:15.360> but

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
anyway it's just a good idea just to

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.910 
anyway it's just a good idea just to
change<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.720> name<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:19.080> your<00:03:19.230> Xcode<00:03:19.890> project

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
change the name of your Xcode project

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.520 
change the name of your Xcode project
and<00:03:20.580> then<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.480> will<00:03:21.630> override<00:03:21.900> whatever

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
and then that will override whatever

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.860 
and then that will override whatever
your<00:03:22.890> name<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.550> your<00:03:23.670> app<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:24.000> for<00:03:24.420> your<00:03:24.540> bundle

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.530 
your name of your app is for your bundle

and<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.720> course<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:37.140> want<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.380> be<00:03:37.470> specific

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
and of course you want to be specific

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.260 
and of course you want to be specific
when<00:03:38.130> you're<00:03:38.310> actually<00:03:38.430> making<00:03:38.700> this<00:03:39.000> to

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
when you're actually making this to

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.420 
when you're actually making this to
whatever<00:03:39.900> your<00:03:40.140> app<00:03:40.290> name<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.740> like<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.190> just

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
whatever your app name is like I just

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.810 
whatever your app name is like I just
showed<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:42.830> that's<00:03:43.830> basically<00:03:44.250> all<00:03:44.550> you

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
showed you and that's basically all you

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.790 
showed you and that's basically all you
really<00:03:44.940> have<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.180> do<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.990> one<00:03:46.230> thing<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.590> really

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
really have to do and one thing I really

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.710 
really have to do and one thing I really
want<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.010> note<00:03:47.220> though<00:03:47.430> is<00:03:47.459> once<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.300> create

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
want to note though is once you create

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.949 
want to note though is once you create
these<00:03:48.870> app<00:03:49.110> IDs<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:50.520> keep<00:03:51.120> these<00:03:51.450> app<00:03:51.660> ADIZ

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
these app IDs you keep these app ADIZ

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.380 
these app IDs you keep these app ADIZ
forever<00:03:52.560> so<00:03:53.310> if<00:03:53.520> you're<00:03:53.700> just<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.300> know

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
forever so if you're just you know

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.480 
forever so if you're just you know
playing<00:03:54.660> around<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:55.140> this<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:56.370> know

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
playing around on this and you you know

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.790 
playing around on this and you you know
accidentally<00:03:57.330> create<00:03:57.660> one<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:58.230> can't<00:03:58.560> get

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
accidentally create one you can't get

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.250 
accidentally create one you can't get
rid<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.310> basically<00:04:00.270> apples<00:04:00.900> reasoning

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
rid of it and basically apples reasoning

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.730 
rid of it and basically apples reasoning
probably<00:04:01.800> behind<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:03.480> know

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
probably behind this is so that you know

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.050 
probably behind this is so that you know
somebody<00:04:04.740> can't<00:04:04.980> come<00:04:05.160> along<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.640> steal<00:04:05.910> an

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
somebody can't come along and steal an

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.390 
somebody can't come along and steal an
application<00:04:06.690> ID<00:04:06.870> from<00:04:07.320> you<00:04:07.890> know<00:04:07.980> somebody

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
application ID from you know somebody

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.300 
application ID from you know somebody
before<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:09.170> once<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:10.320> create<00:04:10.620> your<00:04:10.709> app<00:04:10.860> ID<00:04:11.070> in

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
before so once you create your app ID in

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.040 
before so once you create your app ID in
this<00:04:11.489> it's<00:04:11.760> locked<00:04:12.239> into<00:04:12.660> your<00:04:12.780> account

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
this it's locked into your account

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.770 
this it's locked into your account
forever<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:14.040> make<00:04:14.430> sure<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:15.209> know<00:04:15.330> you

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
forever so make sure you know you

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.849 
forever so make sure you know you
actually<00:04:16.140> have<00:04:16.260> an<00:04:16.380> app<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:16.530> you're<00:04:16.770> going

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
actually have an app that you're going

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.199 
actually have an app that you're going
to<00:04:16.919> submit<00:04:17.160> before<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.760> start<00:04:18.000> playing

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
to submit before you start playing

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.819 
to submit before you start playing
around<00:04:18.330> with<00:04:18.540> this<00:04:18.690> and

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
around with this and

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.890 
around with this and
once<00:04:20.519> you've<00:04:20.699> got<00:04:20.909> that<00:04:20.939> you<00:04:21.269> know<00:04:21.419> just<00:04:21.720> put

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
once you've got that you know just put

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.929 
once you've got that you know just put
your<00:04:22.049> company<00:04:22.500> name<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:23.039> your<00:04:23.400> app<00:04:23.550> name<00:04:23.789> in

00:04:23.929 --> 00:04:23.939 
your company name and your app name in

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:26.029 
your company name and your app name in
once<00:04:24.870> you're<00:04:24.930> done<00:04:25.080> with<00:04:25.259> that<00:04:25.289> you<00:04:25.530> continue

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
once you're done with that you continue

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.189 
once you're done with that you continue
and<00:04:26.400> then<00:04:26.699> when<00:04:26.879> you're<00:04:26.970> done<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.180> hit<00:04:27.750> submit

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
and then when you're done you hit submit

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.249 
and then when you're done you hit submit
and<00:04:28.590> then<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:29.550> will<00:04:29.699> create<00:04:29.909> an<00:04:30.030> app<00:04:30.150> ID<00:04:30.330> so

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
and then that will create an app ID so

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.659 
and then that will create an app ID so
I'm<00:04:31.530> not<00:04:31.770> going<00:04:31.949> to<00:04:32.009> actually<00:04:32.099> submit<00:04:32.430> it

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
I'm not going to actually submit it

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.189 
I'm not going to actually submit it
though<00:04:32.819> because<00:04:33.060> I<00:04:33.300> don't<00:04:33.509> want<00:04:33.659> to<00:04:33.719> submit<00:04:33.900> an

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
though because I don't want to submit an

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.439 
though because I don't want to submit an
app<00:04:34.319> ID<00:04:34.530> like<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:34.979> but<00:04:35.370> once<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:35.699> go<00:04:35.939> and<00:04:36.330> you

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
app ID like that but once you go and you

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.570 
app ID like that but once you go and you
hit<00:04:36.629> submit<00:04:36.960> you'll<00:04:37.590> be<00:04:37.710> brought<00:04:37.949> to<00:04:38.189> the<00:04:38.400> app

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
we have this wild card app ID which you

that<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:50.039> make<00:04:50.250> an<00:04:50.460> app<00:04:50.909> ID<00:04:51.210> when<00:04:51.509> you're<00:04:51.629> done

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
that you make an app ID when you're done

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.320 
that you make an app ID when you're done
of<00:04:52.129> whatever<00:04:53.129> you<00:04:53.340> call<00:04:53.580> then<00:04:53.849> if<00:04:53.940> we<00:04:54.030> made<00:04:54.180> the

of whatever you call then if we made the
test<00:04:54.569> one<00:04:54.810> it<00:04:55.050> would<00:04:55.199> be<00:04:55.349> called<00:04:55.530> test<00:04:56.159> and<00:04:56.639> you
