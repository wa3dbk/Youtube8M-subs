your actual Craig tools but in this one
they<00:01:29.450> made<00:01:29.599> it<00:01:29.750> deep<00:01:29.869> enough<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:30.670> first<00:01:31.670> off

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
they made it deep enough so first off

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.240 
they made it deep enough so first off
this<00:01:32.090> is<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.300> k3<00:01:32.840> system<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.709> monta<00:01:34.039> the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
this is the k3 system the monta the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.790 
this is the k3 system the monta the
system<00:01:34.789> they<00:01:34.880> use<00:01:34.910> now<00:01:35.179> is<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.390> Cape<00:01:35.599> for<00:01:35.840> not

system they use now is the Cape for not

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.109 
system they use now is the Cape for not
much<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.190> difference<00:01:37.459> other<00:01:37.640> than<00:01:37.700> the

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
much of a difference other than the

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.059 
much of a difference other than the
clamp<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.569> in<00:01:38.599> the<00:01:38.780> back<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.619> clamp<00:01:39.860> in<00:01:40.009> the

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:40.069 
clamp is in the back the clamp in the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:41.260 
clamp is in the back the clamp in the
front<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:40.399> actually<00:01:40.520> a<00:01:40.729> little<00:01:40.880> bit<00:01:41.060> better

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
front is actually a little bit better

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.150 
front is actually a little bit better
design<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:42.170> KFOR<00:01:42.500> still<00:01:42.770> does<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.950> great<00:01:43.069> job

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
design the KFOR still does a great job

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.889 
design the KFOR still does a great job
don't<00:01:43.490> get<00:01:43.640> me<00:01:43.700> wrong<00:01:43.819> but<00:01:44.090> when<00:01:44.539> you're<00:01:44.660> doing

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
don't get me wrong but when you're doing

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.600 
don't get me wrong but when you're doing
larger<00:01:45.259> panels<00:01:45.649> having<00:01:45.979> this<00:01:46.130> clamp<00:01:46.459> in<00:01:46.580> the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
larger panels having this clamp in the

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.210 
larger panels having this clamp in the
front<00:01:46.940> is<00:01:47.239> a<00:01:47.300> little<00:01:47.539> bit<00:01:47.630> better<00:01:48.039> from<00:01:49.039> what<00:01:49.190> I

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
front is a little bit better from what I

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.050 
front is a little bit better from what I
hear<00:01:49.489> Craig<00:01:49.789> is<00:01:49.940> coming<00:01:50.179> out<00:01:50.300> with<00:01:50.830> another

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
hear Craig is coming out with another

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.850 
hear Craig is coming out with another
one<00:01:53.060> with<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.420> clamp<00:01:53.630> in<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.869> front<00:01:54.110> like<00:01:54.739> I

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
one with the clamp in the front like I

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.430 
one with the clamp in the front like I
say<00:01:55.039> in<00:01:55.369> 99%<00:01:56.209> of<00:01:56.539> cases<00:01:56.599> you'll<00:01:56.989> never<00:01:57.229> ever

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
say in 99% of cases you'll never ever

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.680 
say in 99% of cases you'll never ever
notice<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.890> difference<00:01:58.220> but<00:01:58.849> on<00:01:59.000> big<00:01:59.300> panels

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
notice the difference but on big panels

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.199 
notice the difference but on big panels
that's<00:01:59.840> where<00:02:00.050> you'll<00:02:00.259> see<00:02:00.440> it<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.149> anyway<00:02:02.149> so

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
that's where you'll see it so anyway so

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:03.160 
that's where you'll see it so anyway so
this<00:02:02.420> is<00:02:02.569> the<00:02:02.660> k3

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
this is the k3

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.080 
this is the k3
we've<00:02:03.770> got<00:02:03.890> your<00:02:04.009> standard<00:02:04.280> jig<00:02:04.640> right<00:02:04.819> here

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
we've got your standard jig right here

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.389 
we've got your standard jig right here
your<00:02:05.750> standard<00:02:07.869> larger<00:02:08.869> jig<00:02:09.110> here<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.649> then

your standard larger jig here and then

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.650 
your standard larger jig here and then
the<00:02:11.239> kit<00:02:11.510> also<00:02:11.780> comes<00:02:12.110> with<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:13.520> big<00:02:13.910> Craig

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
the kit also comes with the big Craig

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.309 
the kit also comes with the big Craig
the<00:02:15.620> Kreg<00:02:15.830> jig<00:02:15.860> HD<00:02:16.459> which<00:02:17.270> is<00:02:17.540> good<00:02:17.870> for<00:02:18.080> like<00:02:18.290> 2

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
the Kreg jig HD which is good for like 2

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.800 
the Kreg jig HD which is good for like 2
by<00:02:18.650> 4<00:02:18.950> stuff<00:02:19.280> it's<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:20.030> bigger<00:02:20.239> drill<00:02:20.569> bit

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
by 4 stuff it's a bigger drill bit

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.010 
by 4 stuff it's a bigger drill bit
bigger<00:02:21.140> screws<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.700> bigger<00:02:22.910> jig<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:23.690> it

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
bigger screws and a bigger jig so it

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.170 
bigger screws and a bigger jig so it
changes<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.530> angle<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.830> little<00:02:24.860> bit<00:02:25.060> plus<00:02:26.060> it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
changes the angle a little bit plus it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.640 
changes the angle a little bit plus it
allows<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.630> put<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.960> little<00:02:27.050> more<00:02:27.260> hold<00:02:27.440> in

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
allows you to put a little more hold in

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.170 
allows you to put a little more hold in
there<00:02:27.800> shows<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.460> right<00:02:28.580> here<00:02:28.760> usually

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
there shows you right here usually

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.660 
there shows you right here usually
two<00:02:29.450> guys<00:02:29.659> with<00:02:30.349> this<00:02:30.500> jig<00:02:30.769> so<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:31.519> will

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
two guys with this jig so this will

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.509 
two guys with this jig so this will
still<00:02:31.909> fit<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.299> that<00:02:32.769> but<00:02:33.769> you<00:02:34.099> know<00:02:34.219> in<00:02:34.430> most

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
still fit in that but you know in most

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.649 
still fit in that but you know in most
cases<00:02:34.760> you're<00:02:34.939> not<00:02:35.000> gonna<00:02:35.209> put<00:02:35.359> it<00:02:35.450> in<00:02:35.540> there

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
cases you're not gonna put it in there

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.899 
cases you're not gonna put it in there
anyway<00:02:35.719> you're<00:02:36.560> gonna<00:02:36.680> take<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.609> the<00:02:37.730> piece

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
anyway you're gonna take it to the piece

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.789 
anyway you're gonna take it to the piece
but<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:39.319> then<00:02:39.439> this<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.799> your<00:02:40.010> Craig<00:02:40.760> micro

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
but and then this is your Craig micro

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.360 
but and then this is your Craig micro
which<00:02:42.799> is<00:02:42.950> good<00:02:43.219> for<00:02:44.560> thinner<00:02:45.560> wood<00:02:45.829> so<00:02:46.040> like

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
which is good for thinner wood so like

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.470 
which is good for thinner wood so like
half-inch<00:02:47.079> 5/8<00:02:48.079> 3/8<00:02:48.620> stuff<00:02:48.889> like<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.480> it

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
half-inch 5/8 3/8 stuff like that it

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.509 
half-inch 5/8 3/8 stuff like that it
drills<00:02:50.870> us<00:02:51.019> with<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.319> smaller<00:02:51.709> drill<00:02:52.099> bit<00:02:52.310> and

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
drills us with a smaller drill bit and

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.059 
drills us with a smaller drill bit and
uses<00:02:53.329> smaller<00:02:53.659> screws<00:02:54.139> so<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.769> shows<00:02:54.950> you

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
uses smaller screws so it shows you

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.830 
uses smaller screws so it shows you
right<00:02:55.159> there<00:02:55.219> there's<00:02:55.819> some<00:02:56.030> drawer<00:02:56.269> boxes

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
right there there's some drawer boxes

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.949 
right there there's some drawer boxes
and<00:02:57.139> some<00:02:57.319> picture<00:02:57.590> frames<00:02:57.739> etc<00:02:58.370> etc<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:59.269> this

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
and some picture frames etc etc so this

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.929 
and some picture frames etc etc so this
kit<00:03:00.319> is<00:03:00.530> really<00:03:01.370> good<00:03:01.519> when<00:03:01.639> you're<00:03:01.730> doing

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
kit is really good when you're doing

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.879 
kit is really good when you're doing
small<00:03:02.180> stuff<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.720> that<00:03:03.109> does<00:03:03.349> spin<00:03:03.650> in<00:03:03.769> there

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
small stuff and that does spin in there

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.800 
small stuff and that does spin in there
just<00:03:04.069> like<00:03:04.159> that<00:03:04.459> does<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:05.329> cool<00:03:05.540> thing<00:03:05.689> with

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
just like that does the cool thing with

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.110 
just like that does the cool thing with
the<00:03:05.930> Craig<00:03:06.169> system<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.609> all<00:03:07.819> of<00:03:08.000> these

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
the Craig system is that all of these

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.369 
the Craig system is that all of these
things<00:03:09.549> work<00:03:10.549> together<00:03:10.840> ok<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:12.169> is<00:03:12.349> your

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
things work together ok so this is your

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.190 
things work together ok so this is your
portable<00:03:12.769> geog<00:03:13.549> right<00:03:13.700> here<00:03:13.939> I<00:03:14.120> think<00:03:14.810> on<00:03:14.959> some

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
portable geog right here I think on some

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.330 
portable geog right here I think on some
of<00:03:15.290> our<00:03:15.319> previous<00:03:15.530> videos<00:03:15.769> we've<00:03:16.129> talked

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
of our previous videos we've talked

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.250 
of our previous videos we've talked
about<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.609> Craig<00:03:16.849> so<00:03:17.750> we'll<00:03:17.840> just<00:03:17.959> look<00:03:18.109> at

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
about the Craig so we'll just look at

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.949 
about the Craig so we'll just look at
those<00:03:18.409> but<00:03:18.650> this<00:03:18.799> is<00:03:18.919> your<00:03:19.069> portable<00:03:19.400> rig<00:03:19.959> and

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
those but this is your portable rig and

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.059 
those but this is your portable rig and
you<00:03:20.989> would<00:03:21.139> just<00:03:21.169> clamp<00:03:21.469> that<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.859> board

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
you would just clamp that to the board

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.129 
you would just clamp that to the board
well<00:03:22.219> this<00:03:22.370> fits<00:03:22.609> in<00:03:22.790> here<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.359> fits<00:03:23.719> in<00:03:23.900> here

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
well this fits in here that fits in here

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:29.020 
well this fits in here that fits in here
that<00:03:24.469> fits<00:03:24.709> in<00:03:24.919> here<00:03:26.409> so<00:03:27.669> it<00:03:28.669> all<00:03:28.790> works

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
that fits in here so it all works

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.030 
that fits in here so it all works
together<00:03:29.209> as<00:03:29.599> a<00:03:29.629> system<00:03:29.930> which<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.799> really

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
together as a system which is really

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.649 
together as a system which is really
cool<00:03:31.629> then<00:03:32.629> of<00:03:33.019> course<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.440> get<00:03:33.560> your

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
cool then of course you get your

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.129 
cool then of course you get your
assortment<00:03:35.680> here<00:03:36.680> some<00:03:36.889> of<00:03:36.919> the<00:03:37.040> big<00:03:37.190> screws

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
assortment here some of the big screws

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:46.830 
assortment here some of the big screws
you<00:03:39.139> get<00:03:39.319> your<00:03:39.470> normal<00:03:39.829> clamp<00:03:43.840> right<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:46.040> then

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
you get your normal clamp right and then

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.000 
you get your normal clamp right and then
you<00:03:47.840> get<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.079> right<00:03:48.260> angle<00:03:48.590> clamp<00:03:48.620> which

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
you get the right angle clamp which

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.259 
you get the right angle clamp which
again<00:03:49.189> we<00:03:49.310> talked<00:03:49.549> about<00:03:49.669> this<00:03:49.909> in<00:03:50.030> one<00:03:50.150> of<00:03:50.180> the

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
again we talked about this in one of the

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.179 
again we talked about this in one of the
previous<00:03:50.389> videos<00:03:50.629> too<00:03:51.049> but<00:03:51.319> this<00:03:51.650> is<00:03:51.709> really

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:52.189 
previous videos too but this is really

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:54.909 
previous videos too but this is really
handy<00:03:52.430> I<00:03:52.900> wish<00:03:53.900> I'd<00:03:54.049> brought<00:03:54.199> a<00:03:54.319> demo<00:03:54.620> up<00:03:54.739> here

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
handy I wish I'd brought a demo up here

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.649 
handy I wish I'd brought a demo up here
with<00:03:55.040> me<00:03:55.159> but<00:03:55.310> this<00:03:55.699> is<00:03:55.879> really<00:03:56.299> handy<00:03:56.479> when

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
with me but this is really handy when

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.689 
with me but this is really handy when
you're<00:03:56.840> putting<00:03:57.019> boxes<00:03:57.260> together<00:03:57.799> or<00:03:58.009> well

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
you're putting boxes together or well

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.999 
you're putting boxes together or well
anything<00:03:58.849> together<00:03:59.180> that's<00:03:59.840> it's<00:04:00.799> wide

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:01.009 
anything together that's it's wide

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:04.330 
anything together that's it's wide
enough<00:04:01.040> to<00:04:01.340> handle<00:04:02.739> because<00:04:03.739> you<00:04:03.949> can<00:04:04.099> stick

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
enough to handle because you can stick

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.219 
enough to handle because you can stick
this<00:04:04.489> in<00:04:04.699> the<00:04:04.879> Craig<00:04:05.120> hole<00:04:05.419> that<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:05.959> drilled

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:06.229 
this in the Craig hole that you drilled

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.409 
this in the Craig hole that you drilled
and<00:04:06.409> then<00:04:06.979> clamp<00:04:07.609> it<00:04:07.790> on<00:04:07.879> to<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.060> other<00:04:08.180> side

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
and then clamp it on to the other side

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.300 
and then clamp it on to the other side
the<00:04:08.930> Kreg<00:04:09.139> jig<00:04:09.169> is<00:04:09.470> awesome<00:04:09.859> and<00:04:10.009> usually<00:04:10.250> you

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
the Kreg jig is awesome and usually you

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.289 
the Kreg jig is awesome and usually you
don't<00:04:10.400> need<00:04:10.579> clamps<00:04:10.909> once<00:04:11.090> it's<00:04:11.209> glued

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
don't need clamps once it's glued

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.390 
don't need clamps once it's glued
together<00:04:11.509> the<00:04:12.229> only<00:04:12.319> issues<00:04:12.739> that<00:04:12.979> sometimes

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
together the only issues that sometimes

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.180 
together the only issues that sometimes
when<00:04:13.549> you<00:04:13.639> put<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.879> two<00:04:14.000> pieces<00:04:14.180> together

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
when you put the two pieces together

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.409 
when you put the two pieces together
once<00:04:16.190> you're<00:04:16.340> driving<00:04:16.699> the<00:04:16.789> screw<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.180> screw

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
once you're driving the screw the screw

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.390 
once you're driving the screw the screw
still<00:04:17.720> wants<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.019> kind<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.530> follow<00:04:18.739> that<00:04:19.099> grain

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
still wants to kind of follow that grain

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.789 
still wants to kind of follow that grain
a<00:04:19.430> little<00:04:19.699> bit<00:04:19.970> so<00:04:20.570> sometimes<00:04:21.019> your<00:04:21.229> your

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
a little bit so sometimes your your

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.770 
a little bit so sometimes your your
piece<00:04:22.039> that<00:04:22.070> you<00:04:22.250> put<00:04:22.370> together<00:04:22.460> can<00:04:23.240> move<00:04:23.479> as

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
piece that you put together can move as

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.200 
piece that you put together can move as
you're<00:04:24.110> as<00:04:24.560> you're<00:04:24.620> inserting<00:04:25.159> it<00:04:25.400> or<00:04:25.610> putting

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
you're as you're inserting it or putting

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.040 
you're as you're inserting it or putting
the<00:04:26.360> screw<00:04:26.599> in<00:04:26.750> so<00:04:27.650> once<00:04:27.979> if<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.310> clamp<00:04:28.610> it

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
the screw in so once if you clamp it

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.839 
the screw in so once if you clamp it
then<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.650> likelihood<00:04:31.099> of<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.250> happening<00:04:31.340> is

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
then the likelihood of that happening is

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.330 
then the likelihood of that happening is
is<00:04:32.120> really<00:04:32.419> diminished<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:33.440> this<00:04:33.680> is<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:33.830> really

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
is really diminished so this is a really

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.710 
is really diminished so this is a really
really<00:04:34.460> handy<00:04:34.849> clamp<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:35.240> don't<00:04:35.389> have<00:04:35.479> one<00:04:35.599> of

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
really handy clamp you don't have one of

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.149 
really handy clamp you don't have one of
these<00:04:35.810> I<00:04:36.110> would<00:04:36.590> tell<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:36.770> to<00:04:36.860> get<00:04:36.949> one<00:04:37.070> of

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
these I would tell you to get one of

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.870 
these I would tell you to get one of
these

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
these

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.510 
these
then<00:04:39.770> this<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:40.980> just<00:04:41.130> kind<00:04:41.280> of<00:04:41.310> your<00:04:41.430> other

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
then this is just kind of your other

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.950 
then this is just kind of your other
parts<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:43.080> this<00:04:43.230> kit<00:04:43.560> right<00:04:43.740> here<00:04:44.600> then<00:04:45.600> this

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
parts to this kit right here then this

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.420 
parts to this kit right here then this
is<00:04:46.620> your<00:04:46.980> wheel<00:04:47.220> that<00:04:48.120> tells<00:04:48.390> you<00:04:49.070> what<00:04:50.070> screws

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
is your wheel that tells you what screws

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.770 
is your wheel that tells you what screws
to<00:04:50.670> use<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:53.840> then<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:55.050> size<00:04:55.290> let's<00:04:55.590> see

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
to use and and then the size let's see

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.360 
to use and and then the size let's see
actually<00:04:57.780> never<00:04:58.170> use<00:04:58.350> this<00:04:58.590> it's<00:04:59.010> pretty<00:04:59.190> cool

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
actually never use this it's pretty cool

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.900 
actually never use this it's pretty cool
so<00:05:00.180> it's<00:05:00.300> mostly<00:05:00.720> what<00:05:00.900> screws<00:05:01.230> to<00:05:01.650> use<00:05:01.860> so<00:05:02.460> if

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
so it's mostly what screws to use so if

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.000 
so it's mostly what screws to use so if
you<00:05:03.390> have<00:05:04.310> one<00:05:05.310> inch<00:05:05.490> to<00:05:05.700> one<00:05:05.910> inch<00:05:07.010> thickness

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
you have one inch to one inch thickness

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.940 
you have one inch to one inch thickness
part<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:08.880> thickness<00:05:09.150> Part<00:05:09.450> B<00:05:09.480> thickness<00:05:09.990> then

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
part a thickness Part B thickness then

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.290 
part a thickness Part B thickness then
you<00:05:11.100> would<00:05:11.220> use<00:05:11.370> an<00:05:11.490> inch<00:05:11.640> and<00:05:11.790> a<00:05:11.820> half<00:05:11.850> screw

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
you would use an inch and a half screw

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.120 
you would use an inch and a half screw
let's<00:05:13.110> say<00:05:13.320> I'm<00:05:13.470> going<00:05:13.740> from<00:05:16.130> three-quarter

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
let's say I'm going from three-quarter

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.970 
let's say I'm going from three-quarter
and<00:05:17.670> I'm<00:05:17.760> gonna<00:05:17.880> go<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.180> inch<00:05:18.450> and<00:05:18.660> a<00:05:18.690> half<00:05:18.980> so

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
and I'm gonna go to inch and a half so

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.040 
and I'm gonna go to inch and a half so
we're<00:05:20.100> going<00:05:20.220> to<00:05:20.280> go<00:05:20.370> through<00:05:20.810> plywood<00:05:21.810> into<00:05:22.730> a

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
we're going to go through plywood into a

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.630 
we're going to go through plywood into a
2x4<00:05:25.520> so<00:05:26.660> we'd<00:05:27.660> come<00:05:27.690> over<00:05:28.110> here<00:05:28.440> and<00:05:28.770> then<00:05:29.580> we

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
2x4 so we'd come over here and then we

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.070 
2x4 so we'd come over here and then we
tell<00:05:29.820> us<00:05:29.940> it<00:05:30.180> tells<00:05:30.300> us<00:05:30.480> to<00:05:30.510> use<00:05:30.690> an<00:05:30.780> inch<00:05:30.930> and

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
tell us it tells us to use an inch and

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.330 
tell us it tells us to use an inch and
1/2<00:05:31.170> screw<00:05:31.530> so<00:05:32.310> it's<00:05:32.460> a<00:05:32.520> really<00:05:32.700> handy<00:05:34.010> jig<00:05:35.010> to

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
1/2 screw so it's a really handy jig to

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.820 
1/2 screw so it's a really handy jig to
help<00:05:35.490> you<00:05:35.640> set<00:05:36.150> up<00:05:36.180> properly<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:37.110> it<00:05:37.680> tells

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
help you set up properly and it tells

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.430 
help you set up properly and it tells
you<00:05:37.920> to<00:05:37.950> use<00:05:38.040> the<00:05:38.310> 3/4<00:05:38.850> jig<00:05:39.330> setting<00:05:39.750> so<00:05:40.320> that's

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
you to use the 3/4 jig setting so that's

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.440 
you to use the 3/4 jig setting so that's
on<00:05:40.620> the<00:05:40.710> side<00:05:41.010> of<00:05:41.220> this<00:05:41.370> there's<00:05:42.150> your<00:05:42.240> three

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
on the side of this there's your three

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.710 
on the side of this there's your three
quarter<00:05:42.780> line<00:05:43.410> right<00:05:43.680> there<00:05:44.300> 7/8<00:05:45.300> one<00:05:45.510> inch

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
quarter line right there 7/8 one inch

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.460 
quarter line right there 7/8 one inch
and<00:05:45.870> so<00:05:46.020> on<00:05:46.170> and<00:05:46.410> what<00:05:47.280> happens<00:05:47.700> is<00:05:48.440> when<00:05:49.440> you

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
and so on and what happens is when you

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.420 
and so on and what happens is when you
put<00:05:49.560> this<00:05:49.830> in<00:05:49.980> the<00:05:50.070> G<00:05:50.370> egg<00:05:51.830> you'll<00:05:52.830> set<00:05:53.100> it<00:05:53.220> to

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
put this in the G egg you'll set it to

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.240 
put this in the G egg you'll set it to
the<00:05:53.550> right<00:05:53.580> until<00:05:53.760> the<00:05:54.030> line<00:05:54.300> that<00:05:54.540> you<00:05:54.630> need

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
the right until the line that you need

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.770 
the right until the line that you need
so<00:05:56.250> when<00:05:56.370> it<00:05:56.460> talks<00:05:56.640> about<00:05:56.700> the<00:05:56.940> 3/4<00:05:57.450> setting

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
so when it talks about the 3/4 setting

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.110 
so when it talks about the 3/4 setting
that's<00:05:58.200> what<00:05:58.380> it<00:05:58.470> means<00:05:58.620> if<00:05:59.430> it<00:05:59.670> were<00:05:59.760> to<00:05:59.910> say

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
that's what it means if it were to say

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.000 
that's what it means if it were to say
an<00:06:00.480> inch<00:06:00.870> and<00:06:01.020> a<00:06:01.080> quarter<00:06:01.230> setting<00:06:01.680> you'd

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
an inch and a quarter setting you'd

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.410 
an inch and a quarter setting you'd
bring<00:06:02.160> it<00:06:02.310> up<00:06:02.400> here<00:06:02.610> and<00:06:02.790> there's<00:06:03.300> a<00:06:03.360> little

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
bring it up here and there's a little

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.760 
bring it up here and there's a little
screw<00:06:03.780> that<00:06:03.870> goes<00:06:04.020> in<00:06:04.170> there<00:06:04.290> that<00:06:04.470> you<00:06:04.530> thread

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
screw that goes in there that you thread

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.120 
screw that goes in there that you thread
in<00:06:04.950> so<00:06:05.550> that's<00:06:06.270> what<00:06:06.510> that<00:06:06.630> means<00:06:06.950> let's<00:06:07.950> see

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
in so that's what that means let's see

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.650 
in so that's what that means let's see
what<00:06:08.250> this<00:06:08.400> other<00:06:08.550> side<00:06:08.850> does<00:06:09.120> so<00:06:09.420> this<00:06:09.540> is

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
what this other side does so this is

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.880 
what this other side does so this is
showing<00:06:09.840> you<00:06:09.990> if<00:06:10.110> you<00:06:10.200> were<00:06:10.260> gonna<00:06:10.470> do<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.650> butt

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
showing you if you were gonna do a butt

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.740 
showing you if you were gonna do a butt
joint<00:06:10.920> like<00:06:11.310> this<00:06:11.550> so<00:06:12.120> that<00:06:12.150> you<00:06:12.270> didn't<00:06:12.630> pop

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
joint like this so that you didn't pop

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.040 
joint like this so that you didn't pop
out<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:13.050> other<00:06:13.080> side<00:06:13.820> and<00:06:14.820> then<00:06:15.390> face<00:06:15.720> join

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
out the other side and then face join

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.720 
out the other side and then face join
cool<00:06:16.620> okay<00:06:17.430> so<00:06:17.600> let's<00:06:18.600> do<00:06:18.750> it<00:06:18.780> again<00:06:18.930> let's<00:06:19.350> go

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.730 
cool okay so let's do it again let's go

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.050 
cool okay so let's do it again let's go
3/4<00:06:20.730> so<00:06:21.390> Part<00:06:21.660> A<00:06:21.720> thickness<00:06:22.170> 3/4<00:06:22.830> and<00:06:23.670> let's<00:06:23.850> go

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
3/4 so Part A thickness 3/4 and let's go

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.520 
3/4 so Part A thickness 3/4 and let's go
to<00:06:24.120> inch<00:06:24.810> and<00:06:24.990> a<00:06:25.020> half<00:06:27.110> so<00:06:28.110> it<00:06:28.200> tells<00:06:28.410> you<00:06:28.500> that

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
to inch and a half so it tells you that

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.490 
to inch and a half so it tells you that
you<00:06:28.680> use<00:06:28.800> the<00:06:28.920> same<00:06:29.100> settings<00:06:30.020> so<00:06:31.020> it<00:06:31.290> might

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
you use the same settings so it might

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.420 
you use the same settings so it might
look<00:06:32.180> at<00:06:33.180> that<00:06:33.230> kind<00:06:34.230> of<00:06:34.320> cool<00:06:34.500> so<00:06:34.830> 7/8<00:06:35.280> to

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
look at that kind of cool so 7/8 to

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.820 
look at that kind of cool so 7/8 to
half-inch<00:06:35.790> not<00:06:36.060> recommended

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
half-inch not recommended

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.730 
half-inch not recommended
one<00:06:37.830> is<00:06:37.980> to<00:06:38.130> 5/8<00:06:38.490> not<00:06:38.610> recommended<00:06:39.110> anyway<00:06:40.110> so

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
one is to 5/8 not recommended anyway so

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.610 
one is to 5/8 not recommended anyway so
lots<00:06:40.950> of<00:06:41.070> cool<00:06:41.280> little<00:06:42.410> information<00:06:43.410> on<00:06:43.500> that
