I<00:00:29.550> should<00:00:29.789> say<00:00:30.000> giving<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.689> more<00:00:30.900> power<00:00:31.140> out

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
I should say giving you more power out

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.020 
I should say giving you more power out
of<00:00:31.410> each<00:00:31.650> stride<00:00:32.040> that's<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.910> be

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
of each stride that's going to be

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.090 
of each stride that's going to be
holding<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.420> CCM<00:00:33.989> stainless<00:00:34.440> steel<00:00:34.649> runners

holding the CCM stainless steel runners

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.370 
holding the CCM stainless steel runners
now<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.090> attached<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.050> super

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
now this is all attached to the super

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.770 
now this is all attached to the super
skin<00:00:37.590> outsole<00:00:38.399> now<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:38.969> quarter<00:00:39.329> package<00:00:39.480> is

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
skin outsole now the quarter package is

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.389 
skin outsole now the quarter package is
what<00:00:39.960> they<00:00:40.079> call<00:00:40.290> their<00:00:40.440> action<00:00:40.860> form<00:00:41.100> chrome

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
what they call their action form chrome

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.889 
what they call their action form chrome
composite<00:00:41.969> quarter<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.629> that's<00:00:42.690> gonna

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
composite quarter and that's gonna

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.270 
composite quarter and that's gonna
happen<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.320> they<00:00:43.440> call<00:00:43.620> their<00:00:43.770> speed<00:00:44.040> core

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
happen what they call their speed core

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.990 
happen what they call their speed core
inner<00:00:44.579> core

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
inner core

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.970 
inner core
now<00:00:45.480> these<00:00:45.660> both<00:00:45.989> work<00:00:46.230> together<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.770> give<00:00:46.890> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
now these both work together to give you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.740 
now these both work together to give you
a<00:00:47.010> big<00:00:47.370> jump<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.730> stiffness<00:00:48.180> from<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.600> saw

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
a big jump in stiffness from what we saw

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.959 
a big jump in stiffness from what we saw
in<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.899> 280<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:49.890> translate<00:00:50.399> into<00:00:50.579> just

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
in that 280 which translate into just

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.479 
in that 280 which translate into just
extreme<00:00:51.510> power<00:00:51.860> explosive<00:00:52.860> foot<00:00:53.070> speed<00:00:53.370> as

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
extreme power explosive foot speed as

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.189 
extreme power explosive foot speed as
you're<00:00:53.640> taking<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.120> strides<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.020> other

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
you're taking your strides and the other

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.720 
you're taking your strides and the other
thing<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.590> really<00:00:55.770> point<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.610> this

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
thing to really point out with this

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
compared to those RBZ skates so right

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.969 
compared to those RBZ skates so right
out<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> box<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.320> gonna<00:01:13.439> fit<00:01:13.799> better

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
out of the box it's gonna fit better

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.770 
out of the box it's gonna fit better
especially<00:01:14.520> once<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.060> go<00:01:15.150> ahead<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.479> bake<00:01:15.630> it
