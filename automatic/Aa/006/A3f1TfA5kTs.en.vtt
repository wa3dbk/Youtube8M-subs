00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.539 
and they have a really nice drop rate
and<00:01:36.240> they<00:01:37.049> respawn<00:01:37.409> rather<00:01:37.890> quickly<00:01:38.159> too

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
and they respawn rather quickly too

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.399 
and they respawn rather quickly too
because<00:01:39.000> they're<00:01:39.619> part<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.770> objective<00:01:41.400> of

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
because they're part of the objective of

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.289 
because they're part of the objective of
one<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.780> battles<00:01:46.399> winter<00:01:47.399> quests<00:01:48.270> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
one of the battles winter quests that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.929 
one of the battles winter quests that
they<00:01:48.509> give<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.890> really<00:01:50.490> do<00:01:50.610> think<00:01:50.820> that

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
they give so I really do think that

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.420 
they give so I really do think that
these<00:01:51.149> two<00:01:51.479> spots<00:01:51.840> are<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.350> best<00:01:52.590> place<00:01:52.950> to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
these two spots are the best place to

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.929 
these two spots are the best place to
skin<00:01:54.799> savage<00:01:55.799> leather<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.280> most<00:01:56.520> people

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
skin savage leather for most people

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.699 
and the reason i save this spot for last
is<00:02:07.970> because<00:02:08.619> it's<00:02:09.619> behind<00:02:10.130> an<00:02:11.200> instanced<00:02:12.200> area

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
is because it's behind an instanced area

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.480 
is because it's behind an instanced area
that<00:02:13.190> requires<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:14.319> long<00:02:15.319> quest<00:02:16.069> chain<00:02:16.340> to

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
that requires a long quest chain to

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.880 
that requires a long quest chain to
complete<00:02:16.720> now<00:02:17.720> while<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.230> appealed<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.800> a

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
complete now while that appealed to a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.130 
complete now while that appealed to a
lot<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.220> people<00:02:19.370> when<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.910> level<00:02:20.090> cap<00:02:20.360> was<00:02:20.600> 85

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
lot of people when the level cap was 85

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.949 
lot of people when the level cap was 85
now<00:02:22.069> that<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.370> level<00:02:22.700> cap<00:02:22.850> is<00:02:23.150> 90<00:02:23.600> I<00:02:23.630> can't

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
now that the level cap is 90 I can't

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.500 
now that the level cap is 90 I can't
imagine<00:02:24.080> most<00:02:24.560> people<00:02:24.940> will<00:02:25.940> want<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.239> spend

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
imagine most people will want to spend

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.640 
imagine most people will want to spend
the<00:02:26.630> time<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:28.209> access<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:29.420> level<00:02:29.840> 85<00:02:30.260> zone

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
the time to access this level 85 zone

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.979 
the time to access this level 85 zone
but<00:02:31.459> for<00:02:31.700> those<00:02:31.819> that<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.300> already<00:02:32.690> that

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
but for those that you already that

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.960 
but for those that you already that
already<00:02:33.290> have<00:02:33.470> access<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.250> molten<00:02:34.610> front

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
already have access to the molten front

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.479 
already have access to the molten front
it's<00:02:35.870> worthwhile<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:37.660> kill<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.840> spiders

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
it's worthwhile to kill the spiders

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.259 
it's worthwhile to kill the spiders
there<00:02:40.489> because<00:02:40.850> they're<00:02:40.940> going<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.120> have<00:02:41.239> a

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
there because they're going to have a

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.020 
there because they're going to have a
little<00:02:41.420> bit<00:02:41.690> higher<00:02:42.230> drop<00:02:42.590> rate<00:02:42.910> than<00:02:43.910> the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
little bit higher drop rate than the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.740 
little bit higher drop rate than the
ones<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.440> mentioned<00:02:45.739> previously<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:47.450> I

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
ones that I mentioned previously so I

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.420 
ones that I mentioned previously so I
just<00:02:48.230> wanted<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.560> make<00:02:48.620> sure<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:49.040> covered

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
just wanted to make sure that I covered

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.180 
just wanted to make sure that I covered
that<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.930> molten<00:02:51.440> front<00:02:51.739> has<00:02:51.980> the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
that that the molten front has the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.630 
that that the molten front has the
absolutely<00:02:53.200> highest<00:02:54.200> drop<00:02:54.500> rate<00:02:54.800> but<00:02:55.040> only

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
absolutely highest drop rate but only

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.370 
absolutely highest drop rate but only
the<00:02:55.850> players<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.239> took<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.780> time<00:02:57.019> back<00:02:57.350> when

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
the players that took the time back when

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.740 
the players that took the time back when
they<00:02:57.709> were<00:02:57.739> level<00:02:58.160> 85<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.850> that<00:02:58.970> was<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.120> cap<00:02:59.450> to

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
they were level 85 and that was a cap to

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.080 
they were level 85 and that was a cap to
gain<00:03:00.440> access<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:01.069> that<00:03:01.310> zone<00:03:01.640> are<00:03:01.819> going<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.000> be

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
gain access to that zone are going to be

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.630 
gain access to that zone are going to be
able<00:03:02.269> to<00:03:02.330> farm<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:03.190> that's<00:03:04.190> all<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.430> have<00:03:04.610> for
