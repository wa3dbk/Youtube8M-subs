00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello today again new video and was 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.630
 a tutorial on how best to do that 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.429
 battery life on the device can increase and 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.980
 how to make sure that batteries 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.410
 should be explained I give you dear text 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.630
 I'll tell you what you might do 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.160
 could do a bit for it 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.279
 to make sure he is not so fast 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.510
 The reason for this was a comment 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.260
 from the off to the video where I have the battery 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.969
 switch from a power red 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.320
 had bought one from ps then said 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.000
 that he believed moment has only three left 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.950
 hours is when the device is new 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.050
 not so to be there is probably 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.420
 what about the legal arrangement of the batteries 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.120
 broken or used device 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.070
 I could definitely say 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.899
 Just use this video around you 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.180
 to show it like you might for it 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.539
 Could not worry that the battery is not 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.260
 emptied so quickly on iphone 4 or 4 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:01.559
 first tip wlan on the way 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.270
 you should turn off 1 in any case 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.280
 always do when you are on the way 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.830
 turn off your wlan if you have it 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.210
 So you do not need it on everyone 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.460
 save a bit of energy 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.960
 if you have a setting or sbs though 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.330
 you can do that quite normally over the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.970
 respective solved and see or sb 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.650
 make settings menus otherwise you have 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.340
 no jailbreak just the setting 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.610
 go 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.470
 above with wlan then simply the function 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.340
 turn off and on demand easy 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.340
 turn back on 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.380
 second tip message central apps 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.689
 consciously adjust 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.890
 in the message center you have too 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.350
 apps that tell you about all the information 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.210
 at any time also keep an offline at 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.390
 me it is foursquare wordpress and 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.740
 facebook as well as other apps there too 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.560
 You should definitely be aware of the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.750
 set apps because there is something there 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.979
 more is in you at any time 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.959
 Keep up-to-date with information 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.959
 that means it always acts in the 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.789
 background and becomes energy as well 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.590
 you can adjust the pull under 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.380
 messages you see in the message 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.489
 central everything you have in there with me 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.989
 Of course it's a bit more 

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:06.619
 always want to keep up to date 

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:08.630
 stay 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.979
 otherwise he does not need that 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.810
 Just get out then it is not one 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.390
 headquarters and if you are there 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.040
 everything can consciously and well adjusted 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.120
 So you also save energy again 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.629
 So it's definitely one 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.629
 worth considering 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.810
 third tip brightness of the display 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.610
 car brightness 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.770
 an important feature is definitely 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.690
 the brightness of the phones all the way to 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.550
 reduce or given 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.170
 because of course because of the 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.340
 brightness, of course, is very much 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.270
 Energy consumed I have here now 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.739
 the brightness a bit higher 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.420
 so that of course you can do everything 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.190
 but you can see better in any case 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.720
 it is also quite good again on the way 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.760
 time the brightness down a bit 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.730
 to turn to cut down on third 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.170
 that means her black energy and 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.880
 the car's brightness is also important 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.260
 as soon as you're outside or 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.209
 back in the time or the bright or 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.620
 it turns dark automatically 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.640
 display again with the brightness 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.980
 You can do a little bit here again 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.180
 See that is the optimal setting 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.110
 if you can set it that way 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.970
 you definitely have a lot of energy 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.590
 save and when needed simply the regulator 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.670
 turn up again and there you have 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.420
 the vulnerability actually 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.420
 always needs 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.640
 Location Services will turn off the 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.020
 Location services only one if you want them 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.610
 really needed that recognizes yes this 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.770
 case of so from bottom left to top 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.930
 i would go to the right 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.220
 process I generally omit only 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.870
 if necessary, you can of course set 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:35.040
 also within the app control fifth 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.040
 tip bluetooth 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.480
 because it is bluetooth in general 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.980
 basically leave out with me it is 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.360
 Actually, always out because I have one 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.560
 headset or mine 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.200
 Handsfree then it sounded 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.299
 Of course, but otherwise bluetooth 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.620
 basically leave out thus has yes 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.620
 also a little energy 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.780
 sixth tip e mails automatically 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.640
 query push function so beautiful it too 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.440
 is that you are always informed that 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.090
 one new e mail gets so annoying 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.530
 It can also be if the battery then in 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.110
 The knee is only because you are always 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.760
 as I said the push function of the mail 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.500
 I have contacts calendar function on 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.870
 I have the data completely on 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.209
 stay out with me you can do it 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.340
 switch to push then you have the push 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.100
 function on you can decide whether you 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.800
 every 15 minutes 30 minutes or 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.450
 hourly would like to be informed 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.120
 my time that means the phone asks 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.530
 automatically now I have it off me 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.970
 I 'm on manual and whenever I go 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.950
 I want to know if I'm going now 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.419
 I just ask the app for me 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.060
 and so I stay up to date 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.260
 That's how you can save energy 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.230
 are there last tip device lock 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.330
 keyboard autologue i would you 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.320
 recommend your device to automatic 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.940
 to put a barrier 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.830
 I have my also gets on 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.270
 automatic lock after one minute 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.790
 that means if I do not get my device 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.170
 use or put on the table and that 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.550
 light in rome mode offset switches 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.330
 automatically after a minute 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.690
 in the sleep mode 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.310
 You can choose if 123 45 minutes I 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.770
 let me basically on a minute 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.810
 30 seconds, the display takes off 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.430
 after a luthe can go to sleep 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.840
 I highly recommend it as I said so 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.210
 you can also save energy again 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.300
 and not your device will run infinitely 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.840
 leave so I hope my tips from you 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.640
 helped 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.010
 and you should maybe tips and 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.600
 then can make tricks even easier 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.710
 just the comment 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.820
 write to me or write to me 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.450
 feel comfortable with tips and suggestions 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.500
 looking forward 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.500
 that said
