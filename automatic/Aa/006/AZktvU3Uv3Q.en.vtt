00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.740
 well I'll have another video is 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.020
 trust drills for glass and before I 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.029
 show that the reason I'm here is 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.790
 making this trophy which is a prize of the 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:30.570
 award art décor which is a prize of tv 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.480
 victory that is affiliated with the record 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.220
 holy spirit and we have created and 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.070
 we make this trophy 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.620
 we are already in the seventh edition and he was a 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.180
 articulated trophy as you can see 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.190
 What is so cool is a very 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.989
 that is geared towards the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.019
 professionals and companies from 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.120
 architecture and decoration here state 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.400
 Good, but I want to show you the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.979
 next to make all the prizes 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.479
 Look how much glass I have 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:03.120
 what a hole 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:06.510
 are about 600 perforated glasses 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.710
 so are bubbles with one 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.390
 effect we created with a hole 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.229
 One of the songs to do that one. 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.390
 It is made 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.210
 this glass it has six millimeters one 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.990
 molten glass so it's already more 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.810
 resistant a normal glass then and beyond 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.909
 from being thick then to 600 holes 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.030
 really there are buying several 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.950
 Drills I end up sharpening drugs 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.950
 Good, that's what I'm going to talk to you. 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.869
 now I want to show first the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.689
 put the camera on the tripod 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.189
 I want to show you is if a drill 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:48.329
 that we can say that I just made 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.119
 This drill bit and a drill bit is in the state 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.359
 still good good quality block not 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.310
 has a brand but is a brand is a purchase 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.909
 in specialty stores and a drill is 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.329
 good quality and a good diamond area 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:06.929
 well it only you can see that this 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:09.539
 it is thick for sale and this 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.319
 here is one of the drills that was also 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.740
 using 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.900
 look at the difference in this border can 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.620
 see that it's fine that this happens 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.709
 Anger that is already blind is this 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.360
 exchange of the series she has a cutting effect 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.290
 with 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.410
 a good precision because she already 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.210
 decreased contact area is different 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.650
 other materials and other drugs that 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.030
 you need a really one tip 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.040
 little finer 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.960
 in this case but needs to expand the area of 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.770
 contact because she is actually going to 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.870
 Eating right, you're not going to sing like that. 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.110
 a drill arm for the wood by 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.780
 For example, it will erode 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.459
 need to increase this area of ​​contact 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.120
 here and that's what we're going to do now 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.600
 so we're going to use it is a stone of 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.340
 sharpening a normal stone is one of those 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.430
 people use in the kitchen will stick the knife 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.989
 even though there are special stones 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.800
 own for this 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.930
 Only I dug it, testing it, no. 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.140
 emergency one time when I needed it 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.480
 really worked and then I started to 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.430
 use it that way and I did not stop 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.920
 I ended up finding a special stone. 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.739
 but who want to buy them exist only 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.040
 there in the market then we will make a 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.810
 only by the thick part of the drill and we 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.730
 Let's be careful that we have to 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.620
 it will only lead to the drill and every 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.670
 a little twist something around a 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:45.269
 room for us to keep 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:49.019
 this area that really flat and not 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.459
 make this area because if this 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.320
 here we fall asleep we have a 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.840
 problem that will only take a piece of the 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.519
 drug a month in the river then rest goes 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.290
 to stand still then this is the 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:03.799
 movement lifts you off and always with 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.780
 causing water did not hit with water but 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:16.220
 can be a form every time then we 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:16.220
 Let's take the exchange and inform 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:28.910
 this takes about a couple of 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.910
 depends on the pace that we are going to make 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.580
 good've already wore enough since 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:45.610
 we can say that there is more the block is 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.320
 Sharp already has a bit of daily already 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.240
 we increased here in the contact holidays 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.460
 however there are still some small 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.310
 imperfections then we'll do 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.370
 let's turn the cornerstone of the finest 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.300
 and we will use some passages no longer 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.030
 it takes as many strides or 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:16.270
 so long just do not take away a bit 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:18.759
 imperfections that are always 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.620
 remember playing water is leaving 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:31.930
 It is important that the skin is always 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:32.830
 wet it's already good it 's this personal looks 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:42.820
 the difference 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:43.840
 now it will stay here to bring a 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.300
 little more 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.139
 That's it, it's in that test that was 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.180
 bad 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.789
 now you're ready to go back and do 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.500
 but several holes 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:55.960
 just for you to have an idea of ​​how much 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.750
 really a drill can last 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.419
 Look at this one already the used block 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.729
 also in your area greater demand and looks 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.430
 this is very small because if an area 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.440
 mounted then it's still here 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.919
 It's about three millimeters still. 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.409
 too much bore is really sharpening it let's go 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.500
 to make many holes is a block that is 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:23.349
 me this exchange is already with me maybe 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:25.780
 four years and has already made four 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:28.270
 the trophy so you guys have a 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.099
 idea how yields still put 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.080
 always intercalating with two more drills 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:36.759
 for you to have a notion is not just a 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.380
 about 600 holes 4 times is just do 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:41.529
 one contained and you will see that a 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.610
 drill bit by buying a good drill is 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:45.370
 a pity that really is 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.770
 has the brands but is is buying a 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.060
 drill in an appropriate place you will have 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.819
 a good drill 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.219
 Okay and with more this tip then do not do 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:57.759
 many holes the courses will yield and 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:59.349
 will ruin - the virus ankle - splinters 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.710
 OK people 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:06.069
 One more tip for you, a hug, I hope. 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:09.340
 that you liked and liked click on 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:12.430
 I liked sharing with friends help 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.659
 in a place that adds favorites 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.279
 right 

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:17.279
 a hug until the next video
