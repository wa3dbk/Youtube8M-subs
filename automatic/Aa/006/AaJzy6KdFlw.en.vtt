00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.700
let us study an important section of.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.030
reflection of light that is analysis of image
formation by spherical mirrors. here we can

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:23.700
write that, for a given object.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.029
a spherical mirror.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.140
produces.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.370
its image.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.370
for which.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.649
four different parameters, four parameters.
are analyzed.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:52.590
which gives us the whole information about
the image and these parameters are.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.900
very first one is.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.260
exact location of image.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.309
where the image is produced.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.810
the second one is, nature of image.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:14.909
third one is size of image.

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.990
and the fourth one is orientation of image.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.920
orientation, meaning whether the image is
produced on the same side of principle axis

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.840
which we also called erected image or it is
produced on the other side opposite side of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.180
the principle axis which we call inverted
image.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.439
here 1 by 1 we’ll discuss all these parameters.
if we talk about exact location of image,

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.549
here we can write that this obtained.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.850
by mirror formula.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.850
which.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:02:00.639
we’ll take up in next section, in detail.
and this one of the most important mathematical

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:01.710
relation which is.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.310
going to be used for, calculation of.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.909
exact location of image in any case.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.230
if we talk about nature of image, we already
studied that it is obtained.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.010
by nature of.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.840
reflected rays, from the spherical mirrors
as we already discussed if there are converging

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.240
reflected rays this implies.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:31.659
image is real. and if there are diverging
reflected rays then this implies image is

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.849
virtual that we already studied under the
section of, types of images so.

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:43.090
always nature of image we are obtained by
looking at the type of reflected rays from

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.920
the spherical mirrors. if we talk about size
of image this is obtained.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.920
by.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.920
magnification formula.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.129
which we’ll study in next section.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:03:04.280
using magnification formula 
we can directly relate the size of image with

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.280
the size of, object.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.350
if we talk about orientation of image this
a very.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:16.030
good and direct analysis by which we can see
the orientation of image this i am explaining

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:24.739
with the help of a note, which you should
always keep in mind that.

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.290
in geometrical optics.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.290
whenever.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.760
object and image i have written geometrical
optics means the note is universally valid

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.769
whether we are studying reflection or refraction
or any optical instrument.

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.750
so here we can write whenever object and image.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.599
both.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.049
are of same nature.

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.049
always.

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.650
image is produced.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.400
on, opposite side of.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.209
principle axis. and ,when object, and, image.

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:09.329
are of opposite nature, opposite nature means,
if object is real image is virtual or object

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.950
is virtual image is real.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:21.260
here i have written when o and i both are
of same nature that means either both real

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.180
or both virtual. in that case the image is
produced on opposite side of principle axis

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:34.220
or inverted image is obtained and here when,
object and image are of opposite nature.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.139
the image.

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.220
is always produced.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.740
on.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.210
same side of principle axis that means we
can state that the image is, erected in nature.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.960
erected in its orientation.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.640
so you must be very careful about the four
parameters, in next section we’ll study

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.630
about mirror formula and magnification formula
and the applications.
