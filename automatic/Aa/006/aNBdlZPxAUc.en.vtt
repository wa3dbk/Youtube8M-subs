00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
22-foot pontoon single-engine it shows

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.080 
22-foot pontoon single-engine it shows
you<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.289> couple<00:00:31.590> different<00:00:31.650> ways<00:00:31.859> Bob<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.520> go<00:00:32.730> 60

miles<00:00:33.300> an<00:00:33.510> hour<00:00:33.630> because<00:00:33.840> Carolyn<00:00:34.260> had<00:00:34.410> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
miles an hour because Carolyn had a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.799 
miles an hour because Carolyn had a
single<00:00:34.860> 496<00:00:35.610> big<00:00:35.880> block<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.450> think

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
single 496 big block and it I think

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.709 
single 496 big block and it I think
right<00:00:37.520> this<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> little<00:00:38.790> smaller<00:00:39.149> boat<00:00:39.450> in

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
right this is a little smaller boat in

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.400 
right this is a little smaller boat in
Carolyn's<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.469> 22<00:00:41.010> footer

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.650 

boat<00:00:47.950> runs<00:00:48.190> with<00:00:48.310> a<00:00:48.370> good<00:00:48.520> attitude<00:00:49.210> yes<00:00:49.420> it's

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
boat runs with a good attitude yes it's

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.360 
boat runs with a good attitude yes it's
70<00:00:49.989> miles<00:00:50.170> an<00:00:50.380> hour<00:00:50.500> or<00:00:50.710> however<00:00:51.010> fast<00:00:51.190> he's

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
70 miles an hour or however fast he's

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.760 
70 miles an hour or however fast he's
going<00:00:51.550> right<00:00:51.760> now<00:00:51.970> looks<00:00:52.450> like<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.770> catamaran

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
going right now looks like a catamaran

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.030 
going right now looks like a catamaran
kinda<00:00:54.250> it's<00:00:54.489> wait

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.640 

to<00:00:58.900> 5189<00:01:00.080> speed<00:01:00.470> 66<00:01:01.720> 666<00:01:02.720> miles<00:01:03.020> an<00:01:03.230> hour's<00:01:03.500> we

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
to 5189 speed 66 666 miles an hour's we

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.310 
to 5189 speed 66 666 miles an hour's we
picks<00:01:03.860> it<00:01:03.980> up<00:01:04.040> 5<00:01:04.340> miles<00:01:04.670> an<00:01:04.970> hour

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
picks it up 5 miles an hour

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.070 
picks it up 5 miles an hour
yeah<00:01:06.320> I<00:01:06.350> think<00:01:06.590> we<00:01:06.890> have<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.750> single<00:01:08.750> engine

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
yeah I think we have to single engine

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.690 
yeah I think we have to single engine
outboard<00:01:09.590> pontoons<00:01:10.190> that<00:01:10.370> are<00:01:10.460> right<00:01:10.670> there

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
outboard pontoons that are right there

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.610 
outboard pontoons that are right there
at<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.240> number<00:01:11.510> this<00:01:12.080> is<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.410> first

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
at that number this is the first

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.620 
at that number this is the first
Evinrude<00:01:13.040> power<00:01:13.280> pontoon<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.090> i've<00:01:14.360> seen

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
Evinrude power pontoon that i've seen

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.160 
Evinrude power pontoon that i've seen
right<00:01:15.080> well<00:01:15.770> least<00:01:16.010> here<00:01:16.310> yeah<00:01:17.060> that's<00:01:17.900> right

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
right well least here yeah that's right

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.410 
right well least here yeah that's right
right<00:01:18.590> here<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:18.830> shut<00:01:19.010> absolutely

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.530 

this<00:01:23.960> is<00:01:24.110> our<00:01:24.229> polylift<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.979> boatlift<00:01:25.540> replay

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
this is our polylift the boatlift replay

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.720 
this is our polylift the boatlift replay
of<00:01:26.840> our<00:01:27.560> play<00:01:28.190> craft<00:01:28.520> run

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.330 

you

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.100 

yeah<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.450> only<00:01:36.510> does<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
yeah you can see that not only does the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.400 
yeah you can see that not only does the
center<00:01:37.770> tune<00:01:38.090> provide<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.120> little<00:01:39.390> more<00:01:39.660> lift

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
center tune provide a little more lift

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.280 
center tune provide a little more lift
but<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.010> of<00:01:41.220> course<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.580> single<00:01:41.880> engine

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
but you know of course the single engine

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.660 
but you know of course the single engine
it<00:01:44.750> puts<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.990> ear<00:01:46.470> case<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.800> little<00:01:47.250> bit<00:01:47.370> behind

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it puts the ear case a little bit behind

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.399 
it puts the ear case a little bit behind
the<00:01:47.850> hull<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.540> has<00:01:48.870> less<00:01:49.200> wetted<00:01:49.620> surface

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.790 

nice<00:01:54.860> steady<00:01:55.220> run<00:01:55.490> yep
