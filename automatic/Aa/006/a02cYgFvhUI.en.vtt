I<00:00:00.829> want<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.920> give<00:00:02.070> an<00:00:02.190> example<00:00:02.520> from<00:00:02.909> an<00:00:03.179> actual

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
I want to give an example from an actual

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.260 
I want to give an example from an actual
game<00:00:03.810> that<00:00:03.990> I<00:00:04.110> played<00:00:04.440> I<00:00:04.890> started<00:00:05.609> here<00:00:05.850> with

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
game that I played I started here with

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.390 
game that I played I started here with
my<00:00:06.450> platoon<00:00:06.870> from<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.259> insertion<00:00:07.740> point<00:00:07.770> we

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
my platoon from the insertion point we

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.400 
my platoon from the insertion point we
moved<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.210> direction<00:00:09.269> we<00:00:09.929> linked<00:00:10.290> up

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
moved in this direction we linked up

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.470 
moved in this direction we linked up
with<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.620> partition<00:00:11.070> then<00:00:11.880> we<00:00:12.059> were<00:00:12.150> moving

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
with a partition then we were moving

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.780 
with a partition then we were moving
here<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.780> right<00:00:13.200> before<00:00:13.469> crossing<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.400> trail

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
here and right before crossing the trail

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.910 
here and right before crossing the trail
we<00:00:15.059> had<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> chance<00:00:15.719> encounter<00:00:15.990> with<00:00:16.350> an<00:00:16.560> enemy

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
we had a chance encounter with an enemy

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.370 
we had a chance encounter with an enemy
there<00:00:17.340> was<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.490> battle<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.960> hugely

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
there was a battle and that hugely

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.710 
there was a battle and that hugely
increased<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.609> console<00:00:21.090> level<00:00:21.390> with<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
increased the console level with the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.599 
increased the console level with the
enemy<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.199> increase<00:00:22.470> therefore<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.039> odds<00:00:23.220> of

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
enemy and increase therefore the odds of

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.910 
enemy and increase therefore the odds of
having<00:00:24.000> other<00:00:24.180> encounters<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:25.140> fact<00:00:25.410> right

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
having other encounters in fact right

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.730 
having other encounters in fact right
after<00:00:25.949> crossing<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.880> trail<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.990> had<00:00:28.320> an

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
after crossing the trail we had an

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.880 
after crossing the trail we had an
encounter<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:29.670> another<00:00:30.330> enemy<00:00:31.019> group<00:00:31.320> lucky

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
encounter with another enemy group lucky

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.260 
encounter with another enemy group lucky
enough<00:00:32.130> they<00:00:32.250> were<00:00:32.369> moving<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> opposite

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
enough they were moving in the opposite

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.150 
enough they were moving in the opposite
direction<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.020> had<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.440> option<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.980> just

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
direction so I had the option of just

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.760 
direction so I had the option of just
letting<00:00:35.670> them<00:00:35.940> go<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.480> lay<00:00:36.719> down<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.320> lucky

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
letting them go just lay down and lucky

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.380 
letting them go just lay down and lucky
enough<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.160> weren't<00:00:38.399> spotted<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.090> we<00:00:39.210> could

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
enough we weren't spotted so we could

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.869 
enough we weren't spotted so we could
keep<00:00:39.570> moving<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.050> avoided<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.559> battle<00:00:40.980> but

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
keep moving we avoided that battle but

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.959 
keep moving we avoided that battle but
not<00:00:42.090> after<00:00:42.540> much<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:43.050> pasty<00:00:44.040> sniper<00:00:44.340> start<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
not after much a pasty sniper start the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.270 
not after much a pasty sniper start the
frag<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.420> my<00:00:45.629> platoon<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.500> again<00:00:46.950> there<00:00:47.129> was

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
frag of my platoon and again there was

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.160 
frag of my platoon and again there was
another<00:00:47.700> battle<00:00:48.210> there<00:00:48.420> before<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:48.960> could

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
another battle there before we could

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.430 
another battle there before we could
take<00:00:49.680> down<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.190> guy<00:00:50.600> then<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.840> moved<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.379> we

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
take down this guy then we moved and we

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.080 
take down this guy then we moved and we
reach<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> objective<00:00:53.250> there<00:00:53.520> was<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.879> conduct

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
reach the objective there was to conduct

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.330 
reach the objective there was to conduct
a<00:00:54.360> raid<00:00:54.539> against<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.110> bridge<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.739> then<00:00:56.160> from

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
a raid against this bridge and then from

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.790 
a raid against this bridge and then from
that<00:00:56.370> point<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.449> were<00:00:57.600> lucky<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:58.680> were

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
that point on we were lucky so we were

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.029 
that point on we were lucky so we were
just<00:00:58.829> moving<00:00:59.489> all<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.930> way<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.739> our

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
just moving all the way to our

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.640 
just moving all the way to our
extraction<00:01:02.940> point<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.530> was

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
extraction point so you can see it was

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.830 
extraction point so you can see it was
quite<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.400> bit<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.610> challenge<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.479> had<00:01:06.659> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
quite a bit of challenge that we had to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.969 
quite a bit of challenge that we had to
do<00:01:06.960> there<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.409> during<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.549> entire<00:01:09.119> section

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
do there and during this entire section

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.460 
do there and during this entire section
nothing<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.450> consequence<00:01:12.450> really<00:01:12.960> happened

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
nothing of consequence really happened

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.370 
nothing of consequence really happened
sure<00:01:13.860> there<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.600> countdown<00:01:16.049> sense

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
sure there was that the countdown sense

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.870 
sure there was that the countdown sense
that<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.860> wanted<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.280> reach<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.400> structural

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that we wanted to reach the structural

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.270 
that we wanted to reach the structural
point<00:01:18.150> before<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:19.140> end<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> mission<00:01:19.619> but

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
point before the end of the mission but

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.940 
point before the end of the mission but
aside<00:01:20.729> from<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.570> procedure<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.170> fairly

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
aside from that the procedure was fairly

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.530 
aside from that the procedure was fairly
repetitive<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.670> was<00:01:23.850> look<00:01:24.030> at<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.180> paragraph

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
repetitive it was look at the paragraph

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.749 
repetitive it was look at the paragraph
for<00:01:24.960> all<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> dice<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.740> see<00:01:26.009> how<00:01:26.189> much<00:01:26.369> you're

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
for all the dice to see how much you're

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.539 
for all the dice to see how much you're
moving<00:01:27.140> record<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.380> distance<00:01:28.799> go<00:01:29.189> back<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
moving record the distance go back to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.730 
moving record the distance go back to
the<00:01:29.700> same<00:01:29.939> paragraph<00:01:30.270> roll<00:01:30.900> again<00:01:31.229> record

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the same paragraph roll again record

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.539 
the same paragraph roll again record
again<00:01:32.130> move<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.700> etc<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.220> really

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
again move on etc and this is really

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.569 
again move on etc and this is really
where<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> find<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.020> role-playing<00:01:37.710> aspect<00:01:38.369> and

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
where I find the role-playing aspect and

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.960 
where I find the role-playing aspect and
the<00:01:39.150> gamer<00:01:39.500> aspect<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> game<00:01:40.970> really

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the gamer aspect of the game really

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.020 
the gamer aspect of the game really
diverged<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.079> most<00:01:43.460> because<00:01:44.460> from<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> point

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
diverged the most because from the point

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.530 
diverged the most because from the point
of<00:01:45.119> view<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:46.140> role-playing<00:01:46.759> player<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.180> was

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
of view of the role-playing player I was

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.380 
of view of the role-playing player I was
really<00:01:48.869> happy<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:50.130> entire<00:01:50.579> section<00:01:50.939> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
really happy that this entire section of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.530 
really happy that this entire section of
the<00:01:51.810> trip<00:01:52.140> was<00:01:52.470> completely<00:01:53.070> uneventful<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:54.360> I

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
the trip was completely uneventful if I

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.760 
the trip was completely uneventful if I
were<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.049> Patrol

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
were in a Patrol
