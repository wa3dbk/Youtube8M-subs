third key give it a snip right about
there<00:00:21.670> this<00:00:22.360> is<00:00:22.510> my<00:00:22.690> planet<00:00:23.110> wiggins<00:00:23.410> pro

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
there this is my planet wiggins pro

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.450 
there this is my planet wiggins pro
whiner<00:00:24.130> I<00:00:24.490> don't<00:00:25.090> leave<00:00:25.240> home<00:00:25.270> without<00:00:25.600> it<00:00:25.810> and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
whiner I don't leave home without it and

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.840 
whiner I don't leave home without it and
so<00:00:27.460> I<00:00:28.140> tilt<00:00:29.140> a<00:00:29.290> little<00:00:29.320> bit<00:00:29.710> here<00:00:30.070> so<00:00:30.100> maybe<00:00:30.640> get

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
so I tilt a little bit here so maybe get

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.670 
so I tilt a little bit here so maybe get
a<00:00:30.880> little<00:00:30.910> bit<00:00:31.120> better<00:00:31.240> angle<00:00:31.780> there's<00:00:32.439> that

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
a little bit better angle there's that

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.700 
a little bit better angle there's that
hole<00:00:33.010> right<00:00:33.430> in<00:00:33.489> there<00:00:33.879> and<00:00:34.260> string<00:00:35.260> goes<00:00:35.440> just

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
hole right in there and string goes just

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.490 
hole right in there and string goes just
sits<00:00:36.070> in<00:00:36.219> that<00:00:36.370> hole<00:00:37.050> now<00:00:38.050> give<00:00:38.200> it<00:00:38.290> a<00:00:38.350> real

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
sits in that hole now give it a real

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.989 
sits in that hole now give it a real
sharp<00:00:38.860> bend<00:00:39.160> across<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.149> edge<00:00:40.329> and<00:00:41.039> a<00:00:42.039> sharp

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:42.999 
sharp bend across the edge and a sharp

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:48.720 
sharp bend across the edge and a sharp
bend<00:00:43.239> around<00:00:43.539> the<00:00:43.899> tuner<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:48.190> those<00:00:48.399> two

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
bend around the tuner and those two

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:56.069 
bend around the tuner and those two
combined<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:51.039> a<00:00:51.070> pretty<00:00:51.370> good<00:00:51.579> job<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.780> again

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
combined to a pretty good job and again

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.950 
combined to a pretty good job and again
using<00:00:56.409> the<00:00:56.440> probe<00:00:56.710> winder<00:00:57.449> which<00:00:58.449> just<00:00:58.659> keeps

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
using the probe winder which just keeps

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.410 
using the probe winder which just keeps
it<00:00:59.760> honest<00:01:02.069> and<00:01:03.069> as<00:01:03.249> you<00:01:03.460> can<00:01:03.640> guess<00:01:03.670> makes<00:01:04.300> it

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
it honest and as you can guess makes it

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.910 
it honest and as you can guess makes it
a<00:01:04.449> little<00:01:04.540> much<00:01:04.780> faster<00:01:05.320> than<00:01:05.500> doing<00:01:05.770> it<00:01:05.800> by

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
a little much faster than doing it by

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.600 
a little much faster than doing it by
hand<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:07.270> I<00:01:07.390> can<00:01:07.570> do<00:01:07.720> it<00:01:07.840> by<00:01:08.020> hand<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:09.310> I<00:01:09.430> have

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
hand but I can do it by hand if I have

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:27.870 
hand but I can do it by hand if I have
to

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.109 

so<00:01:28.880> that's<00:01:29.950> how<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.100> goes<00:01:31.250> we'll<00:01:31.549> do<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.729> couple

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
so that's how it goes we'll do a couple

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.930 
so that's how it goes we'll do a couple
more<00:01:32.150> here<00:01:32.950> make<00:01:33.950> sure<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.220> had<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.400> plenty<00:01:34.820> of

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
more here make sure you had a plenty of

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.539 
more here make sure you had a plenty of
video<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.690> of<00:01:36.049> course<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:36.440> can<00:01:36.590> always<00:01:36.770> fast

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
video and of course you can always fast

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.210 
video and of course you can always fast
forward<00:01:38.030> slow<00:01:38.299> down<00:01:38.479> pause<00:01:39.229> make<00:01:39.950> sure<00:01:40.100> you

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
forward slow down pause make sure you

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.930 
forward slow down pause make sure you
get<00:01:40.369> to<00:01:40.520> what's<00:01:40.670> going<00:01:40.759> on<00:01:41.000> here<00:01:41.360> but<00:01:42.940> these

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
get to what's going on here but these

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.080 
get to what's going on here but these
are<00:01:44.090> good<00:01:44.270> techniques<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.930> have<00:01:45.700> so<00:01:46.700> if<00:01:46.909> you're

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
are good techniques to have so if you're

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.540 
are good techniques to have so if you're
at<00:01:47.210> a<00:01:47.240> show<00:01:47.540> you<00:01:48.170> break<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.500> string<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.950> get

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
at a show you break the string you get

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.789 
at a show you break the string you get
it<00:01:49.610> done<00:01:49.790> fast<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.570> in<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.080> way<00:01:51.259> that<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.619> won't

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
it done fast and in a way that it won't

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.370 
it done fast and in a way that it won't
slip<00:01:52.130> on<00:01:52.399> you<00:01:52.610> because<00:01:53.509> it's<00:01:53.720> terrible<00:01:54.229> a

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
slip on you because it's terrible a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.560 
slip on you because it's terrible a
string<00:01:54.830> slipping<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.490> show<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:59.270> better

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
string slipping in the show the better

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.230 
string slipping in the show the better
thing<00:01:59.840> to<00:01:59.869> do<00:02:00.369> not<00:02:01.369> just<00:02:01.610> because<00:02:01.700> I<00:02:01.910> happen<00:02:02.210> to

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
thing to do not just because I happen to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.139 
thing to do not just because I happen to
sell<00:02:02.539> guitars<00:02:03.220> I'd<00:02:04.220> love<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.429> sell<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.820> lots

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
thing on my stratocaster though I got

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.240 
thing on my stratocaster though I got
lazy<00:03:02.030> instead<00:03:02.780> of<00:03:02.930> dealing<00:03:03.410> with<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.799> stamped

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
lazy instead of dealing with the stamped

lazy instead of dealing with the stamped
bridge<00:03:04.549> pieces<00:03:04.910> about<00:03:05.350> graphite<00:03:06.350> once<00:03:06.650> and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
bridge pieces about graphite once and

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.800 
bridge pieces about graphite once and
yeah<00:03:07.670> it<00:03:07.790> changed<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.150> tone<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.450> little<00:03:08.510> bit

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
yeah it changed the tone a little bit

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.580 
yeah it changed the tone a little bit
but<00:03:09.019> boy<00:03:09.290> is<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.590> slick<00:03:10.010> it's<00:03:10.850> nice<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:12.380> there's

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
but boy is it slick it's nice so there's

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.349 
but boy is it slick it's nice so there's
always<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.920> solution<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:13.850> thing<00:03:14.060> but

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
always a solution to that thing but

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.050 
always a solution to that thing but
again<00:03:15.140> two<00:03:15.980> songs<00:03:16.250> oh<00:03:16.459> yeah<00:03:16.760> I'll<00:03:16.880> probably
