one<00:03:04.269> is<00:03:04.750> one<00:03:05.170> click<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.709> then<00:03:05.860> this<00:03:05.980> one<00:03:06.220> is

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
one is one click and then this one is

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.420 
one is one click and then this one is
for<00:03:07.410> remembering<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.650> wiring<00:03:08.980> like<00:03:09.160> years

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
for remembering the wiring like years

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.810 
for remembering the wiring like years
around<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.510> then<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:14.140> then<00:03:14.730> you're<00:03:15.730> gonna

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
around and then and then you're gonna

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.370 
around and then and then you're gonna
want<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.150> make<00:03:16.209> up<00:03:16.540> forward<00:03:17.100> 1210<00:03:18.100> right<00:03:18.310> here

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
want to make up forward 1210 right here

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.840 
want to make up forward 1210 right here
because<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.560> team<00:03:20.769> tonight<00:03:21.010> tend<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.700> go

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
because the team tonight tend to go

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.360 
because the team tonight tend to go
flatten<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.420> then<00:03:22.690> raise<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.560> up<00:03:23.680> bring<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.250> up

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
flatten it then raise it up bring it up

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:33.449 
flatten it then raise it up bring it up
two<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.910> then<00:03:31.150> your<00:03:31.920> twenty<00:03:32.920> cannon<00:03:33.310> was

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
two and then your twenty cannon was

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.410 
two and then your twenty cannon was
basically<00:03:33.880> done<00:03:35.040> that's<00:03:36.040> the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
basically done that's the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.559 
basically done that's the
a test<00:03:36.690> around<00:03:37.020> hopefully<00:03:41.180> reading<00:03:42.180> on<00:03:42.300> how

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
a test around hopefully reading on how

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.680 
a test around hopefully reading on how
far<00:03:42.930> away<00:03:43.080> your<00:03:43.530> target<00:03:43.980> is<00:03:44.330> is<00:03:45.330> basically

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
far away your target is is basically

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.809 
far away your target is is basically
almost<00:03:45.870> into<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.830> this<00:03:47.310> one<00:03:47.550> will<00:03:47.730> not

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
almost into you and this one will not

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:58.120 
almost into you and this one will not
and<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.450> much<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:49.140> but<00:03:49.200> I'll<00:03:49.709> just<00:03:49.890> go

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.570 

for<00:03:59.130> will<00:03:59.400> Hornet<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.120> then<00:04:01.110> go<00:04:01.410> in<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:02.160> then

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
for will Hornet and then go in and then

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.800 
for will Hornet and then go in and then
you<00:04:02.610> may<00:04:02.819> be<00:04:04.640> well<00:04:05.640> that's<00:04:06.030> basically<00:04:06.360> how<00:04:06.750> you

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
you may be well that's basically how you

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.870 
you may be well that's basically how you
make<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.620> works<00:04:07.890> really<00:04:08.130> well<00:04:08.250> if<00:04:08.610> there's

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
make it it works really well if there's

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.009 
make it it works really well if there's
more<00:04:09.060> than<00:04:09.120> one<00:04:09.390> layer<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:11.000> this<00:04:12.000> wall<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.959> you

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
more than one layer of this wall and you

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.320 
more than one layer of this wall and you
just<00:04:13.230> obviously<00:04:14.010> keep<00:04:14.430> on<00:04:14.610> launching<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.209> and

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
just obviously keep on launching it and

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.659 
just obviously keep on launching it and
launching<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.049> then<00:04:16.579> you<00:04:17.579> would

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
launching it and then you would

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.479 
launching it and then you would
eventually<00:04:17.940> get<00:04:18.299> in<00:04:18.450> and<00:04:18.989> it's<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.829> great<00:04:20.310> way

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
eventually get in and it's a great way

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.460 
eventually get in and it's a great way
to<00:04:20.519> raid<00:04:20.880> some<00:04:21.209> pretty<00:04:21.389> big<00:04:21.630> bases<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.260> most

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
to raid some pretty big bases the most

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.250 
to raid some pretty big bases the most
funny<00:04:23.040> one<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.639> richest<00:04:24.570> fraction<00:04:25.020> will<00:04:25.229> have

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
funny one the richest fraction will have

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.219 
funny one the richest fraction will have
faces<00:04:25.800> like<00:04:25.830> these<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.790> this<00:04:27.570> setup<00:04:27.840> really

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
faces like these and this setup really

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.280 
faces like these and this setup really
works<00:04:28.440> it's<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:28.979> lot<00:04:29.190> of<00:04:29.220> work<00:04:30.110> if<00:04:31.110> you're

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
works it's a lot of work if you're

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.800 
works it's a lot of work if you're
especially<00:04:31.590> new<00:04:32.040> to<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.340> kind<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.700> cannon<00:04:33.090> but

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
especially new to the kind of cannon but

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.730 
especially new to the kind of cannon but
it's<00:04:33.990> really<00:04:34.500> worth<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.950> and<00:04:35.220> it's<00:04:35.880> a<00:04:36.740> great

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
it's really worth it and it's a great

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.280 
it's really worth it and it's a great
way<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.010> get<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.479> and<00:04:39.479> this<00:04:39.660> is<00:04:39.870> not<00:04:40.080> my

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
way to get in and this is not my

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.580 
way to get in and this is not my
creation<00:04:40.919> is<00:04:41.600> something<00:04:42.600> I<00:04:42.870> saw<00:04:43.110> on<00:04:43.140> a<00:04:43.289> server

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
creation is something I saw on a server

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.320 
creation is something I saw on a server
while<00:04:44.130> I<00:04:44.160> was<00:04:44.280> waiting<00:04:44.430> with<00:04:44.700> one<00:04:44.910> of<00:04:45.060> my

section others she was using this method

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.279 
section others she was using this method
and<00:04:49.190> just<00:04:50.190> picked<00:04:50.550> it<00:04:50.640> up<00:04:50.760> and<00:04:51.000> just<00:04:51.900> argued

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
and just picked it up and just argued
