and apparently you know a lot of points

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.690 
and apparently you know a lot of points
they<00:01:06.930> don't<00:01:07.110> actually<00:01:07.350> determine<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.369> you

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
they don't actually determine so you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
they don't actually determine so you
guys<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.000> comments<00:01:09.210> section<00:01:09.390> below<00:01:09.750> for

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
guys in the comments section below for

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.230 
guys in the comments section below for
the<00:01:10.799> previous<00:01:10.979> video<00:01:11.340> we're<00:01:11.520> right<00:01:11.729> they

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the previous video we're right they

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.410 
the previous video we're right they
don't<00:01:12.390> actually<00:01:12.600> determine<00:01:13.290> your<00:01:13.530> league

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
don't actually determine your league

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.359 
don't actually determine your league
what<00:01:15.420> division<00:01:15.659> you're<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:17.130> could

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
what division you're in so you could

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.190 
what division you're in so you could
technically<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.909> number<00:01:18.420> one<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.659> platinum

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
technically be number one in platinum

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.770 
technically be number one in platinum
and<00:01:19.439> not<00:01:19.619> ever<00:01:19.979> get<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.430> masters<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.210> it's

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and not ever get to masters and so it's

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.580 
and not ever get to masters and so it's
just<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.140> way<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.290> them<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.729> points<00:01:24.590> in

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
just a way for them to you get points in

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.499 
just a way for them to you get points in
that<00:01:25.950> division<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.640> that'll<00:01:27.000> bump<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.299> up<00:01:27.330> in

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
that division and that'll bump you up in

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.390 
that division and that'll bump you up in
that<00:01:27.600> division<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.350> however<00:01:28.650> moving

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
that division but however moving

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.219 
that division but however moving
division<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.850> division<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.810> way<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.079> that

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
division to division the way you do that

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.170 
division to division the way you do that
is<00:01:31.290> basically<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.890> need<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.159> win<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.939> need<00:01:33.060> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
is basically you need to win you need to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.670 
is basically you need to win you need to
beat<00:01:33.299> players<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.869> are<00:01:33.960> better<00:01:34.110> than<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.439> or

beat players that are better than you or
higher<00:01:34.979> rank<00:01:35.280> than<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.820> my<00:01:36.329> mistake<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.869> was

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
higher rank than you so my mistake I was

them is a zombies map and then there's

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.330

really<00:02:35.520> cool<00:02:35.790> if<00:02:35.850> it's<00:02:36.180> like<00:02:36.420> battlefield

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
really cool if it's like battlefield

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.800 
really cool if it's like battlefield
where<00:02:37.740> they<00:02:37.830> basically<00:02:38.270> you<00:02:39.270> know<00:02:39.390> everybody

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.990 
who has the DLC will get to use that gun
and<00:02:43.320> then<00:02:43.560> everybody<00:02:44.250> who<00:02:44.490> doesn't<00:02:44.820> have<00:02:44.910> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.880 
and then everybody who doesn't have the
DLC<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.570> can<00:02:45.720> still<00:02:45.930> play<00:02:46.230> with<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.530> gun<00:02:46.680> we

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
DLC you can still play with the gun we

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.110 
DLC you can still play with the gun we
get<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.070> pick<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.340> up<00:02:47.460> so<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.700> think<00:02:47.940> that'd<00:02:48.030> be

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
get to pick it up so I think that'd be

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.970 
get to pick it up so I think that'd be
really<00:02:48.270> cool<00:02:48.360> if<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:49.230> true<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.800> not

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
really cool if it's true it's not

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.770 
really cool if it's true it's not
whatever<00:02:50.340> I'll<00:02:50.820> leave<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.030> link<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.570> down

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
whatever I'll leave a link to that down

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.030 
whatever I'll leave a link to that down
below<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:54.320> think<00:02:55.320> that'd<00:02:55.410> be<00:02:55.500> cool<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.890> think

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
below and I think that'd be cool I think

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.350 
below and I think that'd be cool I think
that's<00:02:56.130> like<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.400> next<00:02:56.670> step<00:02:56.850> with<00:02:56.970> call<00:02:57.150> duty

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
that's like the next step with call duty

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.810 
that's like the next step with call duty
because<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:58.410> know<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.740> think<00:02:59.040> most<00:02:59.550> people

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
because you know I think most people

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.350 
because you know I think most people
hate<00:03:00.050> what<00:03:01.050> DLC<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.590> right<00:03:02.100> most<00:03:02.940> people<00:03:03.180> who

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
hate what DLC is right most people who

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.020 
hate what DLC is right most people who
are<00:03:03.660> used<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.990> like<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.890> mass<00:03:05.070> effect<00:03:05.460> dlc<00:03:05.610> or

a<00:03:06.120> Skyrim<00:03:06.480> DLC<00:03:06.810> that's<00:03:07.020> actually<00:03:07.440> new<00:03:07.590> content

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
a Skyrim DLC that's actually new content

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.790 
a Skyrim DLC that's actually new content
but<00:03:08.700> then<00:03:08.850> when<00:03:09.060> developers<00:03:09.660> charge<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.440> for

cool<00:03:28.230> because<00:03:28.410> battlefield<00:03:28.860> does<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.100> right

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280
