I<00:00:24.330> suppose<00:00:25.330> when<00:00:25.570> we<00:00:25.720> when<00:00:26.109> we<00:00:26.140> design<00:00:26.529> a<00:00:26.560> dish

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
I suppose when we when we design a dish

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.519 
I suppose when we when we design a dish
with<00:00:28.750> any<00:00:29.109> fish<00:00:29.380> here<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.750> Irish<00:00:32.140> all<00:00:32.320> has<00:00:32.500> to

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
with any fish here the Irish all has to

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.630 
with any fish here the Irish all has to
be<00:00:32.680> fish<00:00:33.250> and<00:00:33.910> it<00:00:34.210> can<00:00:34.330> be<00:00:34.480> overpowered<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
be fish and it can be overpowered and

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.979 
be fish and it can be overpowered and
while<00:00:36.910> there's<00:00:37.089> a<00:00:37.150> lot<00:00:37.300> going<00:00:37.330> on<00:00:37.629> in<00:00:37.690> this

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
while there's a lot going on in this

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.850 
while there's a lot going on in this
dish<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.769> whole<00:00:38.980> idea<00:00:39.670> is<00:00:39.879> that<00:00:39.940> it<00:00:40.540> enhances

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
dish the whole idea is that it enhances
