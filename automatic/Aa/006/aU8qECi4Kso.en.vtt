00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.670
 Hello everyone, it's time to show 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.710
 you my solution to the riddle 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.900
 a bunch of blocks is shifted by three positions 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.549
 up as I said the problem was solved 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.830
 head on this decision turned out 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.810
 quite expensive not compact but 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.550
 it is very easy to remember but 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.260
 before we start want to draw 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.119
 attention to one moment past 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.070
 Maine versions are quite simple 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.230
 make a shift by two positions 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.750
 it's done like a red torch at level 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.000
 2 piston block above it and thus 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.160
 us whom cats advance and move in 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.140
 my schemes are based on this 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.809
 let's begin construction here we 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.610
 three rows on the pulley bottom 2 sticky top 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.860
 Of course there are ordinary sticky pistons 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.840
 just not needed because we are moving 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.850
 pucci and blocks begin building on 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.980
 level 3 row paving blocks 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.140
 retreat one block and one more 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.059
 the path of the blocks further set 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.370
 red torches here and us 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.320
 need a platform in two blocks 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.210
 this side respectively on this 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.280
 Site we install repeaters 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.619
 which will activate our torches 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.720
 this is our input line let's and immediately 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.520
 somewhere far we will deduce and we will put 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.799
 lever in principle to shift by three 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.689
 positions left , only the top 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.700
 pistons for this we do the following 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.369
 raise the track from the blocks still here 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.189
 here we put a row of red torches 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.590
 red torch and here and again the track from 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.900
 blocks at the level of the upper pistons 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.360
 all such is the secret inversion is obtained 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.860
 and this is a shift by three positions that is 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.020
 pistons push all 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.150
 however, as you can see , we still have 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.189
 here is this gap in order from 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.409
 get rid of him we need to file first 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.240
 short pulse to lower pistons afterwards 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.040
 on the top post will never be in this 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.439
 positions accordingly let's do this 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.780
 let's do for this we put a repeater here 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.149
 hereinafter sticky piston with the usual 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.850
 block either the usual porsche loose 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.009
 block then three blocks and 3 repeaters 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.170
 without delay now we need to file 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.490
 signal to our lower pistons for this 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.439
 again we put a repeater and 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.630
 pave the track of Rostov and 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.340
 place the block right here so our 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.259
 short you will pass down but 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.630
 it remains to do this 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.520
 a row went for this we put blocks over 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.009
 our repeaters are laying 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.470
 ration track 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.060
 a couple more blocks here repeat two 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.829
 delay click is the only one 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.110
 repeater which has a delay in 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.390
 this scheme and two more pieces of the diet 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.549
 Here is our scheme, in principle, let's 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.739
 probably put here a loose blocks for 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.650
 the purity of the experiment and check how it is 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.079
 working 3 rows of loose blocks push 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.390
 our blocks rise we press again 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.459
 and our blocks down as you can see circuit 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.010
 quite voluminous and costly 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.239
 resources but its very easy to remember in 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.250
 Anyway, I hope it is for you. 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.650
 I liked it and that's it for today 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.629
 thank you very much for your attention do not forget
