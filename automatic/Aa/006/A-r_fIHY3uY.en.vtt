00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.890

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.529
 I know we all want to show off 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.079
 Very nice legs for this season 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.390
 because we're going to be wearing short skirts 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.689
 dress and you can wear some legs 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.519
 nice it 's like it's fundamental but 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.739
 then you're going to be showing you 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.329
 long video how can they make 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.030
 They look nice but without having to spend 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.730
 a lot and with products that we have in 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.219
 our houses extremely economically and what 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.410
 better effective so good if you want 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.780
 know how to do or how to achieve 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.270
 Nice legs now in summer still 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.370
 watching the video 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.200
 Many of us know that coffee is a great 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.450
 stimulating and good for many of 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.540
 we are also essential in the 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.970
 mornings ok but also many maybe not 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.950
 They know that it is also a great stimulant 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.830
 when it comes to eliminating toxins and fats 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.650
 in the skin ok in a bowl we go 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.990
 then to join olive oil with the 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.729
 coffee and then we will not place them in 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.920
 the legs I prefer to do this guy 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.300
 of home remedies or this kind of 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.600
 activity outdoors first and 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.729
 enjoy summer and then this as 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.830
 we are using olive oil for 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.450
 that we're not going to slip in the bathroom 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.060
 or any other member of the family 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.180
 so it's going to slide then it's 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.490
 preferable to do it here outdoors and 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.390
 be of summer ok we are going then to 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.850
 give you movements is circular ok this 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.910
 I like it more is to use the eraser 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.610
 coffee or coffee that we have already used when 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.619
 already cold, then let's move it to 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.450
 a deep bowl like we did 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.420
 previously 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.030
 if you can if you notice this this 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.659
 coffee that we have already used tends to have 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.869
 as a tico store that is the one that is going to 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.899
 give wonders on the skin then good 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.659
 let's put it as I said already then 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.630
 be cold and we are going to add coffee 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.220
 that was also cold here nothing is 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.050
 lose all we go then 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.980
 to take advantage of 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.550
 In fact, this is also how you 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.820
 I said in the previous example we are going to 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.300
 our patio and we are going to place ourselves is 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:32.860
 let's say the coffee or the coffee eraser 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.530
 equally in circular movements 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.080
 and well, as I told you, enjoying this 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.730
 summer and enjoying the atmosphere and 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.710
 well you are going to see the difference 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.310
 immediately how beautiful they will be 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.310
 the legs 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.370
 something that I love to do unlocked 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.370
 what remedy 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.019
 but 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.390
 I love using caffeine in my 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.939
 home remedies because it activates the 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.700
 circulation and also leaves the skin very 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:07.640
 soft and very smooth and also with the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.890
 desired is the glow they call 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.049
 will choose the olive oil provided 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.829
 vitamin e as a consequence leaves the 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:18.739
 Soft and relaxed toned skin with a 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.209
 very nice texture and the best of everything is 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.040
 that moisturizes so good has 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.340

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.340
 touch of tan to your legs good 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.400
 put a little color with this 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.459
 you will be able to hide imperfections the 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.799
 cellulite and also the legs are going to 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.200

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.419

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.800
 favorite moisturizer and you add some 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:51.590
 droplets of liquid makeup base 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.750

 legs and if you want to give them a little 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.220
 more than glow then you can add 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.780
