00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello my dear viewer 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.099
 You are welcomed by a plumber and this 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.759
 a short video about the winners 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.830
 transfer this here to the 13th release by the way 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.829
 I am going to make this program on 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.630
 currently monthly well about this in 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.579
 late to start 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.680
 the fifth place is taken by the player who 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:36.510
 sent here this replay called 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.870
 the fate of the t-34 85 which which is visually 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.510
 demonstrates that you will not escape the fate 96 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.030
 man voted for him next 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.089
 Pulley 59 wherein taip 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.839
 leaves the frag completely unfamiliar 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.149
 ally 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.190
 ranked fourth but actually 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.800
 they shared fourth and fifth place by 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.890
 the way they both scored by 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.260
 96 votes only 1185 votes 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.030
 man and so well let's go on 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.350
 let's see who we are there winners 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.360
 we have three winners 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.149
 waffle-off who managed to chop 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.479
 8 thousand damage until the very end of the battle 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:22.759
 losing no unit of strength for it 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.759
 voted 136 people 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.930
 honestly i thought this replay will be 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.140
 at the first place 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.759
 242 people voted for him and this 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.030
 Bishop second place 12 frags most 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.899
 of which web this mode is just crazy 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.170
 and luck 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.939
 plus some skill plus opponents raki 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.549
 plus i don't know just some 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.289
 incredible coincidence 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.840
 which she is one in a million 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.579
 really 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.479
 Concerning the prize I want to say that 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.130
 each winner will receive 1000 gold but 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.469
 probably from the next transfer we 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.140
 let's begin to differentiate that is the fifth 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.789
 place less first place more well so 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.050
 it will probably still be fair 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.990
 because many 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.820
 about this began to resent that 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.560
 like 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.530
 Tops, that is, those who take the first 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.830
 second place will get exactly the same 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.530
 as those who will take 4 5 well so 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.120
 it was originally intended and there already 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.940
 fix well and of course first place 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.270
 undoubted our winner 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.710
 437 votes is over thirty percent 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.020
 voted who participated in 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.460
 voted for precisely 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.770
 him 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:45.240
 wins tiger 2 which closes itself 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:47.820
 shot ally on t-34 85 both of them 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.760
 here will play a significant role in the victory 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.430
 teams like a trifle like that but still 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.680
 really such a nice replay 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.170
 you will meet but not every day 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.690
 every day you meet is in the randomness 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.980
 there is immediately clear that the friend who has 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.590
 plays us on a tiger 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.510
 he will not pass by fallen in the street 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.770
 man, he will definitely help him 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.610
 everyone help regret it is a rarity in 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.640
 our times 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.239
 Well, from myself I want to add that the author of this 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.860
 replay 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.640
 that is, which here for three fours in 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.820
 He plays us. He wished that Goldov 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.360
 1000 gold premium went to him 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.030
 namely the royal tiger who is his 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.520
 here saved the matter is that according to the rules 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.180
 Transfer Gold gets one who replays 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.410
 sent 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.750
 but in this case we will make an exception 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.959
 regarding the future of this program, I want 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.000
 say a few words well firstly i would 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.690
 I wanted to change the output format a bit 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.030
 prize 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.180
 that is, for the first place let's say 2 1000 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:56.250
 gold 1000 gold for the second third and 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:59.070
 for 4 and 5 to 500 it would be honest further 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.200
 on whom this gold is issued now on 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.870
 This moment is issued to the one who sent 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.170
 replays and I want her to 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.620
 issued to someone who actually deserved 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.209
 here it is for example if here the tiger deserved 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.080
 then tiger and issue immediately and not 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.190
 ask the host for ripple 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.709
 who send gold like that so well and a couple 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.810
 problems problem of course 1 is very difficult 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.270
 select sensible replays because they send 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.140
 you understand everything for someone 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.000
 warrior take this great achievement for 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:35.320
 someone and the medal of the pool is so so so 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.420
 not particularly cool that's the most important thing 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.340
 selfish question I do not cooperate with 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.070
 wargaming no way with them 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.110
 cooperate in terms of 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.080
 penalties that is if someone is there 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.210
 someone broke something there very badly 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.600
 there for banning cheaters and so on in this 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.640
 plan with these people with those who 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.280
 hand out game gold I have no connection 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.340
 but then I am an independent author precisely 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.710
 Therefore, I want to attract sponsors 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.320
 the cost of one such movie 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.750
 5,000 gold is the prize plumber himself 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.910
 nothing is in my pocket 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.540
 I need already enough to 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.060
 will go out 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.210
