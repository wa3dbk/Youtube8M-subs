very<00:03:50.510> exact

it's<00:03:53.430> not

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:18.370 

I'll<00:04:00.129> get<00:04:00.610> a<00:04:00.640> close-up

I'm<00:04:19.160> working<00:04:19.520> on<00:04:19.610> this<00:04:19.760> project<00:04:20.110> using<00:04:21.110> a

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
I'm working on this project using a

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.970 
I'm working on this project using a
sketchup<00:04:22.190> plan<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:23.120> i<00:04:23.210> designed<00:04:23.860> with<00:04:24.860> the

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
sketchup plan that i designed with the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.120 
sketchup plan that i designed with the
help<00:04:25.190> of<00:04:25.490> Shopsmith<00:04:26.270> give<00:04:27.110> me<00:04:27.350> some<00:04:27.950> of<00:04:28.070> the

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
help of Shopsmith give me some of the

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.770 
help of Shopsmith give me some of the
dimensions<00:04:28.460> so<00:04:30.250> I'll<00:04:31.250> be<00:04:31.370> using<00:04:31.610> this<00:04:32.000> my

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
dimensions so I'll be using this my

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.960 
dimensions so I'll be using this my
design<00:04:33.140> -<00:04:34.000> or<00:04:35.000> my<00:04:35.480> version<00:04:35.750> of<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.110> design<00:04:36.970> to

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
design - or my version of the design to

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.500 
design - or my version of the design to
build<00:04:38.180> this<00:04:38.420> project<00:04:39.320> and<00:04:39.880> if<00:04:40.880> I<00:04:41.060> have<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.360> make
