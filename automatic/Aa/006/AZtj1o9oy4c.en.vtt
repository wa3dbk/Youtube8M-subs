00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hi I'm John Ricard today we're going to

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.309 
hi I'm John Ricard today we're going to
talk<00:00:02.190> about<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.520> Leica<00:00:02.730> m9<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.720> love<00:00:04.110> this

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
talk about the Leica m9 I love this

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.320 
talk about the Leica m9 I love this
camera<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:04.950> for<00:00:05.339> me<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:05.520> comes<00:00:05.640> down<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:06.120> two

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
camera and for me it comes down to two

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.240 
camera and for me it comes down to two
things<00:00:06.359> something<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.379> call<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.620> usability

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
things something I call the usability

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.060 
things something I call the usability
factor<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.170> I'm<00:00:10.170> not<00:00:10.380> sure<00:00:10.500> what<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.740> call<00:00:10.889> the

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
factor and I'm not sure what to call the

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.520 
factor and I'm not sure what to call the
second<00:00:11.429> one<00:00:11.519> but<00:00:11.639> maybe<00:00:11.849> it's<00:00:12.090> how<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.019> camera

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
second one but maybe it's how the camera

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.829 
second one but maybe it's how the camera
gives<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.920> focus<00:00:14.610> okay<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.420> let<00:00:15.570> me<00:00:15.599> explain

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
gives you a focus okay so let me explain

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.720 
gives you a focus okay so let me explain
those<00:00:16.080> two<00:00:16.260> things<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:16.980> terms<00:00:17.520> of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
those two things so in terms of

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.400 
those two things so in terms of
usability<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:18.990> something<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.380> think

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
usability this is something I think

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.740 
usability this is something I think
people<00:00:19.710> really<00:00:20.340> overlook<00:00:21.029> when<00:00:21.630> they're

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
people really overlook when they're

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.480 
people really overlook when they're
trying<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.020> evaluate<00:00:22.619> different<00:00:22.650> products

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
trying to evaluate different products

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.859 
trying to evaluate different products
like<00:00:23.519> if<00:00:23.760> they're<00:00:23.880> trying<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.119> evaluate<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
like if they're trying to evaluate a

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.160 
like if they're trying to evaluate a
laptop<00:00:25.800> versus<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.670> an<00:00:26.930> iPad

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
laptop versus on an iPad

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.439 
laptop versus on an iPad
they're<00:00:28.590> looking<00:00:28.949> at<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.160> list<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.699> specs<00:00:30.090> and

of hard drive and they're kind of

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.850

important so when we're talking about a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.330 
important so when we're talking about a
camera<00:00:42.210> well<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:43.050> do<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.230> really<00:00:43.590> use<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.309> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
camera what do I really adjust when I'm

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.830 
camera what do I really adjust when I'm
shooting<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.370> me<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.789> adjust<00:00:48.300> my<00:00:48.390> shutter

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
shooting for me I adjust my shutter

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.310 
shooting for me I adjust my shutter
often<00:00:49.440> my<00:00:49.890> aperture<00:00:50.399> my<00:00:51.300> white<00:00:51.600> balance<00:00:52.199> and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
often my aperture my white balance and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.160 
often my aperture my white balance and
my<00:00:52.710> ISO<00:00:53.340> let's<00:00:54.120> look<00:00:54.329> at<00:00:54.420> how<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> Leica<00:00:54.870> m9

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
my ISO let's look at how the Leica m9

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.200 
my ISO let's look at how the Leica m9
handles<00:00:55.829> those<00:00:55.980> things<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.489> my<00:00:56.640> aperture<00:00:57.090> is

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
handles those things so my aperture is

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.090 
handles those things so my aperture is
on<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> ring<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.680> always

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
on a ring right here it's always

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
on a ring right here it's always
available<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.910> me<00:01:00.180> because<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.690> manual

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
available to me because it's a manual

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.380 
available to me because it's a manual
focus<00:01:01.469> camera<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.579> hand<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.969> always<00:01:03.270> going

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
focus camera so one hand is always going

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.270 
focus camera so one hand is always going
to<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.539> right<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:03.989> focusing<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.129> when<00:01:05.250> I

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
to be right here focusing and when I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.010 
to be right here focusing and when I
need<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.519> adjust<00:01:05.729> my<00:01:05.970> aperture<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.810> slide

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
need to adjust my aperture I just slide

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.990 
need to adjust my aperture I just slide
this<00:01:07.229> forward<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.799> here's<00:01:08.100> my<00:01:08.280> adjustment<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
this forward and here's my adjustment I

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.149 
this forward and here's my adjustment I
change<00:01:09.930> my<00:01:10.080> shutter<00:01:10.260> speed<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.650> lot<00:01:10.860> okay

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
change my shutter speed a lot okay

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.890 
change my shutter speed a lot okay
there's<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.430> dial<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.909> top<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.390> shutter<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
there's a dial on top for shutter and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.080 
there's a dial on top for shutter and
that's<00:01:13.500> very<00:01:13.770> easy<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.220> understand<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.060> very

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
that's very easy to understand it's very

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.820 
that's very easy to understand it's very
easy<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.630> me<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:16.380> shutter<00:01:16.650> is

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
easy for me to see what my shutter is

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.200 
easy for me to see what my shutter is
set<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.490> very<00:01:17.610> easy<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.090> me<00:01:18.150> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
set on and it's very easy for me to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.929 
set on and it's very easy for me to
adjust<00:01:18.770> ISO<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.979> another<00:01:20.220> thing<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.490> change<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
adjust ISO is another thing I change a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.969 
adjust ISO is another thing I change a
lot<00:01:21.119> because<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.960> I'm<00:01:22.290> shooting<00:01:22.560> let's<00:01:22.830> say

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
lot because if I'm shooting let's say

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.620 
lot because if I'm shooting let's say
I'm<00:01:23.070> taking<00:01:23.250> some<00:01:23.520> pictures<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.420> train

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
I'm taking some pictures in in the train

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.460 
I'm taking some pictures in in the train
station<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.290> might<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.890> at<00:01:26.009> ISO<00:01:26.490> 1600<00:01:26.970> ISO<00:01:27.689> 2000

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
station I might be at ISO 1600 ISO 2000

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.109 
station I might be at ISO 1600 ISO 2000
then<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.890> walk<00:01:29.130> out<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.490> train<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
then I walk out of the train I'm on the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.030 
then I walk out of the train I'm on the
street<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:30.990> I'm<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> change<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> 100

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
street now I'm going to change it to 100

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.719 
street now I'm going to change it to 100
then<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.729> walk<00:01:32.939> into<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.270> store<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.869> change<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.619> to

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
then I walk into a store I change it to

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.780 
then I walk into a store I change it to
1250<00:01:35.729> or<00:01:35.759> 800<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.509> changed<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> iso<00:01:37.680> 10<00:01:38.340> times<00:01:38.610> a

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
1250 or 800 I changed the iso 10 times a

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.340 
1250 or 800 I changed the iso 10 times a
day<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:39.090> I'm<00:01:39.210> walking<00:01:39.450> around<00:01:39.780> shooting<00:01:40.049> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
day if I'm walking around shooting and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.069 
day if I'm walking around shooting and
on<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> m9<00:01:41.400> I've<00:01:41.700> got<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> button<00:01:42.210> dedicated<00:01:42.930> to

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
on the m9 I've got a button dedicated to

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.100 
on the m9 I've got a button dedicated to
ISO<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:44.040> touch<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.610> button<00:01:44.640> here<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.329> I

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
ISO I just touch the button here and I

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.190 
ISO I just touch the button here and I
can<00:01:46.290> roll<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.340> change<00:01:47.610> my<00:01:47.790> ISO<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:49.020> it's

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
can roll this to change my ISO so it's

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.679 
can roll this to change my ISO so it's
very<00:01:49.530> very<00:01:49.890> simple<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.490> change<00:01:50.670> ISO<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
very very simple to change ISO and the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.749 
very very simple to change ISO and the
last<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.710> would<00:01:52.829> probably<00:01:53.040> change<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.640> my

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
last one I would probably change is my

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.789 
last one I would probably change is my
white<00:01:53.970> balance<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.720> because<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.590> way<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
white balance and because of the way the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.859 
white balance and because of the way the
menu<00:01:56.040> system<00:01:56.280> works<00:01:56.640> if<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.969> leave<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.540> white

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
menu system works if I leave it on white

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.600 
menu system works if I leave it on white
balance<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.469> next<00:01:58.710> time<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.860> push<00:01:59.159> my<00:01:59.369> set

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
balance the next time I push my set

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.480 
balance the next time I push my set
button<00:01:59.880> here's<00:02:00.630> my<00:02:00.810> white<00:02:01.020> balance<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.979> can

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
button here's my white balance and I can

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.719 
button here's my white balance and I can
just<00:02:02.700> change<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.890> whatever<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.430> want

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
just change it here to whatever I want

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.930 
just change it here to whatever I want
to<00:02:05.820> change<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.119> wipe<00:02:06.270> white<00:02:06.810> balance<00:02:07.170> too<00:02:07.380> so

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
to change the wipe white balance too so

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.550 
to change the wipe white balance too so
this<00:02:08.940> camera<00:02:09.330> becomes<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.899> great<00:02:10.140> camera<00:02:10.530> to

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
this camera becomes a great camera to

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.950 
this camera becomes a great camera to
use<00:02:10.950> because<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.849> controls<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.420> need
