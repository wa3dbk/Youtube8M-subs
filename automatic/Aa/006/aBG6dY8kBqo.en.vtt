00:00:06.454 --> 00:00:10.854
Hello, today I would like to show you how to make sweet and sour pork

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.020
Prepare 2 pork ribs

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.040
About half a catty (750 grams) in weight

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.713
First of all, we need to marinate the ribs

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.960
with soy sauce,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.440
a little bit of sugar

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.640
Corn flour and sesame oil

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.460
Marinate for about half an hour

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.174
Then we need to chop up half an onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:34.973
And in the centre, some shredded pickled ginger

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.940
We can also use pineapple chunks

00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:45.234
We also need vinegar, ground pepper, tomato ketchup, tomato puree

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.280
and some oil

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.340
For the batter, we need 2 tablespoon of plain flour

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.676
2 tablespoon of corn flour, and 1 tablespoon of starch

00:00:55.676 --> 00:00:57.756
and mix them all up in a bowl 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.220
For the sauce, we have

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.360
4 tablespoon of white vinegar, 3 tablespoon of sugar

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.200
and 2 tablespoon of tomato ketchup

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.440
2 tablespoon of pineapple juice

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.020
Ok, we have marinated the pork ribs for half an hour

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.180
First of all, we put the chopped rib into a bowl of beaten eggs

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.800
then we place it into a bowl of the batter mix

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.915
mix it well

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.940
then we place the rib into the bowl of beaten egg again

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.320
then we place it again into the bowl of batter mix

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.980
then it is ready for deep frying

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:48.255
Now, we can start frying the pork ribs

00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:51.828
Fill the pan with cooking oil

00:01:51.828 --> 00:01:53.734
We can test the temperature of the oil

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:55.120
by placing a chopstick into the pan

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.509
If there are bubbles around the chopstick, then we know the oil is ready for frying

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.380
We can put the pork in

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.100
Medium low heat

00:02:10.253 --> 00:02:12.733
Medium low heat is perfect for frying

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.280
Now the pork is almost ready

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:24.173
If we want to know if the pork is cooked, you can use a cocktail stick

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.980
to pierce the pork

00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:32.753
the pork is ready if you feel that the stick can easily pierce the pork, and the pork is firm

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.680
At this stage, we need to set the hob to high heat

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.460
to get the excess oil out of the batter

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.700
You can hear the crisp, crackling sound

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.640
then we know the pork is definitely ready

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.271
Don't let the batter turn into dark brown

00:03:02.271 --> 00:03:07.351
because the pork will still be cooking after it is taken out from the pan with the remaining heat

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.760
Add some oil into another pan

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:27.780
We now fry the vegetables.  We have added some shredded pickled ginger and onion

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.940
Now we add in the green bell pepper, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper

00:03:34.582 --> 00:03:35.762
fry well

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.940
Some salt

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.600
pineapple

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.540
They are ready, place them onto a plate for later

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.220
Now we can put in 2 teaspoon of tomato puree

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:03.449
Low heat

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:07.369
Then we can put the sauce into the pan

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:11.600
The sauce is nearly ready.  Lots of bubbles

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.120
Add the pork back into the pan

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.360
now we put in the vegetables

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.040
Add in a few drizzle of sesame oil, to bring out the flavour

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.840
If you don't like sesame oil, you can omit it. 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.200
But if you put in some oil, this will give the dish a glow

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.720
Ok, turn the heat off

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.320
Sweet and sour pork is now ready, it's delicious.  Please try it at home

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.040
Of course it is sour
