00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.050
 convertible 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.950
 family of the big bikes we go 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.440
 they fillet 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.660
 can process it in cavities with the salon 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.199
 weathered piece and the fillet completely 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.199
 pickup, fetch 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.949
 we are going to start revealing the 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.509
 is at the head 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.769
 then use my veneer mass for nothing 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.390
 we're going to pay attention that we never don't like it 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.279
 sharp jug but especially the blunt side 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.800
 we use our space 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.250
 45 degrees and we are going to van bol van de 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.839
 tailpiece after the head work in short 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.470
 movements 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:45.559
 so completely softly above ours 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.120
 cabrio is completely our script 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.640
 cutting the seven away if necessary 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.149
 when we fillet the cabrio what that 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.149
 go off anyway 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.500
 profiling we go I the skin 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.200
 cross section cannot have the brute force on it 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.620
 sit right with the point of mine is it 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.710
 sheet 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.590
 by quick thanks to the tail that 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.750
 there is nicely made in time 10 and then can 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.820
 I start nicely filleting we start too 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:23.320
 Half way back along the goes in 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:25.770
 sitting in the middle half way through my big one 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.520
 one can go about furniture in the middle 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.520
 and war average 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.570
 until I am for you 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.310
 the first piece removed then go 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.350
 we go then head section we go 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.190
 even the work to the minute 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.040
 the piece has underwater head 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.740
 to go to another to cut away 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.800
 as short as possible behind that for as many 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.280
 possible to preserve fish meat 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.580
 here you have the last grade we are 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.170
 have fallen to the tombs 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.640
 never cut with the most 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.420
 but we hear that too much force 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.070
 have to set up 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.070
 I 'm going to do that with the big fish cooked 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.080
 until halfway through limburg until the end of 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.950
 the working height there I can last 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.950
 cut away nicely 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.640
 she's meat is cut off and you see through 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.990
 miss 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.030
 We have set standards as good as 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.140
 he no fish meat that lingers on 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.430
 the bone 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.380
 the other temporary you perfect on 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.360
 filleting the same way now we go 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.870
 move on to such a filet that is beautiful 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.870
 on the choice 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.950
 we are going to start with the belly side 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.420
 I will do the belly side through my knife 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.660
 to put under the threads and to raise 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.660
 to cut 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.519
 beautiful 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.200
 political as soon as they get full grains I 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.260
 with my knife against the bowl of water 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.760
 above fast and that is also for so much 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.690
 possible 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.690
 to get fichiers 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.319
 so i know hard to make that 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.569
 This is actually the first bones 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.230
 the old folks certainly hang the arrow 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.620
 mountains 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.620
 cut away 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.250
 the fillet is now completely cleaned up and is 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.329
 ready to be washed in 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.329
 be portioned 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:43.600
 why start with 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:45.970
 along the crater real snow and on your 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.950
 gently press against those for free 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.670
 if you press it gently then you lose 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.380
 you again have little change until 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.330
 about the very last degree 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.330
 today and I knew the cut 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.870
 The first piece that can removed 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.700
 to order the cod fillet that is 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.709
 also the most beautiful parts last piece 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.810
 that we cut off is the van that we 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:14.050
 start tracking for the belly piece 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.640
 our first part of the tail piece is how 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.030
 to continue the postscript the first rocky 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.330
 do is with the last piece i can do that 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.690
 a piece of bright cutting to beautiful 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:30.340
 while cutting that in my little one 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:33.160
 make a small incision that has arisen 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.320
 piece then portioning it is broke 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.480
 piece but to the free pick up 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.070
 the skin and fleece and then that can be used 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.169
 be burned perpetrators on an a4 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.010
 garnish for the fish smoothly along the 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.010
 degree also cut back 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.700
 to remove the skin 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:06.840
 small settings but miss on 45 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:09.900
 degrees so that it fields beautiful 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.670
 fish and then just the membrane 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.380
 take away 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:19.140
 just the same them cyper no so fine 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:22.860
 grazing again and we can 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.750
 use for brand offenders who are flexible or 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.000
 of course there not dirty horse so see 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.440
 you think it is for a fish 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.550
 cod and whole to do inside 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.410
 filleting for life 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.410
 because you can work on abs completely
