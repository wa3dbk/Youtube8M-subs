 Well, I already have the ground corn 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:13.040
 Now let's add a teaspoon of 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.040
 royal or baking powder 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.950
 let's add a little salt 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.699
 with that enough 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.320
 and what has been two bars of 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.320
 Butter 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.320
 melted 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.690
 and we are going to see all 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.850
 now 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.030

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.320

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.320
 we mix well 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.460
 and this paste is what we are going to put in 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.460
 our leaves 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.820
 this is enough 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.820
 we decorate it 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.620
 and inwards and we're going to put them 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.650
 our steamer for an hour and 15 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.650
 minutes
