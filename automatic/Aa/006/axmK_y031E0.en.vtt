00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:50.649
 find the differences between the original and these 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.089
 copies is not difficult if 

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:54.299
 sold in the details that most line 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.159
 here it is in general inaccurately copied

 guest workers for the Russians can do 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:15.689
 everything is even conceptual 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.569

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:28.229
 and even artists agree project 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:30.109
 interesting because once again convinced in 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.519
 need some capital 1 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.929

 offer to repeat any canvas 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.119
 Artemyev for six months cards 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.619

 in St. Petersburg, while asking the price 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.330
 get used to the idea that if you need
