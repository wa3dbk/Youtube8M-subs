00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
because that would just be a lie but it

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.140 
because that would just be a lie but it
we<00:01:26.260> feel<00:01:26.470> it's<00:01:26.590> wrong<00:01:26.800> to<00:01:27.100> arbitrarily<00:01:27.760> say

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
we feel it's wrong to arbitrarily say

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.300 
we feel it's wrong to arbitrarily say
that<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.750> twelve-year-old<00:01:29.500> can<00:01:29.830> enter<00:01:30.220> this

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
with an adult then it just creates this

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.930 
with an adult then it just creates this
whole<00:03:28.410> environment<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.860> equality<00:03:30.190> in<00:03:30.550> every

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
whole environment of equality in every

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.900 
whole environment of equality in every
way<00:03:31.500> it's<00:03:32.500> amazing<00:03:33.300> because<00:03:34.300> little<00:03:34.840> kids<00:03:34.930> are

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
way it's amazing because little kids are

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.949 
way it's amazing because little kids are
interacting<00:03:37.110> although<00:03:38.110> people<00:03:38.560> so<00:03:38.950> much<00:03:39.160> they
