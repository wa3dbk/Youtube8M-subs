00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.490
 hello friends cards 5 serious deals yo 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.630
 I bring a life for the channel and the day 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.429
 today to teach how to put the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.130
 helicopter the skyline in the version 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.430
 1.12 is worth in the content creator 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.380
 that as before you know you have not 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.810
 tried before it was done with a ship of 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.160
 candle is worth here like that I'm filling 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.260
 all the fields of the mission we 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.420
 This happened quickly and now I explain how 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.369
 this boat is taken out good this boat 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.020
 forgive this helicopter in the latter 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.030
 version instead of that the sailing ship 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.180
 is this this is called bing and it's worth 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.860
 that is a boat those inflatables but 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.420
 as you can see there are two models one that has 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.969
 four seats and one that has two 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.950
 seats then the one that will take us out 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.840
 sky live is the one with two seats 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.940
 We put in the sea we give it twice to 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.039
 the X and as you see is changed 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.170
 automatically by the skyline and good 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.289
 You can put it anywhere you want and 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.930
 others as I repeat this before it was done 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.520
 with the sailboat but now no longer 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.690
 I know if it is because they will have patched it 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.400
 I dont know 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.280
 is that I have no idea what it is that 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.590
 they will have done with them and well then 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.990
 also tell you that if you take for 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.360
 chance is because I tell you what 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.340
 you are going to see it quickly if you see 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.100
 that you take the boat since I 've 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.960
 said that it has 22 places will go out 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.790
 a normal helicopter that is going to 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.860
 leave this that is the good one that 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.590
 we want from dragonfly helicopter like 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.409
 he usually calls me and well then 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.530
 you can put it in your games in 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.479
 your maps that you invent what 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.860
 you think I do not know that anymore in the utility that 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.619

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.780
 your games are going to taste each 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.580
 one and in the imagination that I have 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.220

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.560
