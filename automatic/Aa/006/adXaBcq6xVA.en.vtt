okay<00:00:00.780> I've<00:00:00.989> gotten<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.290> few<00:00:01.319> requests<00:00:01.979> recently

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
okay I've gotten a few requests recently

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.249 
okay I've gotten a few requests recently
to<00:00:02.580> do<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.730> video<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.210> my<00:00:03.360> entire<00:00:03.629> fire<00:00:03.959> alarm

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
to do a video of my entire fire alarm

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.690 
to do a video of my entire fire alarm
collection<00:00:04.740> and<00:00:04.950> I've<00:00:05.040> also<00:00:05.190> gotten<00:00:05.549> some

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
collection and I've also gotten some

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.190 
collection and I've also gotten some
requests<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.150> do<00:00:06.270> video<00:00:06.509> where<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:06.750> pull<00:00:07.020> and

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
requests to do video where I pull and

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.680 
requests to do video where I pull and
reset<00:00:07.620> all<00:00:07.799> my<00:00:07.980> pull<00:00:08.220> stations<00:00:08.730> so<00:00:09.420> this<00:00:09.599> is

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
reset all my pull stations so this is

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.180 
reset all my pull stations so this is
going<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.900> kind<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.139> be<00:00:10.230> both<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.590> those<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.950> one

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
going to kind of be both of those in one

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.310 
going to kind of be both of those in one
I've<00:00:11.759> gotten<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.030> bunch<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.330> devices<00:00:12.509> lately<00:00:13.110> so

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
I've gotten a bunch of devices lately so

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.589 
I've gotten a bunch of devices lately so
I<00:00:13.349> figured<00:00:13.590> I'd<00:00:13.679> do<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:13.920> video<00:00:14.099> right<00:00:14.490> now<00:00:14.700> so

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
I figured I'd do this video right now so

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.689 
I figured I'd do this video right now so
I'm<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.800> try<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.070> remember<00:00:17.430> all<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
I'm going to try to remember all the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.160 
I'm going to try to remember all the
model<00:00:17.970> numbers<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.359> these<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.750> may<00:00:18.869> forget

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
model numbers of these I may forget

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.300 
model numbers of these I may forget
because<00:00:19.289> there's<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.560> lot<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.830> stuff<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.279> I

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
because there's a lot of stuff so I

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.130 
because there's a lot of stuff so I
guess<00:00:20.609> I'll<00:00:20.760> just<00:00:20.789> start<00:00:21.060> at<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.180> top<00:00:21.420> with

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
guess I'll just start at the top with

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.560 
guess I'll just start at the top with
the<00:00:22.289> coded<00:00:22.590> pull<00:00:22.740> stations<00:00:23.220> right<00:00:24.180> here<00:00:24.420> we

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the coded pull stations right here we

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.929 
the coded pull stations right here we
have<00:00:24.750> an<00:00:24.869> old<00:00:25.019> Holtz<00:00:25.830> or<00:00:25.980> Cabot<00:00:26.400> coded<00:00:26.760> pull

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
have an old Holtz or Cabot coded pull

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.650 
have an old Holtz or Cabot coded pull
station<00:00:27.330> from<00:00:27.680> 1936<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:29.279> does<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.580> code<00:00:29.789> 164

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
station from 1936 it does the code 164

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.410 
station from 1936 it does the code 164
I'm<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.890> go<00:00:31.980> ahead<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.279> pull<00:00:32.430> this

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.729 

right<00:00:36.420> here<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> similar<00:00:37.140> one<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
right here we have a similar one this is

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.220 
right here we have a similar one this is
a<00:00:37.800> Faraday<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:39.000> coded<00:00:39.329> pull<00:00:39.480> station<00:00:39.960> or<00:00:40.110> when

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
a Faraday on coded pull station or when

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.299 
a Faraday on coded pull station or when
this<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.649> made<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.129> one's

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
this one is made but this one's

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.110 
this one is made but this one's
different<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> inside<00:00:46.489> over<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:47.969> we

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
different on the inside over here we

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.630 
different on the inside over here we
have<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> couch<00:00:48.539> f5g<00:00:49.440> X<00:00:49.590> non-coated<00:00:50.309> hole

I'm going to ship to alarm 77 776 this
afternoon<00:04:27.639> and<00:04:27.760> I<00:04:27.789> just<00:04:27.940> figured<00:04:28.120> I'd<00:04:28.240> put<00:04:28.840> it

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
afternoon and I just figured I'd put it

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.439 
afternoon and I just figured I'd put it
in<00:04:29.020> here<00:04:29.169> for<00:04:29.289> this<00:04:29.409> video<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:31.210> there<00:04:31.330> it's

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
in here for this video and there it's

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.290 
in here for this video and there it's
pulled<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:31.990> you<00:04:32.380> can<00:04:32.500> reset<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:33.090> like<00:04:34.090> this

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
pulled and you can reset it like this

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.650 
pulled and you can reset it like this
with<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:34.750> screw

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.610 

and<00:04:38.320> it<00:04:38.650> just<00:04:39.040> goes<00:04:39.250> like<00:04:39.430> that<00:04:39.910> here<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:40.960> an<00:04:41.140> mg

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
and it just goes like that here is an mg

inside is already melted which means

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.060 
inside is already melted which means
it's<00:05:04.780> pretty<00:05:05.020> much<00:05:05.140> useless<00:05:05.350> now<00:05:05.740> it's
