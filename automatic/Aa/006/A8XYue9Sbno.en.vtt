00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.840
 so this day compared to this 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.850
 filming that was needed for a little 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:18.960
 calypso the return we had decided to 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:20.310
 make a plan of 5 6 7 8 start again name 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.230
 of sequence shot of ten speed riding 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.940
 it is a plan we had planned to do 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.070
 but it is not planned to film 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.140
 speed riding from Mont Blanc with 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.820
 if speed rail out in front of you of my 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.140
 time it is not expected at the beginning what 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.399
 do a sequence shot at the beginning it can 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.199
 to be a broad shot that would allow me 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.059
 after purging tight shots in 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.649
 to make a sequence and that is to adhere 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.069
 that when they left the second 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.510
 duty to be water and the unfolding of 

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:44.879
 plan was done a little bit everything 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.199
 alone and what makes the end certainly 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.010
 with a ten-minute sequence shot that 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.379
 does not really have that they can 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.789
 hijack at the start and when I 'm not going 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.219
 in the machine how much are you at 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.960
 work in the machine we are 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.510
 three there are two pilots of course pascal 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.710
 brown there is an operator who operates the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.389
 camera that is under the chopper that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.879
 is called cineplex the cameras that have 

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:04.799
 regained remote controlled by joystick and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.899
 ya - who runs a little there the operation 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.520
 is so do not plan to plan to be 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.170
 as long because in general when 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.180
 robbery like that there are tonelico people 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.680
 who steals a pilot pole is very 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.729
 delicate is dangerous for all 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.990
 world ie it must be done 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.360
 be careful, it's not someone who can 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.550
 enter the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.820
 in the surface of your bed that you need 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.260
 be attentive to what is happening in 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.920
 we had very little sense to do 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.630
 for a long time we have taken to the game 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.830
 like that it's gone realized 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.930
 that it was well worth it that we did not have my 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.430
 word of the riddle is so this island so 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.050
 of coordination sort of ballet between 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.910
 the people who were in the air who them 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.380
 had a line that determined in you 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.750
 of my time that was in front of density 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.030
 it's antoine amount 10 to the line of 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.650
 5 other speed riders followed and we 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.050
 slip on lap it's a shame to tell 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.670
 pascal most right lane left I 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.860
 also directed the technician with his 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.440
 little fads the zoom out so 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.520
 it was a kind of ballet like that 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.810
 nothing during July that was enough 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.330
 exceptional we were very lucky 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.020
 by the way because that's his coordinates 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.030
 it was chained 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.290
 sometimes, despite ourselves, there are 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.390
 moments when we are lucky in the 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.350
 cinema are not all languages indeed 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.100
 what because she sees the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.170
 paragliders or not or so he 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.700
 just enough haste and indications because 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.810
 that she does not go paragliders months 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.260
 two months in front of me I have a big screen 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.100
 of control that shows what must 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.209
 to be a film train with his 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.080
 joysticks and tourist is not it 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.209
 it says nothing because at will 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.489
 pilots and he sees the paragliders 600 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.050
 departures in the speed rider if they are 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.770
 to know everything to his left and start 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.010
 north above 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.840
 he 's not going and only sees if he brakes 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.720
 and who gets overtaken so in general 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.100
 less than ten years ago when for example 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.430
 at a given moment where the guys he's leaving on 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.630
 left 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.010
 and there he is doomed again to see 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.510
 ten weeks on them there is one missing 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.700
 squat he will miss me behind who will me 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.230
 asks to go to the net or because he 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.660
 can not engage him a little dry turn 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.940
 at risk van persie so would you and a 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.640
 real security work that to do in 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.420
 real time and brief, that's enough 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.470
 pointed 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.459
 when we will be close to people it is to 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.150
 these points only because these pagans 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.870
 imminent danger turn e what is 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.340
 represents for you this plan today 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.600
 for me this plan that was made Thursday is going 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.890
 not died by chance this is a 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.269
 sequence of good circumstances 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.040
 first because the guys who were worth 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.970
 in the air was very coordinated it's up to 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.799
 say at any time there are some who 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.840
 goes on and there are big ones too 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.489
 speed riding is obvious they have good 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.380
 carried out their flight ie they are 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.420
 remained grouped behind antoine which 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.280
 is not obvious 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.230
 to hide error in this round 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.640
 it's a sequence shot like that for me 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.959
 it's just historic since you 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.120
 can look for plants even in the 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.380
 feature film shots of ten 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.200
 minutes that hold from beginning to end 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.420
 it's very rare to be air to very little 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.190
 because precisely there is I think we 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.780
 could have if we had decided to do it 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.290
 before it comes true a little 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.700
 himself 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.830
 we could have done without times without 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.720
 succeed there is still well shot 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.700
 of huge luck to a coordination of 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.110
 all that makes it work and also it 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.360
 were not in front of the pickups were 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.819
 because they are full of parameters 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.860
 that we did not manage who put themselves in 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.220
 synthesis of the same so it's a for me 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.569
 it's a plan - the filmography to me 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.010
 for a certain history for myself 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.840
 because that's all very very beautiful 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.810
 we are in the middle of the mountain damage is going 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.799
 very well oxidizes a certain big 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.799
 poetry at the cinema level
