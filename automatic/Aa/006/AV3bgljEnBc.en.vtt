00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.460 
splitboard together these actually have
a<00:01:56.170> back<00:01:56.470> country<00:01:56.770> specific<00:01:57.670> soul<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.200> this<00:01:59.349> is

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
a back country specific soul so this is

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.130 
a back country specific soul so this is
a<00:01:59.500> Vibram<00:01:59.950> outsole<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:01.270> like<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.420> burly<00:02:01.869> hiker

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
a Vibram outsole just like a burly hiker

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.219 
a Vibram outsole just like a burly hiker
it's<00:02:02.679> got<00:02:02.830> great<00:02:03.039> traction<00:02:03.690> it's<00:02:04.690> definitely

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
it's got great traction it's definitely

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.719 
it's got great traction it's definitely
going<00:02:05.349> to<00:02:05.410> be<00:02:05.530> strong<00:02:06.099> enough<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.610> withstand

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
going to be strong enough to withstand

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.150 
going to be strong enough to withstand
steep<00:02:07.569> terrain<00:02:07.959> you<00:02:08.530> can<00:02:08.679> actually<00:02:08.950> put<00:02:09.130> a

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
steep terrain you can actually put a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.830 
steep terrain you can actually put a
crampon<00:02:09.580> on<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.880> bottom<00:02:10.179> of<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:10.630> if<00:02:10.720> you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
crampon on the bottom of it so if you

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.630 
crampon on the bottom of it so if you
want<00:02:11.020> a<00:02:11.140> mountaineer<00:02:11.770> up<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.160> section<00:02:12.370> where

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
want a mountaineer up a section where

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.940 
want a mountaineer up a section where
the<00:02:12.700> splitboard<00:02:13.180> can't<00:02:13.719> quite<00:02:13.959> ascend<00:02:14.409> you

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
the splitboard can't quite ascend you

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.670 
the splitboard can't quite ascend you
can<00:02:15.159> hike<00:02:15.760> up<00:02:15.969> with<00:02:16.150> these<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:17.049> then<00:02:17.319> put<00:02:17.650> your

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
can hike up with these and then put your

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.200 
can hike up with these and then put your
splitboard<00:02:18.159> together<00:02:18.489> put<00:02:18.819> your<00:02:18.969> by

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
splitboard together put your by

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.430 
splitboard together put your by
innings<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:19.570> just<00:02:19.990> like<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.260> would<00:02:20.380> a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
innings on just like you would a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.800 
innings on just like you would a
snowboard<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.130> there<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.940> go<00:02:21.970> ready<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.660> go

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
snowboard and there you go ready to go

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.450 
snowboard and there you go ready to go
down<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.590> obviously<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:24.190> get<00:02:24.310> up<00:02:24.430> there

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
down and obviously you get up there

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.910 
down and obviously you get up there
using<00:02:24.910> these<00:02:25.000> skins<00:02:25.330> right<00:02:26.020> so<00:02:26.320> these<00:02:26.500> skins

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
using these skins right so these skins

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.950 
using these skins right so these skins
are<00:02:27.100> mohair<00:02:27.550> skins<00:02:27.940> from<00:02:28.180> gecko<00:02:28.690> they're

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
are mohair skins from gecko they're

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.590 
are mohair skins from gecko they're
actually<00:02:29.380> snowboard<00:02:29.920> specific<00:02:30.610> one<00:02:31.270> of<00:02:31.450> the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
actually snowboard specific one of the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.750 
actually snowboard specific one of the
few<00:02:31.900> out<00:02:32.080> there<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:32.620> they're<00:02:32.860> wide<00:02:33.160> enough<00:02:33.490> to

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
few out there so they're wide enough to

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.400 
few out there so they're wide enough to
fit<00:02:34.750> these<00:02:35.760> different<00:02:36.760> planks<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.630> they<00:02:38.260> have

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
fit these different planks and they have

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.110 
fit these different planks and they have
a<00:02:38.440> little<00:02:38.650> roughness<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.310> them<00:02:39.460> as<00:02:39.610> any<00:02:39.760> skin

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
a little roughness to them as any skin

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.970 
a little roughness to them as any skin
does<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:40.600> have<00:02:40.780> traction<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.380> walk<00:02:41.620> up<00:02:41.860> the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
does so you have traction to walk up the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.100 
does so you have traction to walk up the
hill<00:02:42.030> these<00:02:43.030> are<00:02:43.180> also<00:02:43.300> cool<00:02:43.630> because<00:02:43.870> they

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
hill these are also cool because they

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.050 
hill these are also cool because they
have<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.350> silicone<00:02:44.740> adhesive<00:02:45.010> as<00:02:45.520> opposed<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:46.030> a

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
have a silicone adhesive as opposed to a

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.620 
have a silicone adhesive as opposed to a
glue<00:02:46.560> doesn't<00:02:47.560> sound<00:02:47.920> very<00:02:48.040> cool<00:02:48.630> doesn't

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
glue doesn't sound very cool doesn't

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.900 
glue doesn't sound very cool doesn't
sound<00:02:49.750> very<00:02:49.900> simply<00:02:50.470> but<00:02:50.710> what's<00:02:51.640> cool<00:02:51.850> about

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
sound very simply but what's cool about

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.700 
sound very simply but what's cool about
it<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.300> if<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.570> get<00:02:52.660> dog<00:02:52.960> hair<00:02:53.260> in<00:02:53.290> them<00:02:53.500> if<00:02:53.620> you

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
it is if you get dog hair in them if you

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.440 
it is if you get dog hair in them if you
get<00:02:53.860> pine<00:02:54.310> cones<00:02:54.580> in<00:02:54.790> them<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.150> just<00:02:55.300> take

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
get pine cones in them you can just take

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.090 
get pine cones in them you can just take
them<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.230> sink<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.710> rinse<00:02:56.890> it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
them to the to the sink and rinse it

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.580 
them to the to the sink and rinse it
right<00:02:57.250> off<00:02:57.400> perfect<00:02:57.970> yeah<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.660> polls<00:02:59.140> polls
