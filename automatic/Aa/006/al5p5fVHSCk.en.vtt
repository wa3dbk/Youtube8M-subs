00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.980
 good afternoon with you olga kanunnikova and 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.340
 today I will show you one more small 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.809
 but very effective way of grouping 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.029
 using the iron we know the way cold 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.490
 corrugation but cold corrugation is not 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.480
 every fabric and doesn't give in very well 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.820
 processing 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.590
 for this you can use a good iron 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.579
 do the same thing as in cold 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.040
 corrugation that is, we take a piece of this 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.160
 a certain fabric in this case to me awning 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.980
 handkerchief take in our petal which 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.250
 need for corrugated and his my 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.440
 fold in half put here on 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.629
 corner 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.219
 also like a cold crinkle but instead 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:56.070
 arms using leaks we put the iron like 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.160
 times here by the middle here are the bases 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.190
 petals here we put its edge just on 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.390
 petal our iron 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.229
 I have a steam iron with a steam side 1 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:16.229
 1 and that's just like when cold 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:20.070
 shirring we bring the edge of the scarf sharply 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.189
 on like one side to the other 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.200
 we get in so we corrugate 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:31.820
 petal parts show another jet census 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.820
 here we fold it in half 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.730
 all round 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.920
 vitek 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.640
 so we did it here when 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:59.750
 the edges are not very well processed 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:04.840
 need to repeat again anyway 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:10.340
 hot crinkle she much 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:13.010
 more effective than the cold see right now I 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.510
 show here the leaves that are made 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.510
 bitterness corrugation 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:30.459
 here let's say this leaf that I 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.800
 after the shirring a little hands 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.520
 so stretched 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.520
 tips 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.330
 the rest when washing can again also 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.420
 you can even stretch the edge 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.920
 slightly pull it like this and have 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.260
 collects ready flower 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.950
 Thank you for your attention was a duck 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.950
