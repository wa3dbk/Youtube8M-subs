00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.200
 a game of worries 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:28.420
 that they are called wasabi that's why 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:32.689

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.980
 to 6 players 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.890
 the game lasts about 20 minutes from 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.320

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:21.229
 rule of the game and the cards almost the 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:25.390
 more important on the side so there you 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.550

 in the rules of the game we are 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.870

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.270
 players at the start 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.630
 so you can on the d isly at a 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.740
 phase where azzabi did 3 3 against the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.200

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:07.090
