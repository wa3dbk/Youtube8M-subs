you<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> little<00:00:47.250> bit<00:00:47.489> careful<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
you have to be a little bit careful and

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.569 
you have to be a little bit careful and
stir<00:00:48.600> them<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.930> lot<00:00:49.110> otherwise<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:50.010> tend<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
stir them a lot otherwise they tend to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.639 
stir them a lot otherwise they tend to
burn<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.149> same<00:00:51.390> with<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.780> sesame<00:00:52.140> seeds<00:00:54.649> when

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
burn the same with the sesame seeds when

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.139 
burn the same with the sesame seeds when
they're<00:00:55.829> nice<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.070> brown<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.460> set<00:00:56.910> them<00:00:57.030> aside

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
they're nice and brown I set them aside

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.920 
they're nice and brown I set them aside
and<00:00:57.329> they<00:00:57.809> cool<00:00:58.050> off<00:00:58.309> next<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.750> peel<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> garlic

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and they cool off next I peel the garlic

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.850 
and they cool off next I peel the garlic
I've<00:01:01.649> got<00:01:01.980> rather<00:01:02.160> big<00:01:02.489> cloves<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.300> time<00:01:03.860> not

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
I've got rather big cloves this time not

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.580 
I've got rather big cloves this time not
quite<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.489> usual<00:01:05.790> fare<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.590> but

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
quite the usual fare that I have but

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.469 
quite the usual fare that I have but
that<00:01:07.710> makes<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.070> much<00:01:08.490> easier<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.970> peel<00:01:09.330> them

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that makes it much easier to peel them

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.750 
that makes it much easier to peel them
and<00:01:11.960> working<00:01:13.040> less<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.400> kitchen<00:01:14.700> is

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and working less and the kitchen is

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.810 
and working less and the kitchen is
always<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.210> good<00:01:15.450> idea<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.720> cut<00:01:18.720> them<00:01:18.900> into

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
always a good idea and I cut them into

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.060 
always a good idea and I cut them into
fine<00:01:20.820> slices

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.040 

so<00:01:27.070> you<00:01:27.130> see<00:01:27.370> this<00:01:27.520> is<00:01:27.760> nothing<00:01:28.750> for<00:01:28.930> people

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
so you see this is nothing for people

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.470 
so you see this is nothing for people
who<00:01:29.290> don't<00:01:29.410> like<00:01:29.560> garlic<00:01:29.950> because<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.850> lot<00:01:31.450> of

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480

garlic<00:01:31.840> is<00:01:31.930> added<00:01:32.230> and<00:01:32.410> decides<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.250> leaves

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
garlic is added and decides to leaves

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.260 
garlic is added and decides to leaves
garlic<00:01:34.180> is<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.390> one<00:01:34.720> ingredient<00:01:34.870> that<00:01:35.500> always

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270

is served

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.610 
is served
garlic<00:01:40.300> tends<00:01:40.510> to<00:01:40.660> stick<00:01:40.930> together<00:01:41.110> when<00:01:41.500> you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
garlic tends to stick together when you

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.370 
garlic tends to stick together when you
fry<00:01:41.860> it<00:01:41.890> so<00:01:42.460> again<00:01:42.910> a<00:01:43.150> lot<00:01:43.330> of<00:01:43.360> stirring<00:01:44.080> until
