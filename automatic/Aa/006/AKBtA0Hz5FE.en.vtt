00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.840
 such 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.759
 the shorts disappeared after her departure 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.610
 cried after she left better 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.380
 whether it will be in all kind of tired 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.840
 why would someone be behind the project 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.579
 she carried in general it was necessary to come and 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.450
 if you have already met your love 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:13.150
 who left coughing and who doesn't 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.090
 it is a pity that she left but I did leave 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.120
 I was not so we could not be friends 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:24.549
 to believe that she was walking and so without her cant 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.049
 well we looked at the interview with 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.120
 remaining participants 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.970
 on the monster project bachelor and 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.160
 most girls and you 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.870
 good opinion that is, you were able to 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.450
 manifest on the project as kind and 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.000
 responsive person but why is it not 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.280
 he estimated the 100 bachelor 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.410
 Well, to be honest, we talked once 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.500
 so I can't do anything about him either 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.660
 say no good and bad well me 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.420
 it seems that he just realized that I did not 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:59.560
 interesting as men to what power led 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:03.110
 yourself absolutely not interested in 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.630
 relationship girl yes I noticed it too 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.840
 she looked past him as if 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.490
 I do not agree with the experts the girl can 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.240
 only behave this way because of your 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.650
 modesty 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.870
 but what does our psychoanalyst say 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.930
 all the analysis there is such a thing as 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.540
 simulated indifference do not know where it was 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.960
 fake or not but bachelor right away 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.970
 I realized that they were walking in it 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.570
 uninterested and we have about it 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.900
 the plot well and let's see why ashley 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:39.200
 by earl vdalat understand not in our 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.010
 the conversation that I was not interested in her she led 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.270
 yourself too arrogant and indifferent 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.180
 that is, are there any other girls 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.770
 tried not like it went even 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.020
 did not try to pretend that she 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.750
 interested in talking every kind 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.090
 showed that she was bored with me that is 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.310
 if elad is guilty that expelled himself 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.910
 bachelor sensitive i was with him 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.290
 bored because my heart is already taken 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.470
 whether then these projects to occupy 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.420
 bills a place if you're already in love i think 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.959
 what is worth well at least on TV 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.709
 will show 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.959
 and let's ask our viewers here 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.049
 instead of ashley l and i went but by 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.330
 rules can not i think that she has a 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.940
 solid there is a chance that 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:26.360
 bachelor like and more than that 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.220
 the guy behind the project was our opinion 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.160
 viewers can you tell us 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.220
 who owns your heart I think you 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.890

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.760
 cupid yes indeed he is to me 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.100
 It refers both to a friend, or can be so 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.870
 say like a sister 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.419
 but I will try to change it 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:52.430

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:55.240

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.770
 I saw you so beautiful 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.479
 psychoanalysis there is such a thing that a friend 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.479
 numbers does not turn into a loved one 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.970
