158 gear set Jeff what can he tell us
about<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.030> why<00:00:12.240> do<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.450> racers<00:00:12.750> like<00:00:12.990> it

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
about this why do the racers like it

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.959 
about this why do the racers like it
bitches<00:00:13.769> like<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.070> because<00:00:14.429> there's<00:00:14.610> nothing

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
bitches like it because there's nothing

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.790 
bitches like it because there's nothing
like<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.120> out<00:00:15.480> there<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> industry<00:00:16.560> our

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
like it out there in the industry our

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.279 
like it out there in the industry our

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
about their in the industry the gear

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.560 
about their in the industry the gear
sets<00:00:22.500> are<00:00:22.710> especially<00:00:23.010> our<00:00:23.279> 158th<00:00:23.910> are

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
sets are especially our 158th are

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.740 
sets are especially our 158th are
designed<00:00:25.289> more<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:25.939> cars<00:00:26.939> with<00:00:27.300> power

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
designed more for cars with power

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.250 
designed more for cars with power

additives nitrous blowers turbos the
gizmos<00:00:31.650> software<00:00:32.130> launch<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> car<00:00:33.360> can

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
gizmos software launch so the car can

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.450 
gizmos software launch so the car can
actually<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.840> more<00:00:34.079> consistent<00:00:34.530> when<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.340> goes

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
actually be more consistent when it goes

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.270 
actually be more consistent when it goes
for<00:00:35.760> second<00:00:36.120> gear<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.989> high<00:00:37.140> gear<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
for second gear the high gear and the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.549 
for second gear the high gear and the
car<00:00:38.489> actually<00:00:38.760> won't<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> pot<00:00:39.690> or<00:00:40.050> keep

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
car actually won't get the pot or keep

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.520 
car actually won't get the pot or keep
the<00:00:40.680> engine<00:00:40.980> as<00:00:41.129> peak<00:00:41.430> power<00:00:42.239> bass<00:00:42.570> yeah<00:00:43.260> you

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the engine as peak power bass yeah you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.869 
the engine as peak power bass yeah you
mentioned<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.920> softer<00:00:44.280> launch<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.760> that's

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
mentioned a softer launch and that's

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.479 
mentioned a softer launch and that's
really<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.450> does<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.860> lower

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
really what this does it's a lower

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.340 
really what this does it's a lower
numerical<00:00:48.090> ratio<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.690> takes<00:00:48.899> away<00:00:49.050> some<00:00:49.320> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
numerical ratio that takes away some of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.869 
numerical ratio that takes away some of
the<00:00:49.469> torque<00:00:49.710> multiplication<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> launch

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the torque multiplication on the launch

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
the torque multiplication on the launch
and<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.780> one<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> reasons<00:00:52.410> why<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> lot

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
and this is one of the reasons why a lot

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.319 
and this is one of the reasons why a lot
of<00:00:52.860> racers<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.430> converting<00:00:53.820> away<00:00:54.000> from<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
of racers are converting away from the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.750 
of racers are converting away from the
power<00:00:54.539> glide<00:00:54.809> over<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> turbo<00:00:55.620> 400<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.610> get

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
power glide over to the turbo 400 to get

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.000 
power glide over to the turbo 400 to get
that<00:00:56.940> second<00:00:57.329> gear<00:00:57.449> ratio<00:00:57.899> launch<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that second gear ratio launch it's a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.099 
that second gear ratio launch it's a
little<00:00:59.190> softer<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> tires<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.359> you're

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
little softer on the tires and you're

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.810 
little softer on the tires and you're
not<00:01:01.230> gonna<00:01:01.379> lift<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> tires<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.430> front<00:01:02.460> tire

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
not gonna lift the tires the front tire

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.579 
not gonna lift the tires the front tire
so<00:01:03.090> much

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
so much

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.390 
so much
so<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> 158<00:01:05.880> ratio<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.950> unique<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.220> power

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
so the 158 ratio is unique for the power

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
so the 158 ratio is unique for the power
glide<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.880> gives<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.180> those<00:01:09.299> ratio<00:01:09.750> option

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
glide it gives you those ratio option

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.020 
glide it gives you those ratio option
options<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.130> don't<00:01:11.280> need<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> convert<00:01:11.880> to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
options and you don't need to convert to

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.960 
options and you don't need to convert to
a<00:01:12.060> turbo<00:01:12.420> 400<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.590> softer<00:01:14.010> launch<00:01:14.220> so

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
a turbo 400 they have a softer launch so

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.609 
a turbo 400 they have a softer launch so
it's<00:01:15.240> been<00:01:15.420> an<00:01:15.509> exciting<00:01:15.570> new<00:01:16.020> product<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.560> us
