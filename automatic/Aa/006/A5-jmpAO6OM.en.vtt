00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.839
 hello one more time in this video I'm going to 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.849
 show you how to make a series of 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.950
 General facial massages to improve 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.570
 the quality of your skin and / or soil 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.210
 perform them before going to sleep after 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.310
 have applied my creams 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.619
 If you notice the discomfort when you feel the skin 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.570
 pain or some kind of worship can 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.519
 indicate that you have an infection in that 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.809
 case you perform in a massage and 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.059
 go to your doctor to make you a 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.890
 valuation in the same way you never do 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.870
 massages upwards or in the 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.880
 neck or in the face and neither do you 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.350
 lateral push-ups in the neck 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.950
 let's start doing the 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.950
 muscle stretch 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.820
 we rotate the head to the side and with 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.650
 the hand on the same side we will support it 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.520
 our chin that hand will help us 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.520
 to make an extension 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.600
 at the same time that we descend the name of the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.600
 opposite side 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.390
 we will hold in this position of 20 or 30 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.480
 seconds and we will do the same in the other 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.190
 side 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.810
 now let's stretch the whole part 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.970
 previous making the extension of 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.890
 neck 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.250
 for this exercise we have to maintain 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.250
 Mouth closed 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.580
 we hold 20 to 30 seconds too 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.180
 now with the back of the hand we are going to 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.180
 smooth the skin of the neck 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.369
 always with a very light pressure and with 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.369
 descending movements 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.830
 we do 5 repetitions with each step 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.810
 next we analyze in the part 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.170
 lower jaw in movements 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.170
 outward 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.670
 and we again smooth the skin of the neck 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.300
 now with my fingers in v I'm going out 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.730
 around the angle of the jaw 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.730
 reaching up to the ears and going down 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.490
 we go to the lips we are going to focus 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.320
 in the upper part 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.760
 with two fingers we read the stack towards 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.760
 outside and down towards the chin 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.120
 and now with the fingers we hold the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.770
 commissures and we do a stretch of 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.770
 the musculature with the help of the tongue 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.900
 on the sides of the nose we stretch 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.340
 slightly skin with fingers in vy 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.020
 with the tip of the index finger 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.770
 we make transversal frictions on 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.770
 the line of expression 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.860
 we repeat on the other side 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.330
 when we are skin down by 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.330
 front and back 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.739
 and then massaging the ears 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.790
 in the eyes we begin by analyzing the 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:25.210
 skin from the sides towards the 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.210
 ears 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.730
 Now we put these three fingers together and let's go 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.730
 to close the eyelids 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.880
 let's make a slight pressure that goes 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.050
 to start in the lacrimal and that is going to 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.050
 finish on the outside 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.470
 we ended up doing it again 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.690
 and going down to the neck 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.890
 we put our fingers again in v 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.450
 stretching bhatti lightly and we're going to 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.170
 make transverse movements with the 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.170
 fingertip of the index finger 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.960
 we go to the front we are drawing the 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.229
 top of the eyebrows with 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.229
 fingers 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.580
 in this area of ​​the forehead we will make a 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.930
 Massage a little deeper to relax 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.930
 plus the musculature of this area 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.729
 and now to end this routine from 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.990
 the forehead we are going to leave the skin towards 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.990
