00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.840 
can see the legends class figures are
going<00:00:54.319> to<00:00:54.409> be<00:00:54.530> somewhere<00:00:54.979> between<00:00:55.190> a

figure<00:01:19.130> just<00:01:19.430> looks<00:01:19.670> pretty<00:01:20.180> good<00:01:20.479> in<00:01:20.840> robot

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
figure just looks pretty good in robot

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:21.760

blaze master on the other hand looks

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.459 
blaze master on the other hand looks
terrible<00:01:24.920> in<00:01:25.789> in<00:01:26.090> robot<00:01:26.600> mode<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:27.020> just<00:01:27.350> look

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
terrible in in robot mode you just look

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:28.450 
terrible in in robot mode you just look
so<00:01:27.710> stupid

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
so stupid

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.600 
so stupid
I<00:01:29.200> really<00:01:30.200> don't<00:01:30.350> care<00:01:30.500> for<00:01:30.710> him<00:01:31.070> in<00:01:31.250> robot

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
I really don't care for him in robot

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
pretty much a stand up and do one thing

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.469 
pretty much a stand up and do one thing
type<00:01:37.039> of<00:01:37.869> transformation<00:01:38.869> he<00:01:39.649> is<00:01:39.770> packaged<00:01:40.250> in

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
type of transformation he is packaged in

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.080 
type of transformation he is packaged in
helicopter<00:01:41.479> mode<00:01:41.659> which<00:01:41.990> is<00:01:42.609> all<00:01:43.609> you<00:01:43.820> do<00:01:43.969> is

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
helicopter mode which is all you do is

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.910 
helicopter mode which is all you do is
fold<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:44.509> head<00:01:44.689> down<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:44.930> flip<00:01:45.469> out<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.619> tail

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
fold the head down to flip out the tail

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.859 
fold the head down to flip out the tail
and<00:01:46.130> fold<00:01:46.369> this<00:01:46.549> little<00:01:47.030> mini<00:01:47.240> gun<00:01:47.450> out<00:01:47.659> and

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
and fold this little mini gun out and

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.590 
and fold this little mini gun out and
that's<00:01:48.320> it<00:01:48.560> that's<00:01:48.799> his<00:01:49.070> transformation<00:01:49.609> now

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
that's it that's his transformation now

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.690 
that's it that's his transformation now
he<00:01:50.659> does<00:01:50.929> have<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.380> target<00:01:51.859> master<00:01:52.219> mode<00:01:52.399> which

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
he does have a target master mode which

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.410 
he does have a target master mode which
to<00:01:53.329> do<00:01:53.570> that<00:01:53.810> what<00:01:54.049> I<00:01:54.079> like<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.530> do<00:01:54.679> is<00:01:55.240> kind<00:01:56.240> of

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
to do that what I like to do is kind of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.889 
to do that what I like to do is kind of
first<00:01:57.409> pull<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.310> rotors<00:01:58.640> off<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.630> rotors

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
first pull the rotors off so the rotors

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.099 
first pull the rotors off so the rotors
are<00:02:00.049> detachable<00:02:00.590> then<00:02:01.570> take<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.689> feet<00:02:02.899> get

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
are detachable then take the feet get

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.289 
are detachable then take the feet get
your<00:02:03.259> thumb<00:02:03.439> at<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.649> feet<00:02:03.859> and<00:02:04.039> push<00:02:04.579> up<00:02:04.850> and

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
your thumb at the feet and push up and

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.630 
your thumb at the feet and push up and
that<00:02:05.960> will<00:02:06.170> start<00:02:06.499> the<00:02:06.649> transformation<00:02:06.770> so

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
that will start the transformation so

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.639 
that will start the transformation so
when<00:02:07.789> you<00:02:07.880> push<00:02:08.090> up<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:09.289> will<00:02:09.410> start

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
when you push up that that will start

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.530 
when you push up that that will start
the<00:02:09.740> transformation<00:02:09.860> then<00:02:10.550> fold<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.090> tail<00:02:11.330> up

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
the transformation then fold the tail up

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.100 
the transformation then fold the tail up
into<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.989> body<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.470> fold<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.659> minigun<00:02:14.720> down

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
into the body and fold the minigun down

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.930 
into the body and fold the minigun down
and<00:02:15.530> then<00:02:15.680> complete<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.220> transformation

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
and then complete the transformation

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.540 
and then complete the transformation
and<00:02:17.660> he<00:02:17.900> turns<00:02:18.170> into<00:02:18.530> this<00:02:18.830> cool<00:02:19.250> little

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
and he turns into this cool little

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.480 
and he turns into this cool little
cannon<00:02:20.090> now<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.540> like<00:02:21.110> this<00:02:21.320> gun<00:02:21.890> mode<00:02:22.130> much

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
cannon now I like this gun mode much

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.160 
cannon now I like this gun mode much
better<00:02:22.790> than<00:02:23.060> rollers<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.720> think<00:02:23.930> it's<00:02:24.020> much

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
better than rollers I think it's much

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.020 
better than rollers I think it's much
more<00:02:24.230> compact<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.040> much<00:02:25.160> more<00:02:25.310> concise<00:02:25.790> and

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
more compact and much more concise and

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.790 
more compact and much more concise and
it<00:02:26.450> looks<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:27.170> lot<00:02:27.410> better

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
it looks a lot better

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.830 
it looks a lot better
as<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.490> can<00:02:28.580> see<00:02:28.790> blaze<00:02:29.120> master<00:02:29.540> combined

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
as you can see blaze master combined

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.990 
as you can see blaze master combined
with<00:02:30.020> bumblebee<00:02:30.320> works<00:02:30.680> pretty<00:02:31.070> well<00:02:31.220> there

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
with bumblebee works pretty well there

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.900 
with bumblebee works pretty well there
is<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.870> weird<00:02:33.350> issue<00:02:33.770> where<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.310> peg<00:02:34.640> is

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
is a weird issue where the peg is

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.560 
is a weird issue where the peg is
actually<00:02:35.690> just<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.620> little<00:02:37.160> bit<00:02:37.310> too<00:02:37.550> small<00:02:37.910> for

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
actually just a little bit too small for

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.890 
actually just a little bit too small for
the<00:02:38.660> hands<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:39.440> when<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:40.220> slides<00:02:40.670> right<00:02:40.820> in<00:02:41.180> but

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
the hands so when it slides right in but

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.400 
the hands so when it slides right in but
it<00:02:42.020> wiggles<00:02:42.410> about<00:02:42.710> pretty<00:02:43.310> easily<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:43.940> mean<00:02:44.150> if

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
it wiggles about pretty easily I mean if

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.080 
it wiggles about pretty easily I mean if
you<00:02:45.410> could<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:45.710> slide<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.190> in<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.430> out<00:02:46.550> very

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
you could just slide it in and out very

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.050 
you could just slide it in and out very
easily<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:48.080> little<00:02:48.770> bit<00:02:48.860> too<00:02:49.250> easily

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
easily a little bit too easily

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.360 
easily a little bit too easily
another<00:02:50.630> nice<00:02:50.840> addition<00:02:51.320> is<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.070> blades

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
another nice addition is that the blades

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.250 
another nice addition is that the blades
from<00:02:52.880> his<00:02:53.060> helicopter<00:02:53.240> mode<00:02:53.720> attached<00:02:54.050> to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
from his helicopter mode attached to

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.820 
from his helicopter mode attached to
bumblebees<00:02:54.680> arm<00:02:54.920> or<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:57.140> can<00:02:57.290> attach<00:02:57.590> the

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
bumblebees arm or you can attach the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.060 
bumblebees arm or you can attach the
blades<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.640> this<00:02:58.790> peg<00:02:59.090> hole<00:02:59.330> in<00:02:59.570> his<00:02:59.840> back<00:03:00.200> so

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
blades to this peg hole in his back so

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.470 
blades to this peg hole in his back so
you<00:03:01.130> get<00:03:01.400> an<00:03:01.700> action<00:03:02.390> master<00:03:02.870> esque<00:03:04.480> action

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
you get an action master esque action

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.020 
you get an action master esque action
master<00:03:05.810> ask<00:03:05.990> helicopter<00:03:06.650> mode<00:03:06.770> going<00:03:07.070> a<00:03:07.310> very

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
master ask helicopter mode going a very

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.660 
master ask helicopter mode going a very
nice<00:03:08.390> nod<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.320> original<00:03:09.350> action<00:03:10.040> master

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
nice nod to the original action master

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.330 
nice nod to the original action master
figure<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.120> like<00:03:11.360> that<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:11.600> lot<00:03:12.340> bumblebees

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
figure I like that a lot bumblebees

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.830 
figure I like that a lot bumblebees
transformation<00:03:14.060> is<00:03:14.210> significantly

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
transformation is significantly

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.440 
transformation is significantly
different<00:03:15.260> from<00:03:15.350> primes<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:16.220> in<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:17.030> good<00:03:17.270> way

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
different from primes and in a good way

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.330 
different from primes and in a good way
I<00:03:17.720> actually<00:03:18.080> find<00:03:18.470> this<00:03:18.590> transformation<00:03:19.250> to

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
I actually find this transformation to

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.770 
I actually find this transformation to
be<00:03:19.460> a<00:03:19.490> little<00:03:19.760> bit<00:03:19.910> more<00:03:20.030> satisfying<00:03:20.600> than

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
be a little bit more satisfying than

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.690 
be a little bit more satisfying than
Prime's<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.709> start<00:03:21.980> we're<00:03:22.190> going<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.370> take<00:03:22.580> the

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
Prime's to start we're going to take the

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.960 
Prime's to start we're going to take the
hands<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.530> straighten<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.590> arms<00:03:24.860> out<00:03:25.040> take

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
hands and straighten the arms out take

hands and straighten the arms out take
the<00:03:26.120> hands<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.660> fold<00:03:27.170> them<00:03:27.500> down<00:03:27.850> about

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
the hands and fold them down about

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.570 
the hands and fold them down about
halfway<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.860> before<00:03:30.860> you<00:03:30.980> fold<00:03:31.130> them<00:03:31.310> up<00:03:31.400> into

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
halfway and before you fold them up into

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.100 
halfway and before you fold them up into
the<00:03:31.700> forearms<00:03:32.209> actually<00:03:32.630> take<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.930> outer

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
the forearms actually take the outer

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.250 
the forearms actually take the outer
forearm<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:33.920> fold<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.340> all<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:35.150> way<00:03:35.270> out<00:03:35.450> so

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
forearm and fold that all the way out so

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.000 
forearm and fold that all the way out so
on<00:03:36.650> this<00:03:36.890> side<00:03:37.150> fold<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.420> hand<00:03:38.660> up<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.560> flip

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
on this side fold the hand up and flip

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.740 
on this side fold the hand up and flip
the<00:03:40.130> other<00:03:40.340> forearm<00:03:41.000> all<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.510> way<00:03:41.600> out<00:03:41.720> like

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
the other forearm all the way out like

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.120 
the other forearm all the way out like
that<00:03:42.110> then<00:03:42.950> unpack<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.120> back<00:03:44.620> pack<00:03:45.620> from<00:03:46.070> the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
that then unpack the back pack from the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.320 
that then unpack the back pack from the
hip<00:03:46.700> of<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:46.970> vehicle<00:03:47.540> mode<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:47.959> fold<00:03:48.650> that

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
hip of the vehicle mode and fold that

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.210 
hip of the vehicle mode and fold that
forward<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.600> then<00:03:50.930> take<00:03:51.080> the<00:03:51.200> arms<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.980> kind

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
forward and then take the arms and kind

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.520 
forward and then take the arms and kind
of<00:03:52.250> put<00:03:52.459> them<00:03:52.640> up<00:03:52.880> towards<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.870> back<00:03:54.019> and<00:03:54.380> then

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
of put them up towards the back and then

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.440 
of put them up towards the back and then
that<00:03:55.690> will<00:03:56.690> cause<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.500> entire<00:03:58.070> hip<00:03:58.430> unit<00:03:58.850> to

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
that will cause the entire hip unit to

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.790 
that will cause the entire hip unit to
fold<00:03:59.750> down<00:04:00.200> like<00:04:00.950> this<00:04:01.310> then<00:04:02.209> take<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.110> legs

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
fold down like this then take the legs

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.970 
fold down like this then take the legs
and<00:04:04.130> put<00:04:04.610> them<00:04:04.790> together<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.510> fold<00:04:06.410> while

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
and put them together and fold while

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.400 
and put them together and fold while
holding<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.430> knees<00:04:07.610> fold<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.450> feet<00:04:08.690> up<00:04:08.870> into

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
holding the knees fold the feet up into

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.340 
holding the knees fold the feet up into
the<00:04:09.950> shins<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:10.580> then<00:04:11.450> all<00:04:11.750> we<00:04:11.840> need<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.050> do<00:04:12.230> is

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
the shins and then all we need to do is

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.210 
the shins and then all we need to do is
just<00:04:12.500> get<00:04:12.620> everything<00:04:12.890> lined<00:04:13.220> up<00:04:13.400> so<00:04:13.640> push<00:04:14.180> the

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
just get everything lined up so push the

mode<00:04:36.760> bumblebees<00:04:37.760> vehicle<00:04:38.150> mode<00:04:38.270> is<00:04:38.480> based

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
mode bumblebees vehicle mode is based

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.590 
mode bumblebees vehicle mode is based
off<00:04:39.020> of<00:04:39.050> some<00:04:39.410> concept<00:04:40.010> art<00:04:40.190> from<00:04:40.400> IDW<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.390> I

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
off of some concept art from IDW and I

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.390 
off of some concept art from IDW and I
like<00:04:41.810> this<00:04:41.960> vehicle<00:04:42.350> mode<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.500> lot<00:04:42.770> it's<00:04:43.310> very

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
like this vehicle mode a lot it's very

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.180 
like this vehicle mode a lot it's very
similar<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:44.240> as<00:04:44.360> generation<00:04:45.080> one<00:04:45.290> and<00:04:45.590> then

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
similar to as generation one and then

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.700 
similar to as generation one and then
it's<00:04:46.610> very<00:04:46.940> similar<00:04:47.330> to<00:04:47.540> his<00:04:48.140> fall<00:04:48.500> of

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
it's very similar to his fall of

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.770 
it's very similar to his fall of
Cybertron<00:04:49.250> nut<00:04:49.400> fall<00:04:49.610> of<00:04:49.730> Cybertron<00:04:50.120> war<00:04:50.390> for

him flying in alt mode it just works it

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.620 
him flying in alt mode it just works it
just<00:05:12.230> works<00:05:12.470> for<00:05:12.800> me<00:05:12.920> overall<00:05:13.610> a<00:05:13.910> very<00:05:13.940> nice

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630

little alt mode unfortunately I don't
think<00:05:17.060> blaze<00:05:17.660> master<00:05:18.260> pegs<00:05:18.620> in<00:05:18.920> anywhere<00:05:19.700> like

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
think blaze master pegs in anywhere like

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.990 
think blaze master pegs in anywhere like
a<00:05:20.600> roller<00:05:21.080> does<00:05:21.410> with<00:05:21.650> Prime<00:05:21.950> in<00:05:22.250> this<00:05:22.490> mode<00:05:22.700> I

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
a roller does with Prime in this mode I

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.690 
a roller does with Prime in this mode I
was<00:05:23.450> trying<00:05:23.720> to<00:05:23.810> think<00:05:23.990> of<00:05:24.140> a<00:05:24.230> way<00:05:24.380> to<00:05:24.440> maybe<00:05:25.280> do

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
was trying to think of a way to maybe do

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.810 
was trying to think of a way to maybe do
well<00:05:26.510> I<00:05:26.540> guess<00:05:26.930> you<00:05:27.140> could<00:05:27.380> peg<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.310> front<00:05:28.580> end

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
well I guess you could peg the front end

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.590 
well I guess you could peg the front end
and<00:05:29.210> then<00:05:30.050> do<00:05:30.320> this<00:05:30.770> kind<00:05:31.760> of<00:05:31.790> like<00:05:31.970> a<00:05:32.000> jolt

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
and then do this kind of like a jolt

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.300 
and then do this kind of like a jolt
from<00:05:33.370> from<00:05:34.370> Armada<00:05:34.760> but<00:05:35.950> that<00:05:36.950> just<00:05:37.070> looks

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
from from Armada but that just looks

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.600 
from from Armada but that just looks
dumb<00:05:37.610> so<00:05:38.590> yeah<00:05:39.590> just<00:05:39.980> leave<00:05:40.100> that<00:05:40.190> alone

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
dumb so yeah just leave that alone

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.810 
dumb so yeah just leave that alone

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
the joint is exposed so just pulling a

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.420 
the joint is exposed so just pulling a
little<00:06:24.080> bit<00:06:24.200> will<00:06:24.470> pop<00:06:24.770> it<00:06:24.980> out<00:06:25.040> of<00:06:25.220> place

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
little bit will pop it out of place

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
little bit on the small side smaller

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.890 
little bit on the small side smaller
than<00:06:36.620> I<00:06:36.710> would<00:06:36.890> like<00:06:36.920> but<00:06:37.490> I<00:06:38.120> like<00:06:38.480> what<00:06:38.690> we've

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
than I would like but I like what we've

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.050 
than I would like but I like what we've
got<00:06:39.140> here<00:06:39.470> now<00:06:39.890> I<00:06:39.950> actually<00:06:40.250> like<00:06:40.610> bumblebee

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
got here now I actually like bumblebee

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.060 
got here now I actually like bumblebee
more<00:06:41.420> than<00:06:41.660> I<00:06:41.750> do<00:06:41.810> prime<00:06:42.260> I<00:06:42.290> think<00:06:42.650> prime<00:06:42.890> is<00:06:43.010> a

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
more than I do prime I think prime is a

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.170 
more than I do prime I think prime is a
good<00:06:43.220> figure<00:06:43.580> or

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
good figure or

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.450 
good figure or
prime<00:06:44.600> is<00:06:44.750> a<00:06:44.780> good<00:06:44.960> figure<00:06:45.139> but<00:06:45.800> I<00:06:45.979> like<00:06:46.310> the

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
prime is a good figure but I like the

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.909 
prime is a good figure but I like the
bumblebee<00:06:46.970> figure<00:06:47.360> just<00:06:47.870> a<00:06:48.199> little<00:06:48.530> bit<00:06:48.680> more

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 
bumblebee figure just a little bit more

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:51.370 
bumblebee figure just a little bit more
and<00:06:49.190> for<00:06:49.850> a<00:06:49.880> size<00:06:50.150> comparison<00:06:50.180> for<00:06:51.020> bumblebee

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
and for a size comparison for bumblebee

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.260 
and for a size comparison for bumblebee
and<00:06:51.410> prime<00:06:51.740> as<00:06:52.009> you<00:06:52.310> can<00:06:52.460> see<00:06:52.699> they're

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
and prime as you can see they're

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.540 
and prime as you can see they're
practically<00:06:54.050> the<00:06:54.199> same<00:06:54.380> size<00:06:54.710> both<00:06:55.280> of<00:06:55.460> these

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
practically the same size both of these

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.129 
practically the same size both of these
figures<00:06:55.789> are<00:06:56.090> good<00:06:56.270> I<00:06:56.509> would<00:06:56.720> recommend

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:57.139 
figures are good I would recommend

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:58.450 
figures are good I would recommend
picking<00:06:57.350> up<00:06:57.530> both<00:06:57.740> of<00:06:57.919> them<00:06:58.009> but<00:06:58.130> if<00:06:58.220> you<00:06:58.310> can

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
picking up both of them but if you can

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.820 
picking up both of them but if you can
only<00:06:58.669> get<00:06:58.970> one<00:06:59.180> I<00:06:59.479> would<00:07:00.199> say<00:07:00.380> pick<00:07:00.590> up<00:07:00.710> the

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
only get one I would say pick up the

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.409 
only get one I would say pick up the
bumblebee<00:07:01.250> neither<00:07:01.699> of<00:07:01.880> these<00:07:01.970> figures<00:07:02.210> are

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419 
bumblebee neither of these figures are

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.240 
bumblebee neither of these figures are
perfect<00:07:02.810> I'm<00:07:02.960> just<00:07:03.470> going<00:07:03.590> to<00:07:03.620> say<00:07:03.830> that<00:07:04.009> right

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
perfect I'm just going to say that right

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.770 
perfect I'm just going to say that right
out<00:07:04.400> I<00:07:04.430> think<00:07:04.610> both<00:07:04.940> of<00:07:04.970> these<00:07:05.180> figures<00:07:05.449> would

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:05.780 
out I think both of these figures would

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.430 
out I think both of these figures would
be<00:07:05.960> much<00:07:06.289> better<00:07:06.620> as<00:07:06.919> deluxe<00:07:07.880> size<00:07:08.479> figures<00:07:09.169> I

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 
be much better as deluxe size figures I

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.140 
be much better as deluxe size figures I
think<00:07:09.919> there<00:07:10.009> would<00:07:10.070> be<00:07:10.130> a<00:07:10.250> lot<00:07:10.520> more<00:07:10.729> design

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
think there would be a lot more design

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.150 
think there would be a lot more design
and<00:07:11.509> more<00:07:11.780> fun<00:07:12.139> to<00:07:12.289> be<00:07:12.350> had<00:07:12.440> with<00:07:12.620> them

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 
and more fun to be had with them

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.040 
and more fun to be had with them
I<00:07:13.190> like<00:07:13.729> the<00:07:13.910> bulb<00:07:14.060> will<00:07:14.180> be<00:07:14.270> better<00:07:14.449> but<00:07:14.930> if

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 
I like the bulb will be better but if

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.749 
I like the bulb will be better but if
you<00:07:15.139> want<00:07:15.320> more<00:07:15.500> color<00:07:15.740> go<00:07:16.100> with<00:07:16.250> the<00:07:16.340> prime<00:07:16.550> or

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:16.759 
you want more color go with the prime or

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.850 
you want more color go with the prime or
a<00:07:16.789> much<00:07:17.000> better<00:07:17.539> diversity<00:07:18.229> and<00:07:18.380> color<00:07:18.560> go

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
a much better diversity and color go

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.740 
a much better diversity and color go
