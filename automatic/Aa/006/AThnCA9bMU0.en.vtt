00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.460
 studio today without april joke 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:21.010
 again normal project update we 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.170
 have a pretty big vehicle here 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.400
 harsh imperial army for warhammer 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.810
 before tk or astra militar around that are so 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.750
 many vehicles that one in principle 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.910
 yes , not all on the plate 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.790
 That's why I'm showing her 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.540
 you guys here on the fast in the 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.600
 each 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.540
 we have a hydra flac tank at the back 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.300
 I have traveled there two basilisks 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.640
 they are here back there are 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.170
 still three cent or storm cent in the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.360
 Ruff oh what else I forget 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.880
 To mention the whole army is in the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.930
 principle an extension of one already 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.250
 completed project that 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.960
 we did some time ago 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.579
 I believe 2013 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.850
 At that time, the whole thing was still considered 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.789
 inquisition following the old 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.249
 in the context 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:10.959
 There are also all the models in one 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:12.880
 another picture gallery already to see 

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:14.649
 and well those were now from the greens 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.240
 more or less outsourced the 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.590
 things that we had already done and 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.329
 that is now also, as it were 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.369
 addition to this came to one 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.850
 really full-fledged vehicle army too 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.469
 do 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.499
 we have here 3 i do not know helen 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.009
 hunt hell devil devil and devil too 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:32.409
 smoke 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:38.709
 that is also in any case this 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:43.359
 three tanks we have 12 34 several and 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:45.039
 one two three four lines rus the 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.389
 weapons at the front and at the side 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.479
 are all to be stuck and to the 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:55.359
 exchange evidence weapons platform 1 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:57.249
 2 3 4 5 6 7 or not weapons platforms 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.469
 Weapons teams behind also a small one 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:01.020
 addition various imperial gardisten 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.140
 with special weapons 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.640
 and similar all the way to level 4 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.149
 our service quality then painted 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.920
 we come here 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.650
 that is a very nice heart think 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.200
 me one 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.660
 maria blettner and bate panzer therefore 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.890
 Six will have been painted what the massive 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.780
 are used in addition to the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.120
 lighting effects extremely many wedding 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.310
 effects so oil stains scratches off 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.069
 There was a lot of space fuente here 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.959
 such a proper pigment crust 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.610
 developed with the level and sent fixer 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.920
 I think of egger interactive is the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.620
 you can do the pigments very nicely 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.420
 mooring that was dried out, the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.829
 is also holding a crust on the model and 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.910
 then there is no danger that that 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.260
 again with time so yes mr 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.340
 can be accommodated or knocked off 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.319
 as if it just like 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.110
 applied powdered sugar is going 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.910
 here is all around the model 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.170
 now a bit more extensive one 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.849
 a bit complicated to turn 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.959
 That's why I prefer to leave otherwise 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.720
 then a look once the front with 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.040
 oil stains all these depreciations 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.799
 and so on that's pretty cool 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.139
 have become few light effects I believe 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.350
 that looks really awesome like this 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:16.380
 massive centerpiece in this army as 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.700
 battle experienced tank of the 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.790
 already a lot behind 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.920
 Commander tank then we go here 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.780
 about very cool 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.160
 these are the new prince we have 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.450
 now for the first time for the customer 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.730
 When painting very cool here are these 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.950
 glowing orange shining eyes 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.660
 glasses eyes eyewear this task very much 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.970
 cool 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.380
 By the way, I believe we have the front 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.980
 that's basically behind the principle 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.169
 curb chains this way as armor 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.769
 armor on the body but once the 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:51.359
 melee variant and then there is here 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.090
 this storm this variant with these 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.980
 storm also very very well all over 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.810
 nice massive massive models if you 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.329
 she looks at herself as a comparison 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.620
 but here are a few snipers 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.150
 over there looks very good as 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.950
 by the way, in almost all armor 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.750
 You can see if they are at this back there 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.209
 For example, there are everywhere 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.750
 his stuff attached bags cover 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.880
 barrels 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.560
 a lot of stuff on the tank 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.060
 it depends if they are fighting a lot 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.620
 many fields are the whole way 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.880
 equipment of the crew of the crew 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.950
 and so on is still there 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.570
 a commissioner is here in front 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.290
 is also in the same color scheme 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.210
 some of the new tempesta us 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.720
 what are the models also very cool here 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.700
 how do you like the guy he has 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.480
 something of the expendables with the 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.520
 beard of tim reveals a text is too 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.720
 very nice light effects here is the 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.060
 Shoulder I think that one can completely 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.520
 Good to see, too, is a very good model 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.110
 another 1 10 model a bit deco white 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.700
 I can also meet with you shortly 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.960
 such a few barrels and something like that 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.480
 customer I still wanted to swing 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.950
 But make it over there too 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.610
 there is still a bit to choose from 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.669
 available 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.140
 and yes, here are how many 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:08.650
 panzers in total for the 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:12.200
 Vehicles 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.840
 14 and if you sentinel it to it 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.030
 still takes then the 14 17 pieces 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.270
 I think the customer already has it 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.060
 4 4 or 6 vehicles are getting over 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.090
 20 over 20 vehicles like such a 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.550
 Imperial Army I think belongs a lot 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.300
 very cool looks real in any case 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.380
 impressive and can be mine 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.120
 see view to really let 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.410
 nice color scheme maybe here 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.950
 quite interesting to mention that 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.710
 color scheme that is in two colors came there 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.160
 is basically green primed first 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.830
 been 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.000
 then the areas were taped the 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.770
 should stay green then was with 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.419
 a darker green hue again 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.820
 the second color with the airbrush 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.830
 applied and here we have such a 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.930
 soft fan-shaped came out of three colors 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.090
 or green primer and 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.320
 dark gray and a light brown 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.940
 that it also harmonizes very cool 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.000
 then with the red bull ring too 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.380
 nice to collect and then fits 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.970
 quite good with the pigments that they are in 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.030
 are pretty much dried out and that 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.220
 is just the right tooth system to the 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.930
 respective pigments is so I have 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.130
 something which I can say I do 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.320
 that was it is nothing 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.040
 been a lot 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.730
 and yes I would a 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.730
 Until next time
