00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.229
 Hello everyone , I have very much 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.200
 productive day was 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:13.140
 it started somewhere at six in the morning was a bunch 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.610
 made a project to cut agreements and 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.260
 other things like that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.410
 somewhere they are somewhere here is the exact time 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.180
 half past one nights and from appstore worker 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.350
 day came up half an hour ago end now 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.660
 begins like a wave of energy charge 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.279
 this is the next day and constantly me 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.779
 ask where do i get so much 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.600
 energy because for my country day 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.729
 starts at seven in the morning and trust me 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.890
 feeling gonna be very good all 

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:40.170
 very simple i recommend to everyone 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.329
 using drugs is another thing that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.979
 the drugs must be correct and have 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.499
 each of you have some kind of your own 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:49.229
 a drug that gives you my energy 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:51.329
 the drug he is very simple this here 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.399
 this is kis 500 horsepower under 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.699
 the hood and 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.019
 I love this dose right now I donâ€™t 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.489
 enough and now I'll show you how I charge 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.500
 energy to the next day 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.290
 hold even more cool than 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.760
 the previous one I do not know if you can 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.450
 understand me but you need to feel it 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.940
 maybe you can even hear it 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.560
 when you roll like this 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.420
 work only and then night falls and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.420
 you can do something like this 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.340
 I drive cause 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.340
 because it's already 170 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.220
 but 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.110
 it seems to me that life is like 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.170
 controlled drift around the country seems 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.810
 what brings you and do not own the situation 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.270
 all very quickly flashed sides crooked 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.900
 askew actually exactly you rulish 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.800
 situations and you control everything badly but 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.910
 what they think there 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.910
 I think so about
