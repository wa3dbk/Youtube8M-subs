of Halloween colored toys in the cage

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.910 
of Halloween colored toys in the cage
but<00:00:31.419> bugs<00:00:32.419> doesn't<00:00:32.870> really<00:00:33.019> stay<00:00:33.350> in<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:33.710> cage

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
but bugs doesn't really stay in the cage

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.430 
but bugs doesn't really stay in the cage
too<00:00:34.400> much<00:00:34.670> that's<00:00:35.420> why<00:00:35.629> there's<00:00:35.839> like<00:00:35.900> not<00:00:36.410> a

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
too much that's why there's like not a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.150 
too much that's why there's like not a
ton<00:00:36.800> of<00:00:36.830> things<00:00:37.160> in<00:00:37.430> it<00:00:37.580> um<00:00:38.019> he<00:00:39.019> gets<00:00:39.650> free

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
can he has access to the cage so he can

proofed it also this cage is called a
CNC<00:01:03.530> cage<00:01:03.879> you<00:01:04.879> can't<00:01:05.089> buy<00:01:05.239> these<00:01:05.299> in<00:01:05.630> stores

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
CNC cage you can't buy these in stores

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.620 
CNC cage you can't buy these in stores
like<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:07.220> have<00:01:07.430> to<00:01:07.610> make<00:01:07.790> it<00:01:07.970> yourself<00:01:08.060> these

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
like you have to make it yourself these

grids<00:01:08.990> are<00:01:09.229> from<00:01:09.470> Walmart<00:01:10.400> in<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.970> I<00:01:11.270> think

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
grids are from Walmart in the I think

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.470 
grids are from Walmart in the I think
it's<00:01:11.990> like<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.290> laundry<00:01:12.880> section<00:01:13.880> like<00:01:14.330> where

you get like laundry baskets and things

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.440 
you get like laundry baskets and things
and<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:17.600> comes<00:01:17.870> like<00:01:18.050> in<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.320> set<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.740> like<00:01:18.950> 12<00:01:19.940> I

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
and it comes like in a set of like 12 I

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.900 
and it comes like in a set of like 12 I
think<00:01:20.900> yeah<00:01:21.590> it's<00:01:21.800> like<00:01:22.040> a<00:01:22.070> set<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.400> 12<00:01:22.640> and

think yeah it's like a set of 12 and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.280 
think yeah it's like a set of 12 and
then<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:23.030> can<00:01:23.240> just<00:01:23.450> put<00:01:23.600> them<00:01:23.690> together<00:01:23.840> and

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
then you can just put them together and

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.700 
then you can just put them together and
make<00:01:24.620> a<00:01:24.650> gauge<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.360> with<00:01:26.360> my<00:01:26.810> CNC<00:01:27.260> cage<00:01:27.440> I've

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
make a gauge and with my CNC cage I've

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.500 
make a gauge and with my CNC cage I've
made<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:27.980> door<00:01:28.460> as<00:01:28.580> you<00:01:28.730> can<00:01:28.880> see<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.300> it<00:01:29.360> does

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.780 
have like some type of lock system so
that<00:01:32.450> he<00:01:32.600> can't<00:01:32.780> like<00:01:32.930> just<00:01:32.960> open<00:01:33.230> it<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:33.790> my

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
that he can't like just open it and my

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.130 
that he can't like just open it and my
cage<00:01:35.120> is<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.840> 2<00:01:36.590> by<00:01:36.890> 4<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.820> it's<00:01:37.940> 2<00:01:38.180> feet<00:01:38.450> by<00:01:38.690> 4

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
cage is a 2 by 4 so it's 2 feet by 4

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.030 
cage is a 2 by 4 so it's 2 feet by 4
feet<00:01:39.170> for<00:01:39.820> bugs<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.090> it<00:01:41.690> is<00:01:41.870> two<00:01:42.350> grids<00:01:42.680> tall

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
feet for bugs and it is two grids tall

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.070 
feet for bugs and it is two grids tall
and<00:01:43.310> there<00:01:43.460> is<00:01:43.580> like<00:01:43.760> this<00:01:43.940> mesh<00:01:44.300> stuff<00:01:44.780> on<00:01:44.990> the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
and there is like this mesh stuff on the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.920 
and there is like this mesh stuff on the
top<00:01:45.260> as<00:01:45.470> you<00:01:45.620> can<00:01:45.800> see<00:01:46.010> because<00:01:46.520> you<00:01:46.790> can<00:01:47.060> jump

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
top as you can see because you can jump

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.850 
top as you can see because you can jump
out<00:01:48.170> of<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:49.010> I<00:01:49.040> use<00:01:49.550> own<00:01:49.790> bunny<00:01:50.240> stretch<00:01:50.830> so<00:01:51.830> I

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
out of so I use own bunny stretch so I

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.610 
out of so I use own bunny stretch so I
use<00:01:52.400> fleece<00:01:52.909> for<00:01:53.210> bugs<00:01:53.479> because<00:01:54.049> that's<00:01:54.470> what

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
use fleece for bugs because that's what

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.500 
use fleece for bugs because that's what
he's<00:01:54.770> grown<00:01:55.040> up<00:01:55.190> on<00:01:55.370> and<00:01:55.640> it's<00:01:55.909> easiest<00:01:56.180> for<00:01:56.479> me

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
he's grown up on and it's easiest for me

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.890 
he's grown up on and it's easiest for me
to<00:01:56.630> clean<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.890> keeps<00:01:58.760> my<00:01:58.909> room<00:01:59.150> cleaner<00:01:59.600> than

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
to clean and keeps my room cleaner than

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.450 
to clean and keeps my room cleaner than
if<00:02:00.170> I<00:02:00.260> had<00:02:00.409> to<00:02:00.560> use<00:02:00.680> Budig<00:02:01.010> because<00:02:01.190> I'm<00:02:01.310> sure

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
if I had to use Budig because I'm sure

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.060 
if I had to use Budig because I'm sure
bedding<00:02:01.790> would<00:02:01.909> be<00:02:02.030> all<00:02:02.210> over<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.570> place<00:02:02.690> and

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
bedding would be all over the place and

toss around I think it's like made with
sisal<00:04:09.680> something<00:04:10.250> like<00:04:10.400> that<00:04:10.579> then<00:04:11.060> bugs<00:04:11.480> has

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
sisal something like that then bugs has

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.090 
sisal something like that then bugs has
his<00:04:11.989> large<00:04:12.620> cat<00:04:13.250> litter<00:04:13.700> pan<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.799> this<00:04:15.799> has

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
his large cat litter pan and this has

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.750 
his large cat litter pan and this has
his<00:04:16.729> litter<00:04:17.329> and<00:04:17.600> hate<00:04:18.049> in<00:04:18.289> it<00:04:18.470> his<00:04:19.220> hay<00:04:19.489> is

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
his litter and hate in it his hay is

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.699 
his litter and hate in it his hay is
unlimited<00:04:20.390> and<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:20.989> stays<00:04:21.229> in<00:04:21.380> his<00:04:21.440> litter<00:04:21.650> box

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
unlimited and it stays in his litter box

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.180 
unlimited and it stays in his litter box
because<00:04:22.250> he<00:04:22.460> does<00:04:22.760> not<00:04:22.940> like<00:04:23.270> using<00:04:23.620> hay<00:04:24.620> racks

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
because he does not like using hay racks

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.800 
because he does not like using hay racks
I've<00:04:25.340> tried<00:04:25.640> he<00:04:25.850> rocks<00:04:26.090> before<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.780> just

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
I've tried he rocks before and I just

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.310 
I've tried he rocks before and I just
finally<00:04:27.140> like<00:04:27.410> run<00:04:27.680> out<00:04:27.800> too<00:04:28.130> quickly<00:04:28.430> and

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
finally like run out too quickly and

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.029 
finally like run out too quickly and
they<00:04:30.430> are<00:04:31.430> harder<00:04:31.880> for<00:04:32.090> him<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.270> get<00:04:32.990> at<00:04:33.169> so<00:04:34.010> I

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
they are harder for him to get at so I

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:34.870 
they are harder for him to get at so I
just<00:04:34.460> give<00:04:34.640> him

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
just give him

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.050 
just give him
hey<00:04:35.030> in<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.390> litter<00:04:35.780> box<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.820> then<00:04:37.820> he<00:04:37.970> has

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
hey in the litter box and then he has

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.270 
hey in the litter box and then he has
like<00:04:38.270> some<00:04:38.780> paper<00:04:39.260> based<00:04:39.530> slaughter<00:04:39.830> in<00:04:40.070> there

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
like some paper based slaughter in there

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.370 
like some paper based slaughter in there
because<00:04:40.760> he<00:04:40.910> is<00:04:41.000> litter<00:04:41.210> box<00:04:41.450> trained<00:04:41.840> so<00:04:42.170> he

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
because he is litter box trained so he

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.100 
because he is litter box trained so he
goes<00:04:42.530> to<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.860> bathroom<00:04:43.010> in<00:04:43.580> there<00:04:44.540> for<00:04:44.840> most

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
goes to the bathroom in there for most

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.020 
goes to the bathroom in there for most
of<00:04:45.230> the<00:04:45.350> time<00:04:45.590> sometimes<00:04:46.340> he<00:04:46.700> does<00:04:46.850> have

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
of the time sometimes he does have

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.850 
of the time sometimes he does have
little<00:04:47.270> accidents<00:04:48.080> but<00:04:48.230> that's<00:04:48.410> okay

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
little accidents but that's okay

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.250 
little accidents but that's okay
and<00:04:49.150> then<00:04:50.150> Indy<00:04:50.810> corner<00:04:51.320> right<00:04:51.500> there<00:04:51.530> he<00:04:52.160> has

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
and then Indy corner right there he has

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.870 
and then Indy corner right there he has

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
his cat water dish I think it's like

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.490 
his cat water dish I think it's like
it's<00:04:58.910> a<00:04:59.240> refilling<00:05:00.230> water<00:05:00.770> dish<00:05:01.300> um<00:05:02.360> you<00:05:03.290> put

water on the top and it like refills at
the<00:05:06.080> bottom<00:05:06.530> so<00:05:06.740> I<00:05:06.770> really<00:05:07.130> like<00:05:07.310> that<00:05:07.490> and
