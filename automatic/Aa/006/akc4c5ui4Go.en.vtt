00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:06.339
This SKF training film is about 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.539
Y-bearing units

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.700
The Y-bearing is based on 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.179
the deep groove ball bearing

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.819
and consists of a wide inner ring 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.939
a row of balls secured by a cage

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.530
and a sphered outer ring 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.520
The Y-bearing is filled with grease

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.250
and sealed on both sides

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.520
The sphered outer diameter the bearing

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.520
fits into a matching sphered bore

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.960
in a range of housing types which can

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.660
be made of cast iron or pressed steel

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.440
It is a simple an economic bearing solution

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.400
to applications to be found in many industries

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.640
Y-bearing units can accept static misalignment

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.589
up to five degrees admissible

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.580
 in maintenance free applications

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.900
reducing to two degrees 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.400
when relocation is required

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.620
Adapter sleeve mounting can be used for shafts 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.000
which have a reverse direction rotation

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.509
The most common cast housings

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:05.969
 are the two bolt hole pillow block

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.520
the four bolt hole flange housing 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.520
the two bolt hole flange housing 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.210
and the take-up unit

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.660
There is also a wide variety 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.940
of pressed steel housings

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.160
Y-bearing units because of their simple 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.660
robust design with excellent sealing

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.600
 are to be found in agricultural equipment

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.330
screw conveyors and fans

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.330
where loads a relatively light

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.790
and speeds moderate

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.430
It is important to realise these bearing units

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.430
have no axial freedom

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.660
To dismount a Y-bearing unit

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.460
with an eccentric locking collar

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.000
loosen the grub screw

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
by using a hammer and drift

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.020
unlock the eccentric collar

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.200
and with the bolts removed from the housing

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.429
the unit can now be removed from the shaft

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.640
The dismounting of Y-bearing units 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.960
located by grub screws is even simpler

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.500
After loosening the two grub screws

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.880
with the housing free the unit can be removed

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.460
Do not remove the bearing unit

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.830
from its protective package

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.490
until everything is ready to mount the unit

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.700
The location method in this instance

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.560
is the eccentric collar

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.900
This method can only be used on shafts

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.620
 where the direction of rotation is constant

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.200
Using the hammer and drift

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.900
tighten the eccentric collar in the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.100
same direction as the shaft rotation

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.320
Then tighten the securing grub screw

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.300
Y-bearing units with grub screw locking

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.360
can accept reverse direction rotation 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.000
and are simpler to fit

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.500
First secure the bearing unit to its base

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.270
and allow the shaft to take

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.540
an unstressed position in the bearing bore

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.900
before tightening the grub screws onto the shaft

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.200
Mounting Y-bearing units 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.200
secured to the shaft with an adapter sleeve

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.590
is a more complicated process

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.660
This method is also capable of 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.879
accommodating reverse direction rotation

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.559
and can run at higher speeds and

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:47.479
smoother operation than the other methods

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.280
Correctly position the adapter sleeve 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.180
and the Y-bearing on the shaft

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.780
after lightly oiling the components

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.610
place the housing in its correct position 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.550
and make sure at this stage

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.570
that is not tightened down

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.900
Using the appropriate spanner

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.760
tighten the lock nut to the torque values

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.360
given in the SKF catalogue

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.120
This is to ensure that the internal bearing 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.900
clearances are not completely removed

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.300
When the correct that is achieved

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.800
check for housing position

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.960
and secure it to the machine frame 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.940
Make sure no stresses are locked in the bearing

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.300
Remove the lock nut and fit the locking washer

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.060
and replace the lock nut and secure it

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.340
The mounting of the Y-bearing 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.020
on an adapter sleeve is completed
