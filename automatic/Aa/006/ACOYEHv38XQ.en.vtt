00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
of this put the two sides together now

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.080 
of this put the two sides together now
that<00:03:37.100> everything's<00:03:37.400> inside<00:03:37.670> what<00:03:37.820> I've<00:03:37.910> found

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
that everything's inside what I've found

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.330 
that everything's inside what I've found
is<00:03:38.300> that<00:03:38.330> if<00:03:38.570> you<00:03:38.720> get<00:03:39.530> out<00:03:39.710> as<00:03:39.860> much<00:03:40.040> air<00:03:40.310> as

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
is that if you get out as much air as

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.270 
is that if you get out as much air as
possible<00:03:41.470> before<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:42.500> actually<00:03:42.950> put<00:03:43.160> these

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
possible before you actually put these

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.430 
possible before you actually put these
sides<00:03:43.610> together<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:44.540> can<00:03:44.720> now<00:03:44.870> fold<00:03:45.200> it<00:03:45.290> over

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
sides together you can now fold it over

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.300 
sides together you can now fold it over
once<00:03:46.030> twice<00:03:47.170> another<00:03:48.170> time<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.650> even<00:03:48.830> another

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
once twice another time and even another

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.780 
once twice another time and even another
time<00:03:50.230> take<00:03:51.230> this<00:03:51.440> buckle<00:03:51.860> over<00:03:51.980> here<00:03:52.340> snap<00:03:52.670> it

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
time take this buckle over here snap it
