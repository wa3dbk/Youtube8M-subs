00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
see it's how it folds up ok so you've

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.260 
see it's how it folds up ok so you've
had<00:03:20.810> your<00:03:20.870> ball<00:03:21.200> head<00:03:21.410> here<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:22.270> normally

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
you'd see it up here and you don't

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.770 
you'd see it up here and you don't
expand<00:03:24.830> but<00:03:25.070> it<00:03:25.100> folds<00:03:25.910> up<00:03:26.000> into<00:03:26.210> itself<00:03:26.540> which

this why would you bother but

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.870 
this why would you bother but
there<00:04:23.680> you<00:04:23.770> go<00:04:23.889> you<00:04:23.949> can<00:04:24.190> see<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.520> difference

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
there you go you can see the difference

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.409 
there you go you can see the difference
there<00:04:25.590> so<00:04:26.590> let's<00:04:27.460> see<00:04:27.699> so<00:04:27.910> we<00:04:28.000> got<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.150> pull<00:04:28.389> out

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
there so let's see so we got a pull out

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.689 
there so let's see so we got a pull out
position<00:04:28.960> here<00:04:29.850> we've<00:04:30.850> got<00:04:31.060> I<00:04:32.490> think<00:04:33.490> that's

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
position here we've got I think that's

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.370 
position here we've got I think that's
going<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:33.910> give<00:04:34.060> us<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.300> spindle<00:04:34.840> there<00:04:35.080> of

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
going to give us the spindle there of

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.840 
going to give us the spindle there of
what<00:04:35.590> we<00:04:35.710> need<00:04:35.919> we've<00:04:36.070> gone<00:04:36.220> all<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.520> way<00:04:36.550> down

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
what we need we've gone all the way down

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.390 
what we need we've gone all the way down
so<00:04:37.660> I'm<00:04:38.260> going<00:04:38.470> to<00:04:38.500> lock<00:04:38.680> that<00:04:38.889> back<00:04:39.130> into

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
so I'm going to lock that back into

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.980 
so I'm going to lock that back into
position<00:04:40.229> let's<00:04:41.229> see<00:04:41.410> we've<00:04:41.560> got<00:04:42.990> positions

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
position let's see we've got positions

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.510 
position let's see we've got positions
down<00:04:44.169> here<00:04:44.710> we'll<00:04:44.919> go<00:04:45.130> ahead<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.400> unscrew

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
down here we'll go ahead and unscrew

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.610 
down here we'll go ahead and unscrew
think<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.389> might<00:04:46.570> have<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.720> screech<00:04:46.960> little<00:04:47.440> too

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
think I might have a screech little too

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.370 
think I might have a screech little too
far<00:04:47.940> so<00:04:48.940> we'll<00:04:49.210> go<00:04:49.330> ahead<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.510> pull<00:04:49.720> that<00:04:49.750> way

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
far so we'll go ahead and pull that way

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.850 
far so we'll go ahead and pull that way
these<00:04:50.560> are<00:04:50.710> really<00:04:50.949> easy<00:04:51.040> to<00:04:51.190> take<00:04:51.940> them<00:04:52.090> screw

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
these are really easy to take them screw

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.159 
these are really easy to take them screw
and<00:04:53.860> pull<00:04:54.520> out<00:04:54.669> so<00:04:55.240> you<00:04:55.510> can<00:04:55.660> see<00:04:55.690> this<00:04:55.960> what

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
and pull out so you can see this what

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.610 
and pull out so you can see this what
we're<00:04:56.260> going<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.410> do<00:04:56.650> is<00:04:56.940> set<00:04:57.940> it<00:04:58.060> up<00:04:58.150> and<00:04:58.620> show

looks really good too and of course the
way<00:05:48.880> it<00:05:49.030> carries<00:05:49.450> makes<00:05:50.349> a<00:05:50.440> huge<00:05:50.740> amount<00:05:50.979> of

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
way it carries makes a huge amount of

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.430 
way it carries makes a huge amount of
difference<00:05:51.370> here<00:05:51.520> you<00:05:51.610> can<00:05:51.820> see<00:05:52.030> here<00:05:52.330> how<00:05:53.289> it

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
difference here you can see here how it

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.500 
difference here you can see here how it
sets<00:05:53.680> up<00:05:53.919> now<00:05:54.430> one<00:05:54.669> thing<00:05:54.789> that's<00:05:54.849> also<00:05:55.270> really

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
sets up now one thing that's also really

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.110 
sets up now one thing that's also really
nice<00:05:55.870> about<00:05:56.110> this<00:05:56.470> is<00:05:56.830> this<00:05:57.310> can<00:05:57.520> set<00:05:57.789> up<00:05:57.940> to

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
nice about this is this can set up to

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.089 
nice about this is this can set up to
where<00:05:58.240> it's<00:05:58.479> almost<00:05:58.660> plain<00:05:59.169> so<00:05:59.800> you've<00:05:59.950> got

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
where it's almost plain so you've got

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.250 
where it's almost plain so you've got
these<00:06:00.250> lockable<00:06:01.150> points<00:06:01.570> that<00:06:01.690> are<00:06:01.810> in<00:06:01.930> here

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
these lockable points that are in here

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.129 
these lockable points that are in here
and<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:03.039> points<00:06:03.400> pull<00:06:03.610> away<00:06:03.729> and<00:06:04.120> when<00:06:04.810> you<00:06:04.930> do

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
and the points pull away and when you do

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.490 
and the points pull away and when you do
that<00:06:05.349> you<00:06:06.039> can<00:06:06.220> do<00:06:06.490> just<00:06:07.030> about<00:06:07.240> almost<00:06:07.750> flat

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
that you can do just about almost flat

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.790 
that you can do just about almost flat
surface<00:06:09.099> these<00:06:09.669> lock<00:06:10.090> into<00:06:10.419> place<00:06:10.570> and<00:06:11.380> so<00:06:11.710> you

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
surface these lock into place and so you

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.740 
surface these lock into place and so you
can<00:06:11.950> see<00:06:12.160> here<00:06:12.370> we<00:06:12.490> can<00:06:12.669> make<00:06:13.300> the<00:06:13.479> stand

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
can see here we can make the stand

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.710 
can see here we can make the stand
almost<00:06:14.110> flat<00:06:15.010> or<00:06:15.460> just<00:06:15.760> be<00:06:15.910> barely<00:06:16.180> rising

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
almost flat or just be barely rising

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.719 
almost flat or just be barely rising
above<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:16.960> floor<00:06:17.320> with<00:06:18.039> the<00:06:18.160> adjustment<00:06:18.639> so

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
above the floor with the adjustment so

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.909 
above the floor with the adjustment so
you<00:06:18.760> can<00:06:18.849> take<00:06:19.090> and<00:06:19.270> make<00:06:19.300> there's<00:06:19.720> one<00:06:19.960> two

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
you can take and make there's one two

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:26.339 
you can take and make there's one two
and<00:06:22.979> three<00:06:23.979> lockable<00:06:24.760> positions<00:06:25.300> so<00:06:25.990> we<00:06:26.020> can

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
and three lockable positions so we can

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.620 
and three lockable positions so we can
make<00:06:26.500> this<00:06:26.680> stand<00:06:26.919> pretty<00:06:27.400> normal<00:06:27.880> we<00:06:28.419> could

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
make this stand pretty normal we could

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.500 
make this stand pretty normal we could
pull<00:06:29.229> this<00:06:29.380> out<00:06:29.620> put<00:06:30.460> the<00:06:30.580> lock<00:06:30.789> back<00:06:30.820> in<00:06:31.270> and

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
pull this out put the lock back in and

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.450 
pull this out put the lock back in and
make<00:06:32.200> it<00:06:32.349> fairly<00:06:32.650> well

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
make it fairly well

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.240 
make it fairly well
lock<00:06:34.120> down<00:06:34.349> or<00:06:35.349> we<00:06:35.530> can<00:06:35.650> go<00:06:35.740> like<00:06:35.919> this<00:06:35.950> and

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
lock down or we can go like this and

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.430 
lock down or we can go like this and
basically

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
basically

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.710 
basically
create<00:06:37.800> a<00:06:38.040> stand<00:06:38.760> that<00:06:38.880> would<00:06:39.090> be<00:06:39.240> literally

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
create a stand that would be literally

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.460 
create a stand that would be literally
just<00:06:40.020> sitting<00:06:40.500> right<00:06:40.530> on<00:06:40.890> the<00:06:41.130> floor<00:06:41.400> so<00:06:42.470> there

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
just sitting right on the floor so there

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.740 
just sitting right on the floor so there
you<00:06:43.650> go<00:06:43.860> so<00:06:44.310> it's<00:06:44.490> a<00:06:44.580> panful<00:06:44.760> stand<00:06:45.210> it's<00:06:45.510> nice

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
you go so it's a panful stand it's nice

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.110 
you go so it's a panful stand it's nice
and<00:06:46.020> light<00:06:46.170> it's<00:06:46.470> very<00:06:46.680> durable<00:06:47.220> and<00:06:47.670> sturdy

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
and light it's very durable and sturdy

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.510 
and light it's very durable and sturdy
and<00:06:48.480> everything<00:06:49.080> else<00:06:49.230> and<00:06:49.680> of<00:06:49.770> course<00:06:50.010> it

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
and everything else and of course it

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.970 
and everything else and of course it
looks<00:06:50.580> good<00:06:51.120> so<00:06:51.780> that's<00:06:51.900> really<00:06:52.200> what<00:06:52.740> matters

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980 
looks good so that's really what matters

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.750 
looks good so that's really what matters
in<00:06:53.370> the<00:06:54.080> context<00:06:55.080> of<00:06:55.290> having<00:06:55.770> a<00:06:56.130> great<00:06:56.400> stand
