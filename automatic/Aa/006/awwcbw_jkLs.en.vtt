now<00:03:45.760> let<00:03:46.180> me<00:03:46.269> just<00:03:46.419> add<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.840> this<00:03:46.959> example

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
now let me just add to this example

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:52.439 
now let me just add to this example
let's<00:03:48.729> say<00:03:48.940> we<00:03:49.150> have<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.540> Steelers<00:03:50.079> and<00:03:51.449> the

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:02.979 
teams are favored to both that 0 so you

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:06.509
