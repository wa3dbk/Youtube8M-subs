00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
think this is a good idea for MLS um one

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.000 
think this is a good idea for MLS um one
day<00:03:30.420> maybe<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.260> think<00:03:31.530> there's<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.769> couple

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
day maybe and I think there's a couple

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.250 
day maybe and I think there's a couple
things<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.489> look<00:03:32.609> at<00:03:32.820> here<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.450> first<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:34.019> if

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
things to look at here the first is if

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.020 
things to look at here the first is if
there<00:03:34.530> was<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:34.829> fourth<00:03:35.280> designated<00:03:35.880> player

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
there was a fourth designated player

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.360 
there was a fourth designated player
spot<00:03:36.390> I'm<00:03:36.600> pretty<00:03:36.840> sure<00:03:37.019> there's<00:03:37.230> only<00:03:37.500> two

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
spot I'm pretty sure there's only two

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.090 
spot I'm pretty sure there's only two
three<00:03:39.209> maybe<00:03:39.690> four<00:03:40.290> teams<00:03:40.650> who<00:03:40.859> would<00:03:40.980> be

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
three maybe four teams who would be

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.610 
three maybe four teams who would be
willing<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.579> use<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.970> at<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.239> point<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:43.049> that

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
willing to use it at this point so that

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.099 
willing to use it at this point so that
in<00:03:43.859> itself<00:03:43.980> doesn't<00:03:44.940> really<00:03:45.269> sell<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.959> me

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
in itself doesn't really sell it to me

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.960 
in itself doesn't really sell it to me
because<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.950> don't<00:03:47.100> want<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.340> lead<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.579> be<00:03:47.700> so

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
because you don't want the lead to be so

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.580 
because you don't want the lead to be so
top-heavy<00:03:48.329> on<00:03:48.780> teams<00:03:49.049> who<00:03:49.200> are<00:03:49.260> just<00:03:49.380> willing
