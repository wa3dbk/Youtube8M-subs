00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
running on top of Android now let's go

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.420 
running on top of Android now let's go
ahead<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.780> benchmark<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.530> device<00:00:43.860> so

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
ahead and a benchmark this device so

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.400 
ahead and a benchmark this device so
let's<00:00:44.670> start<00:00:44.940> off<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> benchmarking<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:46.110> an

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
let's start off the benchmarking with an

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.380 
let's start off the benchmarking with an
to<00:00:46.649> do<00:00:46.770> benchmarking<00:00:47.070> app

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.650 

so<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> anti<00:00:55.530> disclosure<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.520> 18<00:00:56.970> 384

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
so the anti disclosure here it's 18 384

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.600 
so the anti disclosure here it's 18 384
which<00:00:57.810> is<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> pretty<00:00:58.320> impressive<00:00:58.560> value<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
which is a pretty impressive value the

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.580 
which is a pretty impressive value the
zenfone<00:01:00.030> 5<00:01:00.270> when<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.600> tested<00:01:00.930> had<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.200> value<00:01:01.560> of

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
zenfone 5 when we tested had a value of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.060 
zenfone 5 when we tested had a value of
around<00:01:02.000> 1907<00:01:03.000> 4<00:01:03.240> so<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:03.990> very<00:01:04.140> close<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.770> even

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
around 1907 4 so it's very close so even

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.230 
around 1907 4 so it's very close so even
though<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.170> process<00:01:07.620> ROI<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.240> 1.2

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
though it's it's the process ROI is 1.2

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.870 
though it's it's the process ROI is 1.2
gigahertz<00:01:09.450> when<00:01:09.750> come<00:01:09.930> back<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.320> 1.6<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
gigahertz when come back to 1.6 on the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.570 
gigahertz when come back to 1.6 on the
Asus<00:01:12.210> zenfone<00:01:12.420> 5<00:01:12.810> there<00:01:12.990> isn't<00:01:13.290> much

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
Asus zenfone 5 there isn't much

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.130 
Asus zenfone 5 there isn't much
difference<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.060> benchmark<00:01:15.510> so<00:01:15.660> it<00:01:15.750> comes

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
difference in the benchmark so it comes

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.200 
difference in the benchmark so it comes
with<00:01:16.260> a<00:01:16.350> pretty<00:01:16.800> impressive<00:01:16.950> value<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.000> Moto

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
with a pretty impressive value the Moto

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.020 
with a pretty impressive value the Moto
e<00:01:18.330> which<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.440> lower<00:01:19.830> phone<00:01:20.220> then<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.729> comes

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
e which is a lower phone then this comes

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.990 
e which is a lower phone then this comes
up<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> value<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.840> 11<00:01:22.130> 897<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.850> is

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
up with a value of 11 897 so this is

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.310 
up with a value of 11 897 so this is
very<00:01:24.180> impressive<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.780> now<00:01:24.900> let's<00:01:25.110> go<00:01:25.260> to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
very impressive so now let's go to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.160 
very impressive so now let's go to
quadrant<00:01:26.010> test

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.289 

so<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
so the

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.690 
so the
test<00:01:32.600> results<00:01:32.810> are<00:01:33.170> here<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.009> it's<00:01:34.159> six<00:01:34.429> five

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
test results are here so it's six five

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.429 
test results are here so it's six five
zero<00:01:34.729> six<00:01:35.149> again<00:01:35.509> very<00:01:35.719> impressive<00:01:36.200> schoo

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
zero six again very impressive schoo

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.580 
zero six again very impressive schoo
eight<00:01:37.039> three<00:01:37.549> one<00:01:37.820> six<00:01:38.060> was<00:01:38.359> a<00:01:38.689> zoo<00:01:38.869> zenfone<00:01:39.350> 5

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
eight three one six was a zoo zenfone 5

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.440 
eight three one six was a zoo zenfone 5
so<00:01:39.979> this<00:01:40.189> device<00:01:40.579> has<00:01:40.820> come<00:01:41.000> up<00:01:41.179> with<00:01:41.299> pretty

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
so this device has come up with pretty

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.450 
so this device has come up with pretty
decent<00:01:41.570> values<00:01:42.259> six<00:01:42.590> five<00:01:42.799> zero<00:01:43.009> six<00:01:43.219> is

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
decent values six five zero six is

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.249 
decent values six five zero six is
pretty<00:01:43.670> decent<00:01:43.850> value<00:01:44.299> when<00:01:44.780> compared<00:01:45.200> to

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
pretty decent value when compared to

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.800 
pretty decent value when compared to
five<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:45.799> five<00:01:46.069> one<00:01:46.250> of<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.789> Moto<00:01:46.969> e<00:01:47.299> now

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
five and five one of the Moto e now

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:57.719 
five and five one of the Moto e now
let's<00:01:47.990> go<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.530> Nena<00:01:48.770> Mach<00:01:48.950> two

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.359 

so<00:01:58.719> the<00:01:58.899> Nina<00:01:59.079> Mach<00:01:59.320> 2<00:01:59.619> results<00:02:00.100> allowed

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
so the Nina Mach 2 results allowed

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.130 
so the Nina Mach 2 results allowed
that's<00:02:00.579> 50

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
that's 50

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
that's 50
9.0<00:02:01.920> that's<00:02:02.430> very<00:02:02.670> impressive<00:02:02.909> value

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
9.0 that's very impressive value

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.710 
9.0 that's very impressive value
considering<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.080> even<00:02:04.260> moto<00:02:04.590> G<00:02:04.920> has<00:02:05.220> only

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
considering that even moto G has only

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.600 
considering that even moto G has only
57.2<00:02:06.720> so<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.250> great

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
57.2 so this is a really great

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.120 
57.2 so this is a really great

well<00:02:15.270> as<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.510> meta<00:02:15.690> test

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
well as the meta test

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.770 
well as the meta test
so<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.100> velum<00:02:19.370> browser<00:02:19.730> test<00:02:20.150> results<00:02:20.600> are

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
so the velum browser test results are

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.720 
so the velum browser test results are
here<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:21.260> that's<00:02:21.470> one<00:02:21.740> four<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.160> zero<00:02:22.190> which<00:02:22.580> is

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
here so that's one four to zero which is

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.270 
here so that's one four to zero which is
really<00:02:23.090> impressive<00:02:23.240> value<00:02:23.810> for<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.800> mid-range

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
really impressive value for a mid-range

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.670 
really impressive value for a mid-range
phone<00:02:25.700> now<00:02:26.000> let's<00:02:26.270> do<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.720> Vellamo<00:02:27.110> mettle

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
phone now let's do the Vellamo mettle

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.660 
phone now let's do the Vellamo mettle
test

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.050 

so<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.630> Vellamo<00:02:34.930> metal<00:02:35.350> results<00:02:35.800> is<00:02:35.980> 563<00:02:36.760> they

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
so the Vellamo metal results is 563 they

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.760 
so the Vellamo metal results is 563 they
gain<00:02:37.210> really<00:02:37.480> good<00:02:37.780> score<00:02:38.080> for<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.380> mid-range

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
gain really good score for a mid-range

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.740 
gain really good score for a mid-range
phone<00:02:39.150> finally<00:02:40.150> we<00:02:40.300> will<00:02:40.360> see<00:02:40.600> the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
phone finally we will see the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.809 
phone finally we will see the
multi-touch<00:02:41.290> capabilities<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.580> zenfone

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
multi-touch capabilities of the zenfone

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.470 
multi-touch capabilities of the zenfone
5<00:02:43.360> light<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:48.220> as<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.520> can<00:02:48.640> see<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:49.030> supports

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
5 light so as you can see it supports

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.810 
5 light so as you can see it supports
only<00:02:49.690> 5<00:02:49.959> point<00:02:50.230> multi-touch<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.610> zenfone

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
only 5 point multi-touch so the zenfone

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.300 
only 5 point multi-touch so the zenfone
5<00:02:52.300> had<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.660> 10-point<00:02:53.320> multi-touch<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.160> is

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
5 had a 10-point multi-touch so this is

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.010 
5 had a 10-point multi-touch so this is
5<00:02:54.520> point<00:02:54.790> multi-touch<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.870> is<00:02:55.990> a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
5 point multi-touch so that is a

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.500 
5 point multi-touch so that is a
benchmarking<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.190> Asus<00:02:57.520> zenfone<00:02:57.730> 5<00:02:58.209> light

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
benchmarking of the Asus zenfone 5 light

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.800 
benchmarking of the Asus zenfone 5 light
so<00:02:59.020> we<00:02:59.200> did<00:02:59.350> an<00:03:00.190> 2<00:03:00.400> top<00:03:00.580> quadrant<00:03:01.060> nana<00:03:01.330> mikvah

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
so we did an 2 top quadrant nana mikvah

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.630 
so we did an 2 top quadrant nana mikvah
lemma<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.530> multi-touch<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.310> hope<00:03:03.489> you

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
lemma and the multi-touch so hope you

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.070 
lemma and the multi-touch so hope you
