00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
they'll still make and the peridot sword

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.109 
they'll still make and the peridot sword
so<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.220> doesn't<00:01:38.640> really<00:01:38.759> matter

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
so it doesn't really matter

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.929 
so it doesn't really matter
so<00:01:39.689> yeah<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.320> peridot<00:01:40.890> sword<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> little

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
so yeah the peridot sword is a little

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.940 
so yeah the peridot sword is a little
bit<00:01:42.060> better<00:01:42.240> than<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.509> diamond<00:01:42.899> sword<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.409> I

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
bit better than the diamond sword and I

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.410 
bit better than the diamond sword and I
think<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.549> may<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.909> little<00:01:45.060> bit<00:01:45.180> more

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
think it may be a little bit more

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.270 
think it may be a little bit more
durable<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:45.960> yeah<00:01:46.350> obviously<00:01:46.470> that's<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
durable so yeah obviously that's the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.100 
durable so yeah obviously that's the
best<00:01:47.460> one<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.729> far<00:01:47.759> but<00:01:48.180> obviously<00:01:48.840> we'll<00:01:48.990> move

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
best one so far but obviously we'll move

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.020 
best one so far but obviously we'll move
on<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> ruby<00:01:49.829> sword<00:01:50.040> now<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.280> ruby<00:01:50.850> sword

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
on to the ruby sword now the ruby sword

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.039 
on to the ruby sword now the ruby sword
is<00:01:51.240> actually<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.869> same<00:01:52.460> this<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.640> actually<00:01:54.049> in

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
is actually the same this is actually in

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.560 
is actually the same this is actually in
the<00:01:55.649> project<00:01:56.130> red<00:01:56.250> mud<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.119> biomes<00:01:57.479> are

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the project red mud and the biomes are

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.149 
the project red mud and the biomes are
plenty<00:01:57.869> mod<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.200> well<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.649> obviously<00:01:58.829> it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
plenty mod as well so obviously it

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.709 
plenty mod as well so obviously it
doesn't<00:01:59.399> matter<00:01:59.610> which<00:01:59.759> one<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.060> use<00:02:00.090> because

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
doesn't matter which one you use because

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.800 
doesn't matter which one you use because
I've<00:02:00.869> tried<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:02.130> works<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.700> yeah<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
I've tried it and it works so yeah the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.760 
I've tried it and it works so yeah the
Ruby<00:02:04.229> sword

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
Ruby sword

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.499 
Ruby sword
actually<00:02:05.340> gives<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.520> +8<00:02:05.969> damage<00:02:06.329> which<00:02:06.479> is

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
actually gives you +8 damage which is

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.150 
actually gives you +8 damage which is
one<00:02:06.840> higher<00:02:07.110> than<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.380> diamond<00:02:07.770> sword<00:02:07.979> so

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
one higher than the diamond sword so

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.190 
one higher than the diamond sword so
obviously<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.700> more<00:02:08.940> powerful<00:02:09.300> sword<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.959> it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
obviously is more powerful sword and it

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.790 
obviously is more powerful sword and it
probably<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> more<00:02:11.430> durable<00:02:11.760> sword

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
probably is a more durable sword

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.050 
probably is a more durable sword
what<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.070> was<00:02:13.250> reading<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.730> couldn't<00:02:13.970> actually

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
what I was reading I couldn't actually

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.760 
what I was reading I couldn't actually
find<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.510> durability<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.290> swords<00:02:15.620> but

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
find the durability of the swords but

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.680 
find the durability of the swords but
obviously<00:02:16.190> it's<00:02:16.400> probably<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.820> same<00:02:17.060> as<00:02:17.390> just

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
obviously it's probably the same as just

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.800 
obviously it's probably the same as just
Ruby<00:02:18.020> tools<00:02:18.320> so<00:02:18.740> yeah<00:02:19.520> they<00:02:19.760> will<00:02:19.940> be<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.660> is

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
Ruby tools so yeah they will be this is

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.750 
Ruby tools so yeah they will be this is
going<00:02:20.990> up<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.320> ranking<00:02:21.680> order<00:02:21.890> now<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:22.490> it's

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
going up in ranking order now so it's

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.550 
going up in ranking order now so it's
gonna<00:02:23.090> be<00:02:23.270> like<00:02:23.450> more<00:02:23.690> durable<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.350> higher

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
gonna be like more durable and higher

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.400 
gonna be like more durable and higher
attack<00:02:25.340> damage<00:02:25.580> basically<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.420> yeah<00:02:27.170> that's

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
attack damage basically so yeah that's

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.800 
attack damage basically so yeah that's
what<00:02:27.530> I'm<00:02:27.620> saying

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
what I'm saying

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.390 
what I'm saying
what<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:29.840> want<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.170> do<00:02:30.290> now<00:02:30.500> is<00:02:30.530> move<00:02:30.980> on<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.280> the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
what I want to do now is move on to the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.540 
what I want to do now is move on to the
Sapphire<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.330> what<00:02:33.050> this<00:02:33.200> actually<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:34.010> a

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
Sapphire so what this actually is is a

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.880 
Sapphire so what this actually is is a
way<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.750> isn't<00:02:35.900> as<00:02:36.110> good<00:02:36.230> as<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.440> roof<00:02:36.620> sword

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
way that isn't as good as a roof sword

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.640 
way that isn't as good as a roof sword
so<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.670> do<00:02:37.820> that<00:02:38.000> one<00:02:38.480> it's<00:02:38.990> actually<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.470> same

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
so to do that one it's actually the same

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.830 
so to do that one it's actually the same
as<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:40.160> diamond<00:02:40.520> sword<00:02:40.760> but<00:02:41.090> I'm<00:02:41.480> just<00:02:41.630> saying

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
as the diamond sword but I'm just saying

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.200 
as the diamond sword but I'm just saying
sapphire<00:02:42.380> is<00:02:42.620> easier<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.130> find<00:02:43.490> so<00:02:43.880> we'll<00:02:44.090> do

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
sapphire is easier to find so we'll do

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.050 
sapphire is easier to find so we'll do
this<00:02:44.360> sapphire<00:02:45.140> diamond<00:02:45.830> there<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.430> Sapphire

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
this sapphire diamond there the Sapphire

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.750 
this sapphire diamond there the Sapphire
is<00:02:47.090> easier<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.630> find<00:02:47.990> than<00:02:48.440> diamond<00:02:49.190> basically

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
is easier to find than diamond basically

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.540 
is easier to find than diamond basically
so<00:02:50.480> yeah<00:02:51.260> I'm<00:02:51.380> just<00:02:51.530> saying<00:02:51.710> that<00:02:51.980> because<00:02:52.280> if

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
so yeah I'm just saying that because if

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.070 
so yeah I'm just saying that because if
you<00:02:52.610> don't<00:02:53.060> want<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.330> dye<00:02:53.450> my<00:02:53.630> sword<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:53.990> you

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
you don't want to dye my sword and you

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.770 
you don't want to dye my sword and you
find<00:02:54.290> sapphire<00:02:54.590> then<00:02:55.100> obviously<00:02:55.400> go<00:02:56.390> get<00:02:56.570> that

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
find sapphire then obviously go get that

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.810 
find sapphire then obviously go get that
so<00:02:57.050> sapphire<00:02:57.530> can<00:02:57.770> actually<00:02:58.070> be<00:02:58.220> found<00:02:58.550> in

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
so sapphire can actually be found in

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.280 
so sapphire can actually be found in
water<00:02:59.120> like<00:02:59.360> biomes<00:02:59.750> like<00:02:59.960> the<00:03:00.050> sake<00:03:00.260> of

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
water like biomes like the sake of

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.380 
water like biomes like the sake of
Springs<00:03:00.710> mangroves<00:03:01.250> or<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.520> crags<00:03:01.850> which<00:03:02.180> is

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
Springs mangroves or the crags which is

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.720 
Springs mangroves or the crags which is
they're<00:03:03.020> easy<00:03:03.320> to<00:03:03.560> find<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:04.130> I'm<00:03:04.340> just<00:03:04.550> saying

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
they're easy to find so I'm just saying

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.730 
they're easy to find so I'm just saying
if<00:03:05.210> you<00:03:05.300> wanna<00:03:05.450> go<00:03:05.540> find<00:03:05.780> sapphire<00:03:06.050> then<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.620> is

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
if you wanna go find sapphire then it is

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.830 
if you wanna go find sapphire then it is
the<00:03:06.950> same<00:03:07.190> rating<00:03:07.460> as<00:03:07.700> diamond<00:03:08.120> swords<00:03:08.570> so

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
the same rating as diamond swords so

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.230 
the same rating as diamond swords so
yeah<00:03:09.560> anyway<00:03:10.490> we'll<00:03:10.730> move<00:03:10.850> on<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.060> this

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
yeah anyway we'll move on to this

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.540 
yeah anyway we'll move on to this
amethyst<00:03:11.690> now<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.200> as<00:03:12.410> you<00:03:12.500> see<00:03:12.740> +9<00:03:13.250> attack

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
amethyst now and as you see +9 attack

I'm gonna show you that in just a second
but<00:03:27.170> in<00:03:27.470> order<00:03:27.800> to<00:03:27.920> make<00:03:28.100> this<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.760> if<00:03:28.970> this

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
but in order to make this and if this

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.940 
but in order to make this and if this
sword<00:03:29.390> is<00:03:29.690> very<00:03:29.989> different<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.440> other<00:03:30.620> swords

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
sword is very different to other swords

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.290 
sword is very different to other swords
actually<00:03:31.220> use<00:03:31.370> sticks<00:03:31.730> for<00:03:32.000> them<00:03:32.120> the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
actually use sticks for them the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.910 
actually use sticks for them the
amethyst<00:03:32.750> sword<00:03:33.050> what<00:03:33.320> you<00:03:33.380> actually<00:03:33.500> use<00:03:33.770> to

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
amethyst sword what you actually use to

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.580 
amethyst sword what you actually use to
make<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.340> iron<00:03:34.730> instead<00:03:35.090> of<00:03:35.209> sticks<00:03:35.510> so<00:03:35.840> what

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
make is iron instead of sticks so what

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.360 
make is iron instead of sticks so what
would<00:03:36.739> do<00:03:36.950> is<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:38.230> we<00:03:39.230> use<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.560> iron<00:03:39.739> instead<00:03:40.250> of

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
would do is a we use the iron instead of

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.000 
would do is a we use the iron instead of
a<00:03:40.430> stick<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:41.510> what<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.230> do<00:03:42.350> is<00:03:42.590> use<00:03:42.800> iron

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
a stick so what you do is use iron

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.110 
a stick so what you do is use iron
instead<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.400> stick<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.820> make<00:03:44.000> the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
instead to stick and you make the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.490 
instead to stick and you make the
amethyst<00:03:44.450> sword<00:03:44.660> now<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:44.870> have<00:03:45.080> two<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.380> them

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
amethyst sword now I have two of them

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.680 
amethyst sword now I have two of them
but<00:03:46.040> yeah<00:03:46.520> that<00:03:46.760> is<00:03:46.910> pretty<00:03:46.940> much<00:03:47.360> what<00:03:47.420> I'm

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
but yeah that is pretty much what I'm

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.540 
but yeah that is pretty much what I'm
saying<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.110> amethyst<00:03:48.650> is<00:03:48.860> actually<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.310> best

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550
