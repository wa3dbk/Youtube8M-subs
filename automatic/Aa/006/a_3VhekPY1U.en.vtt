00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:19.200
Susan Persky:
I'm Susan Persky, and we're in the immersive

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.900
virtual environment testing area.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.860
So, we do several kinds of research, but everything
falls under the umbrella of trying to understand

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.750
the intersection between genetics and genomics
with society.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.180
So, that can be things like how genetic information
is talked about in the clinic, it can be things

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.890
like how family members talk about genetics
with one another, how genetics is talked about

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.000
on social media, how people think about, report
about genetics and genomics in media.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.770
So, all those sorts of things.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.340
As a kid, I was interested in science kind
of from the get go.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.460
Science, you know, was my favorite class.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.940
I did science fairs in seventh and eighth
grade.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.190
And, so, I took my first psychology class,
and it was sort of like all the stars aligned,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.190
you know.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.020
It was sort of -- it took scientific method
and it married it with this interest in what

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.100
people were thinking about and what was motivating
their behavior, and kind of brought it all

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.490
together for me.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.320
And I went to a recruitment admissions weekend
at one of the schools I had applied to, not

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.450
really thinking this was a place that I would
necessarily go.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.170
And I was on a tour and I saw that there was
a virtual reality lab, that there was a professor

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.210
there who was studying virtual reality and
how you would use that as a tool to understand

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.850
human behavior and also understand what kind
of effects using virtual reality would have

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.850
on people.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.310
And, you know, I just thought that was the
coolest thing.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.070
I had never even thought about that, you know,
as a possibility.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.780
And, you know, that was pretty much it.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.740
You know, I decided this is where I'm going
to school, this is, you know, where I want

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.740
to be.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.299
I've done a number of studies now doing these
kind of rough approximation simulations of

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.299
clinical encounters.

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.490
So, if I'm interested in how a patient's going
to respond when you talk about, you know,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.450
genetics and some sort of health condition,
then I roughly simulate a doctor.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.259
So, I have a virtual doctor who might talk
about genetics, and he might talk about it

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.620
in different ways so we can see what way is
best.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.769
Yeah, I think it looks pretty empathetic.

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:15.769
You think?

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.939
And his eyes should follow us.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:18.939
Male Speaker:
Yeah.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.439
Susan Persky:
I was a little worried, but I think they're

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.139
looking a lot better.

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.379
We also look at things like the people's behavior.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.379
Where are they looking?

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.239
You know, if a doctor is giving you this sort
of information that I might be responding

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.299
favorably to you or I may be responding unfavorably
to you, we can kind of tell that by people's

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.829
nonverbal behavior.

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.469
That can tell us a lot about what they're
thinking, you know, how positively, how negatively

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:42.709
they're feeling.

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.599
I'm planning studies so sort of what's the
next step in what we're doing.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.559
So, I run a virtual reality lab on behalf
of my entire branch at the genome institute.

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.900
I'm working with my colleagues to think about,
well, what are their research questions, what

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.930
do they want to study, what kinds of creative
ways might we be able to use virtual reality,

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.139
use other new envelope pushing methodology
tools to answer their questions.

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:12.409
We bring our volunteers here and we put the
head mounted display on them and they go into

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:13.489
a virtual reality simulation.

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.489
Male Speaker:
Ah.

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.489
Okay.

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.489
Now I see it.

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.489
Susan Persky:
Okay.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.489
Yep.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.489
Male Speaker:
Okay.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.489
Susan Persky:
All right.

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.489
Male Speaker:
I see the food.

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.540
Susan Persky:
I'm going to give you this one that we have

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.239
made out of electrical tape and a PowerPoint
presentation pointer.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.690
So, I work with a company out in California,
and we kind of go back and forth, and we design

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.650
the, you know, world that people are going
to see when they're here in our experiments.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.930
We design their virtual worlds.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.569
So, do they look at everything and then go
make food choices or do they just kind of

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.269
go up and down the buffet and say "I want
this, I don't want that"?

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.489
Male Speaker:
So, when I see something I want, I just --

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.249
Susan Persky:
You just put your pointer -- if you look down,

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:53.249
you'll see your tray.

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:54.779
Male Speaker:
Oh, okay.

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:55.779
There's the tray.

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:56.779
Susan Persky:
There's your tray.

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.569
You should be able to walk up to the counter
and take a closer look.

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.569
Male Speaker:
Grapes.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.569
Steamed carrots.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:02.569
Susan Persky:
Oh, yeah.

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:03.569
Male Speaker:
Tater tots.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:04.569
What's this on the end here?

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:05.669
Susan Persky:
Brownies.

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.189
Male Speaker:
Brownies.

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:12.839
I'm going to be bad and get a brownie.

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:13.839
Susan Persky:
Okay.

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:15.319
Let's see if you're actually able to do that.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:21.630
The foods are meant to be all very child friendly,
things like, you know, chicken nuggets and

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.290
tater tots and things like that.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:29.400
And, so, we can measure the kind of choices
that the parents make for the kids and also

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.040
the process.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.480
You know, I love getting the data, I love,
you know, running analyses on it and finding

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.900
out, you know, what did our experiment find?

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.880
You know, what are our results and were they
what we thought they were going to be?

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.790
And if they're not, what does that tell us
about what we should look into next.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.940
You know, we pick the color of the floor,
we pick, you know, how the doctor's head is

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.090
going to move when he's talking.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.090
Everything is up to us.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.900
And that's really the beautiful thing about
using virtual reality for research.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.910
So, it's showing you basically a diagram of
our room and all the cameras that are on the

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.400
periphery of the room looking for the infrared
signal that the head mounted display is giving

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400
off.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.880
So, this is how it knows where in the room
you're located as you're walking around, making

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.560
choices in the virtual buffet.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.750
It is a cool job.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.750
You know.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.880
I do get to be creative, I get to design things,
and then I go and I put the head mounted display

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.690
on, and I'm in a virtual world.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.300
And it was me writing down, you know, at this
time the virtual doctor should say this and

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.560
he should look this way or, you know, here
are the foods that I want displayed on this

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.360
virtual buffet.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.680
And then you put on the helmet and it's there
[laughs].

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.240
I think I think you really have to experience
it to know how much fun it is.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.180
I really think virtual reality is up and coming.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.590
And I think the hardware is there, but the
need for the content, you know, what are people

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.000
going to do with it, how are you going to
apply it, you know, how can scientists use

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.310
virtual reality, I think that's the big question.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.170
And I think the ability to be part of that
world, I mean, I think is incredibly cool.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.700
