00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:15.619
 Hi people, here it was today, I 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.720
 I'm back here with this series of 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:22.140
 taxpayer fills and today I was is 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.840
 serious to the series that has long been 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.510
 taking in the channel and I'm having it 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.460
 So, next time, I'll solve it. 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.009
 build without time lapse even because 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.120
 I was out of time and you're doing some 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.000
 things here 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.640
 but anyway I was the following and I did 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.040
 that was a part of the net city 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.230
 the majority of the city continues to 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.420
 for later it fits in each place 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.700
 here in town so like this I am 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.480
 doing everything separately first and then 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.410
 I put them on ms say the word 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.180
 yourself 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.690
 There in the city I'll do on the streets and 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.180
 but that's what I did here with 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.420
 the aid of the regime and the club was 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.869
 Azteca was for those who do not know that 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.180
 haztec the haztec was the theater of 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.680
 sprinfield a theater that you defeat 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.500
 representations and tals 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.360
 I do not know if it 's cinema but anyway 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.420
 takita the two vehicles 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.290
 The lady is what we did here then 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.470
 haztec is on the fish him back here by 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.740
 cause I go as I said in the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.579
 set series the bikini slit 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.619
 It's the people do not furniture it now so I 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.100
 I leave to furnish everything after 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.720
 as I said then here and I'll see your 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.850
 course back to do the theater 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.130
 to see if it fits the theater here right? 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.950
 but anyway it was more or less what I 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.079
 I wanted only here because I do not know if this 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.970
 space, I can do the theater I think 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.250
 which is very tight and maybe I 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.180
 I have to make more to come, it always ends. 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.590
 everything is about injury but anyway it is 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.990
 again not only in this video 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.670
 For you in the next video I'll try 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.120
 do time lapse of two or more 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.070
 light constructions 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.540
 It's but I'll build it all at the end of 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.090
 Week in Brazil 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.610
 but anyway it 's all the rush even because 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.710
 Back to school with you, you know and maybe 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.860
 I'll start the tests and then I can have 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.030
 more time here on psn but at last it was 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.770
 more or less then 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.990
 so if you liked, do not forget 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.580
 Leave your home that was born back to 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.360
 help in the dissemination of this brazilian video 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.700
 and it's also because of another place 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.750
 so check this out you can give him 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.810
 What happened? 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.630
 This one went white ds5 to pretend fan 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.890
 again because if it turns white it does not count 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.620
 How is beauty there? 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.360
 But anyway it 's more or less so if 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.150
 writing the channel register and 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.530
 by clicking on the video or below and 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.530
 then this was a strong hug and 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.530
 said
