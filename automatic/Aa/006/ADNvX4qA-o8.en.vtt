like<00:00:00.840> guys<00:00:00.989> just<00:00:01.890> playing<00:00:02.159> with<00:00:02.340> the

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
like guys just playing with the

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.240 
like guys just playing with the
components<00:00:03.270> from<00:00:03.389> this<00:00:03.629> portable<00:00:04.529> CD<00:00:04.740> player

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
components from this portable CD player

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.120 
components from this portable CD player
I<00:00:05.279> took<00:00:05.759> apart<00:00:06.029> last<00:00:06.299> night<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:07.080> used<00:00:07.950> the

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
I took apart last night and used the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.379 
I took apart last night and used the
electric<00:00:08.519> motor<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.910> drive<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.990> fan<00:00:10.800> car<00:00:11.280> or<00:00:11.940> fan

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
electric motor to drive a fan car or fan

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.829 
electric motor to drive a fan car or fan
driven<00:00:12.840> car<00:00:14.000> as<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.150> said<00:00:15.330> at<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.480> time<00:00:15.660> when<00:00:15.809> I

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
driven car as I said at the time when I

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.390 
driven car as I said at the time when I
took<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.109> apart<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.619> looked<00:00:16.830> like<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.190> only

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
took it apart it looked like the only

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.230 
took it apart it looked like the only
problem<00:00:17.970> with<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.240> was<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.420> corrosion<00:00:20.180> and<00:00:21.180> I

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
problem with it was the corrosion and I

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.890 
problem with it was the corrosion and I
felt<00:00:21.480> focus<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.109> here<00:00:22.350> but<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
felt focus on here but this is the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.810 
felt focus on here but this is the
battery<00:00:24.900> terminals<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.609> see

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
battery terminals and as you can see

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.240 
battery terminals and as you can see
they're<00:00:27.199> completely<00:00:28.199> corroded<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.890> springs

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
they're completely corroded the springs

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.410 
they're completely corroded the springs
corroded<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.560> little<00:00:31.610> bump<00:00:32.610> there<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
corroded and little bump there that the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.930 
corroded and little bump there that the
battery<00:00:33.930> presses<00:00:34.500> against<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.070> also<00:00:35.370> corroded

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
battery presses against is also corroded

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.360 
battery presses against is also corroded
and<00:00:36.380> back<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.649> completely<00:00:38.160> corroded

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and back of it's completely corroded

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.790 
and back of it's completely corroded
that<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.940> back<00:00:39.090> doesn't<00:00:39.390> really<00:00:39.540> matter<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.770> I

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
that the back doesn't really matter so I

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.959 
that the back doesn't really matter so I
thought<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.040> wonder<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.520> would<00:00:41.700> work

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
thought I wonder if it would work

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.750 
thought I wonder if it would work
I<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.360> put<00:00:42.570> normal<00:00:42.930> battery<00:00:43.520> container<00:00:44.520> back

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
I just put normal battery container back

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.180 
I just put normal battery container back
in<00:00:44.969> there<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.510> I've<00:00:45.629> jumpered<00:00:46.079> these<00:00:46.920> two

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
in there so I've jumpered these two

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.130 
in there so I've jumpered these two
double-a<00:00:47.550> batteries<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> normal

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
double-a batteries on to the normal

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.639 
double-a batteries on to the normal
terminals<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.329> now<00:00:51.539> I've<00:00:52.110> reconnected

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
terminals and so now I've reconnected

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.849 
terminals and so now I've reconnected
the<00:00:52.980> little<00:00:53.250> display<00:00:54.260> if<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.410> press<00:00:55.680> play<00:00:57.859> you

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the little display if I press play you

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.500 
the little display if I press play you
see<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.280> display<00:00:59.670> works<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.270> actually

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
see the display works it's actually

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.319 
see the display works it's actually
saying<00:01:00.690> op4<00:01:01.260> open<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.219> press<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.699> switch

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
saying op4 open so if I press the switch

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.479 
saying op4 open so if I press the switch
here<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.019> detects<00:01:04.500> whether<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> lids<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.309> or

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
here that detects whether the lids up or

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.630 
here that detects whether the lids up or
down<00:01:06.439> you<00:01:07.439> see<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.619> works<00:01:08.010> okay<00:01:10.280> it's<00:01:11.280> trying

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
down you see that works okay it's trying

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
down you see that works okay it's trying
to<00:01:11.820> detect<00:01:12.150> how<00:01:12.479> many<00:01:12.659> tracks<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:13.200> are<00:01:13.320> at

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
to detect how many tracks there are at

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.840 
to detect how many tracks there are at
the<00:01:13.530> moment<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:13.979> obviously<00:01:14.340> there<00:01:14.549> aren't

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the moment but obviously there aren't

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.999 
the moment but obviously there aren't
any<00:01:15.170> because<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.290> haven't<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> rest<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
any because we haven't got the rest of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.380 
any because we haven't got the rest of
it<00:01:17.100> connected<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.909> press<00:01:18.270> play<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:21.240> it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
it connected up I press play and it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.929 
it connected up I press play and it
choice<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.869> play<00:01:22.080> track<00:01:22.380> 1<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.549> obviously

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
choice to play track 1 but obviously

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.880 
choice to play track 1 but obviously
there's<00:01:24.180> nothing<00:01:24.450> else<00:01:24.570> connected<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.860> I

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
there's nothing else connected so I

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.190 
there's nothing else connected so I
think<00:01:26.159> all<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.790> was<00:01:26.909> wrong<00:01:27.090> with<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.420> was<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
think all that was wrong with it was the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.630 
think all that was wrong with it was the
fact<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.740> battery<00:01:29.130> terminals<00:01:29.520> were

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
fact that the battery terminals were

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.080 
fact that the battery terminals were
completely<00:01:30.000> corroded<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:32.520> only<00:01:32.759> problem

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
completely corroded the only problem

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.440 
completely corroded the only problem
I've<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:33.390> got<00:01:33.659> or<00:01:34.100> quandary<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.270> worth

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
I've now got or quandary is is it worth

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.710 
I've now got or quandary is is it worth
reassembling<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.619> making<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.040> work<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:39.540> I

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
reassembling it and making it work and I

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.520 
reassembling it and making it work and I
think<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.079> answer<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.500> probably<00:01:40.770> no

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
think the answer is probably no

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.539 
think the answer is probably no
potentially<00:01:43.530> somebody<00:01:43.860> could<00:01:43.979> open<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
potentially somebody could open it and

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.350 
potentially somebody could open it and
laser<00:01:45.149> would<00:01:45.450> shine<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.869> their<00:01:46.020> eyes<00:01:47.360> although

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
laser would shine in their eyes although

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.080 
laser would shine in their eyes although
having<00:01:48.659> said<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:50.280> switch<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.549> working

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
having said that the switch is working

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.539 
having said that the switch is working
properly<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.259> should<00:01:52.740> automatically

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
properly so that should automatically

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.080 
properly so that should automatically
switch<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.970> laser<00:01:54.180> off<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.610> sure<00:01:56.850> whether

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
switch the laser off so not sure whether

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.870 
switch the laser off so not sure whether
to<00:01:57.390> reassemble<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.259> into<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> working<00:01:59.130> CD

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
to reassemble it into a working CD

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.170 
to reassemble it into a working CD
player<00:02:00.240> or<00:02:00.509> not<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.960> don't<00:02:01.229> need<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:02.180> and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
player or not I don't need one and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.969 
player or not I don't need one and
personally<00:02:03.930> I'd<00:02:04.020> rather<00:02:04.229> have<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> motors

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
personally I'd rather have the motors

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.819 
personally I'd rather have the motors
out<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.490> use<00:02:05.670> them<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.560> might<00:02:07.799> just

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
out of it and use them so I might just

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.270 
out of it and use them so I might just
reassemble<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:10.619> prove<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.099> can

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
reassemble it to prove that I can

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.490 
reassemble it to prove that I can
and<00:02:12.580> then<00:02:13.180> take<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.570> apart<00:02:13.810> again<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.140> use<00:02:14.470> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
and then take it apart again and use the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.480 
and then take it apart again and use the
bits<00:02:15.810> okay<00:02:16.810> let's<00:02:17.800> see<00:02:18.010> if<00:02:18.070> we<00:02:18.130> can<00:02:18.250> put<00:02:18.400> it

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
bits okay let's see if we can put it

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.610 
bits okay let's see if we can put it
back<00:02:18.640> together<00:02:22.230> sure<00:02:23.230> if<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:23.440> worth<00:02:23.590> just

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
back together sure if it's worth just

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.000 
back together sure if it's worth just
trying<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.190> clean<00:02:24.460> that<00:02:24.730> off<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:25.830> might<00:02:26.830> try

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
trying to clean that off I might try

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.670 
trying to clean that off I might try
that<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:27.460> to<00:02:27.520> get<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.850> work

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
that just to get it to work

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.890 
that just to get it to work
alternatively<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:29.770> could<00:02:29.860> cut<00:02:30.220> up<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.900> piece

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
alternatively I could cut up that piece

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.070 
alternatively I could cut up that piece
I've<00:02:32.140> taken<00:02:32.410> off<00:02:32.590> another<00:02:32.860> one<00:02:33.810> I'll<00:02:34.810> clean

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
I've taken off another one I'll clean

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.300 
I've taken off another one I'll clean
this<00:02:35.200> one<00:02:35.350> up<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:35.530> I'm<00:02:35.740> just<00:02:35.860> gonna<00:02:35.980> get<00:02:36.190> it

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
this one up so I'm just gonna get it

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:45.260 
this one up so I'm just gonna get it
working<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:37.420> then<00:02:37.690> take<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.050> apart<00:02:38.320> again

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.330 

well<00:02:46.270> that<00:02:46.390> didn't<00:02:46.660> go<00:02:46.690> quite<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:47.050> plan<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.739> was

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
well that didn't go quite to plan I was

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.970 
well that didn't go quite to plan I was
happily<00:02:48.640> reassembling<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.660> got<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.709> all<00:02:50.860> the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
happily reassembling it got it all the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.000 
happily reassembling it got it all the
way<00:02:51.100> through<00:02:51.270> testing<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.830> realize<00:02:53.830> the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
way through testing it and realize the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.520 
way through testing it and realize the
camera<00:02:54.370> had<00:02:54.459> stopped<00:02:54.820> recording<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:56.440> I've

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
camera had stopped recording so I've

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.620 
camera had stopped recording so I've
taken<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:57.070> apart<00:02:57.400> again<00:02:59.790> I'll<00:03:00.790> try<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.209> splice

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
taken it apart again I'll try and splice

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.990 
taken it apart again I'll try and splice
it<00:03:01.840> in<00:03:01.930> as<00:03:02.080> best<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.470> can<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:05.520> got<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.610> circuit

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
it in as best I can so got the circuit

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.580 
it in as best I can so got the circuit
board<00:03:07.180> back<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.570> place<00:03:07.890> put<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:08.980> microswitch

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
board back in place put the microswitch

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.039 
board back in place put the microswitch
sliders<00:03:11.590> back<00:03:11.800> in<00:03:11.980> place<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:15.220> we'll<00:03:15.430> put<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
sliders back in place so we'll put the

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:34.700 
sliders back in place so we'll put the
motor<00:03:17.049> assembly<00:03:17.260> back<00:03:17.769> in

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.980 

I<00:03:35.000> suppose<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.060> can<00:03:36.180> always<00:03:36.270> put<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.570> bit<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.750> duct

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
I suppose I can always put a bit of duct

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.590 
I suppose I can always put a bit of duct
tape<00:03:37.260> over<00:03:37.470> there

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
tape over there

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.710 
tape over there
what's<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.780> seat<00:03:43.850> took<00:03:44.850> them<00:03:45.030> off<00:03:45.180> originally

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
what's the seat took them off originally

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.300 
what's the seat took them off originally
in<00:03:45.780> case<00:03:45.960> there<00:03:46.170> was<00:03:46.260> any<00:03:46.410> hidden<00:03:46.740> screws

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
in case there was any hidden screws

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.420 
in case there was any hidden screws
underneath<00:03:47.760> them<00:03:50.810> well

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
underneath them well

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.630 
underneath them well
displays<00:03:53.430> working<00:03:54.030> I'll<00:03:54.540> better<00:03:54.720> find<00:03:54.990> a<00:03:55.080> CD

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
displays working I'll better find a CD

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.620 
displays working I'll better find a CD
and<00:03:56.640> some<00:03:56.880> speakers<00:03:58.220> got<00:03:59.220> some<00:03:59.430> speakers<00:03:59.940> got

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
and some speakers got some speakers got

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:13.130 
and some speakers got some speakers got
a<00:04:00.660> CD<00:04:01.140> with<00:04:01.380> some<00:04:01.560> music<00:04:01.830> on<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:11.900> that's<00:04:12.900> not

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
a CD with some music on it that's not

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:32.940 
a CD with some music on it that's not
detecting<00:04:14.030> shut<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.620> lid

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:40.770 

I<00:04:33.270> see<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:34.570> we've<00:04:34.750> lost<00:04:36.360> yeah<00:04:39.480> so<00:04:40.480> that's<00:04:40.630> the

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
I see so we've lost yeah so that's the

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.950 
I see so we've lost yeah so that's the
other<00:04:40.870> problem<00:04:42.270> we've<00:04:43.270> got<00:04:43.330> nothing<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.720> tell

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
other problem we've got nothing to tell

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.130 
other problem we've got nothing to tell
it<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.140> lid<00:04:44.410> stone<00:04:45.900> didn't<00:04:46.900> notice<00:04:47.260> that

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
it the lid stone didn't notice that

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.870 
it the lid stone didn't notice that
still<00:04:50.140> says<00:04:50.350> open<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.580> only<00:04:54.700> way<00:04:54.850> around

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
still says open so the only way around

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.210 
still says open so the only way around
that<00:04:55.390> would<00:04:55.510> be<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.840> override<00:04:56.230> it<00:04:56.650> and<00:04:56.920> poke

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
that would be to override it and poke

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:07.740 
that would be to override it and poke
something<00:04:57.550> in<00:04:57.820> there

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.240 

it's<00:05:08.470> detected<00:05:08.950> it's<00:05:09.070> got<00:05:09.220> 15<00:05:09.640> tracks<00:05:11.250> that's

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
it's detected it's got 15 tracks that's

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.810 
it's detected it's got 15 tracks that's
visible

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.770 

so<00:05:18.820> this<00:05:18.970> is<00:05:19.090> a<00:05:19.120> bit<00:05:19.300> dangerous<00:05:21.480> what<00:05:22.480> you<00:05:22.600> know

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
so this is a bit dangerous what you know

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.540 
so this is a bit dangerous what you know
isn't<00:05:23.170> dangerous<00:05:23.380> because<00:05:23.950> because<00:05:24.340> that's

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
isn't dangerous because because that's

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.580 
isn't dangerous because because that's
stopping<00:05:24.940> it<00:05:25.060> working<00:05:28.260> still<00:05:29.260> not<00:05:29.410> worth

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
stopping it working still not worth

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:44.100 
stopping it working still not worth
saving<00:05:30.130> but<00:05:30.250> we'll<00:05:30.490> try<00:05:30.730> it<00:05:30.760> out<00:05:42.960> volume<00:05:43.960> we've

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
saving but we'll try it out volume we've

00:05:44.110 --> 00:06:42.200 
saving but we'll try it out volume we've
got<00:05:44.260> set<00:05:44.560> there

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.330 

it's<00:06:43.210> a<00:06:43.300> very<00:06:43.479> quick<00:06:43.750> summary<00:06:44.020> on<00:06:44.440> why<00:06:44.889> I'm<00:06:44.949> not

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
it's a very quick summary on why I'm not

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.620 
it's a very quick summary on why I'm not
gonna<00:06:45.580> attempt<00:06:46.210> to<00:06:46.330> repair<00:06:46.660> this<00:06:47.550> as<00:06:48.550> I<00:06:48.699> say<00:06:48.910> it

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
gonna attempt to repair this as I say it

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.559 
gonna attempt to repair this as I say it
is<00:06:49.660> repairable<00:06:50.819> all<00:06:51.819> that<00:06:51.970> was<00:06:52.060> originally

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:52.569 
is repairable all that was originally

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.570 
is repairable all that was originally
wrong<00:06:52.750> with<00:06:52.900> it<00:06:53.050> was<00:06:53.229> the<00:06:53.460> corroded<00:06:54.460> battery

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
wrong with it was the corroded battery

wouldn't work

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:08.460 
wouldn't work
I<00:07:06.009> could<00:07:06.729> superglue<00:07:07.330> a<00:07:07.569> piece<00:07:07.780> of<00:07:07.930> plastic<00:07:08.319> on

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
I could superglue a piece of plastic on

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.219 
I could superglue a piece of plastic on
there<00:07:08.740> or<00:07:08.979> even<00:07:09.190> melt<00:07:09.669> a<00:07:10.000> piece<00:07:10.389> of<00:07:10.720> plastic<00:07:11.110> on

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:11.229 
there or even melt a piece of plastic on

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:13.050 
there or even melt a piece of plastic on
there<00:07:11.500> using<00:07:11.860> a<00:07:11.949> soldering<00:07:12.340> iron<00:07:12.520> I'm<00:07:12.819> a<00:07:12.880> bit

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060 
there using a soldering iron I'm a bit

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.309 
there using a soldering iron I'm a bit
of<00:07:13.120> plastic<00:07:13.979> so<00:07:14.979> I<00:07:15.009> could<00:07:15.190> fix<00:07:15.400> the<00:07:15.639> lid<00:07:16.319> but

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:17.319 
of plastic so I could fix the lid but

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:22.080 
of plastic so I could fix the lid but
because<00:07:17.680> the<00:07:19.919> little<00:07:20.919> pillar<00:07:21.280> is<00:07:21.729> missing

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.090 
because the little pillar is missing

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.219 
because the little pillar is missing
from<00:07:22.210> just<00:07:22.569> there<00:07:22.949> that<00:07:23.949> goes<00:07:24.190> into<00:07:24.460> the<00:07:25.229> lid

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:26.229 
from just there that goes into the lid

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:32.249 
from just there that goes into the lid
detector<00:07:27.130> switch<00:07:28.919> over<00:07:29.919> here<00:07:31.110> because<00:07:32.110> that's

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:32.259 
detector switch over here because that's

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:34.499 
detector switch over here because that's
missing<00:07:32.800> I<00:07:32.949> could<00:07:33.280> replace<00:07:33.610> it<00:07:33.669> but<00:07:34.150> I'd<00:07:34.300> be

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:34.509 
missing I could replace it but I'd be

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:36.899 
missing I could replace it but I'd be
worried<00:07:34.900> that<00:07:35.650> it<00:07:35.800> break<00:07:36.099> off<00:07:36.280> again<00:07:36.669> and

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:36.909 
worried that it break off again and

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:38.700 
worried that it break off again and
potentially<00:07:37.690> one<00:07:38.080> of<00:07:38.199> my<00:07:38.289> grandchildren

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
potentially one of my grandchildren

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.770 
potentially one of my grandchildren
could<00:07:39.159> get<00:07:39.340> hold<00:07:39.550> of<00:07:39.669> this<00:07:40.380> take<00:07:41.380> the<00:07:41.530> CD<00:07:41.889> off

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:42.780 
could get hold of this take the CD off

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.749 
could get hold of this take the CD off
and<00:07:43.780> actually<00:07:44.199> have<00:07:44.320> the<00:07:44.440> laser<00:07:44.669> shining<00:07:45.669> in

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 
and actually have the laser shining in

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:51.260 
and actually have the laser shining in
their<00:07:45.969> eyes<00:07:47.340> so<00:07:48.340> I'm<00:07:48.820> not<00:07:49.419> going<00:07:49.599> to<00:07:49.690> repair<00:07:50.020> it

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:51.270 
their eyes so I'm not going to repair it

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.640 
their eyes so I'm not going to repair it
but<00:07:52.270> I'm<00:07:52.389> going<00:07:52.659> to<00:07:52.719> take<00:07:52.960> it<00:07:53.080> apart<00:07:53.349> and<00:07:53.530> use

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:53.650 
but I'm going to take it apart and use

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.009 
but I'm going to take it apart and use
the<00:07:53.800> bits
