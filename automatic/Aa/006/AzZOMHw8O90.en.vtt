interchangeable lens cameras out there
we're<00:02:20.790> kind<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.239> poke<00:02:21.390> out<00:02:21.569> just<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.810> little<00:02:21.840> bit

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
we're kind of poke out just a little bit

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.720 
we're kind of poke out just a little bit
more<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.469> that's<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.829> too<00:02:22.980> bad<00:02:23.159> for<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.489> camera

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
more but that's not too bad for a camera

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.190 
more but that's not too bad for a camera
this<00:02:23.939> size<00:02:24.150> now<00:02:24.569> since<00:02:24.750> he<00:02:24.810> does<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.079> this

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
this size now since he does have this

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.599 
this size now since he does have this
little<00:02:25.379> ring<00:02:25.709> right<00:02:25.920> here<00:02:26.069> which<00:02:26.219> is<00:02:26.250> used<00:02:26.579> to

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
little ring right here which is used to

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.940 
little ring right here which is used to
change<00:02:26.879> like<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.510> ISO<00:02:27.959> or<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.349> aperture

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
change like the the ISO or the aperture

in<00:02:33.450> my<00:02:33.540> review<00:02:33.870> I'm<00:02:34.319> on<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.650> back<00:02:34.799> we<00:02:34.980> do<00:02:35.069> have

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
in my review I'm on the back we do have

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.240 
in my review I'm on the back we do have
a<00:02:35.489> three<00:02:35.849> inch<00:02:36.030> LCD<00:02:36.709> extra-fine<00:02:37.709> with<00:02:38.129> the

a three inch LCD extra-fine with the
true<00:02:38.459> black<00:02:38.670> technology<00:02:39.359> so<00:02:39.569> it<00:02:39.629> should<00:02:39.780> be

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
true black technology so it should be

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.209 
true black technology so it should be
really<00:02:39.989> good<00:02:40.260> as<00:02:40.379> far<00:02:40.530> as<00:02:40.650> I'm<00:02:40.980> actually
