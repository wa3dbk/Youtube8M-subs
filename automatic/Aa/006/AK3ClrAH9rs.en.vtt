00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.419
 For the most part, it is well organized 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:19.199
 is played 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.210
 they are the ones they had 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.210
 but in five sentences 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.359
 For me personally, the world is fine but not reduced 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.820
 is 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.160
 not charged too much, the message is clearly recognizable is one 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.220
 This is my personal personal 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.220
 interest 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.410
 for contact between three top tournaments 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.410
 it had to work in a short time 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.990
 the same criteria apply to all, as with many graphic works 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.170
 the handling of typography with writing 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.399
 the color 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.399
 and the design of the pictures 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.360
 a good poster if everything is optimally designed with the poster year too 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.590
 can do without this 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.120
 Color can do without 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.510
 and there is first example 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.330
 what was omitted was omitted 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.550
 only a Peace Council speaks 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.550
 and indeed 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.250
 So for me, a good poster 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.940
 One is not just a hate against the Hawks but they are currently the first 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.940
 Pages is important 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.800
 one square meter of concentrated communication 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.810
 Dr 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.810
 from his experience 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.180
 that the investor was mutually needs to be disposed of 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.390
 not exhausting singer good picture from it is characterized by 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.510
 it's rigid that it gets attention that content 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.079
 in that short words 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.279
 prompt lower limit 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:13.739
 and that will happen 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.109
 bold and natural in a nutshell it is in principle unchanged 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.459
 on 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.829
 these were last in seventh place within a few seconds 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.469
 that it is madness 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.759
 this attention brings 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.489
 Interested 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.489
 that surprises the next round 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.309
 it is a close friend of the prince 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.930
 with John Cleese from 9 9 what is this the kids are climbing 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.079
 Playback of normal and usual 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.299
 the humor is incredibly the idea for the billboard for the graphic for 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.359
 every art form that be 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.120
