and the real trick is to make the puzzle
work<00:01:40.240> yeah<00:01:40.630> just<00:01:40.780> like<00:01:40.900> you<00:01:41.050> said<00:01:41.260> you<00:01:41.440> want<00:01:41.650> to

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
work yeah just like you said you want to

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.620 
work yeah just like you said you want to
pull<00:01:42.040> some<00:01:42.250> big<00:01:42.460> names<00:01:42.670> for<00:01:42.910> some<00:01:43.060> issues<00:01:43.450> you

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
pull some big names for some issues you

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.900 
pull some big names for some issues you
don't<00:01:43.810> want<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.080> mall<00:01:44.320> sad<00:01:44.650> or<00:01:44.920> all<00:01:45.070> happy<00:01:45.460> you

don't want a mall sad or all happy you
got<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.060> find<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.450> flow<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.810> give<00:01:46.960> people<00:01:47.320> a

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
got to find the flow to give people a

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.220 
got to find the flow to give people a
big<00:01:47.740> variety<00:01:47.950> purple<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:48.970> do<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.480> guys<00:01:49.660> write

the<00:02:33.550> quick<00:02:34.240> thing<00:02:34.390> about<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:34.959> don't

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
the quick thing about it is I don't

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.140 
the quick thing about it is I don't
think<00:02:35.380> it's<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:35.740> much<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.920> fat<00:02:36.190> anymore<00:02:36.490> I<00:02:36.850> think

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
think it's so much a fat anymore I think

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.910 
think it's so much a fat anymore I think
it's<00:02:37.270> really<00:02:37.600> become<00:02:37.959> its<00:02:38.140> own<00:02:38.200> genre<00:02:38.350> i<00:02:38.709> think

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
it's really become its own genre i think

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.350 
it's really become its own genre i think
it's<00:02:39.040> like<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.280> Western<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.880> don't<00:02:40.120> think<00:02:40.240> it's

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
it's like the Western I don't think it's

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.180 
it's like the Western I don't think it's
going<00:02:40.510> anywhere<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.170> think<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.680> sort<00:02:42.100> of

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
going anywhere and I think that sort of

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.520 
going anywhere and I think that sort of
gives<00:02:42.400> comfort<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:43.030> people<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.780> then<00:02:44.019> I<00:02:44.350> think

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
gives comfort to people and then I think

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.800 
gives comfort to people and then I think
our<00:02:44.800> book<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.160> different<00:02:45.519> because<00:02:45.880> just<00:02:46.540> the
