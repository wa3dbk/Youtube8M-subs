00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:14.849
 the three tell you want the first 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.119
 red bull is plumb to march with well 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.380
 this is the fixed disassembly so first 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.260
 as the first time come as well 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.250
 various new conversations for expression 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.199
 There are many different shapes and forms 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.599
 first of all who is here for every note 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.880
 2 this is actually the emergency camp 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.520
 Most take that have in my eyes 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.540
 that is exactly how we are here 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.710
 kleinod these are mostly used around 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.300
 for example , with the weather forecast that 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.510
 clapton to mount the first step 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.390
 and now we have every mud note 2 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.760
 which I personally do not give because that 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.039
 relatively inaccurate in my eye is there 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.590
 here the inner part so helped with up 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.690
 arrived later can be taken number 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.100
 however, that is the other part in the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.930
 stande sink so if for example 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.090
 is here reason we have 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.750
 here for example have the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.270
 methods with the finished exactly because of that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.630
 namely on the mess good that 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.880
 same will be mounted immediately 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.340
 and officially make heart with local 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.510
 is the services for companies as the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.000
 slice that now 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.980
 on the outside that was very important 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.790
 the swimmer in the end if a what I 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.730
 just wants to pick 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.720
 that also possible only to pull 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.690
 That's why I really go into the distance 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.610
 is all slices of firm course 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.550
 Also note if the course for 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.190
 War of the 15 gram would carry for it 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.220
 also take it easy because 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.980
 brings nothing emmetten foxconn company had 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.860
 which is expected of the effectiveness of course 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.890
 also mistakes 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.650
 after all, back to the bank 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.180
 I know it like to have a 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.020
 little bit no antenna woman 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.660
 Replace with the fine antenna and 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.270
 complain for the river certain roland 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.860
 accept that has always easy 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.140
 very pure from the 5 you can see that too 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.120
 here on this one is still there 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.120
 more precisely the depth 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.290
 this likes 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.440
 wait for me in st 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.050
 and was like I already forgot 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.180
 that their rent lot thereby in the 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.460
 Middle east is my eyes that will 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.040
 as follows, mount the special 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.030
 hook 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.440
 we have only through the first 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.860
 hole feels here and below you can see it 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.670
 a foam would be in the basket and here 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.860
 there's just a weight falling there 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.580
 90 percent of cases must be bombproof 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.330
 already from 5 now I go from the place 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.980
 where the dead from Tibet is relative 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.870
 hard to throw thereby remains here 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.940
 still much heavier than in the 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.230
 voice over is running meanwhile 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.040
 Funny there you have to be first 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.330
 accustom 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.990
 you can not get the same 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.060
 For example, the room number 1 will be 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.980
 Of course this is sometime in tea 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.860
 From the water far outside you have to take 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.110
 the corresponding smaller ones are there 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.040
 That's why it's the most accurate and you should still 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.040
 a bit out point 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.840
 now is only in the wise to two 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.790
 third is still the wind the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.310
 cord can attract the bow and 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.470
 before the striker also in the 37th 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.810
 Now the roll makes on as now 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.890
 that's just what it 's got 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.170
 the sense that the swimmer is the 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:08.390
 string off the roll 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:13.629
 bohlen partie the worse it comes along 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.629
 the time has fallen further and further 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.520
 at first, he soon has hope as 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.900
 area they are shown at the end 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.039
 The deep ones are a bit unseen 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:44.840
 deeper than the question arises for 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.840
 many back and forth 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.300
 the 0 2 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:08.570
 after the hard now somewhere at the 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:11.770
 good moments club then have a 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:15.460
 little bit rum also the rower 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.930
 Little humorous will be on the company 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.040
 really just nice and taut on the good 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:26.840
 Now let's go and lay with him 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:30.110
 Help with a mark cut 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.600
 flea market everything mark amount reported 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.230
 that he just got ten of opel 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.140
 done 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.270
 exactly on the route but has lots of 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.270
 about with these animals 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:48.050
 Now we have the depth of the route 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:51.620
 now marked change won the bar 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.810
 again out accordingly so again 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.860
 enough slices on this need that 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.690
 first time is operated and changes in 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.669
 a deep determined by grasser 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.130
 and now always speak to that 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.889
 set variably and with the 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:10.130
 Wanted to come soon became over reason 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:13.039
 between want before the trek to the 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.330
 achieving perfect results while doing so 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.310
 Of course you throw the few bananas 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.530
 and accordingly look where the 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.840
 are more effective, respectively 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:25.449
 where it starts are in front of the other 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.449
 acidic they could stop themselves
