00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.230 
and we're going to see if we can get it
hooked<00:00:21.779> up<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.320> running<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.340> less<00:00:23.730> than<00:00:23.970> two

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
hooked up and running in less than two

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.599 
hooked up and running in less than two
hours<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.320> cars<00:00:25.560> down<00:00:25.800> there<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.369> it's

hours to the cars down there and it's

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.960 
hours to the cars down there and it's
getting<00:00:27.029> worked<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.420> it's<00:00:27.720> now<00:00:27.869> 3:00<00:00:28.410> p.m.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
getting worked on it's now 3:00 p.m.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.220 
getting worked on it's now 3:00 p.m.
it's<00:00:29.970> taking<00:00:30.390> much<00:00:30.570> longer<00:00:30.599> than<00:00:30.960> we

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
it's taking much longer than we

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.940 
it's taking much longer than we
anticipated<00:00:31.340> but<00:00:32.780> what<00:00:33.780> we've<00:00:34.050> worked<00:00:34.410> out<00:00:34.649> is

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
anticipated but what we've worked out is

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.250 
anticipated but what we've worked out is
the<00:00:35.399> host<00:00:35.790> lines<00:00:36.180> need<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> go<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.930> first

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the host lines need to go in first

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.369 
the host lines need to go in first
before<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:38.340> actual<00:00:38.670> air<00:00:38.820> struts<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.480> that

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
before the actual air struts so that

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.049 
before the actual air struts so that
will<00:00:40.530> save<00:00:40.710> us<00:00:40.890> some<00:00:41.070> time<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.940> next

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
will save us some time in the next

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.569 
will save us some time in the next
install<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> front<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
install so this is what the front and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.920 
install so this is what the front and
strut<00:00:44.850> looks<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:46.550> nice<00:00:47.570> bellowed<00:00:48.570> sleeve

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930

airbag very slim but suit an air line

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.660 
airbag very slim but suit an air line
and<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:54.449> top<00:00:54.629> mount<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.399> just<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.520> both

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
and the top mount so just to both

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
and the top mount so just to both
prepare<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> nice<00:00:57.390> thing<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:57.690> Erics<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.350> comes

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
prepare a nice thing with Erics it comes

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.400 
prepare a nice thing with Erics it comes
with<00:00:58.980> an<00:00:59.309> all-in-one<00:00:59.699> box<00:01:00.239> where<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
with an all-in-one box where the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.070 
with an all-in-one box where the
compressor<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.370> air<00:01:02.820> tank<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.840> valve

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
compressor is the air tank the valve

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.380 
compressor is the air tank the valve
sits<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.010> smoke<00:01:05.339> glass<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:06.060> behind

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
sits in the smoke glass right behind

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.510 
sits in the smoke glass right behind
this<00:01:06.630> kit<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.409> if<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.369> this

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
this kit but if you can see there this

so<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.950> basically<00:01:11.369> hooks<00:01:11.640> up<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.960> drop

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
so this basically hooks up the drop

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.859 
so this basically hooks up the drop
where<00:01:14.250> we're<00:01:14.729> bringing<00:01:14.820> out<00:01:15.150> four<00:01:15.509> horses

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
where we're bringing out four horses

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.550 
where we're bringing out four horses
which<00:01:16.259> go<00:01:16.500> straight<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.640> side<00:01:17.909> they're

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
which go straight to the side they're

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.340 
which go straight to the side they're

easy hookup positive negative manual

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.890 
easy hookup positive negative manual
switch<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.150> stays<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> trunk

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
switch so that just stays in the trunk

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.350 
switch so that just stays in the trunk

airlines<00:01:40.650> don't<00:01:40.860> scrape<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:42.060> will<00:01:42.329> ensure

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
airlines don't scrape this will ensure

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
that your kit stays Leigha guys so it's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.980 
that your kit stays Leigha guys so it's
almost<00:01:46.770> four<00:01:47.460> o'clock<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.390> got<00:01:48.840> it

almost four o'clock and we got it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.530 
almost four o'clock and we got it
running<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.619> here's<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.310> air<00:01:50.460> box<00:01:50.640> right

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
running so here's the air box right

running so here's the air box right
airlines<00:01:52.350> run<00:01:52.620> through<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.550> just

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
airlines run through and we just

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.340 
airlines run through and we just
switched<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.300> on<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.720> we're<00:01:54.870> going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.110> some

switched it on so we're going to do some

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.790 
switched it on so we're going to do some
pressure<00:01:55.770> test<00:01:56.220> and<00:01:56.460> then<00:01:57.420> we're<00:01:57.870> going<00:01:58.650> to

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
pressure test and then we're going to

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.110 
pressure test and then we're going to
plump<00:01:59.040> up<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.250> air<00:01:59.370> bags<00:01:59.610> put<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.970> wheels

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
rise now on the remote you actually have

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.260 
rise now on the remote you actually have
your<00:02:46.010> readings<00:02:47.010> for<00:02:47.310> your<00:02:47.430> air<00:02:47.700> for<00:02:48.090> each

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
your readings for your air for each

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.080 
your readings for your air for each
corner<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.780> your<00:02:49.260> air<00:02:49.440> tag<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:50.010> always<00:02:50.820> you

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
corner and your air tag so always you

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.210

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
would know what your available air

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.949 
would know what your available air
supply<00:02:53.550> would<00:02:53.610> be<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.450> can<00:02:54.600> also<00:02:54.750> adjust

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
supply would be you can also adjust

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.320 
supply would be you can also adjust
stuff<00:02:55.440> manually<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.640> if<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.880> want<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.120> drop

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
stuff manually so if you want to drop

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.360 
stuff manually so if you want to drop
the<00:02:57.540> front<00:02:57.720> we<00:02:58.050> just<00:02:58.260> press<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.770> down<00:02:58.950> remote

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
the front we just press the down remote

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.120 
the front we just press the down remote
here<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.270> holding<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.920> nose

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
here and holding that and the nose

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.090 
here and holding that and the nose
should<00:03:02.400> be<00:03:02.610> going<00:03:02.880> down<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:04.620> it's<00:03:04.739> going<00:03:04.950> down

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
should be going down so it's going down

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.610 
should be going down so it's going down
slowly<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.970> then<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.360> back<00:03:06.630> will<00:03:07.080> be<00:03:07.110> back

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
slowly and then the back will be back

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.770 
slowly and then the back will be back
here<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.790> can<00:03:08.940> do<00:03:09.030> individual

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
here so you can do individual

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.750 
here so you can do individual
adjustments<00:03:10.440> as<00:03:10.530> well<00:03:10.739> from<00:03:11.220> side<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.640> side

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
adjustments as well from side to side

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.320 
adjustments as well from side to side
and<00:03:12.450> all<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.440> other<00:03:13.650> stuff<00:03:13.860> but<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:15.120> most

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
and all that other stuff but the most

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.479 
and all that other stuff but the most
practical<00:03:15.810> number<00:03:16.470> would<00:03:16.830> be<00:03:16.890> number<00:03:17.280> two

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
practical number would be number two

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:28.289 
practical number would be number two
