00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.410
 hey people thank you again 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.670
 have turned on and today we have 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.279
 here again a new motto and 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.020
 this time it is a kavalier tlg 600 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.809
 group with a working width of six 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.040
 meters and the seven we now to 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.800
 so of course only with the key iks 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.020
 unfolded what actually nice 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.910
 animated is here 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.560
 that's really sad cylinder 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.600
 actually she is beautiful here she is 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.280
 a little bit can somehow because I 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.380
 now otherwise have no other field 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.040
 we have to do this here now 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.530
 he likes gruber already 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.559
 quite wide as you can see for that 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.150
 that the three-point appended here 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.980
 he is already quite wide and 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.630
 that we get the three points to it 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.579
 then finally because 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.310
 yes, as I said, we see us at the end 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:15.530
 then there is of course nothing else 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.240
 except what with woman lower what actually 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.570
 very nice to more is also in the 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.049
 link here also in the ground 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.329
 Here this forest behind is animated and 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.280
 The front roller is always animated 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.829
 So that's really nice 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:37.100
 made yes as I said six meters already 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:38.179
 So you get a good working width 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.789
 you have everything gone here 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.950
 and yes as I said the animations the 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.500
 I like just pretty good the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.539
 the child here from robert's 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.539
 textures are also very nice 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.140
 now somehow lamps or so, the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.899
 has no or any now 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.880
 warning signs but also without that is that 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.890
 nevertheless very nice group also before 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.990
 very many details we see here 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.990
 for example, this little yellow 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.569
 always tag there which also now 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.200
 to mean it 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.599
 Nevertheless, I do not understand it 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.950
 anyway , that's four 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.510
 different is not easy here 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.489
 same but four different ones 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.599
 small signs so that 's really 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.830
 very nicely done that really needs 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:28.220
 say textures are really 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.220
 very nice 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.360
 The collapse also the texture is too 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.879
 It is easy to see here 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.140
 there's a couple of such a few scratching 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.379
 paint a little off that is 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.190
 also write very nice so visually 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.599
 In any case, schonmal 1a and here at 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.920
 the work is really great 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.360
 fun six meters is also a great 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.470
 working width that's really a lot and 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.519
 We'll see it right around dealers back where 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.519
 I still want to show something 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.140
 so we are promised a lot now 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.000
 Trader and you already have maybe 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.159
 not so much weight on the front 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.500
 So that's a two ton concrete 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.310
 court and why I will then off 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.269
 you see the same as said two tons 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.280
 hang out now and want a crew 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.269
 not at least march for the first time exactly 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.299
 That's a good idea to put this way and then 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.010
 we still have the weight there and take 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.660
 then the weight off him 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:39.250
 that is a very weighty one with a 2 yes 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.250
 and now let's have a look at a group 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.080
 we are already tractor of 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.650
 high bed now catch save driving 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.260
 you see century under control already 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.570
 So here you can do a great job 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.530
 Do not drive because we are over 67 km 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.760
 Brand the tractor and steerable 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:04.240
 he wished it was all right 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.290
 You can hardly see it at the front 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.390
 with it the plan 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.100
 So we come back from the group like 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.380
 said a ton and a ton is 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.520
 really much as I mean a ton 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.040
 is not that easy right now 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:24.000
 something and then we have 600 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.000
 kilo bullet now 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.840
 yes and now, of course, is finally over 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:34.360
 now we can not do it anymore 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.860
 drive so that is finally off 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.330
 not yet been made as he 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.340
 just does not see until I do not 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.320
 Weight on the front then have something in the 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.790
 Farming simulator 2011 still 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.810
 works fine now works 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.340
 Of course not anymore 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.460
 Of course that's because of that 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.870
 this whole weight is everything here 13 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.680
 What I actually changed was also changed 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.130
 think very well 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.420
 when he made more realistic is 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.160
 and on the other hand, it probably is 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.570
 Remember that this group here too 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.100
 Hard is my sure of six meters 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.270
 Working width as I have in the beginning 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.070
 I said there was a three-point here 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.230
 suspension 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.940
 yes that's what has already 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.490
 a lot of mass to the people 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.320
 but then come together anyway 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.360
 I'm a little too heavy 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.310
 people two tons of weight as you can see 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.390
 I can go with that in the back 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.520
 know high then you can the group 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.290
 others can do so fairly well 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.460
 drive understeer so that's it 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.870
 a bit overdone my two 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.060
 tons of weight is a hell of a lot 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.880
 and then you can weigh two tons weight 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.580
 are driving with the gross here so the 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.230
 group so brand new come out the 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.720
 Maybe you could be a bit too 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.940
 change that weight here from that 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.730
 group somehow know lessened 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.870
 because that is really something manager 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.100
 a little two tons weight 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.780
 It looks a bit weird, of course 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.580
 You can watch that one 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.760
 somehow a smaller heavy weight 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.200
 but so is that a bit 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.520
 I have that weight two tons 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.030
 needs to drive with that at all 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.280
 but otherwise as already said visually 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.770
 very nice animated is also very nice 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.630
 and definitely recommendable 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.950
 The new one in any case down if you 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.390
 Any questions about the weights 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.740
 or you can download both 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.210
 I do not do that now 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.709
 description purely the links but you can 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.349
 you like me from you a pn or 

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:18.059
 complements the links in the description 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.319
 otherwise thank you for watching it 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:22.729
 well how do we see each other 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:22.729
 next test again until then
