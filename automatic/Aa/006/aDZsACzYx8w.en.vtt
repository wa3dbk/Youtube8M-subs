them<00:01:18.320> yesterday<00:01:19.320> when<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.180> did<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.360> grafting<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
them yesterday when I did the grafting I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.610 
them yesterday when I did the grafting I
made<00:01:22.920> sure<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> Queen<00:01:24.350> was<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
made sure that the Queen was in the

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.040 
made sure that the Queen was in the
bottom<00:01:26.010> brood<00:01:26.250> box<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.880> then<00:01:27.510> I<00:01:27.630> put<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.930> an

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
bottom brood box and then I put on an

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.790 
bottom brood box and then I put on an
excluder<00:01:29.030> if<00:01:30.030> she<00:01:30.330> happens<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.260> top

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
excluder if she happens to be in the top

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.780 
excluder if she happens to be in the top
she<00:01:32.580> will<00:01:32.760> tear<00:01:32.940> down<00:01:33.150> all<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.540> themselves<00:01:37.790> so

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
she will tear down all of themselves so

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.920 
she will tear down all of themselves so
now<00:01:38.940> we're<00:01:39.060> going<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.240> shake<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.540> rest<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
now we're going to shake the rest of the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:51.690 
now we're going to shake the rest of the
bees<00:01:40.080> back<00:01:40.320> in

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.310 

how<00:01:52.700> well<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.119> can<00:01:53.270> see<00:01:53.479> this<00:01:53.720> but<00:01:53.960> this<00:01:54.170> is

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
how well you can see this but this is

how well you can see this but this is
just<00:01:54.500> an<00:01:55.220> idea<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:55.790> mean<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.210> had<00:01:56.420> this<00:01:56.600> box

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
just an idea I mean I had this box

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.620 
just an idea I mean I had this box
loaded<00:01:57.680> with<00:01:57.860> these<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:59.420> there's<00:02:00.320> my<00:02:01.630> sponge

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
loaded with these and there's my sponge

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.490 
loaded with these and there's my sponge
with<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.110> water<00:02:04.540> today<00:02:05.540> it's<00:02:05.720> it's<00:02:06.170> 100

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
with the water today it's it's 100

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.889 
with the water today it's it's 100
degrees<00:02:06.619> here<00:02:07.100> in<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.280> hyah

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
degrees here in a hyah

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:43.250 
degrees here in a hyah
and<00:02:08.899> that's<00:02:09.470> still<00:02:09.770> wet<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:11.500> that's<00:02:12.500> good

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:03:36.360
