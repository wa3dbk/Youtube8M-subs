about<00:00:18.330> particularly<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.770> bear<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.220> boat

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
about particularly the bear the boat

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.910 
about particularly the bear the boat
what<00:00:20.820> size<00:00:21.060> paddle<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:21.960> have<00:00:22.170> over<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
what size paddle do we have over the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.009 
what size paddle do we have over the
years<00:00:23.010> paddles<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:23.880> shortened<00:00:24.359> freestyle

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
years paddles have shortened freestyle

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.689 
years paddles have shortened freestyle
they<00:00:25.380> want<00:00:25.590> them<00:00:25.680> really<00:00:25.890> short<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.460> they

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
they want them really short but they

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.330 
they want them really short but they
won't<00:00:26.970> close<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.269> your<00:00:27.480> body<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.010> boat

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
won't close to your body but in a boat

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.389 
won't close to your body but in a boat
that's<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.789> 10<00:00:30.330> foot<00:00:30.660> or<00:00:30.990> our<00:00:31.410> normal<00:00:31.830> kayak<00:00:32.160> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
that's the 10 foot or our normal kayak a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.000 
that's the 10 foot or our normal kayak a
longer<00:00:32.940> paddle<00:00:33.390> gives<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> longer<00:00:34.649> stroke

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
longer paddle gives you a longer stroke

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.180 
longer paddle gives you a longer stroke
and<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:36.390> equate<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.930> paddle<00:00:37.350> with<00:00:37.469> glide<00:00:37.829> for

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and I equate the paddle with glide for

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.660 
and I equate the paddle with glide for
stroke<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.480> lessen<00:00:40.140> my<00:00:40.379> stroke<00:00:41.250> rate

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
stroke if I can lessen my stroke rate

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.529 
stroke if I can lessen my stroke rate
and<00:00:42.059> glide<00:00:42.899> more<00:00:43.520> it's<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.730> easier<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.329> it

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and glide more it's just easier and it

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.580 
and glide more it's just easier and it
will<00:00:46.410> equal<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> lot<00:00:47.789> better<00:00:48.210> day<00:00:48.660> getting

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
will equal to a lot better day getting

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.470 
will equal to a lot better day getting
the<00:00:49.620> miles<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.430> particularly<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.030> kayak

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the miles and particularly for kayak

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:02.599

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
canyon a 12-day trip and I took two

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.100 
canyon a 12-day trip and I took two
units<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.920> know<00:02:14.070> one<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.760> paddle<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.600> one<00:02:15.960> to

units you know one to paddle in one to

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.690 
units you know one to paddle in one to
sleep<00:02:16.350> in<00:02:16.620> thought<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:16.950> was<00:02:17.130> great<00:02:17.400> because

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
sleep in thought that was great because

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.970 
sleep in thought that was great because
they<00:02:18.030> could<00:02:18.240> all<00:02:18.510> turn<00:02:18.720> eight<00:02:18.990> if<00:02:19.500> one<00:02:19.770> was

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
they could all turn eight if one was

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.460 
they could all turn eight if one was
