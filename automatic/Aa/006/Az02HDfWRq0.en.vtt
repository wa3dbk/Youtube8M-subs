00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
the most part I have to win that battle

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.670

Michael Jordan I'm not a Wayne Gretzky

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.750 
Michael Jordan I'm not a Wayne Gretzky
but<00:03:41.200> it's<00:03:41.530> kind<00:03:41.829> of<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.010> same<00:03:42.280> thing<00:03:42.610> that

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
but it's kind of the same thing that

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.990 
but it's kind of the same thing that
drives<00:03:43.000> them

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
drives them

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.820 
drives them
they<00:03:44.540> were<00:03:44.600> good<00:03:44.900> athletes<00:03:45.350> but<00:03:45.620> they<00:03:45.740> had

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
they were good athletes but they had

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.040 
they were good athletes but they had
something<00:03:46.280> else<00:03:46.490> that<00:03:46.850> that<00:03:47.210> clicked<00:03:47.690> that

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
something else that that clicked that

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.500 
something else that that clicked that
made<00:03:48.440> them<00:03:48.740> want<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.370> win<00:03:49.670> they<00:03:50.120> pushed

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
made them want to win they pushed

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.540 
made them want to win they pushed
themselves<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:51.260> that's<00:03:51.860> something<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:52.520> I

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
themselves and that's something that I

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.250 
themselves and that's something that I
think<00:03:52.640> every<00:03:53.030> photographer<00:03:53.360> needs<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:54.020> do<00:03:54.140> as

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
think every photographer needs to do as

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.350 
think every photographer needs to do as
well<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:55.130> have<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.340> approach<00:03:55.610> it<00:03:55.820> almost<00:03:56.150> like

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
well you have to approach it almost like

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.070 
well you have to approach it almost like
an<00:03:56.480> athlete<00:03:56.840> train<00:03:57.560> hard<00:03:57.830> practice<00:03:58.430> hard

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
concentration just gets funneled in

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.760

light is great and clouds or water
visibility<00:04:53.180> is<00:04:53.240> good<00:04:53.510> and<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:54.740> things<00:04:54.979> start

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
visibility is good and the things start

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.670 
visibility is good and the things start
happening<00:04:55.430> and<00:04:55.910> you<00:04:56.479> know<00:04:56.660> that's<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.290> moment

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
happening and you know that's the moment

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.110 
happening and you know that's the moment
what<00:04:57.919> you're<00:04:58.190> waiting<00:04:58.400> for

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
what you're waiting for

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.780 
what you're waiting for
by<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.020> fourth<00:05:00.800> quarter<00:05:01.130> or<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.550> third

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
by the fourth quarter or the third

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.659 
by the fourth quarter or the third
period<00:05:02.120> I<00:05:02.570> have<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:03.110> be<00:05:03.200> fine-tuned<00:05:03.890> so<00:05:04.400> I

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
period I have to be fine-tuned so I

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.240 
period I have to be fine-tuned so I
don't<00:05:04.970> miss<00:05:05.150> that<00:05:05.210> shot<00:05:05.720> I<00:05:06.050> think<00:05:06.979> it's<00:05:07.100> just

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
don't miss that shot I think it's just

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.870 
don't miss that shot I think it's just
something<00:05:07.570> you<00:05:08.570> know<00:05:08.690> pretty<00:05:08.930> deep<00:05:09.229> down<00:05:09.880> you

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
something you know pretty deep down you

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.480 
something you know pretty deep down you
know<00:05:11.000> down<00:05:11.210> inside<00:05:12.070> there's<00:05:13.070> a<00:05:13.160> joy<00:05:13.460> that

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
know down inside there's a joy that

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.450 
know down inside there's a joy that
comes<00:05:13.820> from<00:05:13.970> it<00:05:14.240> from<00:05:15.220> accomplishment<00:05:16.220> I

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
comes from it from accomplishment I

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.790 
comes from it from accomplishment I
think<00:05:16.910> that's<00:05:17.090> why<00:05:17.240> I<00:05:17.270> sort<00:05:17.690> of<00:05:17.780> explode<00:05:18.530> with

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
think that's why I sort of explode with

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.620 
think that's why I sort of explode with
excitement<00:05:18.830> when<00:05:19.550> I<00:05:19.580> get<00:05:19.820> a<00:05:19.850> great<00:05:20.090> shot

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
excitement when I get a great shot

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.590 
excitement when I get a great shot
it's<00:05:21.260> the<00:05:21.470> overcoming<00:05:22.370> of<00:05:22.520> everything<00:05:23.450> that

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
it's the overcoming of everything that

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.900 
it's the overcoming of everything that
goes<00:05:23.780> on<00:05:24.020> around<00:05:24.260> sometimes<00:05:25.010> it<00:05:25.220> can<00:05:25.400> be<00:05:25.520> way

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
goes on around sometimes it can be way

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.300 
goes on around sometimes it can be way
some<00:05:26.450> on<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:26.990> sitter<00:05:27.229> face<00:05:27.470> and<00:05:27.770> when<00:05:28.070> you<00:05:28.160> go

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
some on the sitter face and when you go

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.540 
some on the sitter face and when you go
down<00:05:28.340> it's<00:05:28.970> just<00:05:29.330> so<00:05:30.140> quiet<00:05:30.470> and<00:05:31.070> somehow<00:05:31.490> you

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
down it's just so quiet and somehow you

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.730 
down it's just so quiet and somehow you
have<00:05:31.820> to<00:05:31.850> narrow<00:05:32.690> it<00:05:32.870> down<00:05:32.900> and<00:05:33.229> just<00:05:33.290> like<00:05:33.620> an

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
have to narrow it down and just like an

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.190 
have to narrow it down and just like an
athlete<00:05:33.890> it<00:05:34.550> all<00:05:34.700> goes<00:05:34.910> quiet<00:05:35.150> when<00:05:35.660> you<00:05:35.810> know

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200
