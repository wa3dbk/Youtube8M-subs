now I'm running clockworkmod version 4.0
point<00:00:23.609> 1.5<00:00:24.680> but<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.039> letting<00:00:26.580> you

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
know how you guys can update to and get

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.779 
know how you guys can update to and get
the<00:00:28.560> latest<00:00:28.710> basically<00:00:29.340> what<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.609> going<00:00:29.730> to

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the latest basically what it's going to

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.830 
the latest basically what it's going to
do<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.390> allow<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.660> be<00:00:30.810> a

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
do is it's going to allow it to be a

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.060 
do is it's going to allow it to be a
little<00:00:30.869> more<00:00:31.080> stable<00:00:31.349> I'm<00:00:31.650> sure<00:00:31.800> it'll<00:00:31.920> be<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
little more stable I'm sure it'll be a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.090 
little more stable I'm sure it'll be a
little<00:00:32.250> more<00:00:32.369> faster<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:34.140> I'm<00:00:34.620> sure<00:00:34.890> it's

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
little more faster and I'm sure it's

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.620 
little more faster and I'm sure it's
just<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.550> overall<00:00:35.969> better

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
just going to be overall better

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.510 
just going to be overall better
clockworkmod<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.770> I'm<00:00:37.950> definitely

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
clockworkmod so I'm definitely

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.819 
clockworkmod so I'm definitely
recommending<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.390> update<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.620> it's

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
recommending you to update to it it's

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.889 
recommending you to update to it it's
it's<00:00:41.340> quite<00:00:41.579> easy<00:00:41.610> as<00:00:42.030> long<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it's quite easy as long as you do have a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.330 
it's quite easy as long as you do have a
previous<00:00:43.440> version<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.800> clockworkmod

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
previous version of clockworkmod

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
previous version of clockworkmod
obviously<00:00:44.789> you're<00:00:44.879> going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.090> need<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.210> be

all I'm gonna have to do is go ahead and

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.760 
all I'm gonna have to do is go ahead and
power<00:02:23.620> off<00:02:23.980> my<00:02:24.310> photon<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:26.470> now<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.710> my

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
power off my photon and now that my

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.440 
power off my photon and now that my
photon<00:02:27.190> has<00:02:27.370> shut<00:02:27.640> off<00:02:27.670> I'm<00:02:28.000> going<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.210> need<00:02:28.300> to

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
photon has shut off I'm going to need to

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.930 
photon has shut off I'm going to need to
go<00:02:28.600> into<00:02:28.900> clockwork<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.800> do<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.130> volume<00:02:30.700> down

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
go into clockwork to do this volume down

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.910 
go into clockwork to do this volume down
and<00:02:31.360> power<00:02:31.390> button<00:02:31.930> at<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.080> same<00:02:32.140> time<00:02:32.560> press

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920

and power button at the same time press
and<00:02:33.160> hold<00:02:33.190> those<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.510> see<00:02:34.750> fastboot<00:02:35.470> at

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
and hold those so you see fastboot at

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.070 
and hold those so you see fastboot at
the<00:02:35.830> top<00:02:36.070> right<00:02:36.550> there<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.030> then<00:02:37.600> you'll<00:02:37.900> see

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
the top right there and then you'll see

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.740 
the top right there and then you'll see
fastboot<00:02:38.530> hit<00:02:38.740> volume<00:02:39.220> down<00:02:39.520> until<00:02:40.330> you<00:02:40.540> get

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
fastboot hit volume down until you get

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.410 
fastboot hit volume down until you get
to<00:02:40.960> Android<00:02:41.710> recovery<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:42.850> keep<00:02:43.120> hitting

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
to Android recovery so keep hitting

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.150 
to Android recovery so keep hitting
volume<00:02:43.810> down<00:02:44.020> until<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.500> get<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.710> Android

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
volume down until you get to Android

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.890 
volume down until you get to Android
recovery<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.000> when<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.210> says<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.690> hit

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
recovery and when it says that hit

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.410 
recovery and when it says that hit
volume<00:02:47.260> up<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.650> selected<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.760> select<00:02:49.120> Android

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
volume up to selected so select Android

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.910 
volume up to selected so select Android
recovery<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.960> says<00:02:50.110> entering<00:02:50.560> Android

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
recovery it says entering Android

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
recovery mode what that's going to do is

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.090 
recovery mode what that's going to do is
boo<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:52.750> into<00:02:53.080> clockwork<00:02:53.590> whatever<00:02:53.860> version

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
boo you into clockwork whatever version

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.210 
boo you into clockwork whatever version
you<00:02:54.310> have<00:02:54.610> as<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:56.470> can<00:02:56.590> see<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:56.950> have

you have as you can see I have

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.820 
you have as you can see I have
clockworkmod<00:02:57.870> version<00:02:58.870> 4.0<00:02:59.830> point<00:03:00.190> 1.5<00:03:01.830> right

clockworkmod version 4.0 point 1.5 right

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.270 
clockworkmod version 4.0 point 1.5 right
there<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:03.720> obviously<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.780> have<00:03:05.020> it's<00:03:05.740> blue<00:03:06.070> as

select<00:04:58.070> it<00:04:58.220> it's<00:04:59.120> going<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.300> enter<00:04:59.780> android

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
select it it's going to enter android

recovery<00:05:00.560> it's<00:05:00.650> going<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:00.860> basically<00:05:00.980> go<00:05:01.340> into

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
recovery it's going to basically go into

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.580 
recovery it's going to basically go into
the<00:05:01.700> updated<00:05:02.120> clockworkmod<00:05:02.630> version<00:05:02.960> 5.0

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
the updated clockworkmod version 5.0

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.980 
the updated clockworkmod version 5.0
point<00:05:03.770> 2<00:05:03.919> point<00:05:04.130> 3<00:05:04.250> so<00:05:05.240> there<00:05:05.390> you<00:05:05.419> go<00:05:05.540> as<00:05:05.900> you

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
point 2 point 3 so there you go as you

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.680 
point 2 point 3 so there you go as you
can<00:05:06.110> see<00:05:06.410> clockworkmod<00:05:07.340> based<00:05:07.550> recovery<00:05:07.700> 5.0

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
can see clockworkmod based recovery 5.0

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.600 
can see clockworkmod based recovery 5.0
point<00:05:08.870> two<00:05:09.050> point<00:05:09.260> three<00:05:09.440> right<00:05:09.890> there<00:05:09.919> so<00:05:10.430> now

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
point two point three right there so now

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.580 
point two point three right there so now
you<00:05:10.669> do<00:05:11.120> have<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.360> updated<00:05:11.660> clockwork<00:05:12.320> as<00:05:12.500> you

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
you do have the updated clockwork as you

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.760 
you do have the updated clockwork as you
can<00:05:12.680> see<00:05:12.830> it's<00:05:12.980> nice<00:05:13.730> blue<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.270> it<00:05:14.770> obviously

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
can see it's nice blue to it obviously

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.740 
can see it's nice blue to it obviously
you<00:05:15.950> got<00:05:16.160> all<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.490> same<00:05:16.730> options<00:05:17.240> wipe<00:05:17.450> cache

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
you got all the same options wipe cache

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.890 
you got all the same options wipe cache
wipe<00:05:18.140> data<00:05:18.470> all<00:05:18.860> those<00:05:19.070> install<00:05:19.490> zip

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
wipe data all those install zip

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.760

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
basically you got all these different

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.610 
basically you got all these different
options<00:05:22.310> so<00:05:22.760> you're<00:05:23.330> good<00:05:23.479> to<00:05:23.570> go<00:05:23.620> basically

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
options so you're good to go basically

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.469 
options so you're good to go basically
it<00:05:24.710> says<00:05:24.860> it's<00:05:25.100> based<00:05:25.310> off<00:05:25.460> a<00:05:25.550> clockwork<00:05:25.940> mod<00:05:26.090> 5

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
it says it's based off a clockwork mod 5

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.690 
it says it's based off a clockwork mod 5
as<00:05:26.750> opposed<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.260> clockwork<00:05:27.530> month<00:05:27.889> for<00:05:28.250> so<00:05:28.580> it

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
as opposed to clockwork month for so it

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.070 
as opposed to clockwork month for so it
should<00:05:28.850> be<00:05:29.000> more<00:05:29.150> stable<00:05:29.419> it<00:05:29.750> should<00:05:29.930> be<00:05:30.050> a

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
should be more stable it should be a

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.500 
should be more stable it should be a
little<00:05:30.229> faster<00:05:30.710> so<00:05:31.430> I'm<00:05:31.970> definitely<00:05:32.120> going<00:05:32.419> to

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
little faster so I'm definitely going to

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.550 
little faster so I'm definitely going to
go<00:05:32.570> ahead<00:05:32.660> and<00:05:32.750> recommend<00:05:33.200> that<00:05:33.290> you<00:05:33.410> to

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
go ahead and recommend that you to

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.990 
go ahead and recommend that you to
update<00:05:33.770> your<00:05:33.979> clockwork<00:05:34.340> mod<00:05:34.669> to<00:05:34.880> this

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
update your clockwork mod to this

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.490 
update your clockwork mod to this
version<00:05:35.479> and<00:05:35.690> then<00:05:35.900> you'll<00:05:36.110> be<00:05:36.229> good<00:05:36.350> to<00:05:36.410> go

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
version and then you'll be good to go

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.890 
version and then you'll be good to go
