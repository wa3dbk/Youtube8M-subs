and stick it on smaller you make the
pieces<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.340> easier<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.270> cover<00:03:35.690> because

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
pieces the easier it is to cover because

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.900 
pieces the easier it is to cover because
the<00:03:36.320> body<00:03:36.500> is<00:03:36.620> contoured<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:43.250> just<00:03:43.519> cover<00:03:43.730> the
