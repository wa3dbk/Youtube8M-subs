00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
hey but that's the most important thing

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.190 
hey but that's the most important thing
if<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.129> don't<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:18.470> difficult<00:02:20.200> we

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
if you don't do that it's difficult we

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.009 
if you don't do that it's difficult we
also<00:02:21.349> went<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:22.250> an<00:02:23.030> other<00:02:23.239> River<00:02:23.569> during<00:02:23.840> this

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
also went to an other River during this

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.509 
also went to an other River during this
day<00:02:24.230> yes

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
day yes

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.440 
day yes
Rena<00:02:26.090> river<00:02:26.390> yeah<00:02:27.970> what<00:02:28.970> do<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.120> think<00:02:29.180> of

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
Rena river yeah what do you think of

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.380 
Rena river yeah what do you think of
that<00:02:29.569> River<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.170> also<00:02:30.680> has<00:02:31.190> being<00:02:31.760> in<00:02:31.970> Tree

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
that River and also has being in Tree

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.460 
that River and also has being in Tree
Hill<00:02:34.180> what<00:02:35.180> do<00:02:35.299> you<00:02:35.360> think<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.840> exactly

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
Hill what do you think of that exactly

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.990 
Hill what do you think of that exactly
that<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.700> result<00:02:38.330> is<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.510> much<00:02:38.810> easier<00:02:38.840> River

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
that the result is a much easier River

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.390 
that the result is a much easier River
then<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.629> arena<00:02:41.870> where<00:02:42.140> we<00:02:42.260> were<00:02:42.440> especially

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
then the arena where we were especially

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.610 
then the arena where we were especially
now<00:02:43.910> well<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.360> trees<00:02:44.630> are<00:02:44.810> almost<00:02:44.959> underwater

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
now well the trees are almost underwater

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.120 
now well the trees are almost underwater
and<00:02:46.459> you<00:02:46.940> have<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.239> float<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:47.750> fast<00:02:48.079> and<00:02:48.440> still

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
and you have to float so fast and still

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.069 
and you have to float so fast and still
we<00:02:49.340> find<00:02:49.610> some<00:02:49.819> places<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:52.660> another<00:02:53.660> thing<00:02:53.930> is

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
we find some places and another thing is

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.870 
we find some places and another thing is
this<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.410> course<00:02:54.680> if<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.069> can't<00:02:55.400> read<00:02:55.700> the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
this of course if you can't read the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.940 
this of course if you can't read the
water<00:02:56.120> then<00:02:56.959> it<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:57.260> difficult

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
water then it is difficult

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.330 
water then it is difficult
yeah<00:02:58.610> but<00:02:59.269> so<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.540> again<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.500> have<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.040> listen

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
yeah but so you again you have to listen

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.059 
yeah but so you again you have to listen
to<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.579> guides<00:03:02.049> they<00:03:03.049> know<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.379> places<00:03:03.650> and

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
to the guides they know the places and

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.130 
to the guides they know the places and
they<00:03:04.190> know<00:03:04.370> how<00:03:04.549> to<00:03:04.610> fish<00:03:04.910> in<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.930> way<00:03:06.079> you

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
they know how to fish in and the way you

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.080 
they know how to fish in and the way you
have<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.590> fish

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090

all the same yeah I also have to say
that<00:03:23.410> we<00:03:24.410> have<00:03:24.530> been<00:03:24.739> trying<00:03:25.040> and

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
that we have been trying and

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.490 
that we have been trying and
experimenting<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:26.030> little<00:03:26.120> bit<00:03:26.359> also<00:03:27.019> with<00:03:27.410> the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
experimenting a little bit also with the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.259 
experimenting a little bit also with the
health<00:03:27.680> of<00:03:27.829> your<00:03:27.889> knowledge<00:03:28.400> as<00:03:28.579> well<00:03:28.760> yeah<00:03:29.060> so

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
health of your knowledge as well yeah so

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.900 
health of your knowledge as well yeah so
yeah<00:03:29.720> yeah<00:03:30.560> clearly<00:03:30.950> you<00:03:31.340> need<00:03:31.459> more<00:03:31.670> advice

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
yeah yeah clearly you need more advice

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.949 
yeah yeah clearly you need more advice
for<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.180> yeah<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:33.290> find<00:03:33.530> out<00:03:33.709> but<00:03:33.889> I<00:03:34.099> think

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
for that yeah to find out but I think

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.620 
for that yeah to find out but I think
the<00:03:35.959> best<00:03:36.170> way<00:03:36.380> is<00:03:36.410> with<00:03:36.829> the<00:03:36.859> boat<00:03:37.389> yeah<00:03:38.389> and

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
the best way is with the boat yeah and

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.099 
the best way is with the boat yeah and
it's<00:03:38.750> also<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.170> easiest<00:03:39.530> way<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:41.720> handle<00:03:42.019> the

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
it's also the easiest way you handle the

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.190 
it's also the easiest way you handle the
boat<00:03:42.290> very<00:03:42.560> well<00:03:42.859> and<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:43.910> were<00:03:44.599> happy<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:44.930> you
