um<00:01:47.600> 5542<00:01:48.600> that's<00:01:49.140> not<00:01:49.320> even<00:01:49.560> very<00:01:49.649> many<00:01:49.860> kills

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
um 5542 that's not even very many kills

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.550 
um 5542 that's not even very many kills
well<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.030> lot<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.270> deaths<00:01:51.479> i<00:01:51.689> guess<00:01:51.930> most

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
well as a lot of deaths i guess most

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.370 
well as a lot of deaths i guess most
valuable<00:01:52.979> kill<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.579> 137<00:01:54.420> mill<00:01:54.570> no

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
valuable kill what is that 137 mill no

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.789 
valuable kill what is that 137 mill no
way<00:01:55.530> no<00:01:55.890> 13<00:01:56.490> mil<00:01:56.670> yeah<00:01:57.119> 13<00:01:57.420> not<00:01:57.540> okay<00:01:57.840> right<00:01:58.259> I'm

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
way no 13 mil yeah 13 not okay right I'm

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.050 
way no 13 mil yeah 13 not okay right I'm
not<00:01:58.829> saying<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.159> okay<00:01:59.490> hoping<00:01:59.790> that's<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.000> it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
not saying that okay hoping that's in it

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.020 
not saying that okay hoping that's in it
anyway<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.439> pretty<00:02:01.710> bad<00:02:02.040> cut<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.430> 30<00:02:02.670> I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
anyway so it's a pretty bad cut a 30 I

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.789 
anyway so it's a pretty bad cut a 30 I
will<00:02:03.450> say<00:02:03.689> though<00:02:03.840> that's<00:02:04.079> better<00:02:04.590> than<00:02:04.770> what

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
will say though that's better than what

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.069 
will say though that's better than what
I<00:02:04.979> expected<00:02:05.479> that<00:02:06.479> being<00:02:06.689> said<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.020> reason

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
I expected that being said the reason

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.270 
I expected that being said the reason
why<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.320> wanted<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.590> show<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.069> video

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
why I wanted to show that in this video

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.400 
why I wanted to show that in this video
because<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:08.849> they<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.209> somehow<00:02:09.720> let<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.140> track

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
because if they do somehow let you track

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.229 
because if they do somehow let you track
your<00:02:10.590> kill<00:02:10.770> death<00:02:10.860> ratio<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.400> ruthie<00:02:11.580> 2007

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
your kill death ratio and ruthie 2007

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.280 
your kill death ratio and ruthie 2007
which<00:02:12.270> they<00:02:12.569> didn't<00:02:12.930> before

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
which they didn't before

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.410 
which they didn't before
so<00:02:13.799> if<00:02:13.920> they<00:02:14.010> somehow<00:02:14.189> introduce<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.790> different

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
so if they somehow introduce a different

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.140 
so if they somehow introduce a different
will<00:02:15.629> wild<00:02:16.439> stalker<00:02:16.739> helmet<00:02:17.219> thing<00:02:17.459> that'd<00:02:18.030> be

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
will wild stalker helmet thing that'd be

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.149 
will wild stalker helmet thing that'd be
cool<00:02:18.329> because<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.989> was<00:02:19.200> not<00:02:19.859> going<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.040> say<00:02:20.129> I

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
cool because I was not going to say I

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.530 
cool because I was not going to say I
was<00:02:20.250> indestructible<00:02:20.549> but<00:02:21.120> when<00:02:21.329> I<00:02:21.359> was
