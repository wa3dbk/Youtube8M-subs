00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
way to actually hold them in place so

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.130 
way to actually hold them in place so
they're<00:01:43.610> always<00:01:43.759> going<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.180> jiggle<00:01:44.689> about<00:01:44.960> and

they're always going to jiggle about and
stuff<00:01:45.439> and<00:01:46.600> also<00:01:48.159> because<00:01:49.159> you<00:01:49.430> pull<00:01:49.729> razor

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
stuff and also because you pull razor

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.999 
stuff and also because you pull razor
claws<00:01:51.860> legs<00:01:52.250> apart<00:01:52.640> for<00:01:53.180> these<00:01:53.329> yellow<00:01:53.630> bits

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
claws legs apart for these yellow bits

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.080 
claws legs apart for these yellow bits
they<00:01:55.009> they<00:01:55.520> have<00:01:55.729> a<00:01:55.759> tendency<00:01:57.220> excuse<00:01:58.220> me<00:01:58.400> to

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
they they have a tendency excuse me to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.870 
they they have a tendency excuse me to
go<00:01:59.299> back<00:01:59.509> in<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.710> then<00:02:01.009> that's<00:02:01.220> kind<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.549> skews

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
go back in and then that's kind of skews

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.170 
go back in and then that's kind of skews
the<00:02:01.909> legs<00:02:02.810> of<00:02:03.049> it<00:02:03.200> which<00:02:03.409> isn't<00:02:03.560> good<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.340> is

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
the legs of it which isn't good and is

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.109 
the legs of it which isn't good and is
quite<00:02:05.689> loose<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.350> mean<00:02:06.560> these<00:02:07.130> bits<00:02:07.460> can<00:02:07.640> go<00:02:07.850> and

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
quite loose I mean these bits can go and

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.419 
quite loose I mean these bits can go and
the<00:02:08.750> insides<00:02:09.110> of<00:02:09.259> is<00:02:09.409> the<00:02:09.799> yellow<00:02:09.950> bits<00:02:10.189> of<00:02:10.310> his

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
the insides of is the yellow bits of his

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:10.990 
the insides of is the yellow bits of his
arms

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
arms

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.670

if<00:02:12.000> you're<00:02:12.480> not<00:02:12.630> then<00:02:12.900> they<00:02:13.080> can<00:02:13.290> go<00:02:13.320> in<00:02:13.560> as

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
if you're not then they can go in as

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.250 
if you're not then they can go in as
well<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.720> assume<00:02:16.280> it's<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.940> basic<00:02:18.720> floor<00:02:19.050> with

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
well I assume it's a basic floor with

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.290 
well I assume it's a basic floor with
the<00:02:19.380> figure<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:20.040> I'm<00:02:20.190> not<00:02:20.400> completely<00:02:21.060> sure

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
the figure but I'm not completely sure

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.700 
the figure but I'm not completely sure
but<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:23.790> doesn't<00:02:24.540> matter<00:02:24.660> it's<00:02:25.470> only

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
but that doesn't matter it's only

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.080 
but that doesn't matter it's only
matters<00:02:26.100> really<00:02:26.280> if<00:02:26.490> you're<00:02:26.640> playing<00:02:26.850> with

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
matters really if you're playing with

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.420 
matters really if you're playing with
him<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.390> for<00:02:28.170> us<00:02:28.200> collectors<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:29.100> shouldn't

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
him and for us collectors we shouldn't

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.680 
him and for us collectors we shouldn't
really<00:02:29.580> be<00:02:29.760> playing<00:02:30.150> with<00:02:30.300> them<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.540> should

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
really be playing with them we should

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.600 
really be playing with them we should
just<00:02:30.870> have<00:02:31.320> them<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:31.800> display<00:02:32.220> case<00:02:32.460> and

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
just have them in like display case and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.949 
just have them in like display case and
go<00:02:32.700> aw<00:02:32.990> he's<00:02:33.990> awesome<00:02:34.230> which<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.710> what<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:34.890> do<00:02:35.040> I

love it it is really good and all of the
bits<00:02:39.750> look<00:02:40.350> excellent<00:02:40.830> on<00:02:41.160> him<00:02:41.780> every<00:02:42.780> figure

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
bits look excellent on him every figure

is unfortunately the pricing for
Predaking<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.370> very<00:02:57.330> expensive<00:02:57.660> if<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:59.670> want

to get the reissue that is about I don't
know<00:03:05.810> 134<00:03:06.810> thing<00:03:07.140> that's<00:03:07.320> what<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.500> paid<00:03:07.890> and

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
know 134 thing that's what I paid and

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.540 
know 134 thing that's what I paid and
that<00:03:08.130> was<00:03:08.340> just<00:03:08.550> for<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.480> figure<00:03:09.810> in<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:09.989> box

that was just for the figure in the box
it'll<00:03:11.550> probably<00:03:11.790> cost<00:03:12.030> more<00:03:12.330> for<00:03:12.390> postage<00:03:13.050> and

it's just nicely presented as well in
this<00:03:46.620> little<00:03:46.950> box<00:03:47.480> so<00:03:48.480> yes<00:03:48.720> he<00:03:49.709> he<00:03:50.100> is<00:03:50.430> also

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
this little box so yes he he is also

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.850 
this little box so yes he he is also
bigger<00:03:51.209> than<00:03:51.480> all<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.959> combiners<00:03:52.530> as<00:03:52.680> well

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
bigger than all of the combiners as well

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.610 
bigger than all of the combiners as well
because<00:03:53.220> each<00:03:53.400> part<00:03:53.760> each<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.420> his<00:03:54.570> limbs<00:03:55.049> is

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
because each part each of his limbs is

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.850 
because each part each of his limbs is
the<00:03:56.010> size<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.880> body<00:03:57.750> basically<00:03:58.500> for<00:03:58.739> like

the size of a body basically for like

lot taller which is make some uniqueness
but<00:04:07.860> i<00:04:08.030> think<00:04:09.030> i'm<00:04:09.269> not<00:04:09.450> sure<00:04:09.720> but<00:04:09.920> as<00:04:10.920> far<00:04:11.130> as<00:04:11.190> i

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
but i think i'm not sure but as far as i

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.440 
but i think i'm not sure but as far as i
know<00:04:11.519> this<00:04:11.730> figure<00:04:12.299> was<00:04:12.570> i<00:04:13.940> think<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.120> first

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
know this figure was i think the first

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.010 
know this figure was i think the first
figure<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.590> first<00:04:16.829> combiner<00:04:17.930> for<00:04:18.930> the

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
figure the first combiner for the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.150 
figure the first combiner for the
