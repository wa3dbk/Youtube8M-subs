a<00:00:39.719> thin<00:00:40.079> layer<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:41.550> all<00:00:41.790> over<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> nail

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.160 

you<00:00:50.090> want<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.300> do<00:00:50.420> that<00:00:50.570> on<00:00:50.629> all<00:00:50.719> 10<00:00:50.960> fingers

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
you want to do that on all 10 fingers

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.380 
you want to do that on all 10 fingers
and<00:00:51.710> then<00:00:51.920> when<00:00:52.129> that's<00:00:52.309> dried<00:00:52.730> you<00:00:53.090> want<00:00:53.269> to

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
and then when that's dried you want to

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.420 
and then when that's dried you want to
paint<00:00:53.539> another<00:00:53.809> layer<00:00:53.989> on<00:00:54.140> it's<00:00:54.949> best<00:00:55.219> to<00:00:55.309> do

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
paint another layer on it's best to do

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.520 
paint another layer on it's best to do
too<00:00:55.699> thin<00:00:56.030> layers<00:00:56.269> than<00:00:56.660> one<00:00:56.899> thick<00:00:57.230> layer

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
too thin layers than one thick layer

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.770 
too thin layers than one thick layer
just<00:00:57.649> because<00:00:58.070> it<00:00:58.190> dries<00:00:58.489> quicker<00:00:58.909> and<00:00:59.300> it's

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
just because it dries quicker and it's

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.360 
just because it dries quicker and it's
better<00:00:59.960> just<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:00.260> layer<00:01:00.530> it<00:01:00.559> up<00:01:00.859> then<00:01:01.159> to<00:01:01.280> have

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
better just to layer it up then to have

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:10.190 
better just to layer it up then to have
one<00:01:01.550> big<00:01:01.820> kind<00:01:02.239> of<00:01:02.300> gloopy<00:01:02.690> mess<00:01:02.870> on<00:01:03.019> your<00:01:03.050> nail

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.440 

once<00:01:10.979> you've<00:01:11.159> done<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.909> want<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.149> let<00:01:12.299> it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
once you've done that you want to let it

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.850 
I just got a bit on the edge to fill in
there<00:01:54.200> there<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.259> go<00:01:55.349> the<00:01:55.500> less<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.829> pay

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
there there you go the less you pay

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.279 
there there you go the less you pay
about<00:01:56.220> play<00:01:56.489> about<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:56.789> it<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.329> better

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
about play about with it and the better

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.870 
about play about with it and the better
will<00:01:58.500> look<00:01:58.739> just<00:01:58.920> because<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> white<00:01:59.640> gets

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
will look just because the white gets

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.609 
will look just because the white gets
quite<00:02:00.119> thick<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.689> then<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:00.989> gets<00:02:01.079> gloopy<00:02:01.530> and

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
quite thick and then it gets gloopy and

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.169 
quite thick and then it gets gloopy and
you'll<00:02:01.709> be<00:02:01.799> moving<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.280> about<00:02:02.489> too<00:02:02.729> much<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
you'll be moving it about too much and

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.800 
you'll be moving it about too much and
you'll<00:02:03.659> end<00:02:03.810> up<00:02:03.959> with<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.229> quite<00:02:04.439> patchy<00:02:04.709> and

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
you'll end up with it quite patchy and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.330 
you'll end up with it quite patchy and
although<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:06.959> you<00:02:07.079> haven't<00:02:07.500> managed<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> get

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
although if you haven't managed to get

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.219 
although if you haven't managed to get
the<00:02:08.489> whole<00:02:08.670> swoop<00:02:09.090> or<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.509> not<00:02:09.720> all<00:02:09.840> even

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
the whole swoop or it's not all even

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.870 
the whole swoop or it's not all even
what<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.799> can<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> little<00:02:11.640> bit<00:02:11.760> more

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
what you can do is get a little bit more

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.759 
what you can do is get a little bit more
on<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:11.970> brush<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.540> just<00:02:12.989> paint<00:02:13.230> down<00:02:13.500> words

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
fill it all in and even it all out once

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.750
