00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
downtime these kids are very very sick

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.980 
downtime these kids are very very sick
and<00:01:39.109> they<00:01:40.149> their<00:01:41.149> clinical<00:01:41.509> status<00:01:41.719> can

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
and they their clinical status can

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.740 
and they their clinical status can
change<00:01:42.259> at<00:01:42.469> any<00:01:42.500> given<00:01:42.890> moment<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.520> so<00:01:43.759> you're

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
privilege and an honor because for a lot

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.940 
privilege and an honor because for a lot
of<00:01:49.759> these<00:01:49.939> families<00:01:50.570> we're<00:01:51.140> showing<00:01:51.439> up<00:01:51.710> at

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
of these families we're showing up at

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.969 
of these families we're showing up at
the<00:01:52.070> most<00:01:52.250> volatile<00:01:52.820> points<00:01:53.390> in<00:01:53.770> their<00:01:54.770> life

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
the most volatile points in their life

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.639 
the most volatile points in their life
and<00:01:55.340> I<00:01:56.149> think<00:01:56.479> that's<00:01:56.689> also<00:01:57.109> important<00:01:57.560> for

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
and I think that's also important for

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.719 
and I think that's also important for
the<00:01:57.770> students<00:01:58.219> to<00:01:58.280> see<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:59.210> was<00:01:59.539> eye-opening<00:01:59.750> I

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
the students to see it was eye-opening I

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.039 
the students to see it was eye-opening I
don't<00:02:01.729> think<00:02:01.939> people<00:02:02.030> realize<00:02:02.570> how<00:02:02.600> hard

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
don't think people realize how hard

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.260 
don't think people realize how hard

that their education has really prepared
them<00:05:01.139> to<00:05:02.009> function<00:05:02.669> well<00:05:02.909> in<00:05:03.179> the<00:05:03.449> sort<00:05:03.959> of<00:05:04.020> the

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
them to function well in the sort of the

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.379 
them to function well in the sort of the
real<00:05:04.349> clinical<00:05:04.709> setting<00:05:05.249> they<00:05:05.490> spend<00:05:06.029> about

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
real clinical setting they spend about

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.480 
real clinical setting they spend about
two<00:05:06.930> hundred<00:05:07.259> and<00:05:07.349> twenty<00:05:07.619> hours<00:05:08.009> in<00:05:08.219> our

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
two hundred and twenty hours in our
