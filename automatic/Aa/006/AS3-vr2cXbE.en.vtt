00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.040 
painted the eye and then I took a white
paper<00:02:02.160> cause<00:02:02.550> I<00:02:02.580> didn't<00:02:02.880> hello<00:02:03.300> paint<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.930> I

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.430 
paper cause I didn't hello paint and I
cut<00:02:04.290> out<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.680> shape<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.250> eye<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.440> glued

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
cut out the shape of the eye and I glued

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.620 
cut out the shape of the eye and I glued
it<00:02:07.470> on<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:07.980> then<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:10.850> painted<00:02:11.850> on<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.360> red

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630

off and you should get this in three
pieces<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.920> top<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.700> two<00:04:24.970> sides<00:04:27.270> they're

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
pieces the top and two sides they're

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.700 
pieces the top and two sides they're
gonna<00:04:28.360> have<00:04:28.570> like<00:04:28.720> little<00:04:28.990> lines<00:04:29.170> right<00:04:29.680> here

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
gonna have like little lines right here

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.620 
gonna have like little lines right here
and<00:04:30.550> down<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.600> middle<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.230> across<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.920> top

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
and down the middle and across the top

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.970 
and down the middle and across the top
you<00:04:34.630> have<00:04:34.690> to<00:04:34.900> fold<00:04:35.140> them<00:04:35.320> in<00:04:35.470> to<00:04:35.680> give<00:04:35.800> them<00:04:35.950> a

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
you have to fold them in to give them a

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.740 
you have to fold them in to give them a
three-dimensional<00:04:36.730> shape<00:04:36.850> make<00:04:37.480> sure<00:04:37.630> don't

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
three-dimensional shape make sure don't

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.890 
three-dimensional shape make sure don't
fold<00:04:38.020> them<00:04:38.200> in<00:04:38.290> too<00:04:38.470> much<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:38.980> you<00:04:39.100> hot<00:04:39.310> glue

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
fold them in too much and you hot glue

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.730 
fold them in too much and you hot glue
you<00:04:40.900> stick<00:04:41.200> glue<00:04:41.350> Elmer's<00:04:42.040> glue<00:04:42.700> or<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:44.590> can

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
you stick glue Elmer's glue or you can

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.350 
you stick glue Elmer's glue or you can
staple<00:04:45.040> them<00:04:45.340> like<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:45.640> did<00:04:45.850> because<00:04:46.090> I<00:04:46.180> got

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
staple them like I did because I got

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.100 
staple them like I did because I got
lazy<00:04:46.600> um<00:04:48.840> then<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:50.740> just<00:04:51.550> make<00:04:51.700> it<00:04:51.850> 3d<00:04:52.180> ish

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
lazy um then you just make it 3d ish

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.520 
lazy um then you just make it 3d ish
like<00:04:53.470> that<00:04:53.710> but<00:04:54.340> don't<00:04:54.550> do<00:04:54.820> that<00:04:55.090> yet<00:04:55.450> take<00:04:56.350> it

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
like that but don't do that yet take it

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.770 
like that but don't do that yet take it
and<00:04:56.680> glue<00:04:56.920> the<00:04:57.130> whole<00:04:57.310> thing<00:04:57.610> on<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:58.000> piece<00:04:58.630> of

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
and glue the whole thing on a piece of

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.880 
and glue the whole thing on a piece of
cardboard<00:04:59.760> the<00:05:00.840> cereal<00:05:01.840> box<00:05:02.050> cardboard<00:05:02.200> is

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
cardboard the cereal box cardboard is

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.370 
cardboard the cereal box cardboard is
actually<00:05:03.280> really<00:05:03.580> flexible<00:05:04.150> so<00:05:05.020> it<00:05:05.200> might

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
actually really flexible so it might

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.940 
actually really flexible so it might
work<00:05:05.530> better<00:05:05.770> would<00:05:06.010> you<00:05:06.130> bending<00:05:06.580> it<00:05:07.950> the

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
work better would you bending it the

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.400 
work better would you bending it the
brown<00:05:09.220> cardboard<00:05:09.700> it'd<00:05:10.630> be<00:05:10.840> a<00:05:10.870> lot<00:05:11.050> thicker

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
brown cardboard it'd be a lot thicker

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.230 
brown cardboard it'd be a lot thicker
and<00:05:11.620> easier<00:05:12.220> to<00:05:12.250> use<00:05:12.400> just<00:05:12.820> make<00:05:12.940> sure<00:05:13.150> you

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
and easier to use just make sure you

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.390 
and easier to use just make sure you
paint<00:05:13.540> whatever<00:05:14.200> cardboard<00:05:14.830> you<00:05:14.980> use<00:05:15.100> white

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
paint whatever cardboard you use white

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.350 
paint whatever cardboard you use white
and<00:05:17.250> then<00:05:18.250> you<00:05:18.280> get<00:05:18.490> some<00:05:18.700> string<00:05:19.000> and<00:05:19.270> you

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
and then you get some string and you

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.840 
and then you get some string and you
 holes<00:05:19.840> in<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.200> sides<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:20.980> you<00:05:21.670> just

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
 holes in the sides and you just

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.700 
 holes in the sides and you just
string<00:05:22.690> it<00:05:22.840> through<00:05:22.870> it<00:05:23.200> doesn't<00:05:23.410> matter<00:05:23.590> what

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
string it through it doesn't matter what

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.430 
string it through it doesn't matter what
string<00:05:24.010> you<00:05:24.220> can<00:05:24.370> use<00:05:24.490> a<00:05:24.520> stretchy<00:05:24.850> con<00:05:25.440> but

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
string you can use a stretchy con but

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.100 
string you can use a stretchy con but
when<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:27.340> use<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.490> stretchy<00:05:27.880> time<00:05:28.180> it<00:05:28.630> might

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
when you use a stretchy time it might

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.910 
when you use a stretchy time it might
end<00:05:29.380> in<00:05:29.770> like<00:05:30.100> this<00:05:30.630> so<00:05:31.630> I<00:05:32.020> just<00:05:32.230> use<00:05:32.440> normal

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
end in like this so I just use normal

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.940 
end in like this so I just use normal
and<00:05:33.190> what<00:05:33.730> I<00:05:33.760> did<00:05:34.000> on<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.270> back<00:05:34.450> of<00:05:34.600> this<00:05:34.720> one

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
and what I did on the back of this one

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.140 
and what I did on the back of this one
since<00:05:35.950> I<00:05:36.130> didn't<00:05:36.430> think<00:05:36.610> of<00:05:36.670> the<00:05:36.790> cardboard

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
since I didn't think of the cardboard

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.990 
since I didn't think of the cardboard
way<00:05:37.540> yet<00:05:37.900> so<00:05:38.830> I<00:05:38.860> just<00:05:39.160> looks<00:05:39.370> like<00:05:39.550> some<00:05:39.820> more

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
way yet so I just looks like some more

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.410 
way yet so I just looks like some more
thin<00:05:40.300> sticks<00:05:40.840> and<00:05:41.250> I<00:05:42.250> hot-glued<00:05:42.640> those<00:05:43.180> in

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
thin sticks and I hot-glued those in

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.600 
thin sticks and I hot-glued those in
there<00:05:43.630> to<00:05:44.410> make<00:05:44.560> them<00:05:44.710> stay<00:05:44.980> and<00:05:45.160> listen<00:05:45.580> you

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
there to make them stay and listen you

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.640 
there to make them stay and listen you
can<00:05:45.760> actually<00:05:45.880> see<00:05:46.330> out<00:05:46.480> of<00:05:46.510> because<00:05:47.470> it's

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
can actually see out of because it's

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.060 
can actually see out of because it's
like<00:05:48.570> missing<00:05:49.570> an<00:05:49.690> eye<00:05:49.810> and<00:05:50.200> all<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.890> white

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
like missing an eye and all the white

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.530 
like missing an eye and all the white
right<00:05:51.280> here<00:05:51.550> you're<00:05:51.700> supposed<00:05:51.790> to<00:05:52.000> cut<00:05:52.180> it<00:05:52.210> out

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
right here you're supposed to cut it out

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.100 
right here you're supposed to cut it out
and<00:05:53.790> like<00:05:54.790> right<00:05:55.000> up<00:05:55.120> here<00:05:55.450> I<00:05:55.750> thought<00:05:55.960> you're

and like right up here I thought you're

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.450 
and like right up here I thought you're
supposed<00:05:56.200> to<00:05:56.380> get<00:05:56.500> that<00:05:56.680> out<00:05:56.830> and<00:05:57.010> I'm<00:05:57.190> glad<00:05:57.340> I

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
supposed to get that out and I'm glad I

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.890 
supposed to get that out and I'm glad I
didn't<00:05:57.820> because<00:05:58.030> I<00:05:58.060> cut<00:05:58.360> off<00:05:58.480> face<00:05:58.690> of<00:05:58.810> the

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
didn't because I cut off face of the

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.160 
didn't because I cut off face of the
mask<00:05:59.160> so<00:06:00.160> I<00:06:00.220> had<00:06:00.430> to<00:06:00.550> take<00:06:00.760> tape<00:06:01.090> and<00:06:01.930> tape<00:06:02.140> it

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
mask so I had to take tape and tape it

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.670 
mask so I had to take tape and tape it
back<00:06:02.470> so<00:06:03.130> I'm<00:06:03.250> like<00:06:03.880> I'm<00:06:04.060> gonna<00:06:04.180> make

back so I'm like I'm gonna make
ones<00:06:04.860> these<00:06:05.850> are<00:06:05.910> judging<00:06:06.720> these<00:06:06.900> on<00:06:07.050> my<00:06:07.139> walls

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
ones these are judging these on my walls

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.409 
ones these are judging these on my walls
looks<00:06:10.039> but<00:06:11.039> that's<00:06:11.310> pretty<00:06:12.030> much<00:06:12.180> how<00:06:12.389> you

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
looks but that's pretty much how you

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.900 
looks but that's pretty much how you
make<00:06:12.810> them<00:06:13.080> sorry<00:06:13.919> I'm<00:06:14.100> not<00:06:14.250> making<00:06:14.580> one<00:06:14.759> right

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
make them sorry I'm not making one right

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.870 
make them sorry I'm not making one right
now<00:06:15.150> just<00:06:16.050> I<00:06:16.199> don't<00:06:16.259> have<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.710> ink<00:06:16.919> to<00:06:17.400> like

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
now just I don't have the ink to like

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.070 
now just I don't have the ink to like
waste<00:06:18.650> maybe<00:06:19.650> I'll<00:06:20.009> make<00:06:20.370> one<00:06:20.729> like<00:06:21.720> a<00:06:21.750> better

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
waste maybe I'll make one like a better
