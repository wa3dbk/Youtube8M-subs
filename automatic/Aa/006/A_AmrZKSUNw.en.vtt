00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 what's up with friends stefanie von fifa 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.540
 and gaming drive and welcome 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.309
 for the second packaging in fifa 14 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.870
 today we have the whole time at the start 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.219
 with yes a bit faster so 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.870
 last time was the right are 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.000
 Tedious therefore took so long 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.220
 between the takes and that's why I have 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.990
 that worked a bit this time 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.880
 that it looks like it's going right 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.470
 purely in the store have all this here 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.630
 a little faster and we did 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.430
 see there also flashes directly the player 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.080
 on wagners have now in the second pack 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.460
 as well as I really do not like any 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.710
 bad player but we only take 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.940
 the crunchers and that's why we can 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.320
 the two just do not use us 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.510
 we could not pull so many packs 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.600
 want on the event that is natural 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.250
 now everything from the event hijacked and after 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.629
 comments so we have now 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.579
 not the whole game at home 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.739
 and that's why we do not have 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.390
 really keep everything because we have the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.890
 lose things again anyway 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.750
 or had to give up 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.579
 So we start at fifa 14 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.680
 Of course, from the beginning to before new 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.480
 and have no special players or 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.520
 something but everyone else start 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.140
 we also directly in now we have 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.049
 Carillon in it and helmet is but the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.610
 also can not be broken and times 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.049
 look what we are going to pull 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.290
 This time I am alone on the start 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.320
 Christian is not there and only times 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.630
 watch what we do now has creature 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.340
 of course arturo vidal was on it and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.979
 this time more in it alex but have the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.150
 Of course we have and because of that 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.530
 we pulled the gentleman twice 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.090
 of course we also do not have fun 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.070
 knows how many texts were drawn 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.259
 so there are not so many were definitely 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.980
 fall under thirty times i think and that 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.230
 we will do it 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.770
 in the double player in there have talked 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.120
 Of course he wears arena but what 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.980
 there are so many players and 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.480
 The same is also shit 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.040
 we did not want that anyway 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.560
 also come to the next day 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.930
 senivita point but still 1500 we will 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.720
 all of us also use up and now 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.190
 we draw gomes from tottenham player 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.350
 I think that was a short time 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.090
 Hope home because the kempinski style like 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.070
 near also has all explained if you 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.570
 again , the canal looks over there 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.950
 takes you all things to the Kemmers 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.690
 stars and co so there you will find 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.360
 possible broad spectrum 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.740
 Videos uploaded the last time that 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.660
 same have seen everything 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.170
 and there would be another shot at the camera 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.690
 no streetstyles explained by e 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.770
 we now have not at all times to all 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.300
 taken some one then has 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.010
 double and so on and so forth 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.120
 so short with I do not know if he does that 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.980
 does not matter quieter 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.840
 we come to the next pack 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.880
 Agas I have my chance already 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.350
 yes, there we have one more 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.200
 militant part but prove again 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.760
 everything off and on 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.560
 yes, I think that will too 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.080
 Last pack opening will be from the 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.000
 Event pressed 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.080
 yes so interesting is that then too 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.580
 not if I'm not really 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.810
 I can be happy that I am a good player 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.580
 pulled because I would be then anyway 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.290
 no longer have or can not keep 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.600
 that's why the illusion comes 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.620
 over and that's just what we do 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.630
 first show you how the whole 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.520
 Expires here and some of you have 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.900
 We also say make a sale 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.780
 That's why we do it all 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.000
 let's have messi on it 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.820
 the cover and zhiyong quite good player 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.590
 with gibson zach good left-back 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.730
 from the company is at 85 paces and 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.960
 Of course, I still do it for us 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.810
 I definitely had better games 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.959
 faith has ashley cole or something like that 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.790
 it does not matter then 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.160
 that's why it's not as good as 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.110
 the two now we have in it 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.360
 Huspek was of course again 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.459
 nothing so come load that one 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.260
 Expect trabi or coffee or beer 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.850
 from when there is in it therefore 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.580
 go that only started valuing 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.810
 silver player but also does not matter and 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.709
 now we come to think so 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.980
 penultimate pack ls on it niedermaiers 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.739
 the tig and a button 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.180
 a few silver cards but that 's about it 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.060
 from this package we come to the last 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.799
 pack falcao is on it and therefore also for 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.080
 last day for the next two weeks 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.480
 Of course, I think bread again after that 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.190
 or at the start and this time we have 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.819
 bring here you want yes shay given us 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.010
 shirt 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.180
 Well that was not so brown now 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.010
 pack opening i hope you have it 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.569
 Nevertheless, that was it so far from 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.310
 I look again at the 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.629
 other videos are doing well until the end 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.629
 next time in and out
