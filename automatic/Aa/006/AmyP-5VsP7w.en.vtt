00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
many years because great-grandfather was

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.140 
many years because great-grandfather was
a<00:00:25.119> director<00:00:25.690> of<00:00:25.720> hardees<00:00:26.640> treasurer<00:00:27.640> actually

so he worked in the Vale quite a bit
anyway<00:00:30.160> and<00:00:30.640> that's<00:00:30.760> when<00:00:31.029> he<00:00:31.119> saw<00:00:31.300> the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
anyway and that's when he saw the

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.020 
anyway and that's when he saw the
vineyard<00:00:31.869> come<00:00:32.230> up<00:00:32.379> for<00:00:32.559> sale<00:00:32.739> and<00:00:33.030> went

bought<00:00:34.390> it<00:00:34.570> and<00:00:34.750> obviously<00:00:35.350> it<00:00:36.250> was<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.579> next

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
bought it and obviously it was the next

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.579 
bought it and obviously it was the next
generation<00:00:37.329> though<00:00:37.420> my<00:00:37.629> grandfather<00:00:38.319> who

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
generation though my grandfather who

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.130 
generation though my grandfather who
really<00:00:38.949> developed<00:00:39.370> it<00:00:39.489> I<00:00:39.640> always<00:00:40.569> wanted<00:00:40.960> to

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
really developed it I always wanted to

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.379 
really developed it I always wanted to
work<00:00:41.229> in<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.559> family<00:00:41.859> business<00:00:42.010> really<00:00:42.639> but<00:00:43.359> I

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:43.389 
work in the family business really but I

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:45.599 
work in the family business really but I
think<00:00:43.659> the<00:00:43.929> point<00:00:44.350> that<00:00:44.469> really<00:00:44.949> made<00:00:45.309> it<00:00:45.489> to

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
think the point that really made it to

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.520 
think the point that really made it to
me<00:00:45.729> was<00:00:45.940> when<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:46.210> said<00:00:46.479> on<00:00:46.629> Len<00:00:46.899> Evans<00:00:47.050> knee

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
me was when I said on Len Evans knee

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.020 
me was when I said on Len Evans knee
when<00:00:47.889> I<00:00:47.920> was<00:00:48.069> about<00:00:48.219> seven<00:00:48.579> years<00:00:48.699> old<00:00:48.909> he<00:00:48.999> used

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.029 
when I was about seven years old he used
to<00:00:49.210> come<00:00:49.359> stay<00:00:49.659> and<00:00:50.170> he<00:00:50.260> said<00:00:50.469> to<00:00:50.499> me<00:00:50.679> what<00:00:50.829> sort

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039

presuming i'm going to make wine but

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.789 
presuming i'm going to make wine but
actually<00:01:00.609> so<00:01:01.299> it<00:01:01.690> was<00:01:01.839> installed<00:01:02.170> in<00:01:02.350> me<00:01:02.499> the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
actually so it was installed in me the

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:04.590 
actually so it was installed in me the
sea<00:01:03.010> is<00:01:03.039> obviously<00:01:03.670> very<00:01:03.760> crucial<00:01:04.449> to

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
sea is obviously very crucial to

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.899 
sea is obviously very crucial to
clarabelle's<00:01:05.049> climate<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.369> clothes<00:01:06.580> out

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
clarabelle's climate and the clothes out

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.120 
clarabelle's climate and the clothes out
of<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:07.060> scene<00:01:07.299> the<00:01:07.570> more<00:01:07.810> maritime<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:08.980> the

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
of the scene the more maritime and the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.130 
of the scene the more maritime and the
more<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.640> lower<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.000> diurnal<00:01:10.450> variation<00:01:10.930> I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
more the lower the diurnal variation I

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.200 
more the lower the diurnal variation I
think<00:01:11.680> it's<00:01:11.800> actually<00:01:12.250> important<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:13.030> really

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
think it's actually important to really

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.510 
think it's actually important to really
understand<00:01:13.750> what<00:01:14.020> family<00:01:14.620> does<00:01:14.890> bring<00:01:15.220> to

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
understand what family does bring to

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.430 
understand what family does bring to
wonder<00:01:16.000> if<00:01:16.090> it's<00:01:16.270> for<00:01:16.510> generations<00:01:17.140> like

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
wonder if it's for generations like

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.280 
wonder if it's for generations like
d'arenberg<00:01:17.980> then<00:01:18.550> we<00:01:19.180> basically<00:01:19.840> have<00:01:20.260> a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
d'arenberg then we basically have a

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.520 
d'arenberg then we basically have a
continuum<00:01:21.100> of<00:01:21.420> technique<00:01:22.420> in<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.690> way<00:01:22.870> we<00:01:23.230> still

continuum of technique in a way we still

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.620 
continuum of technique in a way we still
use<00:01:23.740> all<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.100> same<00:01:24.400> old<00:01:24.670> open<00:01:25.030> fermenters<00:01:25.420> we

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
just copied them and turn them into

also<00:01:56.140> very<00:01:56.530> gentle<00:01:57.130> press<00:01:57.370> and<00:01:57.700> we<00:01:57.820> work

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
also very gentle press and we work

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.940 
also very gentle press and we work
extremely<00:01:58.360> hard<00:01:58.720> on<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.140> whole<00:01:59.260> gentle<00:01:59.710> thing

extremely hard on the whole gentle thing

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.610 
extremely hard on the whole gentle thing
and<00:02:00.159> also<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.360> such<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.600> wad<00:02:01.930> of<00:02:02.080> skins<00:02:02.409> like

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
and also the is such a wad of skins like

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.620 
and also the is such a wad of skins like
this<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.460> juice<00:02:03.700> actually<00:02:03.909> filters<00:02:04.510> as

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
this that the juice actually filters as

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.690 
this that the juice actually filters as
it<00:02:04.750> comes<00:02:04.960> through<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.710> skins<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.370> comes<00:02:06.550> out

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
it comes through the skins and comes out

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.580 
it comes through the skins and comes out
very<00:02:06.760> low<00:02:07.090> solids<00:02:07.570> so<00:02:07.960> we<00:02:08.110> can<00:02:08.229> leave<00:02:08.349> it<00:02:08.500> in

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
very low solids so we can leave it in

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.440 
very low solids so we can leave it in
the<00:02:08.679> barrel<00:02:09.009> on<00:02:09.099> the<00:02:09.190> solids<00:02:09.849> for<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.330> whole

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
the barrel on the solids for the whole

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.959 
the barrel on the solids for the whole
time<00:02:10.659> without<00:02:10.869> even<00:02:11.260> racking<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.340> then<00:02:12.849> it

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969 
time without even racking and it then it

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.670 
time without even racking and it then it
creates<00:02:13.180> like<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.569> reductive<00:02:14.230> environment

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
creates like a reductive environment

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.840 
creates like a reductive environment
with<00:02:14.859> the<00:02:14.980> oxidative

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
with the oxidative

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.180 
with the oxidative
the<00:02:16.360> barrel<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.320> we<00:02:17.410> get<00:02:17.560> this<00:02:17.680> balanced

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
the barrel so that we get this balanced

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.740 
the barrel so that we get this balanced
effect<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.640> wines<00:02:18.850> fresh<00:02:19.150> herb<00:02:19.360> Oaks

more<00:02:20.020> integrated<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.560> more<00:02:21.370> lively<00:02:21.730> one<00:02:21.880> and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
more integrated and more lively one and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.360 
more integrated and more lively one and
it<00:02:22.600> takes<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.930> long<00:02:23.200> time<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.560> understand<00:02:24.220> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
it takes a long time to understand the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.150 
it takes a long time to understand the
vineyard<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.880> really<00:02:25.270> make<00:02:25.510> this<00:02:26.050> really<00:02:26.680> get

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
vineyard and really make this really get

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.400 
vineyard and really make this really get
the<00:02:27.310> best<00:02:27.520> out<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.820> that<00:02:28.120> vineyard<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.260> we

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
the best out of that vineyard and so we

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.930 
the best out of that vineyard and so we
returned<00:02:29.860> all<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.100> vineyards<00:02:30.400> back<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.850> the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
returned all the vineyards back to the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.140 
returned all the vineyards back to the
old<00:02:31.090> way<00:02:31.300> no<00:02:31.930> cultivation<00:02:32.320> no<00:02:33.190> spraying<00:02:33.670> no

irrigation if we can and no fertilizer
now<00:02:37.120> for<00:02:37.300> 12<00:02:37.600> years<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:37.990> we're<00:02:38.260> really<00:02:38.440> seeing

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
now for 12 years and we're really seeing

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.860 
now for 12 years and we're really seeing
the<00:02:39.130> soil<00:02:39.610> flavor<00:02:39.850> now<00:02:40.270> getting<00:02:40.630> into<00:02:40.750> the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
the soil flavor now getting into the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.360 
the soil flavor now getting into the
grapes<00:02:41.170> because<00:02:41.710> we've<00:02:41.920> removed<00:02:42.250> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
grapes because we've removed the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.680 
grapes because we've removed the
fertilizer<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.940> water<00:02:43.120> we're<00:02:43.360> not<00:02:43.480> growing

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
fertilizer the water we're not growing

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.570 
fertilizer the water we're not growing
them<00:02:43.900> hydroponically<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.100> vinous<00:02:45.430> to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
them hydroponically so the vinous to

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.220 
them hydroponically so the vinous to
really<00:02:45.910> work<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.390> get<00:02:46.510> all<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:46.780> soil<00:02:47.110> flavor

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
really work to get all that soil flavor

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.350 
really work to get all that soil flavor
so<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.890> get<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.040> great<00:02:48.250> minerality<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:49.180> way

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
so you get a great minerality that way

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.300 
so you get a great minerality that way
being<00:02:49.990> gentle<00:02:50.320> in<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.530> processing<00:02:50.980> also

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
being gentle in the processing also

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.460 
being gentle in the processing also
ensures<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:51.910> we<00:02:52.330> keep<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.720> minerality<00:02:53.200> and

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
ensures that we keep the minerality and

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.350 
ensures that we keep the minerality and
don't<00:02:53.920> over<00:02:54.190> block<00:02:54.430> with<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.880> excessive
