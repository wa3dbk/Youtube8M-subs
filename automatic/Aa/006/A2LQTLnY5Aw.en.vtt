gives like it does give like a moon
flower<00:02:00.439> effect<00:02:00.679> but<00:02:01.429> as<00:02:01.520> you<00:02:01.639> can<00:02:01.789> imagine

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
flower effect but as you can imagine

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.029 
flower effect but as you can imagine
when<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:02.420> smoke<00:02:02.749> starts<00:02:03.200> coming<00:02:03.259> out<00:02:03.679> you

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
when the smoke starts coming out you

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.309 
when the smoke starts coming out you
know<00:02:04.069> with<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.399> fog<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:05.299> actually<00:02:05.630> see<00:02:05.869> beams

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
know with the fog you actually see beams

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.830 
know with the fog you actually see beams
of<00:02:06.740> different<00:02:07.069> color<00:02:07.279> lights<00:02:07.639> in<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.509> smoke

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
of different color lights in the smoke

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.230 
of different color lights in the smoke
as<00:02:09.050> it's<00:02:09.319> coming<00:02:09.649> out<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:10.310> looks<00:02:10.610> really<00:02:11.030> good

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
as it's coming out it looks really good

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.910 
as it's coming out it looks really good
unfortunately<00:02:12.020> I<00:02:12.050> can't<00:02:12.349> plug<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:12.680> in<00:02:12.770> to

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
unfortunately I can't plug it in to

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.530 
unfortunately I can't plug it in to
actually<00:02:13.160> demonstrate<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.180> because

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
actually demonstrate that to you because

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.449 
actually demonstrate that to you because
of<00:02:14.630> all<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.870> smoke<00:02:15.050> alarms<00:02:15.530> but<00:02:16.069> this<00:02:16.190> video

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
of all the smoke alarms but this video

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.980 
of all the smoke alarms but this video
is<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.970> give<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.240> bit<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.450> an<00:02:17.599> idea<00:02:17.930> to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
is just to give you a bit of an idea to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.320 
is just to give you a bit of an idea to
size<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.620> machine<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.700> few<00:02:19.970> things<00:02:20.180> about

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
size the machine and a few things about

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.270 
size the machine and a few things about
the<00:02:20.630> features<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.860> front<00:02:22.069> you've<00:02:22.250> got

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
the features so on the front you've got

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.800 
the features so on the front you've got
your<00:02:22.640> Astro<00:02:23.180> globe

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
your Astro globe

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.480 
your Astro globe
you<00:02:24.170> have<00:02:24.380> your<00:02:24.620> nozzle<00:02:25.040> for<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.280> where<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
you have your nozzle for the where the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.860 
you have your nozzle for the where the
smoke<00:02:25.730> comes<00:02:26.030> out

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
smoke comes out

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.750 
smoke comes out
you've<00:02:27.200> got<00:02:27.350> your<00:02:27.470> tank<00:02:27.800> on<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.280> top<00:02:28.490> here

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
you've got your tank on the top here

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.190 
you've got your tank on the top here
where<00:02:28.940> you

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
where you

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.410 
where you
you<00:02:29.260> fluid<00:02:29.620> in<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:30.280> then<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:30.760> course<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.209> back

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
you fluid in and then of course the back

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.699 
you fluid in and then of course the back
here<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:32.410> have<00:02:33.150> your<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:35.050> shows<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.410> how<00:02:35.530> much

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
here you have your it shows you how much

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.790 
here you have your it shows you how much
fluid<00:02:36.129> is<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.700> actual<00:02:36.819> tank<00:02:37.769> like<00:02:38.769> a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
fluid is in the actual tank like a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.880 
fluid is in the actual tank like a
measurer<00:02:39.220> there<00:02:39.489> you've<00:02:40.209> got<00:02:40.480> your<00:02:40.750> three<00:02:41.620> pin

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
measurer there you've got your three pin

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.990 
measurer there you've got your three pin
connector<00:02:42.340> there<00:02:42.489> which<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.730> where<00:02:42.849> your

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
connector there which is where your

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.150 
connector there which is where your
remote<00:02:43.209> control<00:02:43.629> goes<00:02:43.870> in<00:02:44.110> you've<00:02:44.830> got<00:02:45.010> your

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
remote control goes in you've got your

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.400 
remote control goes in you've got your
power<00:02:45.340> cable<00:02:45.640> plugs<00:02:46.030> in<00:02:46.209> there<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.750> then

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
power cable plugs in there and then

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.250 
power cable plugs in there and then
you've<00:02:47.590> got<00:02:48.060> you've<00:02:49.060> basically<00:02:49.300> got<00:02:49.690> two<00:02:50.080> on

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
you've got you've basically got two on

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.740 
you've got you've basically got two on
here<00:02:50.560> you've<00:02:51.130> got<00:02:51.370> almost<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.150> that's<00:02:52.450> for

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
here you've got almost like that's for

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.270 
here you've got almost like that's for
the<00:02:52.930> effect<00:02:53.260> on<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.620> off<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.069> will<00:02:54.160> be

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
the effect on and off so that will be

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.370 
the effect on and off so that will be
for<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.519> ashtray<00:02:54.910> glow<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:56.019> one<00:02:56.170> there

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
for the ashtray glow and that one there

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.050 
for the ashtray glow and that one there
is<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.560> turn<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.890> smoke<00:02:57.160> on<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.459> off<00:02:57.549> so<00:02:57.970> if

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
is to turn the smoke on and off so if

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.640 
is to turn the smoke on and off so if
you<00:02:58.180> want<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.629> can<00:02:58.780> use<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.110> for<00:02:59.290> either

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
you want to you can use it for either

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.350 
you want to you can use it for either
either<00:02:59.920> or<00:03:00.250> have<00:03:00.430> them<00:03:00.549> both<00:03:00.700> going<00:03:00.970> together

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
either or have them both going together

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.539 
either or have them both going together
and<00:03:01.780> that's<00:03:02.080> where<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.349> key<00:03:02.530> goes<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:02.830> bit

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
and that's where the key goes in bit

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.660 
and that's where the key goes in bit
like<00:03:03.760> lasers<00:03:04.420> where<00:03:04.569> they<00:03:04.690> have<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:04.870> safety<00:03:05.200> key

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
like lasers where they have a safety key

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.190 
like lasers where they have a safety key
so<00:03:06.670> if<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:06.880> want<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.239> can<00:03:07.390> turn<00:03:07.599> it<00:03:07.750> off<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.079> no

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
so if you want you can turn it off so no

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.930 
so if you want you can turn it off so no
one<00:03:08.349> can<00:03:08.730> contribute<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.959> so<00:03:11.440> there<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.769> is

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
one can contribute so so there it is

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.580 
one can contribute so so there it is
I'll<00:03:12.940> give<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.239> few<00:03:13.510> more<00:03:13.660> details<00:03:14.170> about

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
I'll give you a few more details about

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.979 
I'll give you a few more details about
this<00:03:14.980> unit<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:17.200> weight<00:03:17.799> of<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.220> is<00:03:18.750> two<00:03:19.750> point

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
this unit the weight of it is two point

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.680 
this unit the weight of it is two point
five<00:03:20.200> kilo<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:21.040> it's<00:03:21.160> not<00:03:21.280> very<00:03:21.489> heavy<00:03:21.690> tank

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
five kilo so it's not very heavy tank

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.949 
five kilo so it's not very heavy tank
capacity<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.470> not<00:03:23.980> 0.5<00:03:24.579> liters<00:03:24.849> as<00:03:25.390> well<00:03:25.750> in

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
capacity is not 0.5 liters as well in

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.259 
capacity is not 0.5 liters as well in
there<00:03:26.200> heat<00:03:26.799> up<00:03:27.040> time<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.519> sort<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:27.819> five<00:03:28.060> to

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
there heat up time is sort of five to

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.930 
there heat up time is sort of five to
ten<00:03:28.299> minutes<00:03:28.840> from<00:03:29.319> cold<00:03:29.680> once<00:03:30.459> it's<00:03:30.640> been<00:03:30.790> on

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
ten minutes from cold once it's been on

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.940 
ten minutes from cold once it's been on
for<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.239> while<00:03:31.390> then<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.349> you<00:03:32.680> know<00:03:32.709> it

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
for a while then you you know it

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.349 
for a while then you you know it
literally<00:03:33.310> just<00:03:33.340> takes<00:03:33.700> 2<00:03:33.910> or<00:03:33.970> 3<00:03:34.180> minutes

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
literally just takes 2 or 3 minutes

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.069 
literally just takes 2 or 3 minutes
every<00:03:34.720> now<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:34.989> again<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.410> heat<00:03:35.590> up<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:37.540> LEDs

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
every now and again to heat up the LEDs

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.900 
every now and again to heat up the LEDs
are<00:03:38.260> three<00:03:38.500> what<00:03:38.709> LEDs<00:03:39.130> I<00:03:39.160> said<00:03:39.459> on<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.670> front

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
are three what LEDs I said on the front

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.520 
are three what LEDs I said on the front
so<00:03:40.060> it's<00:03:40.180> RGB<00:03:40.810> as<00:03:41.139> well<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.989> that's<00:03:43.989> basically

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
so it's RGB as well and that's basically

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.020 
so it's RGB as well and that's basically
it<00:03:44.739> that's<00:03:44.920> sort<00:03:45.220> of<00:03:45.250> everything<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:45.760> need<00:03:45.910> to

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
it that's sort of everything you need to

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.550 
it that's sort of everything you need to
know<00:03:46.180> about<00:03:46.299> it<00:03:46.630> but<00:03:46.720> it's<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.959> great<00:03:47.139> little

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
know about it but it's a great little

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.009 
know about it but it's a great little
compact<00:03:47.950> machine<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:49.150> there<00:03:49.329> is<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.720> IB

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
compact machine so there is the IB

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.120 
compact machine so there is the IB
thelight<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.739> less<00:03:51.430> than<00:03:51.459> 500<00:03:52.389> astro<00:03:53.130> fog

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
thelight a less than 500 astro fog

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.829 
thelight a less than 500 astro fog
machine<00:03:54.579> and<00:03:54.609> LED<00:03:55.450> moonflower<00:03:56.049> built<00:03:56.500> in<00:03:56.620> one
