so we start on the sea one two three
four<00:01:43.430> five<00:01:43.880> six<00:01:44.270> a<00:01:44.600> flat<00:01:45.469> one<00:01:46.159> two<00:01:46.549> three<00:01:47.000> four

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
and make sure to get wheeled out in the

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.699 
and make sure to get wheeled out in the
ending<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:10.879> it<00:02:11.000> makes<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.510> good<00:02:12.200> epic

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
ending so it makes a good epic

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.640 
ending so it makes a good epic
transition<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.519> the<00:02:13.610> next<00:02:13.819> part

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
transition to the next part

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.960 
transition to the next part
alright<00:02:15.650> now<00:02:15.860> you're<00:02:16.250> right<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.700> we'll<00:02:16.819> do

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
alright now you're right and we'll do

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:28.760 
alright now you're right and we'll do
this

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.440 

now<00:02:29.770> we<00:02:29.830> also<00:02:30.190> know<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:30.790> part<00:02:31.090> already

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
now we also know this part already

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.560 
now we also know this part already
almost<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:33.400> only<00:02:33.640> thing<00:02:33.820> changes<00:02:34.300> is<00:02:34.540> that

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
almost the only thing changes is that

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.490 
almost the only thing changes is that
you<00:02:34.900> don't<00:02:35.080> play<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:40.080> but<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.230> will<00:02:41.320> only

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
you don't play this but you will only

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:49.110 
you don't play this but you will only
play<00:02:41.770> C<00:02:43.170> b-flat<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:45.180> d-flat<00:02:46.980> b3<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.940> it's

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
play C b-flat a d-flat b3 so it's

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.309 
play C b-flat a d-flat b3 so it's
getting<00:02:49.750> even<00:02:50.020> easier

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:07.070 

and<00:02:57.829> the<00:02:58.579> rest<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.180> same<00:02:59.209> as<00:02:59.569> before

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.090 

alright<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:08.500> think<00:03:08.800> it's<00:03:08.920> not<00:03:09.069> that

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
alright and I think it's not that

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:30.290 
alright and I think it's not that
difficult<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:09.760> put<00:03:09.940> together<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:11.140> like<00:03:11.230> this

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.390 

I<00:03:30.330> think<00:03:31.110> if<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.290> already<00:03:31.440> learned<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.100> parts

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
I think if you already learned the parts

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.300 
I think if you already learned the parts
before<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:33.030> this<00:03:33.330> isn't<00:03:34.140> necessary<00:03:35.070> to

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
before that this isn't necessary to

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.900 
before that this isn't necessary to
explain<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.110> hope<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.230> get<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.560> um<00:03:38.100> so

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
explain to you hope you get that um so

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.030 
explain to you hope you get that um so
yeah<00:03:39.150> let's<00:03:39.480> go<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.810> next<00:03:39.990> part<00:03:40.170> see<00:03:40.710> after

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
yeah let's go to the next part see after

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:49.080 
yeah let's go to the next part see after
you<00:03:41.160> did<00:03:41.310> that

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.600 

you<00:03:50.090> will<00:03:50.239> play<00:03:50.950> again<00:03:51.950> as<00:03:52.160> we<00:03:52.459> already

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
you will play again as we already

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.830 
you will play again as we already
learned<00:03:53.060> this

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.490 

just<00:03:58.840> left<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.590> one<00:03:59.980> octave<00:04:00.700> lower<00:04:01.500> this

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
just left and one octave lower this

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:27.570 
just left and one octave lower this
makes<00:04:02.770> it<00:04:02.950> way<00:04:03.370> more<00:04:03.700> epic

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.790 

all<00:04:28.580> right<00:04:28.730> but<00:04:29.150> still<00:04:29.420> something<00:04:30.020> changes

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
all right but still something changes

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:39.439 
all right but still something changes
some<00:04:31.610> things<00:04:31.820> yeah<00:04:33.190> so<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.250> play<00:04:34.640> this

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.480 

anything<00:04:40.439> stays<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.800> same<00:04:41.180> now<00:04:43.099> just<00:04:44.099> the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
anything stays the same now just the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.330 
anything stays the same now just the
left<00:04:44.699> hand<00:04:44.969> pretty<00:04:45.210> much<00:04:45.360> changes<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:46.529> now<00:04:46.770> do

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
left hand pretty much changes you now do

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.260 
left hand pretty much changes you now do
not<00:04:47.550> play<00:04:47.879> this<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:49.020> then<00:04:49.770> go<00:04:49.949> down<00:04:50.339> to<00:04:50.699> play<00:04:50.969> B

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270
