00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
forty dollars and I've been dragging my

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.090 
forty dollars and I've been dragging my
feet<00:00:47.329> kind<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.480> sitting<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.899> these<00:00:49.100> before

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
making a review and the reason for that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.850 
making a review and the reason for that
basically<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.550> because<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.120> don't<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
basically is because I don't like the

basically is because I don't like the
way<00:00:56.100> these<00:00:56.610> headphones<00:00:56.940> sound<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.899> don't<00:00:58.170> think

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
way these headphones sound I don't think

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.000 
way these headphones sound I don't think
they<00:00:58.620> sound<00:00:59.010> good<00:00:59.250> but<00:01:00.000> before<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.199> unpack<00:01:01.800> that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
they sound good but before I unpack that

headband<00:01:51.329> itself<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.899> made<00:01:52.140> out<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.439> some<00:01:52.979> kind

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
headband itself is made out of some kind

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.609 
headband itself is made out of some kind
of<00:01:53.520> plastic<00:01:53.850> polymer<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:54.899> apparently

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
of plastic polymer so it's apparently

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.209 
of plastic polymer so it's apparently
extremely<00:01:55.920> durable<00:01:57.110> very<00:01:58.110> resistant<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.829> kind

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
extremely durable very resistant to kind

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.310 
extremely durable very resistant to kind
of<00:01:59.490> torsion<00:02:00.210> force<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.810> kind<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.170> thing

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
of torsion force and that kind of thing

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.740 
of torsion force and that kind of thing
so<00:02:01.799> that's<00:02:01.979> nice<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.430> see<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.600> an

so that's nice to see it's a it's an

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.020 
so that's nice to see it's a it's an

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
interesting little design

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.190 
interesting little design
unfortunately<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> headband<00:02:06.570> design<00:02:06.930> means

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
unfortunately the headband design means

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.900 
unfortunately the headband design means
that<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> cables<00:02:07.860> come<00:02:08.069> out<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.369> both<00:02:08.610> ear

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that the cables come out of both ear

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.880 
that the cables come out of both ear

think<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.110> big<00:02:22.410> issue<00:02:22.590> since<00:02:23.040> they
