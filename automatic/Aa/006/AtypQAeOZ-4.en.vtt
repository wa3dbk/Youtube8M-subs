is and why we have to be patient with
these<00:01:22.289> updates<00:01:22.800> so<00:01:23.520> first<00:01:23.789> off<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.720> did<00:01:24.929> have<00:01:25.110> a

room at that minecraft a title update 19
was<00:01:28.229> instead<00:01:28.800> testing<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.520> am<00:01:29.729> still<00:01:30.000> sticking

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
was instead testing I am still sticking

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
was instead testing I am still sticking
to<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.690> still<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.349> it<00:01:31.770> possibly<00:01:32.130> could

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
to that I still think it possibly could

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.279 
to that I still think it possibly could
be<00:01:32.520> instead<00:01:32.819> of<00:01:32.940> testing<00:01:33.390> hopefully<00:01:34.170> it

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
be instead of testing hopefully it

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.660 
be instead of testing hopefully it
hasn't<00:01:34.470> failed<00:01:34.800> that<00:01:35.160> would<00:01:35.310> be<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.520> worst

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
hasn't failed that would be the worst

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.969 
hasn't failed that would be the worst
possible<00:01:35.849> outcome<00:01:36.300> the<00:01:37.259> only<00:01:37.470> reason<00:01:37.649> why<00:01:37.950> I

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
possible outcome the only reason why I

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.309 
possible outcome the only reason why I
four<00:01:38.520> zeros<00:01:38.819> don't<00:01:39.030> announce<00:01:39.300> a<00:01:39.539> specific<00:01:40.080> day

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
four zeros don't announce a specific day

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.589 
four zeros don't announce a specific day
anymore<00:01:40.679> is<00:01:41.039> because<00:01:41.069> say<00:01:41.970> if<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:42.179> did<00:01:42.390> send

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:42.599 
anymore is because say if they did send

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:44.389 
anymore is because say if they did send
it<00:01:42.750> instead<00:01:43.020> testing<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.860> fed<00:01:44.099> said

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it instead testing and if fed said
