00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.599
 of three details to give in this 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.550
 day of love and friendship I had very good 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.500
 response from you and is 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.139
 what I bring this new video with 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.240
 three more ideas if you have not seen 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.460
 the previous video I leave here the video 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.800
 so you can see it you can see this first 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.900
 and then you see the other is the other first 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.849
 and then you see this as you want but 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.400
 I hope these three ideas you like 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.400
 equal or more than the previous ones 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.020
 for the first one we are going to need paper 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.320
 china green pancakes chocolate red 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.980
 a flower pot and a lace ball 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.130
 decorated sticks silicon scissors a 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.830
 manga iduya first thing we're going to do 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.400
 is to decorate our flowerpot with the lace 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.400
 and decorated 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.550
 let's put the little tanks already 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.920
 hold them with the chopsticks you can 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.830
 secure the ball of unicel to the pot 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.320
 with a little silicon now what 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.080
 let's do is cut out the Chinese paper 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.210
 of the two colors to fill the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.659
 small holes that remain white 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.579
 we are going to do it this way 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.570
 let's fill each of the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.520
 little white so that he looks father 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.340
 let's fill our sleeve with the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.990
 chocolate previously melted and we're going 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.570
 to decorate each of the pancakes 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:46.220
 giving it a rose shape you can 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.250
 melt the chocolate in the oven 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.250
 microwave or bain-marie and it stays that way 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.350
 for the second one we are going to need a 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:03.250
 frame a deformed silicone heart and 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.760
 silicone tola masking 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.710
 with joy the little one 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.720
 black paint 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.720
 and little buttons of many colors 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.170
 let's start by putting king to 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.170
 make separations you can do it from 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.690
 width that you prefer 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.720
 since it is this way we are going to 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.820
 paint the part that was left free 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.800
 it does not matter what happened to you because that's what 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.270
 are the separations of masking the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.050
 You can find a frame in 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.050
 any stationery 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.110
 since it has dried perfectly well 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.530
 let's take off the masking with a lot 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.530
 watch out 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.610
 we beat our heart of foami with a 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.970
 little bit of silicon in the part of 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.970
 in the middle 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.030
 and now let's paste our 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.359
 little buttons you can go accommodating the 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.689
 how you prefer and the colors 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.689
 big kitten 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.080
 definitely this is the idea that to me 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:22.870
 I liked more we're going to write with 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.870
 our brush the text that you want 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.620
 for the third one we will need a 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:33.520
 stained glass bottle sweet masking 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.260
 of colors a cutter and adhesive sheets what 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.530
 first thing we're going to do is put 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.090
 our masking in our bottle 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.220
 making the separations that we 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.640
 we want in the way that you most 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.640
 like 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.250
 you can do it in the whole bottle or 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.950
 only in one part 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.890
 we apply witral glass I got it in 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.110
 a paint shop we make sure 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.769
 that dries well to give a second 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.750
 past now we retired the masking with 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.739
 be careful not to get up 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.739
 our painting 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.660
 Now it's time to introduce the 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.660
 requirements and fill our bottle 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:26.110
 I print on the sticky sheets you 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:28.870
 I want and what I 'm going to do is with the 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.040
 cutter trimming the letters with much 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.580
 Care and stick them in the bottle 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.870
 and our bottle stays this way 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:41.090
 you can add a small ribbon he cited 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.700

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.370
