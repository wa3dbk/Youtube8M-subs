00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:12.230
 the next integral will be one of the most 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:19.250
 simple solved before so calculate 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:25.470
 integral number 48 integral has 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:30.000
 this kind of integral is from double sine 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:37.040
 argument 2x minus sine half 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.040
 x in half multiplied by dx 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.500
 sum integral equals integral sum 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.680
 so let's write the integral of 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.039
 each term separately that is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:55.670
 this will be the integral of the first term 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:59.579
 sine 2 x multiply by dx and minus 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:06.590
 integral of the second term that is 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:14.040
 sine x multiplied by d ix in half 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:19.189
 further let's try to fit under 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.439
 table integral of sine tdt 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.270
 By the way, let me immediately remind you this 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.360
 here's the bottom of the table integral in 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.840
 he will be before our eyes that is 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:40.490
 integral of sine of you on dt 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:43.780
 equals minus cosine t minus cosine t 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.270
 plus constant c 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.680
 that is, it is this integral as 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.049
 table we will just now 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:57.439
 use from then what do we have in 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.509
 Iâ€™ll start with us first 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.840
 you need to get exactly under the differential 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.909
 the same argument as that of a sine 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.130
 sign of the sine of us two means and under 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.890
 the differential too should owe us 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.690
 be 2 x how to get this deuce we with 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.459
 you have already done so let's do it 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.780
 the easiest way to multiply by 2 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.030
 divide by 2 integral from sine 2x 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.709
 I'll rewrite them 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.769
 then we will contribute this deuce 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.959
 under the sign of the integral and further under 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.540
 differential sign and you know what we 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.890
 can know the differential to make any 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.660
 a constant that is a constant can 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.130
 make and bear the differential 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.010
 further and now as for the second 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.930
 integral to us by integral 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.480
 you need 1 2 that is, we should have 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.340
 the differential from X in half that is us 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.820
 will need to make one second night and 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.709
 we multiply the same by 2 and divide 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.670
 by 2 but only now we will contribute 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.799
 this one second one there is a deuce in 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.650
 numerator let's leave this one second 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:04.790
 will make a sign of the differential that is, 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.709
 in fact , too, the operation itself only 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.600
 we will make a two in the denominator and in 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.160
 the first case we will be under the sign 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.970
 differential two which is in 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.260
 the numerator multiplied by the integral of the sine 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.730
 x 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:30.540
 halved by dx is equal to 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:32.150
 and now let's bring let's make to 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.799
 the first case is this deuce 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.170
 under the sign of the differential in the second case 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.680
 deuce denominator we will add late 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.400
 differential as one second we will bring in as 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.000
 one second in the end we'll get you 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.530
 the next 1 2 we will have after 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.750
 how are we in the numerator deuce take 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.709
 multiply by the integral of the double sine 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.110
 argument multiplied by the differential 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.290
 2x deuce we made under the differential 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.530
 but 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.859
 and now the deuce in the denominator we contribute 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.230
 2 interval from a to deuce remains in 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:14.459
 numerator remain 2 k2 first will 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:18.120
 the deuce in the numerator remains to multiply 2 and 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:21.169
 2 times the integral of the sine of x 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:30.450
 in half and on the differential 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:32.520
 x in half now each of the data each 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:36.270
 of these integrals is tabular 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.190
 and here it belongs to this type that is 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.260
 here to this kind, that is, it is an integral of 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:46.860
 sine integral of sine 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.139
 so this way let's see 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.979
 what we get well firstly 1 2 1 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:55.349
 integral will remain further now sine 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.570
 etc. that is, the quality of so 1 integral 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.070
 it's 2 x 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.260
 that is, the argument is two x we 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.300
 mentally replacing with t we get a sine 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.150
 tons per dt 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.370
 and this integral is equal to minus 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.750
 cosine quit 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.160
 so let's firstly here 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.400
 before 1 2 put a minus sign 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.960
 Further 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:24.449
 multiply by the cosine of t and as you have 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.310
 us 2 x so we will have cosine 2x 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:31.810
 then what remains of the 2 integral 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:34.320
 Well, firstly -2 secondly sine etc. 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.800
 that is, as you already half 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.100
 angle 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:43.300
 i.e. x in half as m 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:45.520
 it turns out then we have minus 2 to minus 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.259
 from cosine that is there will be minus 2 on 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.750
 minus cosine that is it turns out as a result 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:54.460
 here plus will be plus 2 per cosine 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.380
 half argument that is x in half 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:01.000
 well, plus a constant c 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.970
 check the final answer so it means 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.250
 minus one second cosine 2x yes 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:11.530
 I think yes everything seems right 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:15.400
 and 2 cosines of half yes everything is correct 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:18.030
 so this is our final 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.030
 answer
