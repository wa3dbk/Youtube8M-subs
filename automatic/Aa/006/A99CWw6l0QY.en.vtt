 hello friends that such hello friends that such 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.879
 I'm Jorge de Ferro to the point I'm in 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.820
 this social network in google place and I'm going to 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.830
 make a small presentation here 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.289
 slide of this product that is 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.990
 a cleaner for the clothes of the manufacturer 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.820
 magnet is the reference 30 degrees of 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.169
 you live what we will use this 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.759
 cleaner for all those who 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.009
 we do our activities on the air 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.300
 free so much for our jacket 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.600
 our pants as for example from 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.550
 sun cut sep efe or synthetics good 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.770
 eventually they get dirty and 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.110
 they are losing therefore that reference to 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.060
 water then with this product we are going to 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.700
 get two things 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.510
 that the product that in this case would be 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.820
 the clothes do not lose that waterproofing 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.170
 what is wr since we use another 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.820
 type of cleaner by machine or by hand 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.310
 we would lose that repellence work with 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.370
 this is going to make sure that he does not lose that 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.340
 reference the water and the jacket in this 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.380
 case then give us those properties if 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.380
 for the case since we realize 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.060
 that our jacket our pants 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.830
 we see that no longer sick alija hey that 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.260
 they me my partner's jacket me 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.000
 I have here a soccer drop 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.490
 Rebel, we are left below if we do not know 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.650
 get inside I'm walking and only 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.400
 Too much that means we've washed 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.350
 is very dirty and has lost the dw rs the 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.990
 repellency the boot we will need this 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.270
 product here and then for 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.680
 waterproof jacket 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.229
 we will need this product which is the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.310
 product of revive by dry action I will 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.940
 make a presentation here 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.290
 slides and I'm commenting on it and what 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.290
 I'm going to see a lot better 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.150
 as you can see here right now this 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.090
 would the cleaner revive what you 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.700
 we explained earlier this here 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.460
 above that serves for doret garments 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.430
 ebep shop sep and synthetics 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.229
 for step 1 to wash it in the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.759
 washing machine good in the areas in 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.670
 where they really are 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.709
 too much dirt we will apply 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.090
 previously on that spot 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.360
 we will apply directly product this 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.650
 product is concentrated has a volume 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.560
 of about 237 milliliters we would close 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.050
 always the zippers the velcro all 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.239
 what we have from the jacket is good 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.440
 Step 2 would add the product 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.450
 revives cleaner to the washer 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.700
 manufacturer does not recommend that we use 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.250
 a front- loading washer instead of 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.019
 one of the charges greater than 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.180
 then let's see good here 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.800
 I have taken from the wants of the part of 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.319
 behind the bottle I took out in the 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.030
 table that the manufacturer tells us 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.150
 here goes we can also use the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.519
 Stopper as stopper is good for measurements 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.349
 from 1 to 5 garments always machine 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.120
 we will use 15 milliliters of rave and see 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.060
 if we are going to use it by hand in this 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.430
 case we will need 19 liters of water in 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.040
 the same amount of revives but 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.109
 We can use it by machine or by hand 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.239
 soft if we are going to use between 5 to 10 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.609
 clothes we will need 30 milliliters of 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.409
 reliefs and the amount of water at hand 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.209
 that when you need it is going to be about 38 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.859
 liters for example for your tacos de 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.200
 dominated more machine happiness 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.440
 we will need 60 milliliters and for 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.020
 washed machine 75 liters 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.060
 good alternative step 2 in this case 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.210
 it would be that we are using from the 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.610
 tub or the tub or we are in a 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.310
 shelter what we are there for 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.620
 wash the jacket or not 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.780
 we will apply the product in the water 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.420
 we will go in playing pretty well we will go 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.860
 wringing until it runs until 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.170
 you want the water to come out 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.730
 perfectly clear this would be the step 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.760
 where for example we will not use 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.050
 the washing machine now as commented 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.600
 the product noted above 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.270
 which is the spray revives the repellent 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.000
 water because we want to impregnate the 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.790
 jacket we want to give you that 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.930
 extra waterproofing to the jacket 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.330
 because we have lost him of we have 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.150
 good wr periods 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.459
 always after that variant 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.530
 that is the wet pants jacket 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.930
 after washing them, do not 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.850
 we will let it dry then this 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.760
 product recommended for gorete wind 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.220
 stoppers software by the ctc the sun is 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.520
 revive is how I have commented on a 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:36.030
 Water repellent restores or creates the 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:39.930
 wrc is that durable internalization 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.610
 well the next step would be to spray with 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.740
 our spray directly on the 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.150
 jacket is recommended to hang it in a 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.700
 hold an approximate distance between 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.110
 about 15 to 30 centimeters and we have to 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.140
 be generous especially the area of the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.350
 shoulders and fists we will leave dried 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:59.010
 approximately 45 minutes in the 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.870
 step fourth would be to dry it in this case 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.570
 is the manufacturer says we put it if 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.060
 on jackets that allows us 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.880
 we follow 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.860
 In the washing machine, let's dry it 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.690
 the washing machine will be much better for the 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.000
 product is resumed by the party 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:18.880
 interior says that approximately 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.960
 less about 60 minutes 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.970
 good as you have seen in the 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.430
 presentation these products we are going to 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.930
 use this would be to make it what 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.800
 is the cleaning of our jacket and 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.350
 this would be to give him the internalization 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.880
 Well I hope your advice and how it has 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.880
 displayed the product a greeting
