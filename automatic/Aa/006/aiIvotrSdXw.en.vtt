weekend<00:04:40.340> said<00:04:40.790> in<00:04:41.750> 88<00:04:44.410> everything<00:04:45.410> and

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
weekend said in 88 everything and

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.670 
weekend said in 88 everything and
everything<00:04:46.600> had<00:04:47.600> 88<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:49.850> smallest<00:04:50.680> nostrils

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
everything had 88 the smallest nostrils

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:59.340 
everything had 88 the smallest nostrils
that<00:04:52.090> so<00:04:53.090> it's<00:04:53.240> probably<00:04:53.270> 20<00:04:54.139> 28<00:04:56.259> 18<00:04:57.259> games

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
that so it's probably 20 28 18 games

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.120 
that so it's probably 20 28 18 games
there<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:00.500> go<00:05:00.710> I<00:05:00.979> remember<00:05:01.370> this<00:05:01.580> on<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:02.240> wire

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
there you go I remember this on the wire

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:10.600 
there you go I remember this on the wire
the<00:05:04.130> thing<00:05:04.460> that<00:05:04.669> is<00:05:07.270> at<00:05:08.270> which<00:05:08.630> point<00:05:09.610> triple

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
the thing that is at which point triple

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.320 
the thing that is at which point triple
zero<00:05:10.850> so<00:05:11.270> this<00:05:11.510> is<00:05:11.840> I<00:05:12.139> believe<00:05:12.199> or<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:13.940> seven

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
zero so this is I believe or that seven

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.500 
zero so this is I believe or that seven
sixteenth<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.320> an<00:05:15.470> inch<00:05:16.060> after<00:05:17.060> that<00:05:17.240> you<00:05:17.479> just

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
sixteenth of an inch after that you just

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:25.110 
sixteenth of an inch after that you just
say<00:05:17.900> half<00:05:18.110> inch<00:05:19.060> Nancy<00:05:21.010> 916<00:05:22.010> and<00:05:22.430> so<00:05:23.360> on<00:05:23.570> and<00:05:23.840> so

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
say half inch Nancy 916 and so on and so

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.370 
say half inch Nancy 916 and so on and so
um<00:05:26.120> so<00:05:27.050> yes<00:05:27.320> always<00:05:28.310> bothered<00:05:29.090> me<00:05:29.120> I<00:05:29.479> just

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
um so yes always bothered me I just

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.700 
um so yes always bothered me I just
think<00:05:30.740> people<00:05:31.039> sound<00:05:31.520> too<00:05:31.820> good<00:05:32.440> Nixon<00:05:33.440> had
