00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 sure with a video game in 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.160
 you have been able to spend more hours of 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.529
 what you originally wanted 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.870
 or games to help you count sums 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.759
 hundreds of hours the video games can 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.200
 become very addictive and even 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.340
 some companies accuse the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.619
 developers to do it 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.480
 extremely addictive and that that can 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.850
 harming players in a way 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.529
 harmful although these protests soon 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.430
 they fall on a broken sack because it's like saying 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.470
 that make jelly beans too sweet 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.689
 these are ten cases of extreme addiction 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.070
 to video games at number 10 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.530
 we have a boy in perth australia 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.690
 which led to the end that lack the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.489
 class who more and who least the most 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.170
 At some point he may have missed 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.260
 be able to play but what this guy did 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.640
 is the following every morning he dressed 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.309
 with the uniform to go to school 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.350
 he left home and pretended to go though when 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.140
 his mother was going to work came back and he 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.760
 put to play then pretended to return according to 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.800
 she came home from work later 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.690
 he was doing this for three 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.670
 months so after being told 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.230
 they discovered sabotage the phone of their 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.329
 mother so she would not receive calls from 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.920
 the school and at school he said that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.840
 would be absent because they would have 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.409
 that operate explaining that his mother 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.109
 would have 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.270
 and disconnected that time miraculously 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:16.040
 made everything work for three 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.380
 months after that they caught the lie 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.970
 in position number 9 the pissed off by 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.310
 lose in some games can be in 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.350
 such mythical occasions are remembered as 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.270
 the worst you can have but there are 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.090
 people who take everything to the limit and this 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.650
 It is a very illustrative example in Beijing 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.420
 it happened that after losing a 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.580
 game against a classmate 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.710
 this was after the companion and 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.080
 set fire and in case you are 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.510
 asking in a game the boy 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.800
 he was a magician at number 8 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.990
 we have a case that there was a lot of talk 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.460
 some time ago we talked about the man of 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.350
 South Korea that was pulled almost around 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.720
 of three nights in a row playing 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.670
 starcraft after a session of 50 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.430
 hours the man fell and died for 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.140
 heart failure death was 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.180
 caused naturally by exhaustion 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.190
 since at that time he only used the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.960
 bath on few occasions and periods very 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.150
 sleep shorts that could not get to 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.830
 the hour but has been a victim of this 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.290
 type of events more times than they 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.150
 I would like to admit so worrying this 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.340
 situation for them that they even have 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.680
 detoxification centers of games in 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.450
 line despite this, there are still cases 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.510
 where there are people who can be months 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.700
 whole without leaving home in the post 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.050
 number 7 as I could not miss 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.760
 we have the most addictive game in the 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.220
 last years saving league of 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.959
 legends warcraft has been the biggest game 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.720
 online that could have been created we are 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.860
 faithful fans and of course fans 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.050
 corpses on December 27 , 2004 yes 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.400
 or yes, even if it seems to be a lie, I leave a 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.110
 note saying that this life was 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.540
 insufficient and that would join the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.880
 heroes of the game after that opened the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.510
 window and jumped into the void 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.460
 before that he spent his last 36 hours 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.560
 Playing 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.180
 at number 6 we can see how 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.310
 the most extreme cases of people 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.990
 addicted to video games are not only 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.650
 children but they can also be 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.270
 adults a South Korean girl died for 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.100
 abandonment of the parents who passed the 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.620
 hours taking more care of a virtual girl 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.930
 that to her the game was prius online 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.550
 to understand a game similar to 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.950
 that they took out with the name of second life 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.380
 where players have jobs and 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.480
 they live their lives in one of their many 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.880
 sessions the couple went out to a cyber to 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.570
 play that lasted more than 12 hours at 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.400
 come back they found her dead in the 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.890
 put number 5 we have something similar to 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.780
 previous case a man left filling up 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.210
 the bathtub with his twin sons inside 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.420
 while he went out to play with his game 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.160
 boy advance gray clay marc faces 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.090
 up to 10 years in prison for homicide 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.010
 involuntary 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.540
 in position number 4 we have here the 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.910
 chen wei to support him to death 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.590
 wang sugar after it sold 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.010
 a virtual sword that had gotten 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.930
 kibo in the game law in 2003 rubber and 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.400
 He said he was sorry and that he would give him the 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.560
 money that he had got but chen 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.720
 Wei did not attend to reasons and when he lost 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.750
 the nerves took advantage when he slept to 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.370
 Chinese stabbing does not contemplate any 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.019
 law for the crimes that are committed 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.330
 inside the games but curiously 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.180
 South Korea - yes it has a section 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.370
 of crimes online at number 3 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.040
 we have a really depressing case in 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.500
 vietnam a 13 year old boy killed and robbed 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.410
 an old woman of 81 years to be able to play 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.330
 as he himself confessed in the statement 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.070
 the boy passed a rope around the 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.620
 neck of the lady and the extra none 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.930
 after that the semi buried in front of 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.300
 a clearing that was in his house the 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.720
 money that he could steal were six 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.490
 dollars with 20 cents in the post 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.039
 number 2 there is a subject discussed and very 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.780
 spoken the mother of sound bully ensures 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.610
 that his son committed suicide because of 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.720
 obsession that his son had developed 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.850
 for the game 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.990
 Everquest developers are 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.520
 defended by claiming that yes 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.860
 possible that in play condition your 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.020
 son to commit suicide but the mother what 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.640
 corroborates and affirms it knowing that his 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.860
 son spent the hours of the day with the 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.600
 game she commented that she had strong 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.760
 theories to believe that the game was the 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.470
 motive something she does not understand but 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.170
 who presumes that for the son he would charge 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.470
 more importance than it should sony 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.180
 online did not say anything else about the matter 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.770
 and finally at number one there 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.620
 a case more typical of a film of 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.210
 terror that from real life an event that 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.560
 by itself without mixing it with the 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.300
 world gamer turns out pretty 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.480
 chilling just thinking about the 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.800
 This situation is also the few cases in 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.320
 those who do not involve a game 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.810
 online multiplayer daniel patrick of 17 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.670
 years he murdered his mother and injured 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.250
 Gravity his father after he 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.080
 will refuse to continue playing with halo 3 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.730
 this boy little in agreement with the decision 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.620
 that they had taken from not letting him play 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.770
 more went into his parents' room 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.320
 and told them you can close your eyes I have 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.510
 a surprise for you immediately 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.360
 shot in his mother's head and close 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.939
 was the father also to die 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.010
 and nothing more familiar subscribe dale like 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:06:02.510
