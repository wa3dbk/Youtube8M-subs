00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
books authoritative and because of their

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.620 
books authoritative and because of their
power<00:01:21.180> they<00:01:22.140> impose<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.369> church

nothing<00:01:24.630> could<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.930> farther<00:01:25.110> from<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> truth

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
nothing could be farther from the truth

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.080 
nothing could be farther from the truth
it<00:01:27.570> may<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.110> when<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> book<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.520> written<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
it may have when a book was written it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.359 
it may have when a book was written it
was<00:01:30.119> considered<00:01:30.659> authoritative<00:01:30.950> why<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.310> that

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
was considered authoritative why is that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.170 
was considered authoritative why is that
and<00:01:33.060> here's<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.110> issue<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:35.040> seems<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.610> that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and here's the issue it seems to be that

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.510 
and here's the issue it seems to be that
the<00:01:36.240> Old<00:01:36.600> Testament<00:01:36.840> books<00:01:37.470> were<00:01:37.799> written<00:01:37.829> by

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the Old Testament books were written by

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.590 
the Old Testament books were written by
prophets<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:40.290> seems<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
prophets that seems to be the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.780 
prophets that seems to be the
determining<00:01:42.600> factor<00:01:43.590> yes<00:01:43.890> Moses<00:01:44.490> was<00:01:44.759> a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
determining factor yes Moses was a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.859 
determining factor yes Moses was a
prophet<00:01:46.189> so<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.579> books<00:01:47.880> were<00:01:48.180> written<00:01:48.210> by

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
prophet so the books were written by

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.160 
prophet so the books were written by
profits<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.820> if<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.270> book<00:01:51.450> was<00:01:51.479> written<00:01:51.869> by<00:01:52.140> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
profits and if the book was written by a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.749 
profits and if the book was written by a
recognized<00:01:53.009> profit<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.970> came<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:55.759> authority

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
recognized profit it came with authority

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.920 
recognized profit it came with authority
