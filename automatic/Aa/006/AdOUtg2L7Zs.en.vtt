00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
drugs only in specific cases we must

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.930 
drugs only in specific cases we must
always<00:03:29.910> consider<00:03:30.240> th<00:03:30.960> and<00:03:31.260> alt<00:03:31.590> status<00:03:32.220> of<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
always consider th and alt status of the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.390 
always consider th and alt status of the
of<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.870> pads<00:03:34.110> and

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
of the of the pads and

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.670 
of the of the pads and
we<00:03:35.819> have<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.120> know<00:03:36.299> that<00:03:36.330> these<00:03:37.140> substances

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
we have to know that these substances

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.910 
we have to know that these substances
are<00:03:38.420> psychotropic<00:03:39.420> substances<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.200> so<00:03:40.650> their

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
are psychotropic substances and so their

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.190 
are psychotropic substances and so their
sale<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.459> under<00:03:41.849> medical<00:03:42.440> prescription<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:44.000> I

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
sale is under medical prescription and I

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.930 
sale is under medical prescription and I
think<00:03:46.200> most<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.769> cases<00:03:47.159> have<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.700> be

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
think most of the cases have to be

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.930 
think most of the cases have to be
accompanied<00:03:48.780> by<00:03:48.810> therapy<00:03:49.940> behavioral

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
accompanied by therapy behavioral

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.600 
accompanied by therapy behavioral
therapy<00:03:51.840> okay<00:03:52.739> so<00:03:52.799> in<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.099> cases<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.579> which

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
therapy okay so in the cases in which

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.839 
therapy okay so in the cases in which
you<00:03:54.239> actually<00:03:55.079> end<00:03:55.530> up<00:03:55.680> suggesting<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.610> use

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
you actually end up suggesting the use

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.390 
you actually end up suggesting the use
of<00:03:57.030> these<00:03:57.180> drugs<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:57.840> will<00:03:58.230> also<00:03:58.739> suggest<00:03:59.280> the
