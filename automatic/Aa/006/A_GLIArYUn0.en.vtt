00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.209 
that on part of that is time as well as
most<00:02:24.000> Broncos<00:02:24.689> nowadays<00:02:25.319> have<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.709> cutout<00:02:26.040> in

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
most Broncos nowadays have the cutout in

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.770 
most Broncos nowadays have the cutout in
the<00:02:26.250> back<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:26.909> it's<00:02:27.030> not<00:02:27.180> going<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.659> look

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
the back so it's not going to look

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.440 
the back so it's not going to look
terribly<00:02:28.230> bad<00:02:29.689> the<00:02:30.689> inside<00:02:31.670> all<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.000> paneling

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
terribly bad the inside all the paneling

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.429 
terribly bad the inside all the paneling
had<00:02:33.659> been<00:02:33.840> replaced<00:02:34.349> that<00:02:34.920> were<00:02:35.250> corroded<00:02:35.579> and

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
had been replaced that were corroded and

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.539 
had been replaced that were corroded and
most<00:02:37.439> of<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.680> work<00:02:37.950> was<00:02:38.129> actually<00:02:38.340> done

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
most of this work was actually done

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.179 
most of this work was actually done
pretty<00:02:39.000> well<00:02:41.299> there's<00:02:42.299> still<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.599> lot<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:43.189> holds

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
pretty well there's still a lot of holds

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.099 
pretty well there's still a lot of holds
that<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.760> original<00:02:45.209> owners<00:02:45.569> have<00:02:45.780> drilled

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
that the original owners have drilled

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.729 
that the original owners have drilled
into<00:02:46.700> into<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.819> floor<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.480> besides<00:02:49.169> we're

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
into into the floor and besides we're

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.149 
into into the floor and besides we're
going<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.159> have<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.459> weld<00:02:50.669> those<00:02:50.849> shut<00:02:52.159> we're

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
going to have to weld those shut we're

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.869 
going to have to weld those shut we're

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
going to install these inner quarter

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.259 
going to install these inner quarter
panel<00:02:57.469> covers<00:02:58.469> so<00:02:59.280> we're<00:02:59.459> going<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.879> have<00:03:00.060> to

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
panel covers so we're going to have to

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.959 
panel covers so we're going to have to
actually<00:03:00.629> weld<00:03:00.870> all<00:03:01.769> brackets<00:03:02.370> right<00:03:02.579> here

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 
actually weld all brackets right here

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.649 
actually weld all brackets right here
where<00:03:03.180> they're<00:03:03.299> gonna<00:03:03.419> fix<00:03:03.840> against<00:03:04.409> I<00:03:05.659> found

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
where they're gonna fix against I found

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.390 
where they're gonna fix against I found
a<00:03:06.810> little<00:03:07.019> bit<00:03:07.200> more<00:03:07.260> corrosion<00:03:07.799> on<00:03:08.159> this

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
a little bit more corrosion on this

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.270 
a little bit more corrosion on this
right<00:03:09.060> here<00:03:09.450> all<00:03:10.109> of<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.409> corrosion<00:03:10.919> has<00:03:11.069> to

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
right here all of the corrosion has to

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.059 
right here all of the corrosion has to
be<00:03:11.400> removed<00:03:11.730> no<00:03:12.060> matter<00:03:12.239> how<00:03:12.450> small

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.819 

underneath<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.219> dash<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.669> looked<00:03:17.849> okay<00:03:18.829> here

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
underneath the dash it looked okay here

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.649 
underneath the dash it looked okay here
was<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.069> cutout<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.579> was<00:03:20.849> done<00:03:21.060> in<00:03:21.209> order<00:03:21.329> to

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
was a cutout that was done in order to

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.849 
was a cutout that was done in order to
get<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.549> back<00:03:23.549> plate<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.419> this<00:03:24.959> hinge<00:03:25.260> this

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
get to the back plate of this hinge this

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.969 
get to the back plate of this hinge this
hinge<00:03:26.099> plate<00:03:26.400> locking<00:03:26.879> plate<00:03:27.560> so<00:03:28.560> we're<00:03:28.859> gonna

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:28.979 
hinge plate locking plate so we're gonna

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.179 
hinge plate locking plate so we're gonna
have<00:03:29.189> to<00:03:29.310> fix<00:03:29.519> all<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:29.819> good<00:03:30.209> stuff<00:03:30.239> as<00:03:30.629> well

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
have to fix all that good stuff as well

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.800 
have to fix all that good stuff as well
again<00:03:32.189> the<00:03:32.340> wiring<00:03:32.639> harness<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.150> most<00:03:33.419> likely

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
again the wiring harness is most likely

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.330 
again the wiring harness is most likely
going<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.109> be<00:03:34.199> removed<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:35.299> other<00:03:36.299> thing<00:03:36.659> is

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
going to be removed the other thing is

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.479 
going to be removed the other thing is
probably<00:03:38.340> going<00:03:38.639> to<00:03:38.760> remove<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.299> dash<00:03:39.510> and

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
probably going to remove the dash and

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.319 
probably going to remove the dash and
we're<00:03:41.489> going<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.909> go<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.239> an<00:03:42.359> older<00:03:42.720> one<00:03:43.069> the

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
we're going to go with an older one the

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.469 
we're going to go with an older one the
1966<00:03:45.329> dashes<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:46.109> personally<00:03:46.709> like<00:03:46.859> better<00:03:47.189> and

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
1966 dashes I personally like better and

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.619 
1966 dashes I personally like better and
I'm<00:03:48.479> probably<00:03:48.780> going<00:03:49.199> to<00:03:49.319> install<00:03:49.829> that<00:03:50.069> I

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
I'm probably going to install that I

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.780 
I'm probably going to install that I
parted<00:03:51.629> out<00:03:51.780> five<00:03:52.139> Broncos<00:03:52.769> in<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:53.009> last<00:03:53.250> 18

the<00:04:57.630> body<00:04:57.810> shop<00:04:58.229> actually<00:04:58.800> put<00:04:59.279> the<00:04:59.430> motor<00:04:59.639> and

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
the body shop actually put the motor and

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.490 
the body shop actually put the motor and
transmission<00:05:00.270> back<00:05:00.750> in<00:05:01.020> and<00:05:01.289> there's

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
transmission back in and there's

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.399 
transmission back in and there's
Hardware<00:05:01.949> missing<00:05:02.370> so<00:05:03.029> even<00:05:03.539> for<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:03.900> reason

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
Hardware missing so even for that reason

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.839 
Hardware missing so even for that reason
the<00:05:05.010> entire<00:05:06.770> drivetrain<00:05:07.770> will<00:05:08.279> have<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.639> come

the entire drivetrain will have to come
back<00:05:09.029> out<00:05:09.270> I<00:05:09.630> cannot<00:05:10.560> trust<00:05:10.919> that<00:05:11.279> that<00:05:11.610> was

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
back out I cannot trust that that was

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.659 
back out I cannot trust that that was
