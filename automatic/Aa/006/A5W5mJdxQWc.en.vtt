00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
machine as you can see here I've got a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.570 
machine as you can see here I've got a
laser<00:00:11.790> sight<00:00:12.150> extended<00:00:13.110> mag<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:14.190> scope

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
laser sight extended mag and a scope

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.810 
laser sight extended mag and a scope
which<00:00:15.030> I'll<00:00:15.420> never<00:00:15.929> really<00:00:16.170> use<00:00:16.699> all<00:00:17.699> right

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
which I'll never really use all right

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.040 
which I'll never really use all right
let's<00:00:17.970> talk<00:00:18.090> about<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.390> pros<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.600> cons<00:00:18.900> of

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
let's talk about the pros and cons of

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.410 
let's talk about the pros and cons of
hipfire<00:00:19.380> hipfire<00:00:19.800> allows<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.430> be<00:00:20.730> mobile

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
hipfire hipfire allows you to be mobile

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.900 
hipfire hipfire allows you to be mobile
still<00:00:21.750> most<00:00:22.080> guns<00:00:22.410> take<00:00:23.039> away<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.490> mobility

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
still most guns take away that mobility

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.179 
still most guns take away that mobility
when<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.390> scope<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.930> some<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.439> not<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.010> keep

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
when you scope in some do not so keep

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.490 
when you scope in some do not so keep
that<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.400> mind<00:00:26.670> you're<00:00:26.939> more<00:00:27.210> mobile<00:00:27.810> we're<00:00:28.349> in

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
that in mind you're more mobile we're in

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.999 
that in mind you're more mobile we're in
hip<00:00:28.680> fire<00:00:28.949> mode<00:00:29.369> okay<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.420> second<00:00:30.779> thing<00:00:31.009> with

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
hip fire mode okay the second thing with

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.250 
hip fire mode okay the second thing with
the<00:00:32.160> hit<00:00:32.340> fire<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.450> allows<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.079> shoot

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the hit fire is it allows you to shoot

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.380 
the hit fire is it allows you to shoot
faster<00:00:34.770> when<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.100> go<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> aim<00:00:35.670> down<00:00:36.000> sight

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
faster when you go to aim down sight

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.639 
faster when you go to aim down sight
like<00:00:36.570> I'm<00:00:36.719> doing<00:00:36.989> right<00:00:37.020> now<00:00:37.200> there<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
like I'm doing right now there is a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.740 
like I'm doing right now there is a
small<00:00:38.100> delay<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> getting<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.149> reduced<00:00:39.510> cone

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
small delay to getting that reduced cone

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.410 
small delay to getting that reduced cone
of<00:00:39.899> fire<00:00:39.930> if<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.800> guy's<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.219> your<00:00:41.370> face<00:00:41.610> you're

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
of fire if a guy's in your face you're

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.119 
of fire if a guy's in your face you're
getting<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.809> his<00:00:42.960> face<00:00:43.260> sometimes<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.920> don't

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
getting in his face sometimes you don't

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.940 
getting in his face sometimes you don't
have<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.610> extra<00:00:45.000> time<00:00:45.300> okay<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.440> let's<00:00:46.800> talk

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
have that extra time okay so let's talk

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.529 
have that extra time okay so let's talk
about<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.250> third<00:00:47.489> thing<00:00:47.700> why<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.090> wanted<00:00:48.450> to

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
about a third thing why you wanted to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.600 
about a third thing why you wanted to
use<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> laser<00:00:48.930> lasers<00:00:49.559> reduce<00:00:49.980> your<00:00:50.219> cone<00:00:50.430> of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
use a laser lasers reduce your cone of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.670 
use a laser lasers reduce your cone of
fire<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:51.149> hip<00:00:51.270> fire<00:00:51.510> okay<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.469> take<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
fire for hip fire okay if you take a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.200 
fire for hip fire okay if you take a
look<00:00:52.770> my<00:00:53.070> cone<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.399> fire<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.730> grew<00:00:53.910> because<00:00:54.059> I

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
look my cone of fire just grew because I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.660 
look my cone of fire just grew because I
took<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.510> off<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.949> positives<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.129> laser<00:00:56.399> is

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
took it off the positives this laser is

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.330 
took it off the positives this laser is
it<00:00:56.850> blinds<00:00:57.300> people<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:57.899> douses<00:00:58.410> them<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
it blinds people or douses them but the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.799 
it blinds people or douses them but the
negative<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.059> gives<00:01:00.239> away<00:01:00.390> your<00:01:00.510> position

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
negative is it gives away your position

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.319 
negative is it gives away your position
so<00:01:01.289> there's<00:01:01.530> an<00:01:01.649> enemy<00:01:02.010> laser<00:01:02.280> around<00:01:02.730> like

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
so there's an enemy laser around like

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.810 
so there's an enemy laser around like
shining<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.960> my<00:01:04.170> wall<00:01:04.470> I'm<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.519> an

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
shining on my wall I'm going to have an

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.660 
shining on my wall I'm going to have an
idea<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.270> where<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> enemies<00:01:07.290> at<00:01:07.530> okay<00:01:08.159> so

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
idea of where the enemies at okay so

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.460 
idea of where the enemies at okay so
keep<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.090> mind<00:01:09.210> when<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.930> use<00:01:10.170> your<00:01:10.350> laser

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
keep that in mind when to use your laser

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.219 
keep that in mind when to use your laser
and<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.430> use<00:01:11.610> your<00:01:11.760> laser<00:01:12.229> alright

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and one that to use your laser alright

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.719 
and one that to use your laser alright
so<00:01:13.439> let's<00:01:13.890> take<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> look<00:01:14.340> I'm<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.640> turn

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
so let's take a look I'm going to turn

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.179 
so let's take a look I'm going to turn
my<00:01:14.909> laser<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.420> I'm<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.770> start<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.040> go<00:01:17.159> up

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
my laser on I'm going to start to go up

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.820 
my laser on I'm going to start to go up
into<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.759> spawn<00:01:18.570> tunnel<00:01:19.080> from<00:01:19.380> our<00:01:19.590> side

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
into this spawn tunnel from our side

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.999 
into this spawn tunnel from our side
because<00:01:20.009> i<00:01:20.400> don't<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> flag<00:01:21.830> see<00:01:22.830> what's

another<00:02:11.370> thing<00:02:11.580> about<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.849> mp7<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.629> it's<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
another thing about the mp7 is it's the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.720 
another thing about the mp7 is it's the
best<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.560> best<00:02:13.709> when<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:13.950> comes<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.280> hip<00:02:14.459> fire

best the best when it comes to hip fire

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.670 
best the best when it comes to hip fire
in<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.150> range<00:02:15.420> at<00:02:15.660> which<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.959> can<00:02:16.110> do<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.440> at

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
in the range at which you can do it at

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.979 
in the range at which you can do it at
okay<00:02:17.010> obviously<00:02:17.220> rival<00:02:18.209> smacks<00:02:18.510> Manning

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989

quick this drops him from range that's
it<00:02:30.810> that's<00:02:31.380> 2<00:02:31.680> verse<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.300> he<00:02:33.300> drops<00:02:33.630> again

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
it that's 2 verse and he drops again

some weapons are better than others at

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.720 
some weapons are better than others at
this<00:02:36.209> don't<00:02:36.900> try<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.230> with<00:02:37.560> some<00:02:37.769> of<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.069> you

this don't try this with some of the you

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.190 
this don't try this with some of the you
know<00:02:38.790> support<00:02:39.330> guns<00:02:39.569> hoping<00:02:39.930> you're<00:02:40.019> going<00:02:40.140> to

level<00:02:40.349> eight<00:02:40.620> guys<00:02:40.860> you're<00:02:41.069> not<00:02:41.220> going<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.430> do

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
level eight guys you're not going to do

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.119 
level eight guys you're not going to do
it<00:02:41.610> because<00:02:41.670> they're<00:02:41.849> not<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.830> accurate<00:02:43.830> but

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
it because they're not that accurate but

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.759 
it because they're not that accurate but
the<00:02:44.310> mp7<00:02:44.640> is<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> laser<00:02:45.480> beam<00:02:45.780> def<00:02:46.110> machine<00:02:46.560> and

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
the mp7 is a laser beam def machine and

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.470 
the mp7 is a laser beam def machine and
again<00:02:47.220> lastly<00:02:47.700> let's<00:02:48.000> take<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> look<00:02:48.360> at<00:02:48.450> my

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
again lastly let's take a look at my

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.870 
again lastly let's take a look at my
laser<00:02:48.780> beam<00:02:49.080> another<00:02:49.980> example<00:02:50.280> when<00:02:50.549> not<00:02:50.730> to

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
laser beam another example when not to

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.490 
laser beam another example when not to
use<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.299> can<00:02:51.450> see<00:02:51.599> my<00:02:51.750> laser<00:02:52.019> on<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.319> wall

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
use it you can see my laser on the wall

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500 
use it you can see my laser on the wall
that's<00:02:53.040> not<00:02:53.250> good<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.730> smart<00:02:54.090> player<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.390> going

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
that's not good a smart player is going

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.780 
that's not good a smart player is going
to<00:02:54.599> see<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.780> know<00:02:55.110> exactly<00:02:55.829> where<00:02:56.160> I'm<00:02:56.430> at

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
to see that know exactly where I'm at

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.420 
to see that know exactly where I'm at
because<00:02:57.450> lasers<00:02:57.900> make<00:02:58.140> straight<00:02:58.470> lines<00:02:58.500> okay

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
because lasers make straight lines okay

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.339 
because lasers make straight lines okay
a<00:02:59.610> smart<00:03:00.150> player<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.690> going<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.900> come<00:03:01.079> in<00:03:01.230> and

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
a smart player is going to come in and

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.930 
a smart player is going to come in and
say<00:03:01.500> wait<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.769> minute<00:03:01.890> angle<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.489> incidence

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
say wait a minute angle of incidence

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.180 
say wait a minute angle of incidence
ingalls<00:03:03.360> equals<00:03:03.810> angled<00:03:04.170> reflection<00:03:04.739> that

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
ingalls equals angled reflection that

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.920 
ingalls equals angled reflection that
guy<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.610> exact<00:03:05.970> opposite<00:03:06.510> over<00:03:06.690> there's

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
guy is the exact opposite over there's

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.350 
guy is the exact opposite over there's
lasers<00:03:07.319> at<00:03:07.500> ok<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.430> he's<00:03:08.610> going<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.849> come<00:03:09.030> dull

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
lasers at ok so he's going to come dull

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.270 
lasers at ok so he's going to come dull
me<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.750> head<00:03:09.930> alright<00:03:10.319> so<00:03:10.530> know<00:03:10.980> when<00:03:11.190> to

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
me in the head alright so know when to

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.550 
me in the head alright so know when to
turn<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.489> off<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.060> then<00:03:12.900> when<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.110> turn<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.319> on
