00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
both pretty wrong and also add in Kyle

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.990 
both pretty wrong and also add in Kyle
coin<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.870> don't<00:03:32.020> know<00:03:32.080> who<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.410> but<00:03:32.530> yo<00:03:33.000> he

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
coin I don't know who that is but yo he

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.490 
coin I don't know who that is but yo he
seems<00:03:34.240> odd<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.420> me<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:34.870> having<00:03:35.170> these<00:03:35.230> three

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
seems odd to me so having these three

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.500 
seems odd to me so having these three
players<00:03:35.710> off<00:03:35.980> coming<00:03:36.580> off<00:03:36.760> your<00:03:36.970> bench<00:03:37.030> I

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
players off coming off your bench I

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.180 
players off coming off your bench I
think<00:03:38.260> it's<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.380> pretty<00:03:38.530> good<00:03:38.710> idea<00:03:38.800> let<00:03:39.100> me

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
think it's a pretty good idea let me

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.590 
think it's a pretty good idea let me
know<00:03:39.430> what<00:03:39.580> you<00:03:39.700> got<00:03:39.820> in<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.150> comment<00:03:40.420> section
