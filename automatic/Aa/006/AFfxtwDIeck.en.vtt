in<00:00:18.330> falsify<00:00:18.720> was<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> bit<00:00:19.020> different<00:00:19.260> than<00:00:19.590> it

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
in falsify was a bit different than it

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.429 
in falsify was a bit different than it
would<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.920> was<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.460> Forza<00:00:20.939> 4<00:00:21.150> I'm<00:00:22.080> sure<00:00:22.289> you've

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
would it was in Forza 4 I'm sure you've

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.519 
would it was in Forza 4 I'm sure you've
noticed<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.220> bit<00:00:23.460> heavier<00:00:24.180> bit<00:00:25.140> harder<00:00:25.500> to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
noticed it's a bit heavier bit harder to

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.160 
noticed it's a bit heavier bit harder to
steer<00:00:26.119> you<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.359> very<00:00:27.570> patient<00:00:27.779> on<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
steer you have to be very patient on the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.439 
steer you have to be very patient on the
throttle<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.939> I've<00:00:29.939> been<00:00:30.119> playing<00:00:30.330> about

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
throttle and I've been playing about

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.729 
throttle and I've been playing about
with<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:31.050> best<00:00:31.650> settings<00:00:33.200> so<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.500> go<00:00:34.680> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
with the best settings so if you go to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.410 
with the best settings so if you go to
your<00:00:35.100> fills<00:00:35.370> profile<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.000> change<00:00:36.210> these

advanced<00:01:04.489> now<00:01:05.489> these<00:01:05.670> are<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> settings<00:01:06.180> that

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
advanced now these are the settings that

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.320 
advanced now these are the settings that
I<00:01:06.659> use<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:08.400> new<00:01:08.549> improved<00:01:08.970> settings<00:01:11.090> if<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
I use the new improved settings if I

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.010 
I use the new improved settings if I
press<00:01:12.750> Y<00:01:14.150> goes<00:01:15.150> back<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> default

press Y goes back to the default

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.800 
press Y goes back to the default
settings<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> dead<00:01:18.570> zones

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
settings so you can see the dead zones

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.859 
settings so you can see the dead zones
are<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> bit<00:01:19.140> larger<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> default

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869

for anyone who wants to know what and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.060 
for anyone who wants to know what and
the<00:01:23.369> dead<00:01:23.520> zone<00:01:23.729> means<00:01:24.229> essentially<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.890> area

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
the dead zone means essentially the area

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.330 
the dead zone means essentially the area
on<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.880> stick<00:01:27.560> for<00:01:28.560> which<00:01:28.710> there<00:01:29.070> will<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.189> no

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
on the stick for which there will be no

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.210 
on the stick for which there will be no
movement<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.540> move<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:32.009> steering

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
movement so if you move the steering

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.560 
movement so if you move the steering
axis

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570

inside<00:01:34.229> by<00:01:34.799> 24<00:01:35.220> percent<00:01:35.310> nothing<00:01:35.820> will<00:01:35.939> happen

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
inside by 24 percent nothing will happen

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.789

and<00:01:36.770> from<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> outside<00:01:38.810> basically<00:01:39.810> 95%<00:01:40.259> of

and from the outside basically 95% of

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.510 
and from the outside basically 95% of
the<00:01:40.890> way<00:01:41.009> out

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the way out

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.249 
the way out
something<00:01:42.270> will<00:01:42.390> happen<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> last<00:01:43.049> five

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
something will happen but the last five

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.380 
something will happen but the last five
percent<00:01:43.530> there'll<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.710> no<00:01:43.860> movement<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:45.240> what

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
percent there'll be no movement but what

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.690 
percent there'll be no movement but what
I<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.250> put<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.340> all<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> way

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
I like to do is put this all the way

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.719 
I like to do is put this all the way
down<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.270> 0<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.280> 104<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
down to 0 and 104 then for the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.450 
down to 0 and 104 then for the
acceleration<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.770> play<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:52.950> down<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.250> 0

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
acceleration you can play this down to 0

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.740 
acceleration you can play this down to 0
100<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.210> 1<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.630> 99<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.590> put<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.950> lot

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
100 or like 1 and 99 just put it a lot

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.780 
100 or like 1 and 99 just put it a lot
closer<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> extremes<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:59.520> what

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.570 

then<00:02:02.390> what<00:02:02.510> the<00:02:02.600> default<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.140> because<00:02:03.710> this

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
then what the default is because this

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.820 
then what the default is because this
just<00:02:04.820> makes<00:02:04.970> it<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.120> lot<00:02:05.240> easier<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:06.530> put<00:02:06.740> this

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
just makes it a lot easier so I put this

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.200 
just makes it a lot easier so I put this
down<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:09.340> 199<00:02:11.230> roughly<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.650> can<00:02:12.680> have<00:02:12.950> 0<00:02:13.730> 100

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
down to 199 roughly you can have 0 100

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.580 
down to 199 roughly you can have 0 100
it<00:02:14.600> doesn't<00:02:14.990> matter<00:02:15.110> too<00:02:15.200> much<00:02:15.290> but<00:02:15.560> just

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
it doesn't matter too much but just

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.950 
it doesn't matter too much but just
change<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:17.120> acceleration<00:02:17.720> and

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
change it so acceleration and

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.310 
change it so acceleration and
deceleration<00:02:18.110> dead<00:02:19.040> zones<00:02:19.280> are<00:02:19.460> basically<00:02:20.320> if

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
deceleration dead zones are basically if

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
deceleration dead zones are basically if
we<00:02:21.380> put<00:02:21.710> that<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.980> zero

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
we put that to zero

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.180 
we put that to zero
as<00:02:22.550> soon<00:02:22.760> as<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.060> put<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.380> throttle<00:02:24.560> down<00:02:24.770> even

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
as soon as I put the throttle down even

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.060 
as soon as I put the throttle down even
1%<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:26.180> will<00:02:26.360> start<00:02:26.810> accelerating<00:02:27.050> if<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:27.860> put

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
1% it will start accelerating if I put

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.660 
1% it will start accelerating if I put
it<00:02:28.160> up<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:29.170> 20<00:02:30.170> for<00:02:30.410> example<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:31.280> car<00:02:31.490> won't

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
it up to 20 for example the car won't

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.460 
it up to 20 for example the car won't
start<00:02:31.790> accelerating<00:02:32.180> until<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.870> put<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.260> stick

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
start accelerating until I put the stick

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.500 
start accelerating until I put the stick
down<00:02:33.530> 20<00:02:34.100> percent<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:35.000> if<00:02:35.060> you're<00:02:35.180> putting<00:02:35.300> the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
down 20 percent so if you're putting the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.840 
down 20 percent so if you're putting the
stick<00:02:35.690> down<00:02:36.100> 10<00:02:37.100> percent<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.520> way<00:02:37.610> nothing

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
stick down 10 percent of the way nothing

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.780 
stick down 10 percent of the way nothing
will<00:02:38.090> happen<00:02:38.800> so<00:02:39.800> it's<00:02:39.950> better<00:02:40.160> it's<00:02:40.610> more

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
will happen so it's better it's more

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.460 
will happen so it's better it's more
responsive<00:02:41.360> it's<00:02:41.570> better<00:02:41.780> just<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.080> put<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.380> to

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
responsive it's better just to put it to

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.830 
responsive it's better just to put it to
0<00:02:42.500> or<00:02:43.280> 1<00:02:44.500> 1<00:02:45.500> 99<00:02:45.830> doesn't<00:02:46.400> matter<00:02:46.550> too<00:02:46.700> much

this on to normal the steering assist
I<00:03:24.680> have<00:03:25.580> tried<00:03:25.820> simulation<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:26.480> just<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.959> don't

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
I have tried simulation you just I don't

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.470 
I have tried simulation you just I don't
know<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.040> just<00:03:28.340> don't<00:03:28.459> think<00:03:28.730> it's<00:03:28.850> as<00:03:29.000> good<00:03:29.269> it

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
know I just don't think it's as good it

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.170 
know I just don't think it's as good it
just<00:03:29.660> doesn't<00:03:29.950> react<00:03:30.950> as<00:03:31.220> sharply<00:03:31.790> or<00:03:32.090> as

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
just doesn't react as sharply or as

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.380 
just doesn't react as sharply or as
easily<00:03:32.450> it's<00:03:33.049> not<00:03:33.200> as<00:03:33.290> free-flowing<00:03:34.090> so<00:03:35.090> give

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
easily it's not as free-flowing so give

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.160 
easily it's not as free-flowing so give
snowball<00:03:36.290> or<00:03:36.440> try<00:03:37.780> assisted<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:38.870> won't<00:03:39.049> bother

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
snowball or try assisted I won't bother

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.590 
snowball or try assisted I won't bother
with<00:03:39.380> that<00:03:39.440> well<00:03:40.280> obviously<00:03:40.850> if<00:03:41.180> you're<00:03:41.330> just

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
with that well obviously if you're just

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.110 
with that well obviously if you're just
starting<00:03:41.750> out<00:03:41.959> then<00:03:42.200> yeah<00:03:42.320> but<00:03:43.190> I<00:03:43.549> would<00:03:43.880> I

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
starting out then yeah but I would I

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.180 
starting out then yeah but I would I
would<00:03:44.540> use<00:03:44.780> normal<00:03:45.350> I<00:03:45.500> think<00:03:45.739> that's<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:45.980> best

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
would use normal I think that's the best

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.910 
would use normal I think that's the best
one<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.580> use<00:03:47.590> obviously<00:03:48.590> for<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.799> other

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
one to use obviously for the other

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.890 
one to use obviously for the other
assists<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:49.700> it's<00:03:50.030> up<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.299> you<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:52.459> ultimate

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900

for ultimate speed you're going to want

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.170 
for ultimate speed you're going to want
manual<00:03:55.489> clutch<00:03:56.260> traction<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.380> stability<00:03:57.470> off

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.220 
braking ABS off sometimes traction you

turn it on depending on the car

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.949 
turn it on depending on the car
especially<00:04:03.530> in<00:04:03.860> higher<00:04:04.070> classes<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.959> because

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
throttle that you just have to have
