00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.620
 there are people who are born with a dome a 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.660
 skill that will make them your life what 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.900
 happens to matias seems more like a 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.630
 surprise surprisingly his arm 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.070
 exaggeratedly starving 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.860
 bulky very different to his arm 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.530
 left this has allowed me to highlight 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.900
 in the pulse sports mode 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.130
 after we peel the reason for 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.130
 Curious appearance of matías 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:40.829
 this is matias slider 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.170
 or as many call it hellboy 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.469
 he is one of the most 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.670
 important in the sport modality of 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.390
 pulses also known as fight 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.710
 arms 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:59.379
 in 2004 Matías signed up for a championship 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.740
 of pulses that there was in a bar of his 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.210
 city 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:08.800
 the young man was just 16 years old and barely 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.590
 Weighed 65 kilograms 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.159
 the championship was for men up 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.850
 90 kilograms 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.479
 Upon entering the little bar the young man was 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.750
 ridiculed all the men laughed 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.170
 of the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.960
 what his competitors did not know was the 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.820
 incredible strength that he had with his arm 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.850
 straight 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.070
 the laughter soon became 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.410
 respect and admiration for matías because 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.920
 surprisingly he ended up winning that 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.590
 championship 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.500
 this story is just the beginning of a 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.110
 long list of victories throughout the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.340
 world 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:59.710
 the boy now 27 years old has won 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.090
 and seven German titles and 14 titles 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.759
 international 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.229
 since childhood he grew up with his right arm 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:12.290
 largest exactly has 7 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.330
 centimeters in diameter more than in the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.420
 left 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.110
 this is due to a rare condition 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.470
 genetics known as syndrome 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.750
 proteus that causes a growth 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.410
 excessive extremities 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.590
 but you matías instead of lamenting 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.370
 be one of the 120 people in all the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.000
 world with this disease decided 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:48.110
 take advantage of it and become what 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.110
 is now every pulse champion 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:58.400
