00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
data but at least they were supposed to

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.980 
data but at least they were supposed to
collect<00:04:05.400> data<00:04:05.580> but<00:04:06.270> then<00:04:06.420> they<00:04:06.600> had<00:04:06.750> this

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
collect data but then they had this

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.890 
collect data but then they had this
level<00:04:07.680> system<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.180> kid<00:04:09.390> went<00:04:09.630> up<00:04:09.720> the

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
level system and a kid went up the

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.390 
level system and a kid went up the
levels<00:04:10.230> depending<00:04:11.040> on<00:04:11.250> their<00:04:11.700> behaviors<00:04:12.270> and

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
levels depending on their behaviors and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.490 
levels depending on their behaviors and
it<00:04:14.400> was<00:04:14.610> mostly<00:04:14.940> absence<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:15.630> bad<00:04:15.870> behavior

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
it was mostly absence of bad behavior

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.970 
it was mostly absence of bad behavior
that<00:04:17.220> got<00:04:17.460> them<00:04:17.700> out<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:18.030> levels<00:04:18.390> and

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
that got them out the levels and

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.920 
that got them out the levels and
supposedly<00:04:19.980> they<00:04:20.250> had<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.549> tied<00:04:20.820> so<00:04:21.600> when<00:04:21.810> they

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
supposedly they had it tied so when they

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.879 
supposedly they had it tied so when they
got<00:04:22.169> to

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
got to

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.969 
got to
the<00:04:23.250> highest<00:04:23.669> level<00:04:24.030> then<00:04:25.020> they<00:04:25.319> were<00:04:25.379> ready

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
the highest level then they were ready

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.179 
the highest level then they were ready
to<00:04:26.129> start<00:04:26.550> looking<00:04:27.120> at<00:04:27.240> discharge<00:04:27.979> energy<00:04:28.979> and

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.189 
to start looking at discharge energy and

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.580 
to start looking at discharge energy and
they<00:04:30.120> started<00:04:30.479> doing<00:04:30.659> discharge<00:04:31.289> planning

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
they started doing discharge planning

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.059 
they started doing discharge planning
and<00:04:31.949> then<00:04:32.909> they<00:04:33.599> hope<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:33.870> discharge<00:04:34.409> you<00:04:34.590> as

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
and then they hope to discharge you as

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.700 
and then they hope to discharge you as
soon<00:04:35.430> as<00:04:35.550> possible<00:04:35.969> after<00:04:36.659> you<00:04:37.020> reached<00:04:37.289> that

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
soon as possible after you reached that

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.649 
soon as possible after you reached that
level<00:04:38.419> and<00:04:39.419> you<00:04:40.289> know<00:04:40.409> later<00:04:40.800> on<00:04:40.919> in<00:04:41.550> in<00:04:42.210> in

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
two we'll talk about the advantages and

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.899 
two we'll talk about the advantages and

came<00:05:01.229> in<00:05:01.439> and<00:05:01.680> he<00:05:02.550> learned<00:05:02.819> the<00:05:03.029> level<00:05:03.270> system

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
came in and he learned the level system

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.760 
came in and he learned the level system
really<00:05:03.960> well<00:05:04.279> so<00:05:05.279> that<00:05:06.080> from<00:05:07.080> what<00:05:07.590> I<00:05:07.620> could

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
really well so that from what I could

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.219 
really well so that from what I could
tell<00:05:08.159> by<00:05:08.729> the<00:05:08.789> time<00:05:09.029> I<00:05:09.060> came<00:05:09.210> in<00:05:09.479> to<00:05:09.659> consult<00:05:10.080> on

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
tell by the time I came in to consult on

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:10.580 
tell by the time I came in to consult on
the<00:05:10.349> case

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
the case

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.459 
the case
he<00:05:11.490> knew<00:05:11.699> that<00:05:12.620> manual<00:05:13.620> for<00:05:14.129> the<00:05:14.870> level<00:05:15.870> system

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:16.469 
he knew that manual for the level system

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:18.950 
he knew that manual for the level system
better<00:05:16.740> than<00:05:16.979> any<00:05:17.219> of<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.550> staff<00:05:17.879> he<00:05:18.629> knew<00:05:18.779> it

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
better than any of the staff he knew it

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.730 
better than any of the staff he knew it
backwards<00:05:19.529> and<00:05:19.650> forwards<00:05:20.810> but<00:05:21.810> Andy<00:05:22.319> had<00:05:22.500> gone

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
backwards and forwards but Andy had gone

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.990 
backwards and forwards but Andy had gone
through<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.490> level<00:05:23.789> system<00:05:24.210> quickly<00:05:24.509> and<00:05:26.000> it

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
through the level system quickly and it

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.670 
through the level system quickly and it
did<00:05:27.270> always<00:05:27.449> take<00:05:27.839> time<00:05:28.080> because<00:05:28.259> that<00:05:28.560> you

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
did always take time because that you

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.529 
did always take time because that you
have<00:05:28.830> to<00:05:28.979> be<00:05:29.069> good<00:05:29.250> for<00:05:29.580> a<00:05:29.610> long<00:05:29.909> time<00:05:30.270> before

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
have to be good for a long time before

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.230 
have to be good for a long time before
you<00:05:30.779> move<00:05:31.050> to<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.319> next<00:05:31.349> level<00:05:31.889> but<00:05:32.819> he<00:05:33.029> had

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
you move to the next level but he had

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.670 
you move to the next level but he had
made<00:05:33.509> it<00:05:33.629> up<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:33.870> levels<00:05:34.139> one<00:05:34.319> at<00:05:34.440> a<00:05:34.469> time

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
made it up the levels one at a time

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.869 
made it up the levels one at a time
never<00:05:35.039> going<00:05:35.370> back

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:35.879 
never going back
