00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
going to stamp the inside I'm using some

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.050 
going to stamp the inside I'm using some
cocoa<00:03:58.019> inc<00:03:58.380> was<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.859> Coco<00:03:59.190> no<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.579> was<00:03:59.670> saddle

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
cocoa inc was it Coco no it was saddle

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.050 
cocoa inc was it Coco no it was saddle
saddle<00:04:00.660> colored<00:04:01.109> ink<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:01.730> that's<00:04:02.730> pretty

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
saddle colored ink and that's pretty

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.000 
saddle colored ink and that's pretty
much<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.359> so<00:04:03.840> this<00:04:04.019> is<00:04:04.049> pretty<00:04:04.380> much<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.680> whole
