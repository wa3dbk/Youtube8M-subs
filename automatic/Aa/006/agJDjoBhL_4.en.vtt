00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:03.280
 in the 12th century, the Chinese first became 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.639
 reel over fishing line 

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:07.939
 before throwing it in a year 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.879
 today's coils made of light 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.240
 high strength materials and have 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.860
 fixtures that are fast 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.880
 unwind and re-twist the line that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 would you catch the biggest fish 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.849
 the old coils were very heavy and 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.339
 only had one speed 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.480
 modern has two or more speeds and 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.760
 fewer parts coil body 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.679
 make science driven 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:40.579
 computer-made metal 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.350
 machines for this were less than you cylinder 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.469
 four holes are made they 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.030
 allow the fisherman to get to 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.629
 a failure or as it is often called spools 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.400
 to unravel any conditions in alaska 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.800
 on another milling machine and workpiece 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.360
 bulges more ie internal 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.280
 details of the coil which will then 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.590
 reel in silesian 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.780
 if two six days are cut 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.860
 Out transfer gives you the opportunity faster 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.170
 reel down 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.830
 big fish 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.550
 after the machine made of very 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.510
 durable carbon material 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.510
 but still they change once a week 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.530
 on the other hand urge crash major 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.940
 gears that impact 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.960
 gear or school drawn 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.619
 this allows the fisherman to rewind years 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.619
 demand back to start gas 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.000
 further the remains are cut small 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.930
 groove on the details of karma itself 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.540
 devices that enable 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.390
 fisherman to control 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.910
 line length 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.020
 another prize for this company name 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.780
 manufacturer on one of the side 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.960
 carcass record 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.330
 another actress makes markup 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.480
 the degree of tension of Alaska 1 2 3 4 and 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.720
 blocking 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.740
 the latter gives the opportunity to the fisherman 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.470
 catch fish up to nine hundred 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.470
 kilograms 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.209
 the coil side plates are immersed in 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.000
 bathroom with a special solution and 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.709
 containing gold color dyes for 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.579
 applying oxide films to protect 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.959
 them from corrosion this process is called 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.780
 anodizing is now at 2 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.620
 safety constipation which is not 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.469
 will let the fishermen pull too tight or 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.200
 loosen fishing line applied 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.829
 special water repellent 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.829
 grease 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:37.999
 Next put the bearings to 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.759
 hold mows in the center of the spool then 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.229
 plate ratchet which makes sound 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.229
 when a fish pulls alaska 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.329
 behind them is a steel spider and brake 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.329
 disk 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.299
 as well as a durable synthetic washer 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.569
 inside insert 8 gears 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.479
 Now you can insert the chaff 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:15.719
 put the coil special 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.239
 rotating device and in doing so 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.239
 steel mounts for street 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.690
 other side plate 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.690
 fastened with six bolts 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.409
 it's a metal spring cum victims 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.180
 allows the fisherman to change 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.029
 coil rotation speed from high 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:43.169
 or low 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.410
 pressing just one button 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.500
 further with the help of a special 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.350
 tool insert retainer 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.649
 to fix the mechanism in place 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.739
 caused a little lubrication on the gears and 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.239
 the spools are almost ready 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.279
 insert its body does not forget 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:03:59.739
 attach a special window 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.459
 school that joins 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.159
 completing and preventing the fish from escaping being 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.279
 Kuyvashev rub 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.739
 then put the right plate in place 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:10.630
 and behind her 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.440
 lever and switch 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.609
 braking device 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.359
 the switch is turned on 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.799
 clockwise to increase tension 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.000
 Lensk them counterclockwise his two 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.330
 decrease 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.419
 then follows setting knobs for 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.150
 winding fishing line and at the end but after 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.080
 switching winding speed 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.860
 fishing line 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.870
 brake lever asks for permission 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.469
 perm check that they are good 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:37.469
 acted 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.749
 potato checks at high speed 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.809
 rotation to check whether 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:48.159
 guards for ford prevent 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.620
 swipe fishing line when 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.560
 900 meters Lensk will not 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.639
 amenable to your control 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.759
 and you yourself have such a misfortune 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:56.889
 may feel dizzy
