showing zero point zero volts because of
course<00:01:07.430> it's<00:01:07.640> nothing<00:01:07.850> here<00:01:08.210> this<00:01:08.420> little

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
course it's nothing here this little

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.270 
course it's nothing here this little
display<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:09.110> voltage<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.920> whole<00:01:10.070> of<00:01:10.159> each

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
display the voltage the whole of each

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.490 
display the voltage the whole of each
battery<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:10.880> also<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.360> will<00:01:11.509> indicate<00:01:12.320> to

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
battery and also that will indicate to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.950 
battery and also that will indicate to
you<00:01:12.740> whether<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.070> battery<00:01:13.369> is<00:01:13.460> good<00:01:13.670> or<00:01:13.790> bad

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.990 

little<00:01:17.960> cigarette<00:01:18.560> lighter<00:01:18.740> adapter<00:01:19.159> that

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
little cigarette lighter adapter that

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.180 
little cigarette lighter adapter that
would<00:01:20.270> go<00:01:20.450> here<00:01:20.780> does<00:01:21.380> not<00:01:21.409> come<00:01:21.799> with<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:21.979> by

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
would go here does not come with it by

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.649 
would go here does not come with it by
the<00:01:22.250> way<00:01:24.940> so<00:01:25.940> let's<00:01:26.119> try<00:01:26.270> some<00:01:26.479> of<00:01:26.570> these

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
the way so let's try some of these

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.600 
the way so let's try some of these
batteries<00:01:27.110> we<00:01:27.770> have<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:27.920> nickel<00:01:28.250> metal<00:01:28.460> hydride

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
batteries we have a nickel metal hydride

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.380 
batteries we have a nickel metal hydride
battery<00:01:29.390> this<00:01:29.479> is<00:01:29.539> a<00:01:29.780> double-a<00:01:33.820> we<00:01:34.820> have<00:01:34.940> an<00:01:35.030> 18

and this one is a 16-3 4050 mi and as

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.910 
and this one is a 16-3 4050 mi and as
you<00:01:57.119> can<00:01:57.300> see<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.900> display<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.470> displays

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
you can see on the display it displays

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.880 
you can see on the display it displays
all<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.250> different<00:01:59.729> voltages<00:02:00.440> one<00:02:01.440> point<00:02:01.680> 4

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
all the different voltages one point 4

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.980 
all the different voltages one point 4
volts<00:02:01.920> four<00:02:02.550> point<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:02.940> volts<00:02:02.970> for<00:02:03.600> put<00:02:03.810> one

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
volts four point one volts for put one

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.920 
volts four point one volts for put one
in<00:02:04.110> volts<00:02:04.530> four<00:02:04.860> point<00:02:05.159> zero<00:02:05.190> volts<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.090> also

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
in volts four point zero volts I also

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.229 
in volts four point zero volts I also
has<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.170> blinking<00:02:07.590> display<00:02:08.039> event<00:02:08.310> top<00:02:08.489> when

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
has a blinking display event top when

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.240 
has a blinking display event top when
the<00:02:09.270> display<00:02:09.750> stops<00:02:10.050> blinking<00:02:10.470> then<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the display stops blinking then the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.440 
the display stops blinking then the
battery<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.790> at<00:02:11.970> full<00:02:12.300> charge<00:02:14.209> pretty<00:02:15.209> nice

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
battery is at full charge pretty nice

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.300 
battery is at full charge pretty nice
it's<00:02:15.870> nice<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.260> know<00:02:16.380> what<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.709> voltages<00:02:17.160> of

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
it's nice to know what the voltages of

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.270 
it's nice to know what the voltages of
the<00:02:17.400> batteries<00:02:17.760> are<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.770> status<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
the batteries are the status of the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.610 
the batteries are the status of the
battery<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.730> indicator<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.750> kind<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.500> like

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
battery the indicator so I kind of like

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.800 
battery the indicator so I kind of like
this<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> pretty<00:02:23.580> nice<00:02:23.760> multi<00:02:24.360> charger

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
this this is a pretty nice multi charger

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.020 
this this is a pretty nice multi charger
I<00:02:25.019> able<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:26.010> charge<00:02:26.250> all<00:02:26.519> these<00:02:26.700> different

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
I able to charge all these different

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.520 
I able to charge all these different
types<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.420> batteries<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:30.450> only<00:02:30.810> thing

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
types of batteries in it the only thing

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.350 
types of batteries in it the only thing
I<00:02:31.709> can<00:02:31.890> see<00:02:32.070> wrong<00:02:32.280> with<00:02:32.489> this<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.030> have<00:02:33.180> to

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
I can see wrong with this is you have to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.940 
I can see wrong with this is you have to
make<00:02:33.480> sure<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.959> batteries<00:02:34.350> are<00:02:34.380> lined

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
make sure that the batteries are lined

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.640 
make sure that the batteries are lined
up<00:02:35.160> pretty<00:02:35.910> precisely<00:02:36.600> because<00:02:37.320> if<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
up pretty precisely because if the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.860 
up pretty precisely because if the
batteries<00:02:38.010> are<00:02:38.040> off<00:02:38.400> by<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> little<00:02:38.970> bit<00:02:41.870> you'll

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
batteries are off by a little bit you'll

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.170 
batteries are off by a little bit you'll
get<00:02:43.019> a<00:02:43.050> zero<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> voltage<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.030> won't

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
get a zero so a voltage and it won't

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.949 
get a zero so a voltage and it won't
charge

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.119
