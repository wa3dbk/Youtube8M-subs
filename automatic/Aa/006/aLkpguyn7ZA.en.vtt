00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.719
 [Music] 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.259
 the questioning was very clear 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.780
 that things when they came out were going to 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.039
 to be like that I do questioned everything but 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.539
 I think last semester we have 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.400
 got something very important for the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.090
 club that is getting a drink for a 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.439
 cup such a second in a tournament that was 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.439
 a long time that I did not fight nor 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.090
 before we were the best in the world nor 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.240
 bad we are the worst any mind 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.890
 it is logical we have it but 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.130
 we know that the only way to reverse 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.050
 it is with work and following good 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.320
 same tonic that did not arrive 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.910
 I repeat the last semester in 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.880
 the whole tournament and you can for the short 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.560
 by the court there is a lot that does not understand 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.820
 the relationship that we have does not the 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.560
 they will never understand 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.280
 that we enjoy as we enjoy that 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.680
 we love then what we do there are people 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.230
 that bothers you, we do not know what the 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.930
 reason but 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.640
 but we know that I knew and then what to 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.250
 repeat we knew very well that the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.900
 things go wrong I think I said it when 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.020
 things were going well it was going to be like that 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.680
 and then hold he trusts what I 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.440
 I make 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.630
 the group also feel very respect 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.970
 great that that leaves me very 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.320
 quiet that is what it is that I 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.120
 I have to dedicate what I have to 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.100
 convince is a group, not anything, and nobody 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.470
 more than are those who defend me 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.909
 in that sense I am very calm and 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.620
 I know that things are going to reverse 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.930
 I have no doubt when we arrived 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.970
 we are also the situation that we 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.670
 they asked that we do not know what we know 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.250
 the whole situation that happened the club what 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.090
 we solved 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.880
 with this group and I have no doubt that 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.700
 after we are in a moment that 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.189
 these things can happen 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.950
 but I am very proud of the decision that 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.880
 we take because I know what he feels 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.090
 for the club 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.890
 and it's true that I would direct it for free 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.890
 and if it were for the economic thing we would have 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.160
 taken other decisions that you know 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.709
 the offers that have come and the many 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.190
 offers and if it's for the economic 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.190
 we decided something else 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.950
 the wide stories and history of the club 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.740
 I get up all day for that and more than 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.920
 nothing to defend the prestige of whoever 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.950
 be a mother 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.970
 either 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:43.060
 or I am not cross me why by 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.380
 what last semester was blonde eye clear 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.070
 and 16 meters 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.530
 but it's like that and I knew that I got in and 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:03:02.229
 I have the person who is very calm 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:02.229
