00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:11.669
 and we are again with the teacher to 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:16.059
 Miguel 10 in glass today 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:18.490
 It is amazing how good it 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.400
 we can frame bases mandali houses that 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.039
 it can also be decorative objects 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.310
 mainly good these are an object 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.660
 decorative where we are going to apply good 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.609
 This product owes to the color that 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.920
 They are mainly glass powders 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.350
 do not confuse with an enamel likewise 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.110
 it is a promotion for the promotion 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:43.220
 beautiful buying 5 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.770
 chips or glass powder if they carry a 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.750
 gift bird that you choose and also 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.780
 I want to tell you about the promotion of 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.890
 I like pesos I like me to pesos 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.620
 remember girls that with 400 pesos of the 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.400
 you will be given a ticket 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.360
 20 pesos and keep it keep the 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.190
 why for the next 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.880
 but start working like that we learn 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.950
 the use of each good one as I said the 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.450
 I'm going to do it in dust 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.130
 glass 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.890
 the chicken video what has 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.450
 it is mainly a beauty and a 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.280
 wealth of color that does not have a 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.909
 enamel is a work already of a 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.070
 medium complexity then it also has 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.560
 to keep in mind as the main me 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.620
 they make a design on paper 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.590
 This is a simple basic design without 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.970
 too many laps in anything 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.020
 likewise I am going to deal with my 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.960
 Facebook 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.180
 go placing some patterns of 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.460
 jobs that come out in the program as 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.260
 so that people can lift them and 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.630
 solve the design issue a bit 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.880
 well we took a video of this case as 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.770
 say a video of 3 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.579
 first of all if we have the design 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.350
 of base I here I have it advanced almost 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.530
 we work with a typology if it were a 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.950
 In vitro we did not finish passing the design and 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.950
 number 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.710
 here we finished the design by the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.830
 other side 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.380
 we have the glass be in this case I 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.000
 also forward they will see that what 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.120
 I have to do now is cut the 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.690
 pieces I already know myself what are the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.710
 that cut only I was missing two of 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.660
 the line below 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.660
 that would be the 18th 19th 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.510
 a white mark that is what goes on 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.160
 above the level above and on the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.069
 line that we mark that there 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.010
 we open 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.249
 we have to transport the moderately 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.379
 this puzzle does not need to be put together 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:53.090
 my same composition to be able 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.930
 move the glass powder in shape 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.150
 of rainbow 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.540
 we have already armed our google or 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.280
 puzzle completed exactly as 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.439
 is the original now the step that 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.620
 continues is this product that is a 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:08.329
 kind of adhesive that is called glub in 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.690
 this case I use it with a sprinkler or 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.010
 updated 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.010
 strips of the pieces 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.220
 we need a fine mesh colander 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.510
 because we are going to use powder and good 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.860
 subject of containers not to be 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.570
 by as much as cheste and 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.540
 certain things that neat medium of 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.540
 obsessive good to see the dust 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.560
 it looks like a glaze do not confuse that these 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.560
 glass powders placed in the colander 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.060
 and simply the stars in remember 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.250
 I know they have to be fairly 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.760
 generous because if not the jobs 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.770
 they are poor in color this work with 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.530
 enamels can not achieve those 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.900
 works for glass dust or so 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.790
 less of this quality and translucent 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.400
 because also the particularity that 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.040
 cullet has to mention that there 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.840
 also opal and us but the great 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.780
 wonder that we have is to observe 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.120
 what are we achieving 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.209
 works with translucent colors is 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.870
 wonderful now we have to take it to 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.870
 our base 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.650
 something fundamental we are going to work it 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.460
 also with vinyl glue 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.630
 we are moving to the piece 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:27.830
 we clean if there is a surplus with the 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.710
 finger and we apply it precisely what 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.240
 fundamental in the theme of the tail's 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.240
 clinic is that 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.689
 this you can not place me here 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.610
 year cement not because there they will achieve 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.779
 a calcination and a stain has to 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.449
 be very delicate 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:49.979
 then they place the pieces little by little and 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.979
 all they are going to do is dot 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:55.839
 puts the points on you no matter what 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:58.569
 move because he moved it back towards 

00:04:55.839 --> 00:05:00.639
 down in the vinyl tail never never alone 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.589
 a point does not need to be 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.889
 constantly with two points in one 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:08.379
 piece is reached is allowed to dry 12 hours 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:12.249
 and that point is going to be exactly 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:16.229
 dry and our immovable piece what 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:16.229
 placed in the mold and work in ends 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.090
 ah 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.240
 to 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.880
 in see color I will find the greatest 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.200
