we're<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.780> looking<00:00:33.900> at<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> pattern

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
we're going to be looking at a pattern

we're going to be looking at a pattern
inspired<00:00:35.190> by<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> recent<00:00:35.820> less<00:00:35.910> than<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.150> was

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
inspired by a recent less than I was

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.040 
inspired by a recent less than I was
teaching<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.860> Beethoven's<00:00:37.860> moonlight<00:00:38.010> sonata

the<00:00:40.050> pattern<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.650> a<00:00:40.680> diminished<00:00:41.370> pattern<00:00:41.730> that

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
the pattern is a diminished pattern that

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.730 
the pattern is a diminished pattern that
is<00:00:42.240> played<00:00:42.450> over<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.720> left-hand<00:00:43.140> octave<00:00:43.590> and

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
is played over a left-hand octave and

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.520 
is played over a left-hand octave and
here<00:00:44.580> it<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.910> its<00:00:45.030> original<00:00:45.150> context<00:00:46.080> but

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
here it is in its original context but

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:59.330 
here it is in its original context but
transposed<00:00:47.040> up<00:00:47.220> a<00:00:47.400> major<00:00:47.580> third

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.160 

when<00:01:00.340> I<00:01:00.370> first<00:01:00.580> heard<00:01:00.820> it<00:01:00.970> it<00:01:01.360> reminded<00:01:01.810> me<00:01:01.870> as

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
when I first heard it it reminded me as

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.610 
when I first heard it it reminded me as
something<00:01:02.440> that<00:01:02.620> we<00:01:03.070> might<00:01:03.250> improvise<00:01:03.700> over<00:01:04.210> a

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
something that we might improvise over a

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.740 
something that we might improvise over a
dominant<00:01:05.620> seven<00:01:05.890> chord<00:01:05.920> with<00:01:06.220> a<00:01:06.250> flat<00:01:06.520> nine<00:01:06.760> so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
dominant seven chord with a flat nine so

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.780 
dominant seven chord with a flat nine so
I<00:01:07.780> thought<00:01:08.050> why<00:01:08.590> not<00:01:08.620> put<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.190> pattern<00:01:09.520> with<00:01:09.730> a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
I thought why not put the pattern with a

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.760 
I thought why not put the pattern with a
simple<00:01:10.300> left<00:01:10.510> hand<00:01:10.780> shell<00:01:10.990> voicing<00:01:11.410> and<00:01:11.620> see

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
simple left hand shell voicing and see

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.040 
simple left hand shell voicing and see
how<00:01:11.920> it<00:01:12.040> sounds<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.610> this<00:01:13.570> time<00:01:13.780> we're<00:01:13.930> also

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
how it sounds and this time we're also

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:25.570 
how it sounds and this time we're also
not<00:01:14.290> going<00:01:14.440> to<00:01:14.530> play<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.740> pedal

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.100 

so<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.730> pattern<00:01:27.090> when<00:01:27.270> played<00:01:27.479> over<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> basic

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
so that pattern when played over a basic

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.500 
so that pattern when played over a basic
shell<00:01:28.320> voicing<00:01:28.770> really<00:01:29.340> outlines<00:01:29.760> all<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
shell voicing really outlines all the

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.420 
shell voicing really outlines all the
great<00:01:30.960> notes<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.440> we<00:01:31.560> would<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:31.770> using<00:01:31.800> over

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
great notes that we would be using over

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.130 
great notes that we would be using over
a<00:01:32.460> basic<00:01:32.880> dominant<00:01:33.300> 7<00:01:33.540> chord<00:01:33.570> with<00:01:33.870> the<00:01:33.960> flat

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
a basic dominant 7 chord with the flat

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.590 
a basic dominant 7 chord with the flat
line<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.040> for<00:01:35.220> c7<00:01:35.790> our<00:01:36.720> flat<00:01:37.170> 7<00:01:37.640> or<00:01:38.640> flat<00:01:38.910> 9<00:01:39.119> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
line so for c7 our flat 7 or flat 9 a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.930 
line so for c7 our flat 7 or flat 9 a
third

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.120 

let<00:01:43.900> me<00:01:43.990> know<00:01:44.110> we're<00:01:44.290> really<00:01:44.470> missing<00:01:44.650> is<00:01:45.100> the

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
let me know we're really missing is the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.770 
let me know we're really missing is the
root<00:01:45.490> in<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.730> right<00:01:45.880> hand<00:01:46.120> but<00:01:46.270> that's<00:01:46.570> played

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
root in the right hand but that's played

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.060 
root in the right hand but that's played
in<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:46.960> left<00:01:47.170> hand<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:47.560> we're<00:01:47.770> not<00:01:47.860> going<00:01:48.010> to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
in the left hand so we're not going to

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.700 
in the left hand so we're not going to
really<00:01:48.220> be<00:01:48.280> missing<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.760> that<00:01:48.910> much<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.530> let's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
really be missing it that much so let's

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.410 
really be missing it that much so let's
take<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.890> brief<00:01:51.100> look<00:01:51.250> at<00:01:51.520> how<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.880> pattern<00:01:52.300> is

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
take a brief look at how the pattern is

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.600 
take a brief look at how the pattern is
put<00:01:52.600> together<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:53.680> this<00:01:53.800> will<00:01:53.950> all<00:01:54.070> be<00:01:54.250> over<00:01:54.280> a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
put together so this will all be over a

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.820 
put together so this will all be over a
c7<00:01:55.450> chord<00:01:55.690> for<00:01:55.870> now<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.290> in<00:01:56.380> our<00:01:56.440> left<00:01:56.680> hand

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
c7 chord for now so in our left hand

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.470 
c7 chord for now so in our left hand
we're<00:01:56.950> going<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.130> play<00:01:57.280> just<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.580> simple<00:01:57.970> root

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
we're going to play just a simple root

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.220 
we're going to play just a simple root
and<00:01:58.660> third<00:01:58.840> voicing<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.780> only<00:02:01.930> thing<00:02:02.110> you're

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
and third voicing the only thing you're

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.810 
and third voicing the only thing you're
going<00:02:02.350> to<00:02:02.470> need<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:02.710> know<00:02:02.950> music<00:02:03.370> theory<00:02:03.580> wise

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
going to need to know music theory wise

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.280 
going to need to know music theory wise
for<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.120> right<00:02:04.300> hand<00:02:04.570> is<00:02:04.780> how<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.080> put

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
for the right hand is how to put

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.350 
for the right hand is how to put
together<00:02:05.410> a<00:02:05.650> simple<00:02:06.370> diminished<00:02:06.880> 7<00:02:07.120> arpeggio

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
together a simple diminished 7 arpeggio

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.660 
together a simple diminished 7 arpeggio
so<00:02:08.260> we're<00:02:08.350> going<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.530> start<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.979> whole<00:02:09.399> step

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
so we're going to start a whole step

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.100 
so we're going to start a whole step
down<00:02:09.910> from<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.210> root<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.450> our<00:02:10.540> current<00:02:10.780> chord

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
down from the root of our current chord

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.920 
down from the root of our current chord
which<00:02:11.380> is<00:02:11.530> C<00:02:11.770> so<00:02:12.040> when<00:02:12.160> I<00:02:12.190> started<00:02:12.520> on<00:02:12.610> b-flat

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
which is C so when I started on b-flat

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.240 
which is C so when I started on b-flat
and<00:02:13.930> they<00:02:14.050> were<00:02:14.140> just<00:02:14.260> going<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.620> send<00:02:14.920> up<00:02:15.040> and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
and they were just going to send up and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.490 
and they were just going to send up and
minor<00:02:15.400> thirds<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.850> create<00:02:16.090> our<00:02:16.210> board<00:02:16.800> sharp<00:02:18.240> G

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
minor thirds to create our board sharp G

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.370 
minor thirds to create our board sharp G
okay<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:21.150> diminished<00:02:22.150> seventh<00:02:22.480> chord<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.900> a

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
okay so a diminished seventh chord is a

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.580 
okay so a diminished seventh chord is a
chord<00:02:23.740> built<00:02:24.190> all<00:02:24.520> in<00:02:24.970> minor<00:02:25.180> thirds<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:26.500> the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
chord built all in minor thirds so the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.050 
chord built all in minor thirds so the
pattern<00:02:26.860> goes<00:02:26.890> like<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.430> we're<00:02:27.880> going<00:02:28.000> to

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
pattern goes like this we're going to

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.520 
pattern goes like this we're going to
start<00:02:28.240> on<00:02:28.360> our<00:02:28.390> route<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.870> diminished

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
start on our route of the diminished

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.620 
start on our route of the diminished
seventh<00:02:29.800> chord<00:02:29.830> which<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.370> B<00:02:30.520> flat<00:02:30.730> we're

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
seventh chord which is B flat we're

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.970 
seventh chord which is B flat we're
going<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.810> skip<00:02:32.110> over<00:02:32.260> one<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.710> notes<00:02:32.860> of

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
going to skip over one of the notes of

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.190 
going to skip over one of the notes of
the<00:02:33.040> court<00:02:33.420> then<00:02:34.420> go<00:02:34.570> down<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.960> next

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
the court then go down to the next

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.160 
the court then go down to the next
closest<00:02:35.560> note<00:02:35.970> skip<00:02:36.970> down

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.470 

Oh

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:54.100 

so<00:02:45.050> here<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.319> again<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.730> then<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.750> the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
so here it is again and then this the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.630 
so here it is again and then this the
descending<00:02:54.560> portion<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.099> pattern<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.580> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
descending portion of the pattern is the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.399 
descending portion of the pattern is the
same<00:02:55.790> thing<00:02:56.000> but<00:02:56.299> opposite<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.230> first

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
same thing but opposite so the first

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:58.660 
same thing but opposite so the first
thing<00:02:57.440> we're<00:02:57.650> going<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:57.799> do<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.040> step<00:02:58.310> down<00:02:58.489> to

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
thing we're going to do is step down to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:10.800 
thing we're going to do is step down to
our<00:02:58.760> next<00:02:58.970> closest<00:02:59.360> note<00:02:59.510> which<00:02:59.840> is<00:02:59.989> e<00:03:00.819> skip

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:21.120 

here<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.900> is<00:03:11.959> all<00:03:12.170> together

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.100 

now<00:03:22.090> let's<00:03:22.270> take<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.480> look<00:03:22.540> at<00:03:22.750> some<00:03:22.870> rhythmic

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
now let's take a look at some rhythmic

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.960 
now let's take a look at some rhythmic
variations<00:03:23.800> that<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.250> can<00:03:24.370> start<00:03:24.580> adding<00:03:24.760> in

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
variations that you can start adding in

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.550 
variations that you can start adding in
once<00:03:25.240> you've<00:03:25.390> mastered<00:03:25.570> this<00:03:25.960> and<00:03:26.200> its

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
once you've mastered this and its

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.790 
once you've mastered this and its
original<00:03:26.800> context<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:28.710> adding<00:03:29.710> these

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
original context so adding these

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.470 
original context so adding these
rhythmic<00:03:30.280> variations<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.820> your<00:03:30.970> practice<00:03:31.360> is

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
rhythmic variations to your practice is

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.240 
rhythmic variations to your practice is
going<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.780> do<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:31.870> couple<00:03:32.200> of<00:03:32.260> things<00:03:32.290> first<00:03:33.100> of

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
going to do a couple of things first of

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.440 
going to do a couple of things first of
all<00:03:33.370> it's<00:03:33.490> going<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.730> help<00:03:33.820> you<00:03:33.970> improvise

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
all it's going to help you improvise

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.140 
all it's going to help you improvise
more<00:03:35.200> rhythmically<00:03:35.590> complex<00:03:35.860> and<00:03:36.490> more

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
more rhythmically complex and more

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.790 
more rhythmically complex and more
rhythmically<00:03:37.570> interesting<00:03:38.110> patterns<00:03:38.530> and

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
rhythmically interesting patterns and

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.260 
rhythmically interesting patterns and
second<00:03:39.370> of<00:03:39.430> all<00:03:39.550> it's<00:03:39.700> going<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.850> really<00:03:40.060> help

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
second of all it's going to really help

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.300 
second of all it's going to really help
you<00:03:40.420> lock<00:03:40.600> in<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.900> time<00:03:41.110> especially<00:03:42.040> if

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
you lock in the time especially if

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.190 
you lock in the time especially if
you're<00:03:42.400> practicing<00:03:42.760> with<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:42.910> metronome<00:03:43.240> so

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
you're practicing with the metronome so

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.260 
you're practicing with the metronome so
let's<00:03:45.190> look<00:03:45.280> at<00:03:45.400> this<00:03:45.490> pattern<00:03:45.850> how<00:03:46.000> we<00:03:46.060> can

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
let's look at this pattern how we can

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.700 
let's look at this pattern how we can
rhythmically<00:03:46.660> displace<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:47.170> in<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.440> couple

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
rhythmically displace it in a couple

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.590 
rhythmically displace it in a couple
ways<00:03:47.830> using<00:03:48.070> triplets<00:03:48.580> so<00:03:49.180> our<00:03:49.270> original

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
ways using triplets so our original

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.950 
ways using triplets so our original
pattern<00:03:49.900> just<00:03:50.080> started<00:03:50.350> on<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.530> downbeat<00:03:54.960> so

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
pattern just started on the downbeat so

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.930 
pattern just started on the downbeat so
on<00:03:56.140> so<00:03:56.740> we're<00:03:56.890> going<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.070> do<00:03:57.220> is<00:03:57.370> anticipate

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
on so we're going to do is anticipate

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.450 
on so we're going to do is anticipate
the<00:03:58.060> pattern<00:03:58.390> by<00:03:58.540> one<00:03:58.870> triplet<00:03:59.170> so<00:04:00.040> it's<00:04:00.340> going

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
the pattern by one triplet so it's going

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.730 
the pattern by one triplet so it's going
to<00:04:00.520> sound<00:04:00.640> something<00:04:00.880> like<00:04:01.030> this<00:04:01.300> one<00:04:02.260> triplet

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
to sound something like this one triplet

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:14.430 
to sound something like this one triplet
2<00:04:03.400> triplet<00:04:03.430> 3<00:04:04.210> triplet<00:04:04.600> 4<00:04:05.290> trip<00:04:13.410> so<00:04:14.410> I

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
2 triplet 3 triplet 4 trip so I

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.990 
2 triplet 3 triplet 4 trip so I
anticipate<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.070> pattern<00:04:15.340> just<00:04:15.520> by<00:04:15.670> one

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
anticipate the pattern just by one

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.699 
anticipate the pattern just by one
eighth<00:04:16.180> note<00:04:16.390> triplet<00:04:16.780> this<00:04:17.380> time<00:04:17.590> let's

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
eighth note triplet this time let's

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.140 
eighth note triplet this time let's
anticipated<00:04:18.520> by<00:04:18.670> to<00:04:18.730> a<00:04:18.970> thought<00:04:19.299> triplets

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
anticipated by to a thought triplets

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:31.640 
anticipated by to a thought triplets
triple<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.450> triple<00:04:23.230> it

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.870 

so<00:04:32.650> notice<00:04:32.949> we're<00:04:33.070> going<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.250> start<00:04:33.490> in<00:04:33.759> the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
so notice we're going to start in the

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.370 
so notice we're going to start in the
pattern<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.419> completely<00:04:34.900> different<00:04:35.199> places

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
pattern and completely different places

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.830 
pattern and completely different places
than<00:04:35.800> in<00:04:36.039> the<00:04:36.580> original<00:04:36.910> rhythmic

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
than in the original rhythmic

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.469 
than in the original rhythmic
organization<00:04:38.500> of<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.650> pattern<00:04:39.210> we<00:04:40.210> can<00:04:40.360> also

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
organization of the pattern we can also

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.180 
organization of the pattern we can also
do<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.780> same<00:04:40.990> thing<00:04:41.229> with<00:04:41.530> sixteenth<00:04:41.949> notes

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
do the same thing with sixteenth notes

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.180 
do the same thing with sixteenth notes
so<00:04:42.940> I<00:04:43.539> briefly<00:04:44.139> altered<00:04:44.650> it<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:44.889> we're<00:04:45.100> going

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
so I briefly altered it so we're going

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.350 
so I briefly altered it so we're going
to<00:04:45.280> go<00:04:45.340> up<00:04:45.490> a<00:04:45.550> little<00:04:45.639> higher<00:04:45.789> and<00:04:46.300> a<00:04:46.330> little

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
to go up a little higher and a little

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.840 
to go up a little higher and a little
lower<00:04:46.750> than<00:04:47.530> in<00:04:47.979> our<00:04:48.100> original<00:04:48.460> pattern<00:04:48.729> with

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
lower than in our original pattern with

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.279 
lower than in our original pattern with
triplets<00:04:49.030> just<00:04:49.479> so<00:04:49.600> we<00:04:49.780> get<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:49.990> same<00:04:50.139> amount

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
triplets just so we get the same amount

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.020 
triplets just so we get the same amount
of<00:04:50.470> notes<00:04:50.620> in<00:04:50.800> each<00:04:50.919> each<00:04:51.250> measure<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:51.910> this

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
of notes in each each measure and this

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.330 
of notes in each each measure and this
will<00:04:52.180> all<00:04:52.270> be<00:04:52.419> outline<00:04:52.720> in<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:52.930> PDF<00:04:53.199> file<00:04:53.470> one

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
will all be outline in the PDF file one

for e and here's what I would sound like
anticipated<00:05:23.340> by<00:05:23.520> two<00:05:24.060> sixteenth<00:05:24.509> notes<00:05:24.690> for<00:05:25.620> E

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.020 

I<00:05:47.920> think<00:05:48.920> by<00:05:49.010> practicing<00:05:49.550> these<00:05:49.670> rhythmic

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
I think by practicing these rhythmic

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.400 
I think by practicing these rhythmic
variations<00:05:50.570> you're<00:05:51.020> really<00:05:51.140> going<00:05:51.350> to

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
variations you're really going to

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.290 
variations you're really going to
strengthen<00:05:51.770> your<00:05:51.890> time<00:05:52.130> and<00:05:52.460> also<00:05:52.940> start<00:05:53.270> to

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
strengthen your time and also start to

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.850 
strengthen your time and also start to
inject<00:05:53.720> some<00:05:53.780> more<00:05:54.020> rhythmic<00:05:54.350> variations

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
inject some more rhythmic variations

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.220 
inject some more rhythmic variations
into<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:55.400> lines<00:05:55.610> that<00:05:55.730> you're<00:05:55.880> improvising

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
into the lines that you're improvising

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.720 
into the lines that you're improvising
create<00:05:57.230> some<00:05:57.410> more<00:05:57.530> interesting<00:05:57.980> modern
