00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
down and analyze it that way we're still

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.439 
down and analyze it that way we're still
kind<00:00:38.159> of<00:00:38.250> showing<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.610> text<00:00:38.970> but<00:00:39.120> we're<00:00:39.239> showing

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
kind of showing a text but we're showing

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.030 
kind of showing a text but we're showing
a<00:00:39.629> little<00:00:39.780> bit<00:00:39.870> more<00:00:40.019> failed<00:00:40.409> attacks<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
a little bit more failed attacks and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.220 
a little bit more failed attacks and
then<00:00:41.460> also<00:00:41.730> analyzing<00:00:42.540> war<00:00:42.750> from<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.019> defensive

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
then also analyzing war from a defensive

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.799 
then also analyzing war from a defensive
perspective<00:00:44.220> as<00:00:44.400> opposed<00:00:45.239> from<00:00:45.390> an<00:00:45.540> offensive

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
perspective as opposed from an offensive

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.569 
perspective as opposed from an offensive
perspective<00:00:46.559> which<00:00:46.710> i<00:00:46.890> think<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.250> kind<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.519> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
perspective which i think is kind of a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.460 
perspective which i think is kind of a
good<00:00:47.730> new<00:00:47.879> take<00:00:48.149> or<00:00:48.360> fresh<00:00:48.570> take<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:48.930> clan<00:00:49.230> wars

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
good new take or fresh take on clan wars

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.369 
good new take or fresh take on clan wars
so<00:00:50.040> this<00:00:50.370> base<00:00:50.790> right<00:00:51.059> here<00:00:51.119> it<00:00:51.540> makes<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.140> lot

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
so this base right here it makes a lot

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.829 
so this base right here it makes a lot
of<00:00:52.439> good<00:00:52.860> use<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.729> negative<00:00:54.180> space<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
of good use of the negative space and

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.359 
of good use of the negative space and
we'll<00:00:55.470> go<00:00:55.559> ahead<00:00:55.650> and<00:00:55.739> show<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.129> screenshot

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:56.369 
we'll go ahead and show you a screenshot

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:59.240 
we'll go ahead and show you a screenshot
of<00:00:56.790> it<00:00:57.059> at<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> end<00:00:57.540> of<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:57.930> video<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.949> right

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
of it at the end of this video but right

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.210 
of it at the end of this video but right
now<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.699> really<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.390> how<00:01:00.659> the<00:01:00.830> Expos<00:01:01.830> are<00:01:01.860> sort

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
now I really like how the Expos are sort

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.369 
now I really like how the Expos are sort
of<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.430> little<00:01:02.670> bit<00:01:02.760> more<00:01:02.879> spaced<00:01:03.239> out<00:01:03.479> and<00:01:03.720> as

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
of a little bit more spaced out and as

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.020 
of a little bit more spaced out and as
we<00:01:04.769> show<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.009> that<00:01:05.100> screenshot<00:01:05.489> will<00:01:05.850> show

we show you that screenshot will show

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.240 
we show you that screenshot will show
you<00:01:06.090> how<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.360> Tesla<00:01:07.320> placement<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.890> also

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
you how the Tesla placement is also

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.609 
you how the Tesla placement is also
really<00:01:08.880> really<00:01:09.270> important<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> fact

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
really really important I like the fact

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.190 
really really important I like the fact
that<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.860> sort<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.509> Tesla<00:01:12.509> Great<00:01:12.869> Wall

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
that it's sort of like Tesla Great Wall

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.920 
that it's sort of like Tesla Great Wall
in<00:01:13.439> terms<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.979> their<00:01:14.580> all<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:14.759> Tesla's<00:01:15.720> just

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
in terms of their all for Tesla's just

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.990 
in terms of their all for Tesla's just
protecting<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> town<00:01:16.770> hall<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.579> really

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
protecting the town hall and it's really

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.179 
protecting the town hall and it's really
hard<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> take<00:01:18.420> those<00:01:18.600> down<00:01:18.900> especially<00:01:19.229> with

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
hard to take those down especially with

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.640 
hard to take those down especially with
like<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.400> go<00:01:20.670> white<00:01:20.850> composition<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:21.750> well<00:01:22.470> as

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
like a go white composition as well as

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.710 
like a go white composition as well as
like<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.100> lava<00:01:23.340> l'union<00:01:23.790> type<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.120> composition

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
like a lava l'union type of composition

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.630 
like a lava l'union type of composition
mainly<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.830> balloons<00:01:26.250> will<00:01:26.460> focus

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
mainly because the balloons will focus

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.240 
mainly because the balloons will focus
on<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.940> Tesla's<00:01:27.510> and<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.530> Tesla's<00:01:28.920> will<00:01:29.070> also

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
on the Tesla's and the Tesla's will also

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.010 
on the Tesla's and the Tesla's will also
try<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.490> distract<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.030> pekka's<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.750> overall

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
try to distract the pekka's but overall

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.130 
try to distract the pekka's but overall
fairly<00:01:31.470> decent<00:01:31.860> raid<00:01:32.040> did<00:01:32.550> defend<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.480> 16<00:01:33.900> guy

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
fairly decent raid did defend the 16 guy

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.230 
fairly decent raid did defend the 16 guy
against<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.890> number<00:01:35.130> 20<00:01:35.460> guy<00:01:35.580> on<00:01:35.790> our<00:01:35.970> side

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
against the number 20 guy on our side

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.780 
against the number 20 guy on our side
barely<00:01:37.050> making<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:37.979> forty<00:01:38.640> nine

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
barely making it out with forty nine

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.730 
base that you might have seen before on
the<00:01:47.430> channel<00:01:47.940> that<00:01:48.150> I<00:01:48.180> reviewed<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.530> did

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
the channel that I reviewed and it did

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.680 
the channel that I reviewed and it did
survive<00:01:50.100> against<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> max<00:01:50.820> out<00:01:51.030> go<00:01:51.270> wipe<00:01:51.479> and

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
survive against the max out go wipe and

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.450 
survive against the max out go wipe and
then<00:01:52.110> surviving<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.010> a<00:01:53.070> pretty<00:01:53.250> high<00:01:53.430> level

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
then surviving it's a pretty high level

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.760 
then surviving it's a pretty high level
go<00:01:53.880> up<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.240> well<00:01:54.450> here<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.049> would<00:01:55.350> say<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:55.620> more

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
go up as well here I would say it's more

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.310 
go up as well here I would say it's more
of<00:01:56.010> a<00:01:56.130> mid-level<00:01:56.760> go<00:01:57.060> wipe<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.420> terms<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
of a mid-level go wipe in terms of the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.800 
of a mid-level go wipe in terms of the
hero<00:01:58.710> levels<00:01:59.220> but<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.210> pretty<00:02:00.420> much<00:02:00.570> maxed

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
hero levels but it's pretty much maxed

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.140 
hero levels but it's pretty much maxed
out<00:02:01.080> in<00:02:01.170> terms<00:02:01.260> of<00:02:01.409> his<00:02:01.560> troops<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.130> spells<00:02:03.000> I

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
out in terms of his troops and spells I

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.120 
out in terms of his troops and spells I
think<00:02:03.360> hasn't<00:02:03.869> fully<00:02:04.110> maxed<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.890> yet

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
think hasn't fully maxed that out yet

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.880 
think hasn't fully maxed that out yet
but<00:02:05.310> still<00:02:05.970> in<00:02:06.240> terms<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.960> deployment<00:02:07.530> but

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
but still in terms of the deployment but

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.350 
but still in terms of the deployment but
the<00:02:08.009> interesting<00:02:08.039> thing<00:02:08.519> about<00:02:08.670> these<00:02:09.030> type

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
the interesting thing about these type

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.660 
the interesting thing about these type
of<00:02:09.390> Defense's<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.379> terms<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.159> the<00:02:11.340> layout

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
of Defense's in terms of the layout

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.149 
of Defense's in terms of the layout
itself<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.840> town<00:02:13.019> halls<00:02:13.230> fairly<00:02:13.709> exposed

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
itself is the town halls fairly exposed

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.860 
itself is the town halls fairly exposed
and<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.879> does<00:02:15.090> sort<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.420> tease<00:02:15.659> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
and that does sort of tease the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.929 
and that does sort of tease the
attackers<00:02:16.379> in<00:02:16.500> order<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.890> attack<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.670> town

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
attackers in order to attack that town

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.970 
attackers in order to attack that town
hall<00:02:18.150> but<00:02:18.629> if<00:02:18.750> they<00:02:18.840> do<00:02:18.900> go<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:19.470> town<00:02:19.769> hall

Town<00:02:22.170> Hall<00:02:22.200> rather<00:02:22.620> they<00:02:23.220> really<00:02:23.879> waste<00:02:24.239> a<00:02:24.450> lot

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
Town Hall rather they really waste a lot

percent<00:02:26.730> for<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.569> second<00:02:28.020> star<00:02:28.290> now<00:02:28.709> I've

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
percent for that second star now I've

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.400 
percent for that second star now I've
actually<00:02:29.040> seen<00:02:29.760> another

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
actually seen another

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.800 
actually seen another
attacker<00:02:30.680> try<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.070> go<00:02:31.280> or<00:02:31.520> sort<00:02:32.210> of<00:02:32.300> avoid<00:02:32.660> the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
attacker try to go or sort of avoid the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.570 
attacker try to go or sort of avoid the
town<00:02:33.050> hall<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.290> go<00:02:33.530> from<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.830> top<00:02:33.860> right<00:02:34.370> side

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
town hall and go from the top right side

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.730 
town hall and go from the top right side
and<00:02:34.850> he<00:02:35.360> kind<00:02:35.570> of<00:02:35.630> failed<00:02:35.870> all<00:02:36.050> together<00:02:36.230> so

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
and he kind of failed all together so

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.800 
and he kind of failed all together so
this<00:02:37.280> basically<00:02:37.550> out<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.910> actually<00:02:38.060> proven<00:02:38.720> to

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
this basically out is actually proven to

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.680 
this basically out is actually proven to
be<00:02:38.930> pretty<00:02:39.260> good<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:39.830> terms<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.610> being<00:02:41.210> able<00:02:41.390> to

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
be pretty good in terms of being able to

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.330 
be pretty good in terms of being able to
withstand<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:42.350> lot<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:42.620> types<00:02:42.890> of<00:02:43.100> different

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
withstand a lot of types of different

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.330 
withstand a lot of types of different
attacks<00:02:43.820> in<00:02:44.060> clan<00:02:44.900> wars<00:02:45.140> but<00:02:45.380> again<00:02:46.040> with<00:02:46.220> any

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
attacks in clan wars but again with any

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.980 
attacks in clan wars but again with any
type<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.580> basically<00:02:47.000> out<00:02:47.210> people<00:02:47.510> will<00:02:47.720> try<00:02:47.930> to

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
type of basically out people will try to

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.040 
type of basically out people will try to
attack<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.740> try<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:49.610> find<00:02:49.940> out<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.390> sort

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
attack it and try to find out the sort

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.200 
attack it and try to find out the sort
of<00:02:51.200> weaknesses<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.460> and<00:02:52.550> they'll<00:02:52.940> learn<00:02:53.150> a

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
of weaknesses to it and they'll learn a

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.970 
of weaknesses to it and they'll learn a
little<00:02:53.570> depth<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.290> I'm<00:02:54.410> pretty<00:02:54.560> sure<00:02:54.680> this

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
little depth so I'm pretty sure this

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.800 
little depth so I'm pretty sure this
base<00:02:55.220> won't<00:02:55.490> stay<00:02:55.730> undefeated<00:02:56.060> for<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.600> long

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
base won't stay undefeated for a long

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.990 
base won't stay undefeated for a long
but<00:02:57.320> i<00:02:57.350> will<00:02:57.710> say<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:57.920> has<00:02:58.250> been<00:02:58.460> fun<00:02:58.700> kind<00:02:58.940> of

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
but i will say that has been fun kind of

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.820 
but i will say that has been fun kind of
seeing<00:02:59.210> people<00:02:59.540> try<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.140> attack<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.740> or

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
seeing people try to attack it or

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.010 
seeing people try to attack it or
attempt<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.370> attack<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:01.970> kind<00:03:02.630> of<00:03:02.660> go<00:03:02.840> down

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
attempt to attack it and kind of go down

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.040 
attempt to attack it and kind of go down
in<00:03:03.290> flames<00:03:03.640> but<00:03:04.640> all<00:03:04.760> right<00:03:04.880> guys<00:03:05.090> here<00:03:05.480> is<00:03:05.660> the

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
base layout sort of plays on the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.910 
base layout sort of plays on the
negative<00:03:23.180> space<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.810> sometimes<00:03:24.440> even<00:03:24.740> acts

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
negative space and sometimes even acts

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.460 
negative space and sometimes even acts
as<00:03:25.130> a<00:03:25.160> funnel<00:03:25.670> because<00:03:26.300> of<00:03:26.600> like<00:03:26.810> those<00:03:26.990> archer

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
as a funnel because of like those archer

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.990 
as a funnel because of like those archer
towers<00:03:27.830> on<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.070> left<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.460> the<00:03:28.520> right<00:03:28.580> and

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
towers on the left and the right and

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.200 
towers on the left and the right and
also<00:03:29.780> just<00:03:29.990> sort<00:03:30.410> of<00:03:30.500> a<00:03:30.560> lot<00:03:31.400> of<00:03:31.520> troops<00:03:31.970> try<00:03:32.150> to

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
also just sort of a lot of troops try to

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.390 
also just sort of a lot of troops try to
funnel<00:03:32.450> through<00:03:32.720> there<00:03:32.900> as<00:03:33.080> well<00:03:33.320> but<00:03:33.920> overall

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
funnel through there as well but overall

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.190 
funnel through there as well but overall
that's<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.880> town<00:03:35.090> hall<00:03:35.270> 9<00:03:35.300> base<00:03:35.720> let's<00:03:36.020> go

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
that's the town hall 9 base let's go

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.050 
that's the town hall 9 base let's go
ahead<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.530> well<00:03:37.070> actually<00:03:37.250> one<00:03:37.700> more<00:03:37.730> thing

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
ahead and well actually one more thing

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.060 
ahead and well actually one more thing
with<00:03:38.240> this<00:03:38.360> base<00:03:38.660> i<00:03:38.900> like<00:03:39.320> how<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.500> heroes<00:03:39.890> are

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
with this base i like how the heroes are

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.620 
with this base i like how the heroes are
really<00:03:40.310> close<00:03:40.520> to<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.850> town<00:03:41.030> hall<00:03:41.240> as<00:03:41.420> well

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
really close to the town hall as well

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.390 
really close to the town hall as well
again<00:03:42.140> if<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.320> try<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:42.620> go<00:03:42.860> wipe<00:03:43.070> and<00:03:43.280> get

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
again if you try to go wipe and get

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.850 
again if you try to go wipe and get
those<00:03:43.660> heroes<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:44.959> pekka's<00:03:45.320> on<00:03:45.470> the

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
those heroes and the pekka's on the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.920 
those heroes and the pekka's on the
attacker<00:03:46.310> side<00:03:46.610> into<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.030> base<00:03:47.240> then<00:03:47.810> the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
attacker side into the base then the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.330 
attacker side into the base then the
heroes<00:03:48.230> will<00:03:48.440> sort<00:03:48.680> of<00:03:48.770> spring<00:03:49.040> into<00:03:49.310> action

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
heroes will sort of spring into action

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.790 
heroes will sort of spring into action
and<00:03:49.880> sort<00:03:50.690> of<00:03:50.750> save<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.080> base<00:03:51.260> layout<00:03:51.500> that

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
and sort of save the base layout that

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.620 
and sort of save the base layout that
way<00:03:52.040> as<00:03:52.250> well<00:03:52.280> alright<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.240> then<00:03:53.330> for<00:03:53.540> the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
way as well alright and then for the

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.570 
way as well alright and then for the
Town<00:03:53.870> Hall<00:03:53.900> 10<00:03:54.410> base<00:03:54.620> layout<00:03:54.890> here<00:03:55.190> it<00:03:55.310> is<00:03:55.400> on

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
Town Hall 10 base layout here it is on

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.650 
Town Hall 10 base layout here it is on
your<00:03:55.730> screen<00:03:55.820> I<00:03:56.000> think<00:03:56.209> you<00:03:56.270> guys<00:03:56.420> are

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
your screen I think you guys are

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.660 
your screen I think you guys are
familiar<00:03:56.900> with<00:03:57.200> it<00:03:57.500> but<00:03:57.680> again<00:03:58.310> i'll<00:03:58.520> go<00:03:58.640> ahead

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
familiar with it but again i'll go ahead

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.930 
familiar with it but again i'll go ahead
and<00:03:58.820> put<00:03:59.000> a<00:03:59.030> link<00:03:59.239> down<00:03:59.330> below<00:03:59.510> to<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:01.160> maxed

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
and put a link down below to the maxed

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.940 
and put a link down below to the maxed
out<00:04:02.120> go<00:04:02.420> wipe<00:04:02.630> or<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.870> maxed<00:04:03.230> out<00:04:03.320> heroes<00:04:03.709> and

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
out go wipe or the maxed out heroes and

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.430 
out go wipe or the maxed out heroes and
that<00:04:03.980> sort<00:04:04.880> of<00:04:04.940> fail<00:04:05.270> on<00:04:05.540> this<00:04:05.750> face<00:04:05.989> again<00:04:06.260> i

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
that sort of fail on this face again i

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.780 
that sort of fail on this face again i
think<00:04:06.770> this<00:04:06.830> is<00:04:06.920> actually<00:04:07.100> a<00:04:07.340> pretty<00:04:07.550> solid

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
think this is actually a pretty solid

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.400 
think this is actually a pretty solid
basically<00:04:08.270> out<00:04:08.390> i<00:04:08.420> haven't<00:04:08.750> seen<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:08.989> lose<00:04:09.170> yet

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
basically out i haven't seen it lose yet

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.560 
basically out i haven't seen it lose yet
but<00:04:09.920> again<00:04:10.310> we'll<00:04:10.700> just<00:04:11.090> have<00:04:11.270> to<00:04:11.390> wait<00:04:11.510> and

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
but again we'll just have to wait and

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.479 
but again we'll just have to wait and
