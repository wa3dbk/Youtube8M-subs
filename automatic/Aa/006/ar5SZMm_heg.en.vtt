00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:05.589 
you garlic bread is a fun thing to make

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:07.530 
you garlic bread is a fun thing to make
and<00:00:05.830> it's<00:00:06.310> very<00:00:06.759> different<00:00:07.089> from<00:00:07.330> what<00:00:07.509> you

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
and it's very different from what you

and it's very different from what you
would<00:00:07.810> have<00:00:07.990> in<00:00:08.440> a<00:00:08.590> restaurant<00:00:08.980> so<00:00:09.340> we<00:00:10.330> want<00:00:10.570> to

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660 
would have in a restaurant so we want to

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.270 
would have in a restaurant so we want to
start<00:00:10.990> with<00:00:11.519> some<00:00:12.519> yeast<00:00:13.769> so<00:00:14.769> this<00:00:14.919> is<00:00:15.070> just

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
start with some yeast so this is just

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.680 
start with some yeast so this is just
dried<00:00:15.580> yeast<00:00:15.879> that<00:00:16.090> you<00:00:16.150> buy<00:00:16.420> in<00:00:16.480> the<00:00:16.660> grocery

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
dried yeast that you buy in the grocery

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.110 
dried yeast that you buy in the grocery
store<00:00:17.380> and<00:00:17.680> I<00:00:18.130> needed<00:00:18.430> a<00:00:18.490> quarter<00:00:18.910> of<00:00:19.030> a

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.120 
store and I needed a quarter of a

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.690 
store and I needed a quarter of a
teaspoon<00:00:19.330> of<00:00:19.690> that<00:00:19.840> I<00:00:20.200> like<00:00:20.680> less<00:00:21.070> yeast<00:00:21.460> when

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
teaspoon of that I like less yeast when

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.210 
teaspoon of that I like less yeast when
I<00:00:21.760> make<00:00:22.030> bread<00:00:22.330> because<00:00:22.690> I<00:00:22.930> get<00:00:23.410> a<00:00:23.440> slower<00:00:23.830> rise

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
I make bread because I get a slower rise

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.850 
I make bread because I get a slower rise
and<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:25.450> bread<00:00:25.690> has<00:00:25.870> a<00:00:25.900> better<00:00:26.170> taste<00:00:26.470> to<00:00:26.830> it

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
and the bread has a better taste to it

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.740 
and the bread has a better taste to it
so<00:00:27.160> I<00:00:27.610> dissolved<00:00:28.300> it<00:00:28.510> in<00:00:28.540> a<00:00:29.200> cup<00:00:29.500> of<00:00:29.740> warm<00:00:30.310> water

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
so I dissolved it in a cup of warm water

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.389 
so I dissolved it in a cup of warm water
so<00:00:31.750> when<00:00:31.930> it<00:00:32.020> gets<00:00:32.110> Chucky's<00:00:32.739> like<00:00:32.949> that<00:00:33.190> I

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
so when it gets Chucky's like that I

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.560 
so when it gets Chucky's like that I
know<00:00:33.460> that<00:00:33.640> it's<00:00:33.910> ready<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:34.300> it's<00:00:34.390> going<00:00:34.510> to

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
know that it's ready and it's going to

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.020 
know that it's ready and it's going to
take<00:00:34.750> about<00:00:34.960> three<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:35.289> five<00:00:35.589> minutes<00:00:36.030> so

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
take about three to five minutes so

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.250 
take about three to five minutes so
we're<00:00:37.149> going<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.300> do<00:00:37.420> this<00:00:37.570> right<00:00:37.809> in<00:00:37.960> a<00:00:38.050> food

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
we're going to do this right in a food

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.950 
we're going to do this right in a food
processor<00:00:38.499> this<00:00:39.070> is<00:00:39.190> very<00:00:39.609> fast<00:00:40.030> so<00:00:40.780> we're

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
processor this is very fast so we're

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.919 
processor this is very fast so we're
going<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:41.140> put<00:00:41.410> in<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:43.059> yeast<00:00:43.359> and<00:00:43.660> water

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
going to put in the yeast and water

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.060 
going to put in the yeast and water
mixture<00:00:45.359> and<00:00:46.359> I'm<00:00:46.989> going<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.199> give<00:00:47.409> that<00:00:47.440> just

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
mixture and I'm going to give that just

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.130 
mixture and I'm going to give that just
a<00:00:48.370> little<00:00:48.609> olive<00:00:49.179> oil<00:00:49.390> that's<00:00:49.809> going<00:00:49.960> to<00:00:50.019> give

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
a little olive oil that's going to give

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.799 
a little olive oil that's going to give
it<00:00:50.170> some<00:00:50.379> nice<00:00:50.589> flavor<00:00:51.569> and<00:00:53.579> then<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:55.600> need

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
it some nice flavor and then we need

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.529 
it some nice flavor and then we need
flour<00:00:56.109> of<00:00:56.409> course<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.850> when<00:00:57.969> you<00:00:58.059> make<00:00:58.179> bread

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
flour of course so when you make bread

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.540 
flour of course so when you make bread
or<00:00:58.809> when<00:00:59.319> you're<00:00:59.469> baking<00:00:59.829> anything<00:01:00.280> you<00:01:00.399> want

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
or when you're baking anything you want

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.149 
or when you're baking anything you want
to<00:01:00.609> be<00:01:00.670> really<00:01:00.999> careful<00:01:01.449> about<00:01:01.679> the<00:01:02.679> kind<00:01:02.920> of

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
to be really careful about the kind of

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:04.560 
to be really careful about the kind of
flour<00:01:03.399> that<00:01:03.640> you're<00:01:03.850> using<00:01:04.059> so<00:01:04.330> when<00:01:04.450> you're

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
flour that you're using so when you're

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.050 
flour that you're using so when you're
making<00:01:04.809> bread<00:01:05.020> you<00:01:05.200> want<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:06.010> flour<00:01:06.760> that<00:01:07.000> has

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
making bread you want a a flour that has

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.600 
making bread you want a a flour that has
a<00:01:07.180> high<00:01:07.570> protein<00:01:08.320> content<00:01:08.590> because<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.370> need

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
a high protein content because you need

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.810 
a high protein content because you need
the<00:01:09.790> gluten<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.720> be<00:01:10.870> able<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.170> knead<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.650> dough

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the gluten to be able to knead the dough

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.280 
the gluten to be able to knead the dough
but<00:01:12.820> what<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.120> don't<00:01:13.390> want<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:13.780> do<00:01:13.900> is<00:01:14.020> measure

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
but what you don't want to do is measure

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.260 
but what you don't want to do is measure
improperly<00:01:15.010> so<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:15.340> don't<00:01:15.520> want<00:01:15.640> to<00:01:15.700> dig<00:01:16.030> into

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
improperly so you don't want to dig into

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.480 
improperly so you don't want to dig into
your<00:01:16.540> flour<00:01:16.840> bag<00:01:17.260> and<00:01:17.590> bring<00:01:17.950> up<00:01:18.160> what<00:01:18.340> you

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
your flour bag and bring up what you

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.360 
your flour bag and bring up what you
think<00:01:18.850> is<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.120> cup<00:01:19.390> of<00:01:19.570> flour<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.740> better<00:01:21.070> thing

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
think is a cup of flour the better thing

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.710 
think is a cup of flour the better thing
to<00:01:21.400> do<00:01:21.790> is<00:01:22.150> sprinkle<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:24.060> sweep<00:01:25.090> if<00:01:25.300> you<00:01:25.450> don't

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
to do is sprinkle and sweep if you don't

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.740 
to do is sprinkle and sweep if you don't
wave<00:01:25.960> flour<00:01:26.320> this<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.010> next<00:01:27.280> best<00:01:27.460> thing

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
wave flour this is the next best thing

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.360 
wave flour this is the next best thing
so<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:28.810> put<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.200> flour<00:01:29.410> in<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.800> 1<00:01:30.070> cup<00:01:30.340> dry

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
so you put the flour in a 1 cup dry

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.350 
so you put the flour in a 1 cup dry
measure<00:01:31.300> and<00:01:31.630> then<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:32.800> sweep<00:01:33.220> that<00:01:34.210> will

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
measure and then you sweep that will

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.570 
measure and then you sweep that will
give<00:01:34.510> you<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.660> cup<00:01:35.080> of<00:01:35.230> flour<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:36.280> I'm<00:01:36.370> going<00:01:36.520> to

Dean you need the salt to control the
development<00:01:48.760> of<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.030> yeast<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.900> I<00:01:49.990> know<00:01:50.080> that

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
development of the yeast and I know that

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.380 
development of the yeast and I know that
one<00:01:50.590> cup<00:01:50.830> is<00:01:50.980> never<00:01:51.280> going<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.580> be<00:01:51.730> enough<00:01:52.060> so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
one cup is never going to be enough so

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.830 
one cup is never going to be enough so
I'm<00:01:52.630> going<00:01:52.900> to<00:01:52.990> put<00:01:53.610> 2<00:01:54.610> cups<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:55.120> flour<00:01:55.300> and

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
I'm going to put 2 cups of flour and

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.320 
I'm going to put 2 cups of flour and
then<00:01:56.770> I'm<00:01:56.890> going<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.130> process<00:01:57.670> this<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.120> see

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
then I'm going to process this to see

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.840 
then I'm going to process this to see
where<00:01:58.630> we<00:01:58.810> are<00:01:58.920> because<00:01:59.920> everything<00:02:00.460> is<00:02:00.640> in

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
where we are because everything is in

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.880 
where we are because everything is in
the<00:02:01.300> hands<00:02:01.660> and<00:02:01.990> in<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.170> field<00:02:02.440> if<00:02:02.620> you<00:02:02.710> make<00:02:02.860> a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
the hands and in the field if you make a

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.550 
the hands and in the field if you make a
lot<00:02:03.070> of<00:02:03.130> bread<00:02:03.400> well<00:02:03.580> then<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:03.790> know<00:02:03.940> exactly

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
lot of bread well then you know exactly

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.930 
lot of bread well then you know exactly
what<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.680> consistency<00:02:06.400> should<00:02:06.430> be<00:02:06.790> of<00:02:06.910> the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
what the consistency should be of the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.089 
what the consistency should be of the
dough<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.660> see<00:02:08.200> how<00:02:08.349> that's<00:02:08.499> starting<00:02:08.679> to

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
dough and you see how that's starting to

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.000 
dough and you see how that's starting to
turn<00:02:09.310> around<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.789> blade<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.499> know<00:02:11.499> it's<00:02:11.829> too

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
turn around the blade I know it's too

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.979 
turn around the blade I know it's too
soupy<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:12.819> I'm<00:02:12.999> going<00:02:13.269> to<00:02:13.299> add

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
soupy so I'm going to add

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.990 
soupy so I'm going to add
more<00:02:14.530> flour<00:02:14.920> but<00:02:15.159> you<00:02:15.280> really<00:02:15.700> want<00:02:15.879> to

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
more flour but you really want to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.750 
more flour but you really want to
control<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:17.409> amount<00:02:17.739> of<00:02:17.890> flour<00:02:18.189> you<00:02:18.310> put<00:02:18.670> in

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
control the amount of flour you put in

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.849 
control the amount of flour you put in
this<00:02:18.909> because<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.599> more<00:02:19.810> flour<00:02:20.109> you<00:02:20.439> put<00:02:20.680> in

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
this because the more flour you put in

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.759 
this because the more flour you put in
the<00:02:21.489> heavier<00:02:21.909> will<00:02:22.480> be<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:23.049> bread<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:23.560> let<00:02:23.680> me

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
the heavier will be the bread so let me

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.940 
the heavier will be the bread so let me
put<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:23.950> in<00:02:24.599> put<00:02:25.599> the<00:02:25.750> cover<00:02:25.959> back<00:02:26.079> on<00:02:26.500> and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.280 

let<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.069> go<00:02:32.849> when<00:02:33.849> it<00:02:34.000> starts<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.540> go<00:02:34.840> around

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
let it go when it starts to go around

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.119 
let it go when it starts to go around
that<00:02:35.500> blade<00:02:36.069> in<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.400> ball<00:02:37.859> then<00:02:38.859> you<00:02:38.889> know

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
that blade in a ball then you know

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:46.229 
that blade in a ball then you know
what's<00:02:39.340> wicked<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:45.370> now<00:02:45.579> we<00:02:45.639> can<00:02:45.970> take<00:02:46.180> that

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
what's wicked so now we can take that

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.960 
what's wicked so now we can take that
out<00:02:47.189> and<00:02:48.189> we're<00:02:48.340> going<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.519> need<00:02:48.669> that<00:02:48.939> a

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
out and we're going to need that a

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.429 
out and we're going to need that a
little<00:02:49.299> bit<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:51.689> I<00:02:52.689> take<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:52.989> out<00:02:53.290> onto<00:02:53.530> a

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
little bit so I take it out onto a

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.069 
little bit so I take it out onto a
floured<00:02:56.439> surface<00:02:57.329> let's<00:02:58.329> give<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:58.719> a<00:02:58.780> little

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
floured surface let's give this a little

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.970 
floured surface let's give this a little
flour<00:02:59.819> put<00:03:00.819> that<00:03:01.030> aside<00:03:01.590> again<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:02.769> want<00:03:02.919> to

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
flour put that aside again you want to

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.289 
flour put that aside again you want to
make<00:03:03.040> sure<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.430> control<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.969> amount<00:03:04.209> of

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
make sure you control the amount of

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.610 
make sure you control the amount of
flour<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.840> you're<00:03:05.049> using<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:07.109> I<00:03:08.109> can<00:03:08.349> tell

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
flour that you're using and I can tell

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.569 
flour that you're using and I can tell
just<00:03:08.650> by<00:03:09.040> feeling<00:03:09.790> that<00:03:10.000> now<00:03:10.269> that<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:11.139> has

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
just by feeling that now that that has

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.319 
just by feeling that now that that has
plenty<00:03:12.579> of<00:03:12.939> flour<00:03:13.389> so<00:03:13.719> you<00:03:14.439> want<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.829> knead<00:03:15.040> it

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
plenty of flour so you want to knead it

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:21.059 
plenty of flour so you want to knead it
just<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.450> get<00:03:16.569> it<00:03:16.719> into<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:17.019> nice<00:03:17.349> ball<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:20.560> I'm

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
just to get it into a nice ball and I'm

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.879 
just to get it into a nice ball and I'm
going<00:03:21.400> in<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.579> clockwise<00:03:21.790> fashion<00:03:22.650> just<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.739> get

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
going in a clockwise fashion just to get

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.559 
going in a clockwise fashion just to get
this<00:03:24.069> nice<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.699> smooth

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
this nice and smooth

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.469 
this nice and smooth
this<00:03:26.379> is<00:03:26.560> dispersing<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.340> yeast<00:03:27.579> cells<00:03:28.030> this

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:28.479 
this is dispersing the yeast cells this

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.589 
this is dispersing the yeast cells this
is<00:03:28.540> why<00:03:28.840> I'm<00:03:29.079> kneading<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.949> dough<00:03:30.299> so<00:03:31.299> once

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
is why I'm kneading the dough so once

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.809 
is why I'm kneading the dough so once
you<00:03:31.780> do<00:03:32.019> this<00:03:32.229> and<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.590> more<00:03:33.129> you<00:03:33.310> knead<00:03:33.639> it

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
you do this and the more you knead it

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.210 
you do this and the more you knead it
the<00:03:34.000> better<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.720> bread<00:03:35.019> will<00:03:35.290> be<00:03:35.319> so<00:03:35.919> you<00:03:35.979> need

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
the better the bread will be so you need

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.339 
the better the bread will be so you need
to<00:03:36.310> do<00:03:36.459> this<00:03:36.609> for<00:03:36.790> about<00:03:37.030> five<00:03:37.389> or<00:03:37.419> ten<00:03:37.959> minutes

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
to do this for about five or ten minutes

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:45.330 
to do this for about five or ten minutes
and<00:03:38.699> then<00:03:39.699> get<00:03:40.180> it<00:03:40.329> into<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:41.220> rough<00:03:42.220> round<00:03:44.340> and

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
and then get it into a rough round and

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.580 
and then get it into a rough round and
you<00:03:46.030> want<00:03:46.239> to<00:03:46.299> put<00:03:46.509> it<00:03:46.599> into<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:48.180> bowl<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.590> now

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
you want to put it into a bowl and now

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.280 
you want to put it into a bowl and now
we<00:03:50.650> have<00:03:50.949> to<00:03:51.069> let<00:03:51.250> this<00:03:51.459> rise<00:03:51.819> or<00:03:52.689> actually<00:03:53.049> to

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
we have to let this rise or actually to

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.699 
we have to let this rise or actually to
risings<00:03:53.889> on<00:03:54.099> this<00:03:54.370> so<00:03:55.299> you<00:03:55.389> take<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:56.109> wipe<00:03:56.500> the

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
risings on this so you take and wipe the

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.740 
risings on this so you take and wipe the
bowl<00:03:57.930> with<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:58.959> with<00:03:59.439> the<00:03:59.650> dough<00:03:59.889> and<00:04:00.750> you

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
bowl with the with the dough and you

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.149 
bowl with the with the dough and you
cover<00:04:02.049> this<00:04:02.349> do<00:04:03.069> not<00:04:03.400> put<00:04:03.729> it<00:04:03.819> in<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.030> oven<00:04:05.159> put

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
cover this do not put it in the oven put

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.939 
cover this do not put it in the oven put
it<00:04:06.340> somewhere<00:04:06.970> where<00:04:07.180> it's<00:04:07.509> warm<00:04:07.810> but<00:04:08.259> not<00:04:08.319> not

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
it somewhere where it's warm but not not

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.789 
it somewhere where it's warm but not not
in<00:04:09.129> a<00:04:09.220> preheated<00:04:09.459> oven<00:04:09.819> about<00:04:10.379> 7075<00:04:11.379> degrees

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
in a preheated oven about 7075 degrees

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.879 
in a preheated oven about 7075 degrees
is<00:04:11.979> good<00:04:12.419> because<00:04:13.419> the<00:04:13.689> slow<00:04:13.959> rise<00:04:14.229> is<00:04:14.530> always

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
is good because the slow rise is always

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.300 
is good because the slow rise is always
better<00:04:15.159> for<00:04:15.790> bread<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.919> this<00:04:17.919> is<00:04:18.070> going<00:04:18.250> to

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
better for bread and this is going to

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.149 
better for bread and this is going to
take<00:04:18.519> Oh<00:04:19.199> Sammy<00:04:20.199> an<00:04:20.349> hour<00:04:20.530> an<00:04:20.799> hour<00:04:20.919> and<00:04:21.099> a<00:04:21.220> half

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
take Oh Sammy an hour an hour and a half

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.290 
take Oh Sammy an hour an hour and a half
you<00:04:24.159> want<00:04:24.279> to<00:04:24.400> let<00:04:24.520> it<00:04:24.550> rise<00:04:24.789> until<00:04:25.150> it's

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
you want to let it rise until it's

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.750 
you want to let it rise until it's
double<00:04:25.840> in<00:04:26.020> size<00:04:26.919> so<00:04:27.219> we're<00:04:27.370> going<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.520> set

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
double in size so we're going to set

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.060 
double in size so we're going to set
that<00:04:27.910> aside<00:04:29.160> because<00:04:30.160> before<00:04:30.670> you<00:04:30.790> came<00:04:30.970> over

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
that aside because before you came over

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.520 
that aside because before you came over
we've<00:04:33.070> been<00:04:33.190> making<00:04:33.340> dough<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:34.810> here<00:04:35.140> is<00:04:35.320> a

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
we've been making dough so here is a

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.620 
we've been making dough so here is a
risen<00:04:36.070> one<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:37.840> can<00:04:38.050> see<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.860> difference

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
risen one and you can see the difference

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.600 
risen one and you can see the difference
between<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:41.050> one<00:04:41.200> that<00:04:41.380> I<00:04:41.410> just<00:04:41.920> put<00:04:42.400> in<00:04:42.520> the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
between the one that I just put in the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.860 
between the one that I just put in the
bowl<00:04:42.790> and<00:04:43.080> this<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:46.030> now<00:04:46.210> we<00:04:46.270> do<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.570> punch

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
bowl and this so now we do the punch

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.650 
bowl and this so now we do the punch
down<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.320> knife<00:04:47.530> down<00:04:48.690> let<00:04:49.690> me<00:04:49.780> take<00:04:50.080> this<00:04:50.380> out

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
down the knife down let me take this out

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.480 
down the knife down let me take this out
again<00:04:52.660> and<00:04:53.730> if<00:04:54.730> you<00:04:54.850> have<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.090> bench<00:04:55.390> knife

again and if you have a bench knife
that's<00:04:57.490> always<00:04:57.880> good<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:58.510> use<00:04:58.540> helps<00:04:59.530> you<00:04:59.620> move

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
that's always good to use helps you move

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.090 
that's always good to use helps you move
