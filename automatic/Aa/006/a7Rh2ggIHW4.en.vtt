00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
sub spindle notice how some features

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.300 
sub spindle notice how some features
have<00:03:49.840> been<00:03:50.019> copied<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.590> sub<00:03:50.799> spindle<00:03:51.160> and

have been copied to the sub spindle and

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.430 
have been copied to the sub spindle and
some<00:03:51.820> features<00:03:52.030> move<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.690> sub<00:03:52.900> spindle<00:03:53.290> in

some features move to the sub spindle in

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.160 
some features move to the sub spindle in
this<00:03:54.370> example<00:03:54.730> Edgecam<00:03:55.690> gives<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.049> the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
this example Edgecam gives you the

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.960 
this example Edgecam gives you the
option<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.620> machine<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.160> boss<00:03:57.340> of<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.670> model

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
option to machine the boss of the model

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.050 
option to machine the boss of the model
on<00:03:58.090> both<00:03:58.569> spindles<00:03:59.109> and<00:03:59.290> in<00:03:59.920> this<00:04:00.069> case<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.640> went

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
on both spindles and in this case I went

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.759 
on both spindles and in this case I went
to<00:04:01.180> machine<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.660> boss<00:04:01.840> on<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.140> sub<00:04:02.380> spindle

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
to machine the boss on the sub spindle

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.890 
to machine the boss on the sub spindle
so<00:04:03.519> I<00:04:03.549> will<00:04:03.760> suppress<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.329> features<00:04:04.660> that<00:04:04.690> I

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
so I will suppress the features that I

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.970 
so I will suppress the features that I
will<00:04:05.109> not<00:04:05.230> be<00:04:05.260> using<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:08.170> now<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:08.410> strategies

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
will not be using and now the strategies

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.300 
will not be using and now the strategies
are<00:04:09.130> applied<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:11.290> strategy<00:04:11.769> will<00:04:11.920> select<00:04:12.220> the
