00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.210
 So people are welcome back 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.670
 this episode 6 to the elite 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.780
 Let's start the eighth round of the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.519
 championship 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.490
 I have three matches to show to 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.980
 You guys, I 'm losing points now in 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.279
 international level but is more 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.930
 complicated goal to score and the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.590
 guys are attacking more and are more 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.019
 smart now at this level but it 's good 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.560
 this happens, it's good I was 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.090
 That's what I wanted to achieve. 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.690
 now you have to grate to get the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.149
 points 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.820
 but then he started the first match of 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.920
 today for you how much Chesterfield is 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 You see here they started attacking 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.160
 and then I lost that goal 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.649
 volley 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.550
 could have done basic is just a butt 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.039
 of mothers 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.980
 I pressed I think it was ltte that does 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.809
 this move has more effect to do 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.050
 Beautiful, I want to show you, and I'm done. 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.129
 not making 00 the first 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.379
 first time to replace the attackers 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.540
 it was difficult to attack with them that I saw 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.400
 who were tired so I put the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.060
 jackson jax you know the attacker 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.010
 cadu and then I want to show you how 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.360
 is the defensive system at the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.580
 International 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.970
 You see they play with 4 4 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.140
 2 also and this midfield line 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.820
 of them is also very well placed then 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.810
 when they mark ismael behind the line 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.549
 the ball is not 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.979
 and it is much more difficult to create a 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.170
 played the attempts I make through 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.759
 behind the zaga they are the only ones 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.659
 things that are giving for now 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.490
 result 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.549
 It's not for taking the focus away from them. 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.950
 get through them but in this 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.470
 0 - 0 was the score after the first half. 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.079
 It's a very quiet game but that's okay. 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.950
 was a blip the next match against 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.990
 boot 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.630
 and then I got the news that the player 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.979
 I came back from injury the round I can 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.500
 put in jackson jackson's place 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.060
 back to the reservation reserve and they 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.460
 you see the arrows on the side of the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.979
 number of players and if this 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.330
 means that it is evolving and 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.190
 Me, it's cool because the guys are 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.370
 the players with small numbers, right? 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.010
 they do not have much lack very well no 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.970
 runs a lot and were going to a good 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.450
 signal sign I'm playing well and who 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.700
 You know how I can create a star in the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.900
 team such as the 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.110
 bergson striker 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.390
 a rj at the beginning of the first half 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.420
 on the basis of race steal the ball in the corner 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.650
 But I went behind you wrong, right? 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.900
 in the sequence of the move and kicked but the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.580
 goalkeeper also defended the Guarani 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.100
 first match he did not play very well 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.920
 here and I can not depend very much on 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.810
 It's a tough game for a player to stay. 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.090
 play ball for him he expects it to hit 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.110
 good but in this case worked 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.120
 he left the goal that he made an old boot 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.209
 large scale is part of the goal kick in the 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.280
 However he could not even score this handsome 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.490
 goal and in the usual celebration, right? 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.470
 he has five goals already in the league and there 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.280
 I was confident he was from 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.830
 far 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.800
 Only this ball was taller than me. 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.360
 and found that Mazda meantime 1-0 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.760
 out of home 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.640
 I was calm, I needed to win. 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.260
 this game to match ties in another and neither 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.290
 international cinema is so expensive if 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.750
 You lose a point at home loses 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.010
 from draw the faces distancing 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.750
 and it gets complicated 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.420
 then that horrible kick I 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.000
 I sent it to the side I took a goal that 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.940
 Dear dikulo came in the middle of my rear 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.489
 did what he passed into the 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.019
 area and just kicked for the goal 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.690
 then it is so international level is 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.610
 so if you 're the guy get there 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.280
 chance you have to score very large and 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.510
 When they press is I think theatrical 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.280
 in kick of three kick 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.340
 so I try that sometimes even a little bit of 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.440
 luck and after that goal there the game 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.410
 was truncated and only chance was a 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.360
 miss and one more draw are two 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.519
 games two draws do not lose four 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.320
 points in those two games and fell to 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.660
 third place in the table 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.220
 So I went up to the sheffield I think. 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.820
 that chelsea had not already been another 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.150
 game 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.729
 This is the cheltenham that the mall I 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.080
 I needed to win playing at home already fell 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.920
 Third, it is certain that there is no 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.530
 bad position 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.150
 for those who want to climb up 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.270
 must necessarily be champion but 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.530
 talent and a third was 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.720
 quiet 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.000
 and then I would be starting to show for 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.320
 you 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.480
 aaaah again the defense at the level 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.590
 international as the game is locked 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.060
 in the middle of the field 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.610
 I can not get into the big area. 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.050
 them and they did not come into my 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.330
 large area at the time my defense also 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.580
 is well posted and there is this battle in the 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.880
 half -time field or full-time 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.820
 time 0 to 0 and it is this ball dispute 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.540
 and no one strikes and nobody gets what it is 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.280
 anything 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.710
 the only chance of a standing ball but 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.790
 can you see that the ball is still 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.970
 not my forte 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.800
 ah I put full pressure I thought 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.880
 so look I'll press the button 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.790
 faces forward 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.850
 of two is or is it a goal, right? 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.090
 I make a goal and leave with the victory there 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.380
 I replace the some players with 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.290
 this as the team was very slow 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.300
 are very tired this routine of two 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.320
 sometimes three matches a week tires 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:32.230
 much in the smaller divisions in fifa 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.840
 which is what is very real is very extensive 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.360
 there jackson trying the attack made the 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.530
 play and more obvious is jack you know 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.070
 that he will miss does not even need to speak 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.200
 nothing and when you have many games you stay 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.190
 complicated in this routine but beauty 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.980
 taÃ­ zero to zero face three games three 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.530
 draws and I played nine points and I 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.440
 I got three if I left 6 point 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.060
 and this starts to worry i can not 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.160
 lose points like this is right or not 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.560
 I have not lost any game in the championship 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.570
 Grandson undefeated but I'm still today. 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.360
 far from the first place sang 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.740
 four points behind these four points 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.550
 after I've won six, right? 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:15.490
 or at least three plus three rings and 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.380
 jaja recover some of the beauties and the 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.690
 in the fight of the artillery so great 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.550
 with five goals 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.080
 ok let's go the next episode let's go 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.010
 see if I can recover these points in 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.430
 beauty 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.430
 thanks
