$15 crazy right well as a few things I'm
obviously<00:00:13.710> making<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.280> budget<00:00:14.490> device<00:00:14.910> but

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
obviously making a budget device but

obviously making a budget device but
surprisingly<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.470> build<00:00:16.680> quality<00:00:16.890> isn't<00:00:17.369> one

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
surprisingly the build quality isn't one

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.810 
surprisingly the build quality isn't one
of<00:00:17.760> them<00:00:17.940> why<00:00:18.330> don't<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:18.539> take<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.720> closer<00:00:18.960> look

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.640 

the<00:00:23.820> texture<00:00:24.180> beagle<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> 5<00:00:25.050> inch<00:00:25.260> e-reader

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
the texture beagle is a 5 inch e-reader

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.769 
the texture beagle is a 5 inch e-reader
that<00:00:25.830> measures<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> 140<00:00:26.880> millimeters<00:00:27.269> long<00:00:27.510> by

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
that measures a 140 millimeters long by

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.910 
that measures a 140 millimeters long by
105<00:00:28.529> wide<00:00:28.920> by<00:00:29.519> 4<00:00:30.000> point<00:00:30.300> 8<00:00:30.539> millimeters<00:00:31.320> thick

105 wide by 4 point 8 millimeters thick

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.130 
105 wide by 4 point 8 millimeters thick
it<00:00:32.520> has<00:00:32.700> two<00:00:33.149> triple<00:00:33.450> A<00:00:33.480> batteries<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
it has two triple A batteries on the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.190 
it has two triple A batteries on the
bottom<00:00:34.559> which<00:00:35.219> makes<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.149> 14<00:00:36.660> millimeters

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
bottom which makes this 14 millimeters

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.630 
bottom which makes this 14 millimeters
but<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> fact<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.160> doesn't<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.489> a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
but the fact that it doesn't have a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.950 
but the fact that it doesn't have a
rechargeable<00:00:39.000> battery<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
rechargeable battery is one of the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.229 
rechargeable battery is one of the
reasons<00:00:40.230> why<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.440> price<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.190> low<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.820> is

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
reasons why the price is so low and is

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.639 
reasons why the price is so low and is
also<00:00:42.420> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.989> having<00:00:43.320> extra

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
also going to see you having extra

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.340 
also going to see you having extra
charging<00:00:44.040> cables<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.940> know<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.050> guess

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
charging cables so you know I guess

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.290 
charging cables so you know I guess
that's<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.920> little<00:00:47.430> extra<00:00:47.760> stuff<00:00:48.090> that

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
that's just a little extra stuff that

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.810 
that's just a little extra stuff that
you<00:00:48.390> have<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.860> have<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> carry<00:00:50.280> around<00:00:50.430> your

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
you have to have to carry around your

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.790 
you have to have to carry around your
store<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.719> these<00:00:51.899> Triple<00:00:52.199> A<00:00:52.289> batteries<00:00:52.440> are

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
store and these Triple A batteries are

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.680 
store and these Triple A batteries are
supposed<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> last<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.730> year<00:00:53.789> which<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
supposed to last you one year which is a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.250 
supposed to last you one year which is a
huge<00:00:55.110> amount<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.440> time<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.610> Beagle<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.300> very

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
huge amount of time the Beagle is very

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.779 
huge amount of time the Beagle is very
stripped<00:00:58.649> down<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.219> means<00:00:59.340> there's<00:00:59.550> no

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
stripped down so it means there's no

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.750 
stripped down so it means there's no
Wi-Fi<00:01:00.300> there's<00:01:00.660> no<00:01:00.870> 3G<00:01:01.500> no<00:01:02.190> rechargeable

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
Wi-Fi there's no 3G no rechargeable

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.789 
Wi-Fi there's no 3G no rechargeable
battery<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.930> these<00:01:04.080> options<00:01:04.500> would<00:01:04.650> have

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
battery but these options would have

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.429 
battery but these options would have
only<00:01:05.159> driven<00:01:05.339> up<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.610> price<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:07.320> it

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
only driven up the price and then it

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.630 
only driven up the price and then it
would<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.619> ruin<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.070> fact<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
would just ruin the fact that this is a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.330 
would just ruin the fact that this is a
$15<00:01:09.360> eReader<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.770> several<00:01:11.100> color

is evening eating it has a resolution of

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.560 
is evening eating it has a resolution of
800<00:01:31.680> by<00:01:31.740> 600<00:01:32.100> which<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> same<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
800 by 600 which is the same as the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.410 
800 by 600 which is the same as the
Kindle<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.890> grayscale<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> killed

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
Kindle but the grayscale and it killed

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.420 
Kindle but the grayscale and it killed
Kindle<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.439> twice<00:01:37.650> as<00:01:37.860> dark<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.250> what

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
Kindle is actually twice as dark as what

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.760 
Kindle is actually twice as dark as what
we<00:01:38.579> have<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.780> Kindle<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.259> 6<00:01:40.560> inches

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
we have here but the Kindle is 6 inches

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.940 
we have here but the Kindle is 6 inches
right<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.689> 5<00:01:43.170> actually

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
right and so that this is 5 actually

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.770 
right and so that this is 5 actually
gives<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.340> higher<00:01:44.520> pixel<00:01:44.790> density<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.659> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
gives it a higher pixel density so this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.649 
gives it a higher pixel density so this
is<00:01:45.960> 200<00:01:46.200> versus<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> Kindles<00:01:47.340> 167<00:01:48.149> which

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
is 200 versus the Kindles 167 which

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.660 
is 200 versus the Kindles 167 which
should<00:01:48.840> actually<00:01:49.049> give<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.500> star<00:01:49.890> per<00:01:50.070> text

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
should actually give you star per text

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.359 
should actually give you star per text
now<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:51.689> about<00:01:51.780> formats<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.979> beagle

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
now what about formats the beagle

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.990 
now what about formats the beagle
handles<00:01:53.850> ePub<00:01:54.329> files<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.020> PDFs<00:01:55.579> which<00:01:56.579> isn't

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000

highly<00:02:06.420> rendered<00:02:06.780> bitmaps<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.970> what<00:02:09.149> this

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
highly rendered bitmaps so what this

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.089 
highly rendered bitmaps so what this
means<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.110> essentially<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.709> bitmap

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
means is this is essentially a bitmap

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.030 
means is this is essentially a bitmap
viewer<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.390> results<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.110> cleaner<00:02:13.470> texts

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
viewer but this results in cleaner texts

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.180 
viewer but this results in cleaner texts
and<00:02:14.370> cover<00:02:15.180> images<00:02:15.690> but<00:02:16.230> also<00:02:16.410> much<00:02:16.980> larger

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
and cover images but also much larger

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.570

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
files so the navigation is basically you

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.949 
files so the navigation is basically you
just<00:02:20.640> have<00:02:20.849> your<00:02:21.030> books<00:02:21.239> here<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:21.840> you

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
just have your books here and then you

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.250 
just have your books here and then you
can<00:02:22.080> just<00:02:22.290> slide<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.709> over<00:02:23.780> though<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.930> text

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
can just slide on over though the text

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.830 
can just slide on over though the text
on<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.440> Beagle<00:02:25.799> you<00:02:26.310> know<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:27.030> clearing<00:02:27.720> you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
on the Beagle you know is clearing you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.160 
on the Beagle you know is clearing you
can't<00:02:28.080> actually<00:02:28.379> select<00:02:30.049> changing<00:02:31.049> the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
can't actually select changing the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.080 
can't actually select changing the
changing<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.890> font<00:02:32.099> size<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.549> here<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.910> have

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
changing the font size on here you have

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.449 
changing the font size on here you have
to<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.329> it<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.959> on<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.290> handset<00:02:34.829> so<00:02:35.340> that

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
to do it on the on the handset so that

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.680 
to do it on the on the handset so that
is<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.579> little<00:02:35.790> bit<00:02:35.910> annoying<00:02:36.120> but<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.540> guess

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
is a little bit annoying but I guess

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.199 
is a little bit annoying but I guess
once<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.019> have<00:02:37.319> your<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:38.459> your<00:02:38.640> font<00:02:38.970> sizes

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
once you have your like your font sizes

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.809 
once you have your like your font sizes
and<00:02:39.569> everything<00:02:39.709> selected<00:02:40.709> then<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.549> won't<00:02:41.670> be

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
and everything selected then it won't be

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.370 
and everything selected then it won't be
such<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> big<00:02:42.329> deal<00:02:42.510> just<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.930> make<00:02:43.079> sure<00:02:43.260> that

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
such a big deal just to make sure that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.199 
such a big deal just to make sure that
everything<00:02:43.860> set<00:02:44.069> up<00:02:44.099> here<00:02:44.370> before<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.819> import

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
everything set up here before you import

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.880 
everything set up here before you import
it<00:02:45.299> over<00:02:45.629> so<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.230> shouldn't<00:02:46.500> have<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.739> bother

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
it over so you shouldn't have to bother

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.259 
it over so you shouldn't have to bother
with<00:02:47.099> it<00:02:47.250> again<00:02:47.400> once<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.730> figure<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.060> out<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
with it again once you figure it out the

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.960 
with it again once you figure it out the
first<00:02:48.450> time<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:49.650> Beagle<00:02:50.010> has<00:02:50.160> four<00:02:50.489> gigabytes

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
first time the Beagle has four gigabytes

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.670 
first time the Beagle has four gigabytes

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329

five<00:02:54.660> books<00:02:54.959> but<00:02:55.650> digital<00:02:56.010> reader<00:02:56.250> actually

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
five books but digital reader actually

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.250 
five books but digital reader actually
got<00:02:56.849> a<00:02:56.879> whole<00:02:57.090> bunch<00:02:57.329> more<00:02:57.420> on<00:02:57.720> them<00:02:57.930> about

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
got a whole bunch more on them about

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.910 
got a whole bunch more on them about
half<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.620> dozen<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> dozen<00:02:59.489> so<00:03:00.470> it's<00:03:01.470> kind<00:03:01.890> of

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
half a dozen to a dozen so it's kind of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.830 
half a dozen to a dozen so it's kind of
up<00:03:02.040> in<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.220> air<00:03:02.340> about<00:03:02.760> how<00:03:02.879> many<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.450> can<00:03:03.569> take

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
up in the air about how many it can take

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.629 
up in the air about how many it can take
but<00:03:04.049> before<00:03:04.410> we<00:03:04.530> hear<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.769> final<00:03:05.280> verdict

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
maybe three at once max anyway so if I'm

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.110 
maybe three at once max anyway so if I'm
going<00:03:52.950> on<00:03:53.040> vacation<00:03:53.099> that's<00:03:53.700> more<00:03:53.940> than

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
book so not too big of a deal but the

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.840 
book so not too big of a deal but the
one<00:04:15.720> thing<00:04:16.139> that<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.709> wouldn't<00:04:17.250> mind<00:04:17.489> paying<00:04:17.700> a

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
one thing that I wouldn't mind paying a

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.270 
one thing that I wouldn't mind paying a
little<00:04:17.880> bit<00:04:18.120> more<00:04:18.239> money<00:04:18.630> for<00:04:18.959> is<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:20.010> fact

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
little bit more money for is the fact

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.280 
little bit more money for is the fact
that<00:04:20.430> every<00:04:20.790> time<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.150> turn<00:04:21.180> pages<00:04:21.660> it

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
that every time you turn pages it

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.560 
that every time you turn pages it
actually<00:04:23.070> has<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.340> refresh<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.880> entire<00:04:23.910> page

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
actually has to refresh the entire page

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.430 
actually has to refresh the entire page
on<00:04:24.960> some<00:04:25.950> other<00:04:26.130> readers<00:04:26.610> like<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.419> Kobo<00:04:28.139> or

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
on some other readers like the Kobo or

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.390 
on some other readers like the Kobo or
the<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.919> Kindle<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:30.180> actually<00:04:30.810> saves<00:04:31.280> six<00:04:32.280> to

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
the the Kindle it actually saves six to

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.340 
the the Kindle it actually saves six to
nine<00:04:32.550> pages<00:04:33.090> so<00:04:33.600> that<00:04:33.750> when<00:04:33.900> you<00:04:33.990> change<00:04:34.200> the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
nine pages so that when you change the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.320 
nine pages so that when you change the
page<00:04:34.710> it's<00:04:35.040> just<00:04:35.340> directly<00:04:35.700> directly

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
page it's just directly directly

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.150 
page it's just directly directly
switching<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:36.930> so<00:04:37.110> it's<00:04:37.380> actually<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.710> lot<00:04:37.980> less

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
switching it so it's actually a lot less

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.310 
switching it so it's actually a lot less
buffering<00:04:38.490> I<00:04:38.910> found<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.840> really<00:04:39.990> annoying

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
buffering I found it really annoying

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.560 
buffering I found it really annoying
that<00:04:41.010> every<00:04:41.250> single<00:04:41.639> time<00:04:41.850> you<00:04:41.880> had<00:04:42.240> this<00:04:42.389> you

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
that every single time you had this you

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.530 
that every single time you had this you
know<00:04:42.690> big<00:04:43.110> kind<00:04:43.220> of<00:04:44.220> flicker<00:04:44.729> -<00:04:45.000> just<00:04:45.300> to

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
know big kind of flicker - just to

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.379 
know big kind of flicker - just to
switch<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:45.960> page<00:04:46.200> so<00:04:46.500> that<00:04:46.820> is<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:48.000> one<00:04:48.180> thing

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
switch the page so that is the one thing

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.120 
switch the page so that is the one thing
that<00:04:48.600> does<00:04:48.930> make<00:04:49.110> this<00:04:49.320> device<00:04:49.590> feel<00:04:49.860> a<00:04:49.889> lot

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
that does make this device feel a lot

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.890 
that does make this device feel a lot
more<00:04:50.160> budget<00:04:50.790> versus<00:04:51.540> some<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.810> other

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
more budget versus some of the other

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.260 
more budget versus some of the other
ones<00:04:52.320> but<00:04:52.440> it<00:04:52.560> is<00:04:52.889> fifteen<00:04:53.520> dollars<00:04:53.550> so<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:54.240> is

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
ones but it is fifteen dollars so it is

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.230 
ones but it is fifteen dollars so it is
a<00:04:54.479> budget<00:04:54.900> device<00:04:55.229> so<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:55.860> guess<00:04:56.370> you<00:04:56.610> know<00:04:56.729> it's

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
a budget device so I guess you know it's

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.230 
a budget device so I guess you know it's
one<00:04:58.229> of<00:04:58.260> them<00:04:58.500> one<00:04:58.830> of<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.040> problems<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.669> this

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
one of them one of the problems of this

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.940 
one of them one of the problems of this
device<00:05:00.540> if<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:00.930> only<00:05:01.229> big<00:05:01.380> one<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:01.770> can
