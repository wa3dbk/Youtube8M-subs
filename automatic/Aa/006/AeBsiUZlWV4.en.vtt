00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.799
 hi girls today I you 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.510
 offers a first impressions video 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.650
 so the first impression videos this 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.170
 are videos that will be based on 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.090
 products that I test in the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.130
 day and so I will give you life 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.020
 in real time at the end of the day 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.360
 so today I opted for a 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.630
 public yes or no that's the American 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.100
 Shimane so I'll never tested 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.660
 I do not know what it's worth I even 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.190
 not tested the hue if it suits or 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.140
 not so there I really went to the 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.840
 rage and I took a little pique 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.270
 so I order them on the iman website 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.920
 cosmetics it was super fast the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.780
 delivery I received in two days she 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.800
 me side 22 euros so it's not very 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.239
 dear for the crimes 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800
 I expected a even a little 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.050
 expensive brand that is here 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.999
 Finally, I am rather than the vagaries BlÃ©mant 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.620
 surprise and I know for sure that 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:55.050
 this bi li ping is not very 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.479
 covering I do not expect to hide but 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.440
 fathers imperfections with this product 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:03.569
 especially a unified set amount here 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.739
 have a rather natural rendering being 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:06.570
 given that they make you scarce it takes 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.190
 still a product as a light soul 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.990
 I want something too poor in 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.310
 game of things that holds in the day 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.079
 it would be besides I cross the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.240
 fingers for this cream to work 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.189
 so I will try it then I have you 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.960
 said the album so I have everything to have 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.729
 put my time base so I took there 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.219
 me kaufman the ja lips 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.939
 then I have a little sprays monta 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:28.079
 with the honors of orb to fuck and 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.119
 then I will apply fountain 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.549
 with the foundation of forgiveness the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.770
 crime tribe with brush s 84 from 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.630
 sigma good I hand over his demonstrate the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.750
 thick enough range texture I know 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.640
 not if I have a lot or not so the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.990
 hue I feel like it's bump 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.990
 have a little bit to what I wear 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.870
 it seems a little short in what 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.720
 the weather seems to me to go it's not 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.140
 too much that's full of gray holes and to 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.140
 application 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.130
 since it predicted the swell issued the dose 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.620
 so here I am laying them is so these are 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:48.360
 pretty glowy guys is limited this is 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.580
 by this world matt texture cream yet 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.040
 a bit sticky 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.060
 I do not know if it's due to that much 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.700
 that they can induce a little bit 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.840
 hot but not if it has repercussions 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.810
 actually on the cause of music movies 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.459
 so the movies still enough sense 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.900
 still far enough so I do not know if 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.370
 with a few minutes after a few 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.360
 minutes is going to dry is for now 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.700
 all the pressure of competition is 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.260
 rather good I'm pretty surprised that 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.430
 cover to it's good it breaks a little 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.940
 little but it hides a little bit my 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.330
 tasks that on the cheeks I want 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.890
 go to surprise levante if not the 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.660
 color so Japan is a little more 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.950
 darker than a little darker like 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.220
 internations a few moments I think 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.930
 that to the powders years it's going to go 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.769
 I do not know if I took the advantage to you 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.260
 to say take the lead underneath yes that 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.570
 I think it's pretty common 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.160
 I like so by against I love 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.140
 a lot what that it sticks excess 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.209
 it's rockfoucauld I'm not used to 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.760
 to that I'm pretty used to 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.350
 benflis textures that dry up at the end 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.900
 for a moment you lose your royal and the 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.970
 mans they are a little bit tempted what 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.819
 so I think we have to wait for a 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.870
 little bit so I think so define my 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.280
 makeup and then we find ourselves all 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.109
 right now so here I ended up live 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.690
 so put no south to the fixed over a 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.040
 powder to fix a little bit I put 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.989
 a little bluff that I made myself 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.000
 I did my usual makeup on 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.680
 rendering is pretty I like sold it's 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.850
 enough covering his cage like you but 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.570
 imperfections without having put two 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.430
 bodies were today 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.139
 so I really like it so it's 14 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.340
 24 hours we find ourselves just now 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.340
 to see the effect of makeup 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:34.270
 so here I am so here he is 17 years old 44 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.550
 I will call retouching on the complexion 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.570
 I rarely do it 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.790
 but a little lipstick exchanges 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.250
 a little lipstick but never when 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.160
 I really like that I think it's 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.500
 pretty in spite of all that shines a little lousy 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.850
 came out in full sun so I do not 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.419
 do not know if it's more the other sister 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:56.380
 thing in this case I remain present at 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:59.050
 which one will say that I will stay fresh I 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.540
 joking but me cua saying it 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.570
 does a pretty thing you still have it 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.860
 still well kept his brood still there 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.570
 I left this doctor told me that 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.940
 I had a pretty dyed mammoth so I 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.510
 think it's not bad so we get 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.510
 find out later 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.979
 so here it is there it is 21 9 on my 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.110
 phone 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:23.409
 so my complexion still remains pretty 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.360
 unified accord with bwin his face the 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.039
 background you have not left there is when 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.939
 not bad of the two bright on the 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:32.499
 you on the nose on the forehead but despite 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:33.759
 any end despite everything I find that it is 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.529
 not bad given the weather but 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.569
 today they have from my home he has 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:39.069
 made famous almost 30 degrees so I 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.719
 find that it is still a vehicle 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:44.770
 even though a camp even of the chest there 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:46.090
 just as good end qualities I 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.099
 finds that it is and covers well 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.500
 good after I think it will need powder 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:54.250
 and in the day retouches are going 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.509
 to be necessary I think after that it's 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.860
 especially for those who have skin 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.500
 oily fat finally I do not have the 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.509
 program is a slightly mixed skin with 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.770
 some bright on the t zone then 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.719
 give you my verdict is what I 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.029
 guard or not I would say I'm going to 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:08.919
 keep because I was expecting 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:11.529
 something really very very 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.729
 lightweight without any outfit and in fact I 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.469
 do you realize that I have held that 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.689
 all day with without having worn 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:18.430
 of concealer without having corrected montas 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:20.680
 and I find that rendering is really 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.050
 very very pretty and I recommend it 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.990
 strongly because I find that 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.979
 it can really be an alternative to 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.479
 who does not have the foundation and 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:29.979
 kate those who want something from 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.150
 really discreet and not overly covering 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:32.530
 no time I think it's the same 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.180
 otherwise I wanted to apologize for the 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.750
 small noise you will hear 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.069
 in this video 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.650
 good bah I just invested in a 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:40.629
 new camera and ben I have not yet 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.400
 never directed the mastery yet 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:43.900
 so here for the next video I 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.340
 will know how to do but for that I 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.009
 think iraq and raw who for a little bit 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.270
 embarrassed but now bombed 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:50.919

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.300
 give on music yes do not hesitate 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:54.729
