00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
expect any cheap plastic here right in

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.580 
expect any cheap plastic here right in
this<00:01:47.880> shot<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.570> wanted<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.110> compare<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
this shot we wanted to compare the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.910 
this shot we wanted to compare the
device<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.670> know<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:50.939> an<00:01:51.060> Apple<00:01:51.390> TV<00:01:51.920> so

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
device to you know like an Apple TV so

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.410 
device to you know like an Apple TV so
we<00:01:52.950> didn't<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.670> hand<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.270> did

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
we didn't have that on hand but we did

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.959 
we didn't have that on hand but we did
have<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.570> gbx<00:01:55.020> g-box<00:01:55.860> midnight<00:01:55.890> android<00:01:56.729> box

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
have a gbx g-box midnight android box

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.459 
have a gbx g-box midnight android box
which<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.210> really<00:01:57.540> similar<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.960> size<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
which is really similar in size to the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.219 
which is really similar in size to the
apple<00:01:58.770> TV<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.420> even<00:02:00.420> even<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> roku<00:02:01.049> it's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
apple TV and even even the roku it's

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.480 
apple TV and even even the roku it's
probably<00:02:01.469> little<00:02:01.680> bit<00:02:01.770> bigger<00:02:01.920> than<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> Roku

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
probably little bit bigger than a Roku

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.389 
probably little bit bigger than a Roku
though<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:03.990> see<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.860> zotac

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
though so as you can see here the zotac

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.550 
though so as you can see here the zotac
is<00:02:05.729> almost<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.479> similar<00:02:06.689> size<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.409> little

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
is almost really similar size a little

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.619 
is almost really similar size a little
bit<00:02:07.770> higher<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.280> little<00:02:08.580> bit<00:02:08.789> taller<00:02:08.970> but

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
bit higher a little bit taller but

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.059 
bit higher a little bit taller but
simply<00:02:09.959> put<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.289> really<00:02:10.500> amazing<00:02:10.679> how<00:02:10.890> much

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
simply put it's really amazing how much

point that we haven't talked about the

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.870 
point that we haven't talked about the
operating<00:04:08.680> system<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.430> reason<00:04:09.700> for<00:04:09.730> that

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
operating system and the reason for that

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.990 
operating system and the reason for that
is<00:04:10.180> like<00:04:10.450> most<00:04:10.690> many<00:04:10.930> pcs<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.769> ad<00:04:12.220> 13<00:04:12.700> does<00:04:12.850> not

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
windows 7 USB thumb drive or like we did

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.600 
windows 7 USB thumb drive or like we did
we<00:04:42.669> plugged<00:04:42.970> in<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.330> USB<00:04:44.050> optical<00:04:44.199> drive<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:45.010> we

we plugged in a USB optical drive and we

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.740 
we plugged in a USB optical drive and we
like<00:04:45.760> that<00:04:45.880> method<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.270> little<00:04:46.479> bit<00:04:46.570> more

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
like that method a little bit more

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.330 
like that method a little bit more
because<00:04:47.110> you<00:04:47.410> can<00:04:47.620> then<00:04:47.919> use<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.310> included

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
because you can then use the included

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.280 
because you can then use the included
driver<00:04:48.910> disk<00:04:49.210> after<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.750> installation<00:04:49.990> is

for<00:04:54.040> us<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.430> installation<00:04:54.910> went<00:04:55.030> smooth<00:04:55.330> it's

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
for us the installation went smooth it's

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.600 
for us the installation went smooth it's
pretty<00:04:56.080> fast<00:04:56.260> especially<00:04:56.620> with<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.160> 64
