 Welcome to Maxis Cooking School chapter 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.170
 52 starting at the beginning of the season 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.630
 september plum pie with cinnamon cream 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.660
 we have a lot of ingredients for 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.720
 our plums pie with cream in the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.850
 the upper part we have the things here 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.320
 we need for the floor and in the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.939
 In the lower part we have the things we do 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.650
 for the covering I need to catch the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.619
 row after row for the floor we need 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.810
 two eggs 125 grams of sugar 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.140
 we need 100 milliliters 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.440
 sunflower oil 100 milliliters of apple juice 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.300
 100 grams of grated chocolate you can 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.370
 You decide how big you want to be 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.020
 would like to have chocolate chips and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.629
 150 grams of flour for the covering 750 grams 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.079
 So a three quarters kilo of fresh flowers 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.699
 then we need sugar again 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.789
 we are 4 tablespoons for the topping 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.789
 need a packet there must be around the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.090
 juice later 500 milliliters 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.729
 cream two packets of vanilla sugar and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.560
 of course I cinnamon earlier now 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.780
 once I seduce the floor under it 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.799
 the ingredients gradually to one 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.720
 smooth dough let's go so the dough 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.299
 I meanwhile become a smooth mass 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.729
 stir and fill these into one 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:32.070
 springform one of the cake is then 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.740
 in the oven 25 to 30 minutes at 170 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.970
 Grad baked the oven needs 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:43.640
 of course, be preheated that is clear 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.049
 while the cake dough then in the oven 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.390
 comes the next step 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.030
 The plums I have to have 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.090
 started to be fed with the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.009
 Of course, stones have to be removed 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.649
 and then if all 750 grams plum 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.570
 in the bowl are in there then 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.030
 come two tablespoons of sugar over it 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.950
 scattered and we put the whole thing then 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.180
 to the side and read 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:14.090
 for half an hour so go through 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.760
 that's he finished baked pies bottom 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.160
 I once put it over my head 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.489
 So we put the chocolate piece up here 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.120
 have that with something better that way before we do 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.519
 then make the covering on it 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.090
 I park around it 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:37.730
 so that the lining does not run for us 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.170
 here in the pot are the plums the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.989
 quarter which we sprinkled with sugar 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.799
 had these beautiful in the meantime 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.079
 pulled through and are still going 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.760
 Once cooked, it will give you some juice 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.970
 together we need afterwards 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.440
 250 milliliters of liquid with it 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.209
 the juice is not quite ripe at the 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.440
 you can make it boil up 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.450
 some extend with water so 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.549
 are the boiled down fluff you see 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.470
 The juice has formed a bit 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.799
 now through a sieve around the juice 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.799
 catch 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:19.540
 then the flames defend the here 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:22.970
 then drained on the 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.389
 Prepared cake soil beautiful 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.250
 distribute evenly and the juice there 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:31.790
 I have to measure now I need 250 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.739
 Milliliter I will follow the instructions 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.430
 like you on the back of the 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.900
 Pastry pack is a little thickening 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.209
 I need another one for that 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.670
 two tablespoons sugar before you 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.730
 kept and distribute 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.650
 then the covered juice of the 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.859
 I prepared with the cake pouring 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.359
 then comes over the fluff on the floor 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.480
 only the sleep to 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:59.889
 but I'll do everything now 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.709
 finished and then it goes on 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:06.109
 this is the one poem fluff juice 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.690
 you can see what has become viscous 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:12.410
 We now distribute it fairly quickly 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.150
 it's going to be stuck over the plums and now 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.550
 you also see what we springform for 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.530
 have fastened again 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.750
 Otherwise we would be the whole 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.580
 run away from liquid 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.310
 Incidentally, the flames do not quite work 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.200
 made to the edge as we otherwise 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:32.230
 afterwards when cutting the finished 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:36.520
 cake had some difficulties so 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.740
 We'll leave that now and when that's done 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.720
 is only beaten the cream 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.830
 together that's 500 milliliters 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.870
 together with 2pac vanillazucker and the 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.880
 cinnamon in there then the cake is ready 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.280
 I like that again at the same time 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.150
 delicious end product looks and then 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.150
 wishes good appetite
