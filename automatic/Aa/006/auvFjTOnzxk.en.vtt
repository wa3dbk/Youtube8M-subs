00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.200
 Welcome to a new channel 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.270
 update and like last week 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.620
 I said yes that I this 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.559
 week as the channel will make update 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.660
 and inform you if the lok 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.849
 and co kg will happen this 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.560
 weekend on the oasis bochum i have 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.119
 both good and bad 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.840
 message for this weekend the good 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.279
 message is 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.500
 I will definitely be a wheelock 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.070
 make the most extensive fails 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.019
 will we see then I will the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.340
 but not with the tournament report 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.439
 forgive but I would have both times 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.930
 I will pull apart the tournament 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.070
 reporting times separate from the blog have 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.630
 I packed together last time 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.879
 but I have the video a bit too 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.059
 long and that of the effort then 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.350
 rather, the same video together 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.399
 That's why I thought so myself 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.500
 I'd rather divorce that and feel that way 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.120
 think about that for the next week 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.199
 We then stop Monday the regular 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.430
 I'll have that opening now 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.989
 upload or prepare tuesday 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.989
 would like to have the tournament opening 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.930
 there we will have the packs we have on the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.339
 ces bochum have opened there again 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.020
 show what you had pulled out of the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.270
 I have tournament packs on thursday 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.760
 then planned the tournament report itself 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.030
 for the usc to upload it too high and 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.369
 Friday if it works as the lures so 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.229
 Let's see if everything will work out that way 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.330
 as i would like i think that should 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.210
 fold because the first may is yes too 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.320
 a holiday so a little more time 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.780
 there is no friday and sometimes 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.400
 I have a letter from here now 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.680
 get the mail maybe it's mine 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.570
 new cell phone there and I will now 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.890
 Pick it up today, so to speak 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.409
 that we may over half a day so 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.240
 tomorrow so today maybe I would 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.909
 have new mobile that is finally is 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.970
 this does not free my htc from his 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.240
 His pain is everything 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.770
 beautiful roses in streaks when picks up 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.820
 I actually use the new phone though 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.470
 I would do the thing for the block 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.280
 use and then we can actually 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.740
 times really nice full hd clear knorke 60 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.149
 fps and kuka every once for this 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.250
 Let's do something 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.180
 I'm looking forward to it even if I am 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.290
 actually a cell phone to the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.830
 has come 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.800
 yes, then just bad news this 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.320
 week was just tough 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.050
 work was not synonymous 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.370
 still have the preparation for the ubs 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.710
 Unfortunately, I found no time now 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.480
 I want to turn news again 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.970
 Do not promise you next week 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.110
 that I'll take her because of me 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.610
 I do not know if I want to promise 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.140
 can hold because it's just a time 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.320
 It is very stressful and I will 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.760
 then when I get ready to do it 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.020
 the situation feels like the video is making 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.360
 because it is very expensive 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.870
 that just takes all friday 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.390
 evening plus always makes that claim 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.830
 what and who puts a lot of work 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.080
 behind it and I have to look that time 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.380
 I finally finish my week 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.020
 a bit breezy from the moment therefore 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.120
 This weekend, it will not be a video 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.700
 Give Monday is the next video that 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.840
 Mondays opening but if you tell us 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.910
 or me yes we are yes 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.860
 not too much at the race unfortunately 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.700
 do not want / with the virus 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.170
 We will be with her on the dm 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.850
 play on the white book and if 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.730
 You also have interest 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.950
 Follow me on my facebook page 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.420
 look at it as it is now 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.310
 because I will come in after each game 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.330
 post something and also a 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.530
 do a bit of a lok I hope so 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.470
 will not have that much timeout that 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.070
 I then somehow all the time just 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.110
 from game to game over lecce yes exactly 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.209
 So if you are interested in that too 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.070
 follow facebook and maybe also 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.970

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.430
 still packing a description 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.080

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.290

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.090

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.290
 which games of course I do not want 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.400
 I do not want to betray so much 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.120
 might have seen that if it happened 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.880

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.370
