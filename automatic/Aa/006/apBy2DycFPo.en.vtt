00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
weird reason during the swatches it just

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.930 
weird reason during the swatches it just
looked<00:03:13.600> it<00:03:14.500> looked<00:03:14.709> bad<00:03:14.890> on<00:03:15.130> me<00:03:15.310> not<00:03:15.730> just

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
looked it looked bad on me not just

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.819 
looked it looked bad on me not just
because<00:03:16.060> my<00:03:16.390> lips<00:03:16.600> are<00:03:16.780> chapped<00:03:17.049> but<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.620> just

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
because my lips are chapped but it just

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.280 
because my lips are chapped but it just
I<00:03:18.040> don't<00:03:18.220> know<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.760> then<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.480> other<00:03:19.660> one<00:03:19.959> is

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
I don't know and then the other one is

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.759 
I don't know and then the other one is
going<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.890> be<00:03:21.220> amethyst<00:03:21.970> ablaze<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:22.780> really

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769

love<00:03:24.100> amethyst<00:03:24.730> ablaze<00:03:25.090> but<00:03:25.329> I<00:03:25.390> think<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.989> it

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
love amethyst ablaze but I think that it

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.319 
love amethyst ablaze but I think that it
would<00:03:26.470> actually<00:03:26.739> suit<00:03:27.250> my<00:03:27.430> mom<00:03:27.640> better<00:03:28.090> than

would actually suit my mom better than

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.449 
would actually suit my mom better than
it<00:03:28.450> suits<00:03:28.750> me<00:03:29.049> because<00:03:29.230> she<00:03:29.590> has<00:03:29.769> a<00:03:30.010> darker

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
it suits me because she has a darker

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.550 
it suits me because she has a darker
complexion<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:31.269> she<00:03:31.480> wears<00:03:31.630> Purple's<00:03:32.290> better

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
complexion and she wears Purple's better

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.830 
complexion and she wears Purple's better
