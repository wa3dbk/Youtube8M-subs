00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.010 

driving<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.300> night<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.660> like<00:02:24.750> we're<00:02:24.900> going

references<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:28.980> sort<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.250> drive

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
references and you just sort of drive

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.870 
references and you just sort of drive
blind<00:02:29.820> at<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.060> point

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.270 

shift<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.720> on<00:02:35.870> leash<00:02:36.110> as<00:02:36.380> an<00:02:36.590> incredible<00:02:37.130> new

biggest part of that I think is the head
movement<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.710> look<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.070> apex<00:02:46.370> which

movement and the look to the apex which

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.060 
movement and the look to the apex which

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
if you look at helmet cam video you'll

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:58.300 
if you look at helmet cam video you'll
see<00:02:49.100> that's<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:49.580> same<00:02:49.820> motions

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.640
