must say that the gameplay in the field
of<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.440> car<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:18.950> very<00:02:19.489> very<00:02:19.790> realistic<00:02:20.510> and

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
of the car is very very realistic and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.440 
of the car is very very realistic and
very<00:02:20.959> fun<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:22.130> think<00:02:22.160> dirt<00:02:22.940> fans<00:02:23.209> will<00:02:23.420> have

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
very fun and I think dirt fans will have

very fun and I think dirt fans will have
a<00:02:23.569> really<00:02:23.870> good<00:02:24.019> time<00:02:24.200> with<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.560> one<00:02:24.620> it's<00:02:24.920> a

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
a really good time with this one it's a

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.620 
a really good time with this one it's a
nice<00:02:25.190> progression<00:02:25.489> from<00:02:26.030> what<00:02:26.209> they<00:02:26.360> played

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
nice progression from what they played

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:36.890 
nice progression from what they played
before

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:50.650
