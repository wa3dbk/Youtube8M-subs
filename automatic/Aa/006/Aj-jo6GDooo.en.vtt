00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.889
 hello friends with you today again I 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.870
 Sasha dragon and I want to invite you to 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.900
 one mega cool event 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.170
 namely, I say summer dance 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.260
 good food camp itself dance camp which 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.699
 will be held in june not far from 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.590
 Nizhny Novgorod 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.619
 actually why do I want you there 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.170
 call and how he can be useful to you 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.050
 First I know many of you want 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.000
 become more professional in like a dancer 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.760
 as a performer can even be like 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.950
 choreographer or do you just love dancing to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.129
 what does this mean in mid-june from 15 to 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.930
 20 I will conduct a dance 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.370
 intensive within this camp and on 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.280
 which will really understand 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.260
 many unique important things that will 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.370
 in general in the program 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.149
 to understand what you expect 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.880
 naturally first of all i will 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.810
 disassemble technique dance technique 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.369
 illusory styles in particular because 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.140
 I know these styles very well 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.880
 and I can also teach you very cool 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.159
 uses his body in dance i mean i 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.390
 talking about creating an illusion i'm talking about 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.100
 fine art techniques such as wave techniques 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.850
 technician doing stops technician body control 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.979
 and speed control technician and that is all than 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.280
 usually well, many cause my 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.040
 problems and those who dance and hip-hop and 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.320
 other styles because dance should 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.329
 look very clear 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.040
 about fashion may lack just such 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.380
 technician so I will disassemble them in 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.229
 first of all except this i will 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.820
 disassemble yet how to combine motion 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.070
 each other so they looked 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.180
 truly harmonious so they 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.890
 looked to the place I would say yes it 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.799
 different principles of compounding 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.069
 trajectories along curves along 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.929
 sequences that is well 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.379
 I do not think that this information is somewhere 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.709
 You can still get just take from 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.799
 first hand and use on health 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.370
 further what else will naturally be 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:26.319
 A lot of time is devoted to how 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.299
 improvise that is how to go on 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.980
 battles do not fear how to use their 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.049
 imagination on battles as in general 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.349
 work with images for what they are 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:40.269
 Yes, that is, it will be very rich 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.419
 the program will learn not to speak 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:46.060
 afraid of the public will reveal your 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:50.469
 the potential is as full as possible 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.150
 strongly you can ask well here and if 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.629
 I suppose I do not really like illusory 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.819
 style 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.340
 and this dance for example breaking a or 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.739
 maybe hip-hop or even dance there 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.090
 plastic strip that's why this is nothing 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.449
 camp may be useful 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.489
 Well , first of all, let's do it of course 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:08.049
 I will give a couple of reasons well, of course it is not 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.079
 about you but nevertheless here you know there is 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.790
 such people who speak here at me 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.439
 There are favorite jeans I will in these 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.720
 jeans walk all my life and now i will 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:20.079
 walk them to the university i will go to 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.209
 I will be well ordered to school 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.430
 the wedding I also come jeans yes that is 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.199
 cradles his wife these people I mean 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.769
 seems very helpful anyway 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:32.709
 try different things to understand 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.479
 something to really love and understand 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.329
 deeper what you love most 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.859
 and secondly, imagine that 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.560
 how much will you get new information 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:44.650
 which you did not know before and 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.909
 which will greatly advance you in 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.919
 your direction because for example 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:53.799
 I personally have the brightest insights 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:56.349
 were when attending some trainings or 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.909
 workshops that were directly with dance 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.650
 unrelated but who gave me 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.310
 opportunity to take a fresh look at 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.859
 what am i doing here so by the way to 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.009
 a word like a lot of insights if 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.539
 same talk about dancing and i got from 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.699
 master classes in ballet for a while 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:14.379
 dealt with more recently 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.120
 being there champion so on so on 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.190
 so feel free to expand your 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.570
 outlook further 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.610
 suppose you can say well and if 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.590
 i don't want to be super professional me 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.480
 there are no plans to speak such and such 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.740
 contests act on battles there so 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.230
 further so on, is it necessary for me well I 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.240
 I can answer so here if you even 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.940
 dance for yourself or if maybe you 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.350
 not long ago started then why not 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.010
 do what you do for a hundred 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.560
 percent and burn but because going through my 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.130
 intense good food summer camp you 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.040
 be able to understand very seriously and deeply 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.710
 what you do and improve your 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.590
 the technique got a quick result here 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.780
 still a piece quickly you think there 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.920
 5-6 days is a lot of what you can 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.880
 get five to six days 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:09.570
 friends really if you move 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.360
 By the method I have a lot of experience already 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.800
 Intensively during this time you 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.390
 can't even imagine how strong 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.300
 you can boost your label 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.530
 so if you are still thinking of going or not 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.950
 go to this intense 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.800
 just think about what is remembered for 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.250
 do dancing at all and if your 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.410
 answer 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.960
 what do you like dancing and want in them 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.870
 evolve necessarily come to 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.970
 This summer intensive itself Don will 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.090
