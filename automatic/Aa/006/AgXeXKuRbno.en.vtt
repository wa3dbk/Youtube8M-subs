 ps 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.109
 I'm here for this 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.680

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.620
 it will be a bit complicated 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.380
 castellaccia I think the best directors are here and unconventional 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.140
 just like doors that was a journalist who has filmed almost everywhere 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.490
 in the world

 sighted in these war zones 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.000
 supports it influenced shining maybe there is an exclusion only after the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.010
 camera turns to frame 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.590
 and then you realize 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.140
 his ability to set these situations and coordinate all of them together 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.660
 characters creating a sense of chaos and a realistic experience reading the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.780
 since we do not arrive seriously now at that moment we see what we are 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.790
 we must do something referred to in article 5 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.040
 feel adrenaline flowing and if you think they have the seasons 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.070
 little heart on the road miss the universe method 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.310

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.610
 for those who have lived this experience ic-706 camera takes something

 real is always in motion 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.500
 water crisis when you create a thriller you are looking for something extremely songs 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.910
 the hiv high risk vibrations this is the reason why it was chosen 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.919
 standard 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:30.339
 because at that time it was one of the most dangerous places in the world the place 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.339
 ideal for shooting with 7

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.849
 tropez in the family a fundamental aspect of this film is the 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.479
 presence in the cast of veterans returned italytracker from Afghanistan 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.129
 in all the circus scenes I shot 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.060
 these authentic characters who really lived these VIP experiences 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:56.099
 which were fundamental to recreate a realistic price setting 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.279

 equense before any crisis scene does not feel registered 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:14.039
 between a couple of blasts of ak 47 projecting them immediately a thousand 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:17.039
 situations that they themselves had experienced 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:21.399
 this also helped me a lot to understand the meaning of that 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:23.319
 that happened in May 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.599
 because obviously if it doesn't go to places like that 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.749
 if you don't live extreme combat situations you can't risk them seriously 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.749

 what the interesting thing teaches 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.659
 because how fast these guys managed to consider but

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:32.210
 understands that something is wrong 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.870
 the more I say that there is a discrepancy between what the reports read 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.729
 what then said on the field 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.120

 wave hunts you something 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.979
 and we have to find out what 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.839
 a nice air on 1000mikes is getting frustrated because he wants to unpack 

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:54.990
 something 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.529
 because the reviews it exhibits with you will discover important information 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.590
 I wait for you to confirm that Magellan has met officers 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.509

 boris the film conceal 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.860
 there is nothing

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.739
 Fausto claims he has a vacation emirates source on the lake 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.310
 and I confirm the presence of weapons of mass destruction justifying them 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.310
 therefore, subject to the presence of the territory 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:32.249

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.669
 much more than just a simple not set up 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.180
 pity that I love to make an argument 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.069
 if as if someone leave you a child the initiative in bed and eventually discover 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.280
 which I was under is not what he thinks 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.630
 and like every great thriller that this consideration leads to a 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.610
 destiny already marked. a stone 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.520
 continue investigating is a threat we have a plan 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.310
 ariston paestum is the bad character and I am very satisfied with how 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.909
