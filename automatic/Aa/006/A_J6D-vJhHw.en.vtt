so off you go now this actually makes
the<00:00:23.349> job<00:00:23.529> harder<00:00:23.590> because<00:00:24.009> there's<00:00:24.279> three

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
the job harder because there's three

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.189 
the job harder because there's three
other<00:00:24.640> horses<00:00:25.029> now<00:00:25.300> on<00:00:25.419> this<00:00:25.539> paddock<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:28.199> run

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
off and this loss would naturally want

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.189
