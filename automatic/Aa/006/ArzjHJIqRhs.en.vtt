 to bring you here that if I left it to the 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.530

 it is that you can see through 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.830
 the mines with a lot of lighting is worth 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:30.310
 here we see that everything is dark then 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.770
 we simply give the l key and 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.320

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.460
 remove the coordinates if you do not like or 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.830
 add them again 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.520
 and that's it, this is what mode is 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.740
 of the x-raid since it works quite well 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.080
