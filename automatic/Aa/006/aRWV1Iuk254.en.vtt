about<00:01:10.340> making<00:01:11.960> exhibitions<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.830> less

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
about making exhibitions is really less

about having a big argument that I'm
trying<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.890> prove<00:01:17.270> to<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> world<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.720> this

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
trying to prove to the world that this

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.740 
trying to prove to the world that this
is<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.250> right<00:01:20.280> way<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> right

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
is the right way to think of the right

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.929 
is the right way to think of the right

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
way to see it's more it's very much a

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.670 
way to see it's more it's very much a
kind<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.000> hypothetical<00:01:27.990> story<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.560> I'm

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
kind of hypothetical story that I'm

course of that period that there's a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.080 
course of that period that there's a

way<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:38.200> think<00:02:39.200> about<00:02:39.590> doing<00:02:39.800> an<00:02:40.010> exhibition

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
way I think about doing an exhibition

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.730 
way I think about doing an exhibition
because<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.420> want<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.720> know<00:02:41.840> what<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.230> show<00:02:42.440> is

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
because I want to know what the show is

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.540 
because I want to know what the show is
about<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.960> and<00:02:44.960> if<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.800> already<00:02:46.040> didn't<00:02:46.430> know

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
about and and if I already didn't know

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.430 
about and and if I already didn't know
what<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.820> was<00:02:47.030> about<00:02:47.210> then<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.750> would<00:02:47.930> not<00:02:48.230> find

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
what it was about then I would not find

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.170 
what it was about then I would not find
that<00:02:48.590> much<00:02:48.800> interest<00:02:48.980> in<00:02:49.310> doing<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.000> show

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
that much interest in doing the show

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.720 
that much interest in doing the show
because<00:02:51.050> it<00:02:51.110> just<00:02:51.380> becomes<00:02:51.710> an<00:02:51.860> exercise<00:02:52.340> in

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
because it just becomes an exercise in

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.610 
because it just becomes an exercise in
illustrating<00:02:53.630> some<00:02:53.780> argument<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:54.530> I've

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
illustrating some argument that I've

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.320 
illustrating some argument that I've
already<00:02:54.800> figured<00:02:55.130> out<00:02:55.370> or<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.940> kind<00:02:56.180> of

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
already figured out or in kind of

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.930 
already figured out or in kind of
articulating<00:02:57.050> so<00:02:57.710> for<00:02:58.070> me<00:02:58.160> that's<00:02:58.340> less

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.130 

that's<00:03:01.940> less<00:03:02.120> interesting<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:02.750> it's<00:03:02.870> more

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
that's less interesting and it's more

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.440 
that's less interesting and it's more
exciting<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.740> before<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.130> lie<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:08.330> know

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
exciting and before a lie to you know

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.820 
exciting and before a lie to you know
it's<00:03:08.600> over<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.959> next<00:03:09.200> few<00:03:09.350> months<00:03:09.470> as<00:03:09.800> the

it's over the next few months as the

it's over the next few months as the

show that's about XY and Z and it's kind

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.650 
show that's about XY and Z and it's kind
of<00:03:20.630> part<00:03:21.350> of<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.770> process<00:03:22.520> and<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.420> makes

of part of that process and that makes

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.430 
of part of that process and that makes
