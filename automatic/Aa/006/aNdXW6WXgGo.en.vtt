00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.470
 and here is the last package for today 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.450
 and said we go on growing most 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.339
 interesting we are the most interesting for me 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.950
 already unpacked the most interesting now 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.419
 for my subscribers this is hello not 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.940
 kick me in slippers last time 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.859
 unpacking I had to interrupt not 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.050
 just because I sat in a chamber 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.640
 because the double with ruined in general I do not 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.410
 liked that unpacking so 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.339
 I have a separate video unpacking 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.300
 cubot x12 this smartphone came to me site 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.499
 aliexpress went parcel exactly 30 days not 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.750
 noteworthy this smartphone so that 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.610
 it costs exactly 104 dollars well at least 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.180
 least i'm a hare the amount bought it in burning 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.620
 goods 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.650
 in general, a smartphone is much more expensive 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.510
 something around 120 in my dollars 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.460
 notable for a long time the smartphone is not only 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.350
 but at the cost of offering good ones 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.540
 specifications for your 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.220
 the cost seems to be even curious as 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.870
 you can already guess i am a smartphone 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.120
 tested so showing you now 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.560
 bundling how comes the smartphone and for 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.960
 usage time it used 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.700
 about one day did not work out for him 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.440
 what is the first impression first 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.240
 Smartphone small circulation 5 inches in 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.620
 the second one is very complete 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.080
 many gifts 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.030
 specifically this configuration there is something 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.460
 6 gifts here on the protective film 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.170
 I had a quick start and in short 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.860
 the gift is still such a thing this in 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.770
 cigarette lighter 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.140
 crap like I'm shorter crap in the cigarette lighter 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.140
 Well, still went to the protective bumper og immediately 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:28.430
 on a smartphone it is so silicone 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.430
 soft stuff 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.659
 the smartphone is pretty cool by first 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.580
 I even liked the sensations in under 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.649
 back cover we are 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.080
 2200 milliamp battery 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.299
 hours and the Chinese production of 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.159
 completely unknown materials under 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.500
 the back cover is immediately two 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.110
 micro SIM card slots one 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.119
 supports lt 2 only 2g and slot for 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.649
 micro sd card extensions by 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.729
 specifications and here at 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:09.069
 we have a processor mt 6735 with 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.200
 pester m stripped down to one 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.049
 Fucking gigahertz is generally kapets 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.370
 what can be done on a purity of 1 gigahertz 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:18.220
 incomprehensible 1 gigabyte of RAM 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.830
 and 8 GB built in with the possibility of how you 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.350
 already understood the extension back camera with 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.700
 8 megapixel flash 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.350
 most likely used here 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.600
 interpolation is not a real camera here 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.030
 megapixels for 5 front camera for 2 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.100
 megapixels but with interpolation up to 5 so 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.650
 same in the smartphone stated the presence of the IR port 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.180
 in order to manage all the appliances and 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.620
 on top there is a socket for micro sd 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.560
 card three and a half and this 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.000
 most likely there is an infrared port i 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.600
 understand what else you can say by 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.750
 smartphones 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.040
 5 inch screen with 960 resolution 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.109
 540 pixels 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.150
 pixels visible to the naked eye 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.950
 if for example use it like this 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.930
 look like a normal smartphone you 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.900
 use something not to drink or not visible 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.420
 however, it is worthwhile to bring your gaze closer. 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.000
 circles already like not that round etc. 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.540
 pixel grid right striking 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.560
 before this kind of permission now 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.480
 not enough but do not forget that 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.670
 there is only 1 gig hertz 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.980
 processor with only 4 cores 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.850
 despite the fact that he's 64 bits on it 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.590
 no effect on him 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.630
 performance by and large 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.850
 see as in the play market stand 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.180
 most 32-bit applications so and 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.489
 android version itself is 32 bit yes 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.319
 despite the fact that android 5.1 it is all 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.900
 equal to 32 bit below the screen 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.810
 there are backlit buttons 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.480
 home menu back until the smartphone is 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.120
 brakes it works everything is very smart 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.500
 I did not notice any lags 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.379
 however, I have already put one 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.240
 toy it is pretty light something about 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.910
 50 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.200
 megabytes is called on fixture fight and 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.030
 it slows down 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.250
 not so that it was quite critical 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.990
 but lag is still present from the chips 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.920
 smartphone highlight at the moment i 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.880
 I can that well, most likely 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.960
 ergonomic back cover pretty 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.330
 cool to the touch 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.190
 plus the design itself is pretty good for 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.740
 100 bucks is not any ugly there 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.810
 washed to a piece of something else + good 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.310
 color rendition at the smartphone display 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.610
 pretty good brightness as 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.090
 maximum and so minimal and perhaps 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.670
 everything 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.739
 well for 100 dollars is quite a fit 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.020
 if you compare it with other state employees 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.030
 who came to me the other day du jeu oh 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.280
 stop about that still winning a little 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.460
 but here at a price of about $ 20 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.400
 more expensive u tjuji there 720 pixels screen u 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.480
 This is all 540 cameras equally bad 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.580
 what is there what is there 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.670
 but ergonomics right there while winning 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.500
 Yes, I used a little tuji 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.350
 comfortable in the hand really but 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.400
 but it does have a key backlighting and 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.110
 declared port hope it 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.050
 will ever find that while I can say 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.110
 on smartphones while you like it right there 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.730
 I do not like it but with time 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.090
 everything will be corrected and will be the opposite 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.140
 what is the general joke of cubot 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.210
 the fact is that they don't have their own 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.830
 production bases and all their 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.930
 smartphones they order from dick 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.670
 manufacturers that are manufacturers that 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.800
 then there they have nowhere to put their 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.990
 Kubat products and put them buys 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.730
 they sell their brand before it 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.220
 naturally does quality control 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.950
 The fact is that I still have a cubot 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.630
 There is some trust in the brand because 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.490
 that despite the fact that they choose all 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.340
 products from our manufacturers they 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.060
 choose as something more or less successful that 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.310
 Are all models 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.800
 and here he does everything himself and does 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.230
 Often it happens anyhow 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.170
 me as trust there is no reference to both 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:37.530
 the smartphone I will leave in the description a link to 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:40.020
 unpacking g all the links that are in general 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.300
 may be on this planet I will leave everything in 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.130
 description can also go to the group 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.600
 if you are interested in this smartphone and 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.510
 you want to see more about him 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.730
 information any of the first mouth 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.740
 You can join the group to ask a question 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.560
 for example, there on this smartphone or 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.000
 bye anyone 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.800
 another smartphone must 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.900
 subscribe to the channel not to miss 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.850
 none of the reviews i remind it 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.889
 there was only the first impression complete 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.350
 review with my full opinion with everyone 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.600
 pros and cons and conclusions will not do 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.070
 of course later it seems to me all the same 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.500
 make interesting ideas 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.110
 review and comparison on 2 smartphone with almost 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.970
 identical iron and of course everyone 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.970
 Thank you all for your attention.
