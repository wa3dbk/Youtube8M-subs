would<00:00:59.950> be<00:01:00.040> the<00:01:00.190> winter<00:01:00.550> project<00:01:00.730> intro<00:01:01.360> as<00:01:02.170> you

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
would be the winter project intro as you

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
would be the winter project intro as you
see<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.649> title<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:04.180> this<00:01:04.390> is<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.690> exhaust<00:01:05.400> 1dc

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
see the title so this is the exhaust 1dc

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.690 
see the title so this is the exhaust 1dc
on<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:07.060> bolts<00:01:07.510> got<00:01:07.930> stripped<00:01:08.409> when<00:01:08.770> I<00:01:08.800> impact

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
on the bolts got stripped when I impact

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.240 
on the bolts got stripped when I impact
wrenched<00:01:10.210> it<00:01:10.390> out<00:01:11.729> over<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.820> bolts<00:01:13.120> here

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
wrenched it out over the bolts here

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.390 
wrenched it out over the bolts here
because<00:01:15.250> my<00:01:15.370> mechanic<00:01:15.850> late<00:01:16.060> as<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:16.930> see<00:01:17.400> they

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400

just<00:01:18.460> got<00:01:18.760> shot<00:01:19.150> out<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.830> it<00:01:21.040> broke<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.770> is

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
just got shot out is it broke so this is

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.140 
just got shot out is it broke so this is
garbage<00:01:24.280> geez<00:01:24.400> there's<00:01:24.700> some<00:01:24.850> part-time

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
garbage geez there's some part-time

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.190 
garbage geez there's some part-time
keeping<00:01:26.080> so<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:26.740> might<00:01:27.159> use<00:01:27.400> this<00:01:27.960> not<00:01:28.960> quite

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
keeping so I might use this not quite

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.490 
keeping so I might use this not quite
sure<00:01:29.229> I<00:01:29.470> could<00:01:29.799> that<00:01:30.310> might<00:01:30.520> be<00:01:30.729> half-inch<00:01:31.500> put

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
sure I could that might be half-inch put

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.820 
sure I could that might be half-inch put

been using quarter inch copper piping as
my<00:01:40.119> original<00:01:40.590> long<00:01:41.590> because<00:01:41.799> that's<00:01:41.979> when<00:01:42.159> it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
my original long because that's when it

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.580 
my original long because that's when it
came<00:01:42.490> with<00:01:42.700> this<00:01:42.790> compressor<00:01:43.299> tank<00:01:43.510> so<00:01:44.409> it's

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
came with this compressor tank so it's

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.109 
came with this compressor tank so it's
give<00:01:44.799> a<00:01:44.830> quick<00:01:45.130> look<00:01:45.310> at<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:45.640> compressor

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
give a quick look at this compressor

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.550 
give a quick look at this compressor
tank<00:01:46.330> I<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:49.600> it<00:01:49.780> fired<00:01:50.020> up<00:01:50.200> many<00:01:50.470> times

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
tank I have it fired up many times

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.880 
tank I have it fired up many times
before<00:01:50.950> it's<00:01:51.430> just<00:01:51.549> to<00:01:51.820> keep<00:01:52.619> my<00:01:53.619> pressure

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
before it's just to keep my pressure

currently making my uh fire pit out of
Tim<00:02:47.750> can<00:02:47.960> ya<00:02:48.920> rijal<00:02:49.670> not<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.690> good<00:02:50.980> planning

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
Tim can ya rijal not that good planning

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.790 
Tim can ya rijal not that good planning
again<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.340> better<00:02:52.580> fire<00:02:52.850> pit<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:53.620> that's<00:02:54.620> pretty

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
again a better fire pit so that's pretty

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.130 
again a better fire pit so that's pretty
much<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.880> had<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.840> many<00:02:57.800> many<00:02:58.040> times

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
much it I had it many many times

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.650 
much it I had it many many times
sit<00:03:00.140> down<00:03:00.970> that'll<00:03:01.970> dirty<00:03:02.300> again

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
sit down that'll dirty again

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.900 
sit down that'll dirty again
so<00:03:04.000> this<00:03:05.000> engine<00:03:05.780> would<00:03:06.560> never<00:03:06.770> run<00:03:07.490> my<00:03:07.760> dad

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
so this engine would never run my dad

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.890 
so this engine would never run my dad
because<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.210> gets<00:03:08.360> rug

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
because it gets rug

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.280 
because it gets rug
I'm<00:03:09.140> not<00:03:09.440> even<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.680> bother<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:11.120> had<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.540> all

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
I'm not even a bother so had it all

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.340 
I'm not even a bother so had it all
taken<00:03:12.410> apart<00:03:12.800> all<00:03:13.430> new<00:03:13.820> word<00:03:14.110> lubricated<00:03:15.110> back

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350

taken apart all new word lubricated back
it<00:03:15.560> all<00:03:15.650> up<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:17.540> never<00:03:17.780> actually<00:03:18.140> a<00:03:18.610> round

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
it all up so it never actually a round

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.440 
it all up so it never actually a round
fully<00:03:19.910> kept<00:03:20.350> making<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.440> submergence<00:03:21.770> down

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
fully kept making the submergence down

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.400 
fully kept making the submergence down
took<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.570> pistol<00:03:24.070> oiled<00:03:25.070> old<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:25.400> up<00:03:25.520> again<00:03:26.410> so

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
took the pistol oiled old it up again so

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.750 
took the pistol oiled old it up again so
it<00:03:27.530> runs<00:03:27.739> pretty<00:03:28.340> ok<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.340> can<00:03:31.459> spin<00:03:31.700> it

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
it runs pretty ok so you can spin it

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.850 
it runs pretty ok so you can spin it
quite<00:03:32.060> well

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
quite well

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.720 
quite well
so<00:03:33.860> this<00:03:34.160> is<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.760> gear<00:03:35.150> ear<00:03:35.540> pop<00:03:36.080> song<00:03:36.350> as<00:03:36.950> you
