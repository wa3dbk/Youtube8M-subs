the<00:00:30.090> time<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.660> I'm<00:00:30.840> not<00:00:30.900> quite<00:00:31.199> sure<00:00:32.149> when<00:00:33.149> it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the time and I'm not quite sure when it

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.639 
the time and I'm not quite sure when it

Scrolls<00:01:46.079> MMO<00:01:46.439> would<00:01:46.649> work<00:01:46.860> do<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.460> go<00:01:47.610> would

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
Scrolls MMO would work do you go would

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.399 
Scrolls MMO would work do you go would
you<00:01:48.000> guys<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.390> looking<00:01:48.689> forward<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.259> at

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
you guys be looking forward to that at

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.240 
you guys be looking forward to that at
all<00:01:50.630> yeah<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.170> don't<00:01:52.409> know<00:01:52.590> cuz<00:01:52.950> I've

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
all yeah like I don't know cuz I've

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.660 
all yeah like I don't know cuz I've
tried<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> fair<00:01:53.970> few<00:01:54.180> mmo's<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.649> don't<00:01:56.430> I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
tried a fair few mmo's and I don't I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.690 
tried a fair few mmo's and I don't I
think<00:01:57.290> Elder<00:01:58.290> Scrolls<00:01:58.590> would<00:01:59.009> be<00:01:59.159> okay<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.610> an

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
think Elder Scrolls would be okay as an

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.609 
think Elder Scrolls would be okay as an
MMO<00:02:00.090> they've<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.750> got<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.930> try<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> work<00:02:01.439> it

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
MMO they've just got to try to work it

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.859 
MMO they've just got to try to work it
out<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.579> actually<00:02:03.060> plays<00:02:03.479> well

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
out so that it actually plays well

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.050 
out so that it actually plays well
because<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:05.100> too<00:02:05.250> much<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.430> wow<00:02:05.759> then

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
because if it's too much like wow then

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.520 
because if it's too much like wow then
it's<00:02:06.180> gonna<00:02:06.270> get<00:02:06.450> boring<00:02:06.719> because<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.200> found

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
it's gonna get boring because I found

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.680 
it's gonna get boring because I found
that<00:02:07.680> with<00:02:07.890> such<00:02:08.129> wit<00:02:08.580> or<00:02:08.759> when<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.270> was<00:02:09.420> playing

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
that with such wit or when I was playing

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.070 
that with such wit or when I was playing
that<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:10.709> was<00:02:10.920> way<00:02:11.520> too<00:02:11.550> much<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.480> WoW<00:02:12.660> for<00:02:12.959> me

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
that it was way too much like WoW for me

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.700 
that it was way too much like WoW for me
and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.040 
and
I<00:02:13.880> decided<00:02:14.880> not<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.120> keep<00:02:15.390> playing<00:02:15.660> because<00:02:15.840> of

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
I decided not to keep playing because of

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.570 
I decided not to keep playing because of
that<00:02:16.380> reason<00:02:16.770> because<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.250> mean<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.430> don't

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
that reason because I mean I don't

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.520 
that reason because I mean I don't
really<00:02:18.120> play<00:02:18.360> well<00:02:18.540> anymore<00:02:18.840> either<00:02:19.140> because

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
really play well anymore either because

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.900 
really play well anymore either because
I<00:02:19.560> just<00:02:19.980> I'm<00:02:20.280> over<00:02:20.640> it

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
I just I'm over it

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.660 
I just I'm over it
I<00:02:20.940> mean<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.260> probably<00:02:22.740> will<00:02:23.130> eventually<00:02:23.250> get

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
I mean I probably will eventually get

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.980 
I mean I probably will eventually get
dragged<00:02:23.940> back<00:02:24.030> into<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.510> because<00:02:24.720> that's<00:02:24.840> what

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
dragged back into it because that's what

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.260 
dragged back into it because that's what
happens<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.440> everyone<00:02:25.800> who<00:02:26.010> plays<00:02:26.220> well<00:02:26.400> but

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
happens to everyone who plays well but

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.980 
happens to everyone who plays well but
yeah<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:28.470> actually<00:02:28.820> I'm<00:02:29.820> really<00:02:30.300> really<00:02:30.630> keen

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
yeah I actually I'm really really keen

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.100 
yeah I actually I'm really really keen
on<00:02:31.230> Terra<00:02:32.070> actually<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.330> actually<00:02:33.660> feel

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
on Terra actually and I actually feel

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.250 
on Terra actually and I actually feel
that<00:02:35.210> Bethesda<00:02:36.210> should<00:02:36.420> take<00:02:36.690> some<00:02:37.020> notes

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
that Bethesda should take some notes

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.730 
that Bethesda should take some notes
from<00:02:37.860> Terra<00:02:38.460> because<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.300> do<00:02:39.630> like<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.470> police

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
from Terra because I do like the police

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.890 
from Terra because I do like the police
dial<00:02:41.100> in<00:02:41.250> Terra<00:02:41.490> and<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.790> think<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.240> if<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
dial in Terra and I think that if the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.080 
dial in Terra and I think that if the
Elder<00:02:43.170> Scrolls<00:02:43.200> MMO<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.730> know<00:02:44.820> if<00:02:44.940> they

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
Elder Scrolls MMO that you know if they

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.520 
Elder Scrolls MMO that you know if they
do<00:02:45.150> actually<00:02:45.420> end<00:02:45.690> up<00:02:45.720> bringing<00:02:45.900> out<00:02:46.140> Elder

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
do actually end up bringing out Elder

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.610 
do actually end up bringing out Elder
Scrolls<00:02:46.800> online<00:02:47.030> they<00:02:48.030> should<00:02:48.300> really<00:02:48.810> follow

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
Scrolls online they should really follow

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.220 
Scrolls online they should really follow
that<00:02:49.920> very<00:02:50.220> closely<00:02:50.690> but<00:02:51.690> yeah<00:02:51.780> that's<00:02:51.960> all<00:02:52.140> I

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230
