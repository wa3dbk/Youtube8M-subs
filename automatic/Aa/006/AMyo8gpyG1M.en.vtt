00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Mva`a locality abounds in many natural resources.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Today, YETAM report team

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Chose to talk to you about forest tree species,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
As well as Shortwood logging.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
To know more, we met  Mr Onana and  Mr Michel.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Follow me.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The sawn wood is used for construction,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Because if you do not saw wood,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You cannot build a house,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Nor make furniture.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Obviously, woods are resources that belong to us,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
When you are a native of the village.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
On the one hand, you must apply for an authorization of wood sawing.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Before you saw the woods,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If I receive an order

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I will saw woods and earn income.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
My children can live on,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It enables me to pay their school fees, clothes and others.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Normally, wood is a fortune.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It is an asset.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If you have trees to saw, you must saw them.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You sell them and after sale,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You can still make furniture.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Those trees are found in our forests,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And we must exploit them.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Before sawing woods,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We apply to the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Then, they give an exploitation license.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You now start exploiting wood.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Firewood is used for cooking.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
My wife does the cooking thanks to it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And it also enables us to gain some money

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
When we are facing difficulties.
