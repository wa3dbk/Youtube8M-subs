00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
today's video we're gonna be taking a

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.160 
today's video we're gonna be taking a
look<00:00:11.550> at<00:00:11.730> perhaps<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.509> most<00:00:12.630> overpowered

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
look at perhaps the most overpowered

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.140 
look at perhaps the most overpowered
perk<00:00:13.380> at<00:00:13.710> least<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.070> my<00:00:14.190> opinion<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.730> black<00:00:14.940> ops

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
perk at least in my opinion in black ops

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.090 
perk at least in my opinion in black ops
2<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:16.049> may<00:00:16.139> not<00:00:16.260> be<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> perk<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.859> first

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
2 and it may not be the perk that first

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.439 
2 and it may not be the perk that first
comes<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.400> mind<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:17.940> when<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.180> really<00:00:18.420> think

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
comes to mind but when you really think

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.810 
comes to mind but when you really think
about<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.080> see<00:00:19.199> how<00:00:19.230> effective<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.770> is

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
about it and see how effective it is

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.980 
about it and see how effective it is
overpowered<00:00:20.820> really<00:00:21.119> isn't<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> far<00:00:21.660> stretch

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
overpowered really isn't a far stretch

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.720 
overpowered really isn't a far stretch
now<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.470> perk<00:00:22.710> I'm<00:00:22.859> talking<00:00:23.160> about<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.460> flak

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
now the perk I'm talking about is flak

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.400 
now the perk I'm talking about is flak
jacket<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.330> again<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.689> kind<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.930> perk<00:00:25.109> isn't

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
jacket and again this kind of perk isn't

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.599 
jacket and again this kind of perk isn't
typically<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.980> kind<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.250> perky<00:00:26.519> would

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
typically the kind of perky would

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.429 
typically the kind of perky would
complain<00:00:26.849> about<00:00:27.029> being<00:00:27.269> overpowered<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.050> perk

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
complain about being overpowered a perk

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.290 
complain about being overpowered a perk
like<00:00:28.619> ghost<00:00:28.890> from<00:00:29.070> black<00:00:29.279> ops<00:00:29.460> 1<00:00:29.699> was<00:00:29.880> clearly

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
like ghost from black ops 1 was clearly

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.970 
like ghost from black ops 1 was clearly
overpowered<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:31.650> maybe

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
overpowered you know but this one maybe

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.920 
overpowered you know but this one maybe
not<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.520> much<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.210> I'm<00:00:33.329> gonna<00:00:33.420> try<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.660> explain

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
not so much but I'm gonna try to explain

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.840 
not so much but I'm gonna try to explain
exactly<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.800> does<00:00:35.010> what<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.460> counters

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
exactly what it does what it counters

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.950 
exactly what it does what it counters
how<00:00:36.030> effective<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.840> different

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
how effective it is in different

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.780 
how effective it is in different
situations<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.280> decide<00:00:38.460> whether<00:00:38.700> or

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
situations and you can decide whether or

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.580 
situations and you can decide whether or
not<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.149> may<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.329> overpowered<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.320> starting

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
not it may be overpowered so starting

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.170 
not it may be overpowered so starting
off<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.950> flak<00:00:41.160> jacket<00:00:41.489> part<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.820> programmed

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
off the flak jacket part is programmed

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.670 
off the flak jacket part is programmed
to<00:00:42.270> reduce<00:00:42.540> damage<00:00:42.780> from<00:00:43.020> explosives<00:00:43.530> by

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
to reduce damage from explosives by

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.500 
to reduce damage from explosives by
thirty<00:00:44.010> three<00:00:44.280> percent<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:45.120> basically

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
thirty three percent so basically

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.240 
thirty three percent so basically
explosives<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.110> one-third<00:00:46.620> less<00:00:46.829> damage

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
explosives do one-third less damage

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.830 
explosives do one-third less damage
while<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> perk<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.879> equipped<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.719> of

while the perk is equipped because of

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.540 
while the perk is equipped because of
this<00:00:48.930> not<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.469> explosive<00:00:49.800> alone<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.399> kill

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
this not one explosive alone can kill

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.160 
this not one explosive alone can kill
you<00:00:50.670> with<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:50.820> hit<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.390> will<00:00:51.690> survive<00:00:51.989> the

you with one hit you will survive the
