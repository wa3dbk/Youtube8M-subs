00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.920 
direct it forward I'm gonna push it down
in<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> reverse<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:09.450> again<00:01:09.689> set<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> spin

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
in a reverse it again set the spin

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.850 
in a reverse it again set the spin
and<00:01:11.440> take<00:01:11.620> it<00:01:11.770> reverse<00:01:13.440> and<00:01:14.440> slide<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.710> little

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
and take it reverse and slide a little

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:23.970 
and take it reverse and slide a little
bit<00:01:15.190> here

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.960 

now<00:01:24.980> remember<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.370> fly<00:01:25.670> this<00:01:25.730> helicopter

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
now remember to fly this helicopter

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.110 
now remember to fly this helicopter
indoors<00:01:26.980> if<00:01:27.980> you<00:01:28.100> take<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:28.310> outside<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.820> radio

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
indoors if you take it outside the radio

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.600 
indoors if you take it outside the radio
waves<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:29.660> different<00:01:30.440> frequencies<00:01:31.070> outside

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
waves and different frequencies outside

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.510 
waves and different frequencies outside
will<00:01:32.600> mess<00:01:32.900> it<00:01:32.930> up<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.440> it<00:01:33.530> will<00:01:33.650> crash<00:01:33.980> it'll

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
will mess it up and it will crash it'll

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.220 
will mess it up and it will crash it'll
go<00:01:35.000> up<00:01:35.060> a<00:01:35.180> little<00:01:35.270> ways<00:01:35.540> and<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:35.960> will<00:01:36.080> either

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
go up a little ways and it will either

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.630 
go up a little ways and it will either
die<00:01:36.500> or<00:01:36.530> start<00:01:37.040> going<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.340> different<00:01:37.520> direction

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
die or start going a different direction

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.180 
die or start going a different direction
and<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.720> won't<00:01:38.810> be<00:01:38.930> able<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.170> control<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.710> this

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
and you won't be able to control it this

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.610 
and you won't be able to control it this
is<00:01:40.370> indoor<00:01:40.850> use<00:01:41.120> only<00:01:41.450> now<00:01:42.320> we're<00:01:42.440> going<00:01:42.560> to

so come with us and we'll go out and fly

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:26.340 
so come with us and we'll go out and fly

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:03:12.559 

you

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.589 

so<00:03:13.409> far<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.650> think<00:03:13.709> this<00:03:13.980> toy<00:03:14.219> it's<00:03:14.879> just<00:03:15.239> barely

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
so far I think this toy it's just barely

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.690 
so far I think this toy it's just barely
a<00:03:15.749> four<00:03:16.170> it's<00:03:16.739> hard<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.099> know<00:03:17.219> which<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.670> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
a four it's hard to know which is the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.910 
a four it's hard to know which is the
front<00:03:17.999> there's<00:03:18.719> only<00:03:18.959> one<00:03:19.139> option<00:03:19.349> for

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
front there's only one option for

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.640 
front there's only one option for
charging<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.540> through<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.689> remote<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.260> get

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
charging it through the remote and get

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.059 
charging it through the remote and get
six<00:03:23.099> batteries<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:24.780> are<00:03:25.019> installed<00:03:25.859> in<00:03:25.980> the

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
six batteries that are installed in the

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.459 
six batteries that are installed in the
back<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.549> one<00:03:27.269> other<00:03:27.480> problems<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:28.139> found<00:03:28.379> with
