00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
2.10 and higher I think or the duo

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.549 
2.10 and higher I think or the duo
stunner<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> regular<00:00:49.110> one<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.440> think

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
stunner like the regular one I think

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.709 
stunner like the regular one I think
it's<00:00:49.890> very<00:00:50.129> small<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.180> small<00:00:51.449> size

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
it's very small it's like small size

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.639 
it's very small it's like small size
like<00:00:52.370> 1.95<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.430> think<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.750> tires<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.140> had<00:00:55.289> before

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
like 1.95 I think the tires I had before

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.099 
like 1.95 I think the tires I had before
this<00:00:55.829> was<00:00:56.070> animal<00:00:56.520> tires<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.120> they<00:00:57.719> were<00:00:57.780> worn

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
this was animal tires and they were worn

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.450 
this was animal tires and they were worn
out<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.469> can't<00:00:58.739> really<00:00:58.859> give<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> good<00:00:59.190> review

about it but they were 1.95 in I really

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.350

wall<00:02:04.140> or<00:02:04.350> white<00:02:04.590> because<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.909> would<00:02:06.060> imagine

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
wall or white because it would imagine

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.639 
wall or white because it would imagine
with<00:02:06.479> my<00:02:06.630> frame<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.619> decided<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.160> get<00:02:08.369> white

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
with my frame but I decided to get white

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.530 
with my frame but I decided to get white
because<00:02:10.649> white<00:02:10.800> just<00:02:11.039> looks<00:02:11.250> epic<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:12.060> it

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
because white just looks epic and it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.700 
because white just looks epic and it
also<00:02:12.690> goes<00:02:13.080> with<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.440> spa

has like threads right here and as a
line<00:03:51.240> a<00:03:51.540> little<00:03:52.020> small<00:03:52.260> line<00:03:52.440> going<00:03:52.830> here<00:03:52.860> and

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
line a little small line going here and

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.300 
line a little small line going here and
that's<00:03:54.750> pretty<00:03:55.110> much<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.500> for<00:03:55.530> for<00:03:55.890> jams<00:03:56.070> it's

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
that's pretty much it for for jams it's

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.270 
that's pretty much it for for jams it's
very<00:03:56.550> very<00:03:56.850> good<00:03:56.910> for<00:03:57.540> jams<00:03:58.200> depend<00:03:58.620> on<00:03:58.950> your

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
very very good for jams depend on your

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.930 
very very good for jams depend on your
type<00:04:00.240> of<00:04:00.300> grip<00:04:01.050> on<00:04:01.170> your<00:04:01.320> shoe<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:02.070> fork<00:04:02.400> like

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
type of grip on your shoe the fork like

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.110 
type of grip on your shoe the fork like
the<00:04:03.450> space<00:04:03.690> between<00:04:03.960> your<00:04:04.260> fork<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.120> your

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
the space between your fork and your

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.560 
the space between your fork and your
tire<00:04:06.930> also<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:08.310> overall<00:04:08.610> these<00:04:09.000> are<00:04:09.150> very<00:04:09.360> very

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570
