challenge<00:02:59.390> I'm<00:03:00.390> starting<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.720> realize<00:03:00.900> just

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
challenge I'm starting to realize just

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.080 
challenge I'm starting to realize just
how<00:03:01.290> hard<00:03:01.500> it's<00:03:01.620> going<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.799> be<00:03:01.920> in<00:03:02.459> 100<00:03:02.849> miles

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
how hard it's going to be in 100 miles

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.020 
how hard it's going to be in 100 miles
very<00:03:04.049> slowly<00:03:04.440> going<00:03:04.859> around<00:03:05.099> blows<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.700> snow

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
very slowly going around blows of snow

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.080 
very slowly going around blows of snow
and<00:03:06.209> ice<00:03:06.359> and<00:03:06.720> rocks<00:03:07.670> will<00:03:08.670> look<00:03:08.790> after<00:03:08.940> each

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
and ice and rocks will look after each

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.849
