00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.440
 hello i will tell you the truth boat and thou 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:11.420
 see in the protocol 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.789
 and here two is our field 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.329
 earlier kia models in recent years 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.499
 later 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:19.320
 recently released 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.699
 but first she sang 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.130
 percent 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.869
 when designing the boat was delivered 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.640
 task to get 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.749
 cheap with the highest quality 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.920
 I love it very much 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.110
 in order to be able to go to Russia on 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.200
 top trunk besides cars 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.430
 easily loading love 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.100
 percent 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.970
 corresponding signals which 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.170
 will see all nb 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.300
 allowed 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.840
 of the year 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.570
 more than 500 pieces 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.320
 tax touches is used as 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.020
 correct yourself 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.170
 but also under the motors she 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.050
 designed for motor use not 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.540
 more than ten horsepower 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.770
 percent i'm not just like that you say 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.250
 what is probably a big motor 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.250
 pilot Kiev 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.460
 it is calculated 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.250
 under the motor to build horsepower 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.250
 Ukraine 10 horsepower boat acquires 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.650
 water resistance 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.560
 sustainability seriously enough 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.880
 This will not get from the use of MPA 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.750
 smaller motors 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.470
 she is of course well moving and 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.490
 displacement mode that's small 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.410
 motor 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.120
 we are at the same time water 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.120
 very persistently her very comfortable 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.270
 apply for fishing as it has 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.010
 trimaran yamburg 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.140
 with also she is a BBC brook 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.790
 motor little over five horsepower 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.500
 the boat starts chasing goes 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.670
 pretty quickly there is an opportunity 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.350
 set the average information about the shop here 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.140
 boss 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.170
 gritsak 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.170
 it is very convenient you can gain th 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.970
 and before the nose also can in no way in front 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.740
 change will deal 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.110
 headscarves 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.450
 pretty security she 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.389
 Chemistry 3 seconds of buoyancy 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.199
 they are all on the bottom 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.679
 trimarans contours allow us as 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:17.739
 establish that 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.950
 3 just pretty good stadium 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.809
 bow buoyancy 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.169
 bridge boat on the hull of may 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.829
 this is due to the prices 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.819
 we need to have exactly 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.819
 minimal tourist 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.119
 respectively, the application of assessments 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.409
 manufacturing technology new 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.169
 empty boat format 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:39.269
 implies 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.639
 so one country is children's facial 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.249
 the second Chornovola of the Black Sea 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:47.349
 tip we have to crash 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.999
 top lot 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:50.229
 percent 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.519
 and, accordingly, investment, it is not 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.519
 has on a smooth surface 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:57.320
 new model 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.949
 native father 303 uk with how you see the country 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.999
 favorably different appearance under 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.149
 percent of our past model 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:09.729
 she has two surface targets 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.419
 and at the top and bottom of the year it was open 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.349
 brilliant assessment of medics who 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.559
 away tons of coverage 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:20.040
 we managed to get 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.909
 heat fuel 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:23.019
 applying 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.349
 quite sophisticated and modern 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.480
 technology application 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.519
 technology allowed us to get not 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.019
 only running characteristics and 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.599
 the appearance of vodkin will also enhance 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.989
 operational safety 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.929
 and you also have a trimaran job 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:40.019
 she is very stable on the water 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.989
 In addition, the application of new technologies to us 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.089
 allowed this model 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.839
 apply force four more 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:47.719
 additional buoyancy blocks 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:49.989
 yes this rear block will turn out aft 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.219
 ops 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:53.809
 institution 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:56.399
 for two side buoyancy blocks on which 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:58.669
 as you see lies middle seats 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.399
 financial buoyancy block which 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:02.759
 anchor hawsei made 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:06.030
 I need the last block I can do everything at the insistence 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.060
 March 10th is mawka she is quite new this is already 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.169
 not plywood 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.869
 it's completely fiberglass 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:13.799
 while it is quite easy 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.650
 the boat has a load capacity of up to 20 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.439
 kilogram 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:18.309
 in her rather low board she 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:20.189
 designed to operate on 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:21.160
 calm water 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.930
 there in a recession and calm 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.349
 never leave mine 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.129
 in April compliance 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.719
 correct weight distribution when loading the boat 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:32.559
 by boat 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:34.580
 but it remains very stable 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.840
 on the water 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.980
 it is designed for use by the motor 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:41.259
 ten horsepower
