get<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.420> building<00:01:07.020> alright<00:01:08.010> I've<00:01:08.430> completed

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
get to building alright I've completed

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.929 
get to building alright I've completed
the<00:01:09.150> set<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.590> Arctic<00:01:11.130> base<00:01:11.490> camp

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the set and here is the Arctic base camp

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.170 
the set and here is the Arctic base camp
this<00:01:12.510> came<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.840> two<00:01:13.229> pieces<00:01:13.610> this<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
this came in two pieces this one and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.660 
this came in two pieces this one and
this<00:01:15.450> one<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.990> had<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> put<00:01:16.950> them<00:01:17.070> together<00:01:17.220> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
this one I had to put them together and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.910 
this one I had to put them together and
it<00:01:17.970> actually<00:01:18.240> looked<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:18.930> cool<00:01:19.140> when<00:01:19.890> I

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
it actually looked really cool when I

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.999 
it actually looked really cool when I
finished<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.720> okay<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.439> there's<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> satellite

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
finished it okay so there's a satellite

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.910 
finished it okay so there's a satellite
up<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.549> with<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> wire<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:24.869> there's<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
up here with a wire and then there's the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.609 
up here with a wire and then there's the
Arctic<00:01:26.400> face<00:01:26.729> black<00:01:27.390> right<00:01:28.020> there<00:01:28.049> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
Arctic face black right there and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.429 
Arctic face black right there and
there's<00:01:29.490> some<00:01:29.750> solar<00:01:30.750> panels<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.200> here

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
there's some solar panels right here

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.890 
there's some solar panels right here
right<00:01:32.400> here<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.909> take<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.329> down<00:01:33.600> and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
right here you can take this down and

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.960 
right here you can take this down and
there's<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> snowmobile<00:01:34.560> inside<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.220> find<00:01:35.880> that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
there's a snowmobile inside I find that

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.219 
there's a snowmobile inside I find that
really<00:01:36.119> cool<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.600> take<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.869> both<00:01:37.049> sides

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
really cool you can take out both sides

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.200 
really cool you can take out both sides

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
in here there is a research lab where

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.230 
in here there is a research lab where
they<00:01:43.450> get<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.780> research<00:01:44.170> all<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.530> crystals

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
they get to research all the crystals

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.600 
they get to research all the crystals
inside<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.810> ice<00:01:47.130> there's<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.190> conveyor<00:01:48.520> belt

too<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:49.840> can<00:01:49.990> turn<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.200> around<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:54.180> I'm

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
too and you can turn that around so I'm

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.450 
too and you can turn that around so I'm
going<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.479> show<00:01:55.660> you<00:01:55.690> right<00:01:56.200> now<00:01:56.260> what<00:01:56.710> it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
going to show you right now what it

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.780 
going to show you right now what it
looks<00:01:57.640> like<00:01:57.880> inside<00:02:00.000> let<00:02:01.000> me<00:02:01.090> just<00:02:01.270> open<00:02:01.479> this

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.260 

and<00:02:05.320> there<00:02:06.320> you<00:02:07.040> can<00:02:07.190> see<00:02:07.250> what<00:02:07.610> looks<00:02:08.090> like

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
and there you can see what looks like

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.690 
and there you can see what looks like
inside<00:02:08.570> there's<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.200> snowmobile<00:02:09.860> inside<00:02:10.190> and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
inside there's a snowmobile inside and

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.610 
inside there's a snowmobile inside and
if<00:02:10.790> I<00:02:10.910> take<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.270> out<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:12.200> can<00:02:12.380> see<00:02:12.530> that

drinking<00:02:15.110> coffee<00:02:15.560> there's<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.460> conveyer<00:02:16.790> belt

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
drinking coffee there's a conveyer belt

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.450 
drinking coffee there's a conveyer belt
and<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.780> can<00:02:17.930> spin<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:18.320> around<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:19.250> make<00:02:19.430> it

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
and you can spin this around to make it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.440 
and you can spin this around to make it
go<00:02:19.850> in<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:21.440> put<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:22.220> crystals<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:23.000> here

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
go in it you put the crystals in here

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.050 
go in it you put the crystals in here
and<00:02:23.630> they<00:02:23.900> move<00:02:24.140> forward<00:02:24.440> into<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:25.580> white<00:02:25.880> box

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
and they move forward into a white box

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.480 
and they move forward into a white box
alright<00:02:29.060> I'm<00:02:29.240> here<00:02:29.720> with<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.380> treaded<00:02:30.860> drill

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
alright I'm here with the treaded drill

machine this thing has a satellite right

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.630 
machine this thing has a satellite right
here<00:02:34.520> tiny<00:02:35.030> one<00:02:35.270> two<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.890> has<00:02:37.070> two<00:02:37.340> lights

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
here tiny one two and it has two lights

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.100 
here tiny one two and it has two lights
for<00:02:39.070> actually<00:02:40.070> six<00:02:40.610> lights<00:02:41.110> for

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
for actually six lights for

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.950 
for actually six lights for
maneuverability<00:02:42.770> in<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.460> dark<00:02:43.760> these<00:02:44.390> treads

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
maneuverability in the dark these treads

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.290 
maneuverability in the dark these treads
are<00:02:45.410> for<00:02:46.250> treading<00:02:46.730> through<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.030> snow

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
are for treading through the snow

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.450 
are for treading through the snow
because<00:02:47.720> it's<00:02:47.870> really<00:02:48.560> really<00:02:48.890> deep<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
because it's really really deep in the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.960 
because it's really really deep in the
Arctic<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:51.290> also<00:02:51.470> has<00:02:51.800> this<00:02:52.010> drill<00:02:52.430> which<00:02:52.820> I

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
Arctic it also has this drill which I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.390 
Arctic it also has this drill which I
find<00:02:53.210> really<00:02:53.390> cool<00:02:53.810> because<00:02:54.710> then<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.250> can

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
find really cool because then you can

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.970 
find really cool because then you can
just<00:02:55.430> drill<00:02:56.150> right<00:02:56.540> through<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:57.080> ice<00:02:57.230> box

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
just drill right through the ice box

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.770 
just drill right through the ice box
there's<00:02:58.490> also<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.820> little<00:02:59.060> seat<00:02:59.300> here<00:02:59.540> so<00:02:59.720> you

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
there's also a little seat here so you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.750 
there's also a little seat here so you
can<00:02:59.930> control<00:03:00.140> it<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:01.010> guys<00:03:01.190> in<00:03:01.400> here<00:03:01.610> right

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
can control it the guys in here right

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.220 
can control it the guys in here right
now<00:03:01.940> but<00:03:02.270> I<00:03:02.330> guess<00:03:02.570> you<00:03:02.720> could<00:03:02.870> put<00:03:02.959> another

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
now but I guess you could put another

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.330 
now but I guess you could put another
guy<00:03:03.350> right<00:03:03.470> here<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.550> make<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.850> spin<00:03:05.120> around

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
guy right here to make it spin around

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.370 
guy right here to make it spin around
this<00:03:07.340> also<00:03:07.520> has<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:08.300> walkie-talkie<00:03:08.720> right<00:03:09.140> here

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
this also has a walkie-talkie right here

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.340 
this also has a walkie-talkie right here
and<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:10.670> little<00:03:11.140> lion<00:03:12.140> right<00:03:12.830> here<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.930> some

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
and a little lion right here and some

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.800 
and a little lion right here and some
exhaustion<00:03:15.739> right<00:03:16.700> here<00:03:17.020> alright

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
exhaustion right here alright

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.429 
exhaustion right here alright
was<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.790> real<00:03:22.790> machine<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.510> let's<00:03:24.079> move<00:03:24.290> on

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:24.439 
was the real machine and let's move on

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:25.750 
was the real machine and let's move on
to<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.769> next<00:03:24.950> thing
