00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
players overlook some very simple basic

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.189 
players overlook some very simple basic
facts<00:00:14.160> about<00:00:14.340> trying<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.880> play<00:00:15.120> fast<00:00:15.360> they

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
facts about trying to play fast they

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.560 
facts about trying to play fast they
overlook<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.010> actual<00:00:17.460> mechanics<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.210> doing

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
overlook the actual mechanics of doing

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.800 
overlook the actual mechanics of doing
it<00:00:18.750> they<00:00:19.350> think<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.070> ok<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.420> have<00:00:21.600> some

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
it they think that ok I just I have some

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.380 
it they think that ok I just I have some
guitar<00:00:22.140> pick<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.830> my<00:00:23.250> guitar<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.820> I'm

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
guitar pick I have my guitar and I'm

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.990 
guitar pick I have my guitar and I'm
ready<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.779> roll<00:00:24.990> they<00:00:25.920> overlook<00:00:26.460> some<00:00:26.730> very

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
ready to roll they overlook some very

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.120 
ready to roll they overlook some very
basic<00:00:28.340> concepts<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.210> them<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
basic concepts and one of them is a

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.389 
basic concepts and one of them is a
thick<00:00:32.130> pick<00:00:32.579> if<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.750> have<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> thin<00:00:34.890> one<00:00:35.100> it

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
thick pick if you have a thin one it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.410 
thick pick if you have a thin one it
flops<00:00:36.120> around<00:00:36.300> too<00:00:36.719> much<00:00:36.950> so<00:00:37.950> you're<00:00:38.879> missing

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
flops around too much so you're missing

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.490 
flops around too much so you're missing
a<00:00:39.600> few<00:00:39.930> milliseconds<00:00:41.030> when<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> pic<00:00:42.480> bends<00:00:43.350> as

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
a few milliseconds when the pic bends as

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.090 
a few milliseconds when the pic bends as
you<00:00:43.680> pick<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> string<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.680> return<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
you pick a string for it to return to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.580 
you pick a string for it to return to
the<00:00:47.430> straight<00:00:47.730> position<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:49.050> its<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.500> know

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the straight position to its you know

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.950 
the straight position to its you know
original<00:00:50.070> position<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.149> that's<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
original position so that's going to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.560 
original position so that's going to
cost<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> try<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.920> play<00:00:53.239> fast<00:00:54.239> if

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
cost you if you try to play fast if

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.610 
cost you if you try to play fast if
you're<00:00:54.719> trying<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.020> play<00:00:55.370> precisely<00:00:56.370> it's

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
you're trying to play precisely it's

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.130 
you're trying to play precisely it's
just<00:00:58.620> going<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> kind<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.129> mess<00:00:59.250> everything<00:00:59.520> up

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
just going to kind of mess everything up

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.149 
just going to kind of mess everything up
another<00:01:01.140> thing<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:02.809> most<00:01:03.809> players<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:05.010> play

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
another thing is most players that play

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.450 
another thing is most players that play
really<00:01:05.460> fast<00:01:06.049> play<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> very<00:01:07.740> very<00:01:08.070> tip

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
really fast play with the very very tip

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.260 
really fast play with the very very tip
of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.850> pic<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:10.799> reasoning<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.939> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
of the pic and the reasoning is if you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.609 
of the pic and the reasoning is if you
are<00:01:13.460> striking<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> string<00:01:15.229> halfway<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
are striking the string halfway up the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.870 
are striking the string halfway up the
pic<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.420> take<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.990> much<00:01:19.259> longer

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
pic it's going to take that much longer

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.320 
pic it's going to take that much longer
for<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.090> pic<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:22.320> come<00:01:22.710> off<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> string<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
for the pic to come off of the string to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.200 
for the pic to come off of the string to
get<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> string<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.229> vibrate<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.130> thus<00:01:26.369> sound

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
get the string to vibrate and thus sound

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.560 
get the string to vibrate and thus sound
make<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> note<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.909> play<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
make a note so if you play with just the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.600 
make a note so if you play with just the
very<00:01:30.720> very<00:01:31.049> tip<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.590> pic<00:01:31.860> that's<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.430> to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
very very tip of the pic that's going to

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.890 
very very tip of the pic that's going to
help<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.030> immensely<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:34.470> play<00:01:34.680> fast<00:01:35.750> what<00:01:36.750> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
help you immensely to play fast what I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.179 
help you immensely to play fast what I
did<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.740> very<00:01:37.979> simple<00:01:38.340> little<00:01:38.700> mod<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
did is this very simple little mod and

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.550 
did is this very simple little mod and
what<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> did<00:01:41.520> was<00:01:41.549> about<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> quarter<00:01:43.049> inch<00:01:43.079> up

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
what I did was about a quarter inch up

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.139 
what I did was about a quarter inch up
on<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.399> pic<00:01:44.759> i<00:01:45.110> cut<00:01:46.110> two<00:01:46.500> little<00:01:47.040> tiny<00:01:47.430> notches

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
on the pic i cut two little tiny notches

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.789 
on the pic i cut two little tiny notches
on<00:01:48.439> either<00:01:49.439> side<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.460> edge<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.990> what<00:01:52.590> that

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
on either side of the edge and what that

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.480 
on either side of the edge and what that
does<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.759> now<00:01:54.570> ensures<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.829> I'm

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
does is it now ensures that I'm

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.389 
does is it now ensures that I'm
practicing<00:01:57.320> playing<00:01:58.320> with<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.219> very

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
practicing playing with just the very

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.539 
practicing playing with just the very
tip<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.210> pic<00:02:00.710> because<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.040> little<00:02:02.189> notch

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
tip of the pic because this little notch

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.499 
tip of the pic because this little notch
what<00:02:03.329> happens<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:04.020> when<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:06.119> dig<00:02:06.360> in

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
what happens is when you if you dig in

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.900 
what happens is when you if you dig in
to<00:02:06.750> fire<00:02:07.020> into<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> strings

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.470 

the<00:02:11.910> notch<00:02:12.720> catches<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.860> string<00:02:14.480> it's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
the notch catches on the string it's

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.020 
the notch catches on the string it's
pretty<00:02:15.780> much<00:02:16.100> stopped<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.280> deadness<00:02:17.700> tracks

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
pretty much stopped you deadness tracks

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.410 
pretty much stopped you deadness tracks
so<00:02:18.870> if<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.280> you're<00:02:20.460> playing<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
so if you if you're playing in the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.660 
so if you if you're playing in the
little<00:02:22.170> notches<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.800> catching<00:02:23.190> you're

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
little notches of catching you're

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.600 
little notches of catching you're
digging<00:02:24.030> too<00:02:24.240> far<00:02:24.540> into<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.930> strengths<00:02:25.610> this

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
digging too far into the strengths this

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.090 
digging too far into the strengths this
will<00:02:26.910> help<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.660> play<00:02:27.870> with<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.680> tiny

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
will help you to play with just the tiny

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.670 
will help you to play with just the tiny
tiny<00:02:29.550> tip<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.270> pic<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.350> will<00:02:31.500> help

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
tiny tip of the pic and that will help

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.570 
tiny tip of the pic and that will help
you<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.550> play<00:02:32.790> quicker<00:02:33.680> more<00:02:34.680> efficiently<00:02:35.250> and

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
you to play quicker more efficiently and

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.110 
you to play quicker more efficiently and
more<00:02:35.640> precisely<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:37.620> even<00:02:38.040> if<00:02:38.160> speed<00:02:38.910> isn't

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
more precisely so even if speed isn't

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.610 
more precisely so even if speed isn't
your<00:02:39.450> ultimate<00:02:39.959> goal<00:02:40.200> although<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.730> nice

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
your ultimate goal although it is a nice

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.610 
your ultimate goal although it is a nice
little<00:02:43.620> trick<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.310> have<00:02:44.520> in<00:02:44.850> your<00:02:45.150> back<00:02:46.050> pocket

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
little trick to have in your back pocket

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.640 
little trick to have in your back pocket
if<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.700> song<00:02:47.970> or<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.300> situation<00:02:48.930> calls<00:02:49.200> for<00:02:49.380> a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
if the song or the situation calls for a

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.240 
if the song or the situation calls for a
speedy<00:02:50.160> little<00:02:50.310> run<00:02:50.640> but<00:02:51.630> even<00:02:52.500> if<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.830> isn't

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
speedy little run but even if that isn't

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.300 
speedy little run but even if that isn't
your<00:02:53.430> ultimate<00:02:54.000> goal<00:02:54.650> this<00:02:55.650> will<00:02:55.860> help<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.190> to

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
your ultimate goal this will help you to

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.270 
your ultimate goal this will help you to
play<00:02:56.580> more<00:02:57.120> cleanly<00:02:57.540> more<00:02:57.900> precisely<00:02:58.350> more

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
play more cleanly more precisely more

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.690 
play more cleanly more precisely more
efficiently<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.770> I<00:03:01.770> think<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.489> should<00:03:02.640> be

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
efficiently and I think that should be

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.479 
efficiently and I think that should be
the<00:03:02.790> goal<00:03:02.910> for<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.780> know<00:03:03.870> any<00:03:04.080> player<00:03:04.489> so

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
the goal for you know any player so

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.240 
the goal for you know any player so
anyway<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.600> two<00:03:06.810> little<00:03:06.959> notches<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.680> cut

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
anyway the two little notches I cut

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.020 
anyway the two little notches I cut
these<00:03:08.400> notches<00:03:08.700> with<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:10.260> edge<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.640> half

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
these notches with the edge of a half

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.900 
these notches with the edge of a half
round<00:03:12.420> file<00:03:12.980> where<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.130> flat<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.700> one<00:03:14.730> side

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
round file where it's flat on one side

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.449 
round file where it's flat on one side
and<00:03:15.480> then<00:03:15.989> rounded<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.650> other<00:03:16.860> side<00:03:17.160> and

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
and then rounded on the other side and

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.000 
and then rounded on the other side and
you<00:03:18.150> have<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.600> edges<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.290> little<00:03:19.560> sharp

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
you have the edges of that little sharp

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.150 
you have the edges of that little sharp
sort<00:03:20.519> of<00:03:20.640> edge<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.959> just<00:03:22.290> took<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.590> file<00:03:22.860> and

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
sort of edge so I just took the file and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.930 
sort of edge so I just took the file and
a<00:03:23.370> couple<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.180> notches<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:24.690> took<00:03:24.870> seconds<00:03:25.940> I

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
a couple of notches is took seconds I

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.090 
a couple of notches is took seconds I
would<00:03:27.450> not<00:03:27.690> recommend<00:03:27.930> using<00:03:28.530> an<00:03:28.799> exacto

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
would not recommend using an exacto

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.699 
would not recommend using an exacto
knife<00:03:29.489> or<00:03:29.790> razor<00:03:29.820> blade<00:03:30.420> because<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.560> have<00:03:31.650> a

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
knife or razor blade because you have a

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.190 
knife or razor blade because you have a
little<00:03:31.920> tiny<00:03:32.160> hard<00:03:32.700> plastic<00:03:33.299> pick<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:34.049> you

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
little tiny hard plastic pick and you

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.979 
little tiny hard plastic pick and you
try<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.880> kind<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:36.030> Norway<00:03:36.660> at<00:03:36.989> it<00:03:37.230> with<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:38.989> super

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
try to kind of Norway at it with a super

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.490 
try to kind of Norway at it with a super
sharp<00:03:41.930> implement<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.440> can't<00:03:44.250> end<00:03:44.519> well<00:03:45.500> I've

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
sharp implement that can't end well I've

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.030 
sharp implement that can't end well I've
actually<00:03:46.799> had<00:03:47.190> luck<00:03:47.430> doing<00:03:47.850> this<00:03:48.000> using<00:03:48.360> a

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
actually had luck doing this using a

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.000 
actually had luck doing this using a
serrated<00:03:50.040> butter<00:03:50.459> knife<00:03:51.709> certainly<00:03:52.709> it's<00:03:52.860> not

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
serrated butter knife certainly it's not

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.120 
serrated butter knife certainly it's not
sharp<00:03:53.400> but<00:03:54.030> with<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.810> serrations<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.890> can

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
sharp but with the serrations you can

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.870 
sharp but with the serrations you can
kind<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.580> saw<00:03:57.450> little<00:03:58.320> notches<00:03:58.560> in<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.280> course

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
kind of saw little notches in of course

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.670 
kind of saw little notches in of course
just<00:04:00.060> make<00:04:00.269> sure<00:04:00.420> that<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:00.720> get<00:04:00.900> permission

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
just make sure that you get permission

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.800 
just make sure that you get permission
from<00:04:03.350> whoever's<00:04:04.350> in<00:04:04.590> charge<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.400> knives

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
know because it's plastic but still some

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.610 
know because it's plastic but still some
people<00:04:15.120> might<00:04:15.269> not<00:04:15.480> want<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.930> playing<00:04:16.290> around
