that really makes us smell good but the
only<00:04:26.450> problem<00:04:26.900> is<00:04:27.020> with<00:04:27.230> it<00:04:27.470> with<00:04:27.770> the

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
only problem is with it with the

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.340 
only problem is with it with the
lavender<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:29.240> kind<00:04:29.570> of<00:04:29.630> takes<00:04:29.810> away<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.140> smell

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
lavender it kind of takes away the smell

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.540 
lavender it kind of takes away the smell
from<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.560> other<00:04:30.680> flowers<00:04:30.920> which<00:04:31.190> is<00:04:31.340> why<00:04:31.490> you

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
from the other flowers which is why you

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.130 
from the other flowers which is why you
don't<00:04:31.730> need<00:04:31.910> too<00:04:32.030> much<00:04:32.150> lavender<00:04:32.600> when<00:04:33.050> you

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
don't need too much lavender when you

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.300 
don't need too much lavender when you
have<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.410> lavender<00:04:33.590> you're<00:04:33.950> gonna<00:04:34.100> want

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
have the lavender you're gonna want

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.500 
have the lavender you're gonna want
something<00:04:34.520> that's<00:04:34.790> smells<00:04:35.060> really<00:04:35.210> sweet

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
something that's smells really sweet

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.850 
something that's smells really sweet
because<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.930> lavender<00:04:36.320> is<00:04:36.410> more<00:04:36.590> like<00:04:36.770> the

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
because the lavender is more like the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.520 
because the lavender is more like the
minty<00:04:37.220> smell<00:04:37.910> so<00:04:38.210> you<00:04:38.300> can<00:04:38.390> put<00:04:38.810> like<00:04:38.930> loads<00:04:39.410> of

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
minty smell so you can put like loads of

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.590 
minty smell so you can put like loads of
something<00:04:39.860> that<00:04:40.010> smells<00:04:40.400> really<00:04:40.490> like<00:04:42.340> or<00:04:43.600> not

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
something that smells really like or not

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:53.290 
something that smells really like or not
strong<00:04:45.170> like<00:04:45.200> that<00:04:51.130> alright<00:04:52.130> so<00:04:52.580> I<00:04:52.850> think

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
strong like that alright so I think

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:02.220 
strong like that alright so I think
