number 5 is the game I think is a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.470 
number 5 is the game I think is a
brilliant<00:00:22.590> idea<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.130> perhaps<00:00:23.400> lacked<00:00:23.970> proper

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
brilliant idea but perhaps lacked proper

the<00:00:27.269> concept<00:00:27.720> here<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.109> Hitler<00:00:28.289> has

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
the concept here is that Hitler has

the concept here is that Hitler has
decided<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.400> best<00:00:29.609> way<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.820> defeat<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359
