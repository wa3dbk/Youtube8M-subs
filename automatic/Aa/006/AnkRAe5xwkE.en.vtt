you<00:00:00.780> know<00:00:00.840> we<00:00:00.960> hear<00:00:01.110> a<00:00:01.170> lot<00:00:01.350> about<00:00:01.380> an<00:00:01.740> alkaline

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
you know we hear a lot about an alkaline

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.730 
you know we hear a lot about an alkaline
diet<00:00:02.520> what<00:00:02.760> constitutes<00:00:03.629> an<00:00:03.899> alkaline<00:00:04.529> diet

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
diet what constitutes an alkaline diet

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.230 
diet what constitutes an alkaline diet
what<00:00:04.920> are<00:00:04.980> we<00:00:05.069> talking<00:00:05.430> about<00:00:05.490> when<00:00:05.790> we<00:00:05.879> when

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
what are we talking about when we when

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.470 
what are we talking about when we when
we<00:00:06.270> say<00:00:06.540> that<00:00:06.779> well<00:00:07.740> over<00:00:08.519> 30<00:00:08.940> years<00:00:09.210> ago

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
we say that well over 30 years ago

we say that well over 30 years ago
Shelley<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.019> began<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.670> research<00:00:12.469> on

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
Shelley and I began this research on

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.490 
Shelley and I began this research on
determining<00:00:14.280> what<00:00:15.000> foods<00:00:15.240> are<00:00:15.420> alkaline<00:00:15.719> and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
determining what foods are alkaline and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000 
determining what foods are alkaline and
what<00:00:16.680> fluids<00:00:17.310> are<00:00:17.430> alkaline<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:19.680> know<00:00:19.800> I

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
what fluids are alkaline and you know I

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.349 
what fluids are alkaline and you know I
don't<00:00:20.310> know<00:00:20.369> if<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.730> true<00:00:20.939> statement

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
don't know if this is a true statement

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.429 
don't know if this is a true statement
or<00:00:21.390> not<00:00:21.449> but<00:00:21.630> I'm<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.869> say<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.109> anyway

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
or not but I'm going to say it anyway

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.620 
or not but I'm going to say it anyway
because<00:00:22.650> because<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.609> haven't<00:00:23.880> found<00:00:24.330> anything

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
because because I haven't found anything

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.349 
because because I haven't found anything
out<00:00:25.260> there<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.500> would<00:00:25.859> refute<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.910> that

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
out there that would refute this is that

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.630 
out there that would refute this is that
I'm<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.630> only<00:00:27.750> scientist<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> world<00:00:28.920> it's

I'm the only scientist in the world it's

I'm the only scientist in the world it's
literally<00:00:30.090> been<00:00:30.390> studying<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.560> last<00:00:31.619> 30

literally been studying for the last 30

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.330 
literally been studying for the last 30
years<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:33.300> effect<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.989> what<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.620> eat<00:00:34.800> what

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
years the effect of what you eat what

the<00:00:37.680> human<00:00:38.129> blood<00:00:38.870> okay<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.530> my<00:00:40.680> basic<00:00:40.890> theory

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the human blood okay so my basic theory

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.760 
the human blood okay so my basic theory
is<00:00:41.610> one<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> human<00:00:42.989> body<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.320> alkaline

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
is one that the human body is alkaline

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.040 
is one that the human body is alkaline
at<00:00:43.890> its<00:00:44.040> design<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.809> all<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
at its design and to that all the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.479 
at its design and to that all the
functions<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> body<00:00:46.739> are<00:00:46.980> acidic<00:00:47.370> in

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
functions of the body are acidic in

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.150 
functions of the body are acidic in
other<00:00:47.610> words<00:00:47.930> breathing<00:00:48.930> eating<00:00:49.320> thinking

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
other words breathing eating thinking

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.470 
other words breathing eating thinking
can<00:00:50.309> eventually<00:00:50.579> kill<00:00:51.030> us<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.360> don't

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
can eventually kill us if we don't

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.080 
can eventually kill us if we don't
manage<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.260> alkaline<00:00:52.739> design<00:00:53.100> we're<00:00:53.730> born

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
manage that alkaline design we're born

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.819 
manage that alkaline design we're born
in<00:00:54.360> an<00:00:54.449> alkaline<00:00:54.750> state<00:00:55.110> that's<00:00:55.289> why<00:00:55.379> baby

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
in an alkaline state that's why baby

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:56.959 
in an alkaline state that's why baby
smells<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.370> sweet

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
smells so sweet

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.029 
smells so sweet
and<00:00:57.510> when<00:00:57.660> they<00:00:57.780> start<00:00:58.050> feeding<00:00:58.260> baby's<00:00:58.800> food

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and when they start feeding baby's food

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.910 
and when they start feeding baby's food
you<00:00:59.699> know<00:00:59.850> then<00:01:00.210> things<00:01:00.510> start<00:01:00.840> changing<00:01:01.440> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
you know then things start changing you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.490 
you know then things start changing you
know<00:01:02.070> their<00:01:02.430> systems<00:01:03.000> become<00:01:03.510> toxic<00:01:04.229> from<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
know their systems become toxic from the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.990 
know their systems become toxic from the
foods<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> liquids<00:01:05.339> they're<00:01:05.519> drinking

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
foods and the liquids they're drinking

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
foods and the liquids they're drinking
so<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.170> change<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.770> but<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.580> research

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
so we can change that but this research

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.780 
so we can change that but this research
now<00:01:09.150> has<00:01:09.659> been<00:01:09.810> going<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.560> 30<00:01:10.830> years<00:01:11.250> plus

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
now has been going on for 30 years plus

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.210 
now has been going on for 30 years plus
and<00:01:12.180> what<00:01:12.930> I've<00:01:13.080> determined<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.680> specific

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and what I've determined is specific

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.640 
and what I've determined is specific
foods<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.760> are<00:01:15.080> alkalizing<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.259> blood

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
foods that are alkalizing and blood

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.789 
foods that are alkalizing and blood
building<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.479> non<00:01:18.479> congestive<00:01:19.200> high<00:01:19.439> water

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
building and non congestive high water

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.200 
building and non congestive high water
content<00:01:20.130> because<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> lot<00:01:21.180> of

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
content because you can get a lot of

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.420 
content because you can get a lot of
your<00:01:21.450> alkaline<00:01:21.840> fluids<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.380> electrons<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
your alkaline fluids and electrons to

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.100 
your alkaline fluids and electrons to
run<00:01:23.640> your<00:01:23.820> body<00:01:24.030> from<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> foods<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.750> eat<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
run your body from the foods you eat and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.440 
run your body from the foods you eat and
what<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.439> found<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.939> best<00:01:27.119> foods

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
what I have found is this the best foods

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.550 
what I have found is this the best foods
for<00:01:27.630> maintaining<00:01:28.850> extraordinary<00:01:29.900> health<00:01:30.900> and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
for maintaining extraordinary health and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.260 
for maintaining extraordinary health and
that<00:01:31.680> pH<00:01:32.130> I've<00:01:32.490> changed<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> acronym<00:01:34.079> from

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
that pH I've changed the acronym from

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.819 
that pH I've changed the acronym from
potential<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.360> hydrogen<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.110> perfect<00:01:37.619> health

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
potential of hydrogen to perfect health

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.060 
potential of hydrogen to perfect health
so<00:01:38.640> if<00:01:38.759> you're<00:01:38.880> seeking<00:01:39.119> perfect<00:01:39.840> health<00:01:40.079> then

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
so if you're seeking perfect health then

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.310 
so if you're seeking perfect health then
what<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.150> want<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.540> doing<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.960> eating

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
what you want to be doing is eating

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.649 
what you want to be doing is eating
those<00:01:43.590> foods<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.130> will<00:01:44.460> maintain<00:01:45.180> your

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
those foods that will maintain your

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.530 
those foods that will maintain your
alkalinity<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.409> help<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.159> build<00:01:47.310> blood<00:01:47.670> so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
alkalinity and help to build blood so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.940 
alkalinity and help to build blood so
what<00:01:48.689> are<00:01:48.780> those<00:01:48.930> foods<00:01:49.229> they're<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.710> green

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
what are those foods they're the green

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.069 
what are those foods they're the green
foods<00:01:50.399> they're<00:01:51.060> green<00:01:51.329> fruits<00:01:51.659> one<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
foods they're green fruits one of the

blood dope yeah okay with what his own
blood<00:04:20.310> he<00:04:20.609> would<00:04:21.030> take<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.599> liter<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.349> that

blood he would take a liter of that
prior<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.190> his<00:04:23.340> races<00:04:23.849> you<00:04:24.390> don't<00:04:24.570> need<00:04:24.780> a

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
prior to his races you don't need a

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.920 
prior to his races you don't need a
blood<00:04:25.140> doe<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.919> can<00:04:26.070> legally

blood doe you can legally
do<00:04:27.169> this<00:04:27.470> by<00:04:28.400> just<00:04:28.430> moving<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.360> plant-based

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
do this by just moving to a plant-based

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.650 
do this by just moving to a plant-based
organic<00:04:30.530> non-gmo<00:04:31.150> lifestyle<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.330> diet<00:04:32.509> and

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
organic non-gmo lifestyle and diet and

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.490 
organic non-gmo lifestyle and diet and
alkalizing<00:04:33.650> lifestyle<00:04:34.130> my<00:04:35.380> hematocrit<00:04:36.380> is

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
alkalizing lifestyle my hematocrit is

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.790 
alkalizing lifestyle my hematocrit is
52%<00:04:37.660> so<00:04:38.660> it's<00:04:39.050> kind<00:04:39.259> of<00:04:39.289> like<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:39.530> Eveready

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
52% so it's kind of like the Eveready

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.129 
52% so it's kind of like the Eveready
bunny<00:04:40.250> you<00:04:40.550> can<00:04:40.699> keep<00:04:40.850> going<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.449> going<00:04:41.539> and
