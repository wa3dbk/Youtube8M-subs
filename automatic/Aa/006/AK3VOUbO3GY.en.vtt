that makes sense

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.969 
that makes sense

and I think I actually have a gift card

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.760 
and I think I actually have a gift card
that<00:02:43.480> gives<00:02:43.660> him<00:02:43.870> more<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.320> crit<00:02:44.590> chance

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
that gives him more of a crit chance

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.360 
that gives him more of a crit chance
