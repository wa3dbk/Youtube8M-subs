heroes through the extranet if you look

heroes through the extranet if you look
at<00:00:14.459> heroes<00:00:14.760> this<00:00:14.879> format<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.480> mean<00:00:15.600> they<00:00:15.719> always

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:15.959 
at heroes this format I mean they always

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:17.600 
at heroes this format I mean they always
start<00:00:16.200> strong<00:00:16.530> at<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.800> beginning<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.160> formats

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
start strong at the beginning on formats

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.550 
start strong at the beginning on formats
but<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.180> deck<00:00:18.360> is<00:00:18.510> pretty<00:00:18.750> much<00:00:18.930> falling<00:00:19.440> off

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
but the deck is pretty much falling off

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.350 
but the deck is pretty much falling off
the<00:00:19.680> end<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> earth<00:00:20.220> now<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.760> think<00:00:21.060> Heroes

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
the end of the earth now I think Heroes

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.200 
the end of the earth now I think Heroes
is<00:00:21.570> very<00:00:22.470> similar<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.949> gb<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.759> the<00:00:23.880> sense<00:00:24.119> that

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
is very similar to gb in the sense that

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.700 
is very similar to gb in the sense that
it's<00:00:24.509> never<00:00:24.720> going<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.230> completely

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
it's never going to be completely

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.529 
it's never going to be completely
unplayable<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.910> fact<00:00:27.089> I<00:00:27.179> think<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:27.480> more

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
unplayable in fact I think it's more

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.810 
unplayable in fact I think it's more
prevalent<00:00:27.869> than<00:00:28.230> gb<00:00:28.650> because<00:00:29.009> the<00:00:29.460> fact<00:00:29.699> that

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
prevalent than gb because the fact that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.490 
prevalent than gb because the fact that
when<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.150> compare<00:00:30.509> the<00:00:30.660> steps<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.169> two

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
when you compare the steps of the two

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.200 
when you compare the steps of the two
decks<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.919> mean<00:00:32.070> heroes<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.520> better<00:00:32.730> beaters

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
decks I mean heroes that better beaters

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.450 
decks I mean heroes that better beaters
and<00:00:33.480> they<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.350> get<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.710> their<00:00:34.950> really<00:00:35.430> big

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and they can get to their really big

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.780 
and they can get to their really big
boss<00:00:36.150> monsters<00:00:36.870> are<00:00:37.140> fairly<00:00:37.500> easy<00:00:37.860> probably

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
boss monsters are fairly easy probably

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.880 
boss monsters are fairly easy probably
easier<00:00:39.270> than<00:00:39.330> a<00:00:39.540> deck<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:39.810> gb<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.800> it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
easier than a deck like gb can and it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.830 
easier than a deck like gb can and it
opens<00:00:41.310> a<00:00:41.520> little<00:00:41.670> more<00:00:41.880> consistent<00:00:42.450> than<00:00:42.480> gb

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
opens a little more consistent than gb

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.050 
opens a little more consistent than gb
on<00:00:42.960> average<00:00:43.400> one<00:00:44.400> of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.580> things<00:00:44.790> about

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
on average one of the things about

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.630 
on average one of the things about
heroes<00:00:45.540> is<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.830> this<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.010> probably<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
heroes is and this is probably the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
heroes is and this is probably the
biggest<00:00:47.850> problem<00:00:48.420> with<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> debt<00:00:48.870> why<00:00:49.290> did

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
biggest problem with the debt why did

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.840 
biggest problem with the debt why did
that<00:00:49.560> does<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:50.010> some<00:00:50.220> really<00:00:50.520> good

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
that does have some really good

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
deck and that that's that's the biggest

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.270 
deck and that that's that's the biggest

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
sticks that push off a lot of damage but

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.040 
sticks that push off a lot of damage but
the<00:01:43.440> utility<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.760> deck<00:01:44.940> like<00:01:44.970> wind-ups<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
the utility of a deck like wind-ups and

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.020 
the utility of a deck like wind-ups and
rabbit<00:01:46.440> in<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.800> it's<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.460> comparable

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
rabbit in it it's just not comparable

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
rabbit in it it's just not comparable
one<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.630> biggest<00:01:48.780> reasons<00:01:49.260> why<00:01:49.440> macro

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
one of the biggest reasons why macro

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.560 
one of the biggest reasons why macro
rabbits<00:01:50.250> see<00:01:50.400> so<00:01:50.670> much<00:01:50.850> more<00:01:51.060> play<00:01:51.330> than<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
rabbits see so much more play than the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.410 
rabbits see so much more play than the
deck<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.870> heroes<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.729> because<00:01:53.729> when<00:01:54.299> you

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
deck like heroes is because when you

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.450 
deck like heroes is because when you
look<00:01:54.570> at<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> extra<00:01:55.229> deck<00:01:55.380> utility<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> just

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
look at the extra deck utility it just

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.340 
look at the extra deck utility it just
has<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.820> all<00:01:56.940> over<00:01:57.210> heroes<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.630> mean<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.200> can

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
has it all over heroes I mean you can

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
has it all over heroes I mean you can
almost<00:01:58.500> think<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:59.190> macro<00:01:59.729> rabbit<00:02:00.120> in<00:02:00.210> Heroes

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
almost think of macro rabbit in Heroes

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.270 
almost think of macro rabbit in Heroes
is<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.690> same<00:02:00.900> that<00:02:01.140> they're<00:02:01.350> both<00:02:01.530> extreme

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
is the same that they're both extreme

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.520 
is the same that they're both extreme
antimatter<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.510> format<00:02:03.900> but<00:02:04.380> when<00:02:04.500> you

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
antimatter in this format but when you

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.039 
antimatter in this format but when you
look<00:02:04.770> at<00:02:05.010> you<00:02:05.820> look<00:02:06.000> at<00:02:06.090> macro<00:02:06.479> rabbit<00:02:06.869> look

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
look at you look at macro rabbit look

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.630 
look at you look at macro rabbit look
how<00:02:07.140> much<00:02:07.320> utility<00:02:07.650> it<00:02:07.920> gets<00:02:08.190> out<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.549> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
how much utility it gets out of the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.580 
how much utility it gets out of the
extra<00:02:09.000> depth<00:02:09.179> with<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.690> tour<00:02:09.929> guide<00:02:10.140> erratic

now what I've noticed about the UH about
the<00:02:44.800> past<00:02:45.040> set<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.970> past<00:02:46.180> month<00:02:46.300> or<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:46.720> is

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
the past set in the past month or so is

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.240 
the past set in the past month or so is
that<00:02:46.960> he<00:02:47.170> also<00:02:47.350> have<00:02:47.500> actually<00:02:47.860> gotten<00:02:48.040> some

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
that he also have actually gotten some

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.360 
that he also have actually gotten some
really<00:02:48.580> good<00:02:49.140> generic<00:02:50.140> well<00:02:50.410> not<00:02:50.980> Jeanette

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
really good generic well not Jeanette

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.950 
really good generic well not Jeanette
but<00:02:51.670> most<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:52.030> these<00:02:52.090> can<00:02:52.330> be<00:02:52.450> these<00:02:52.600> can<00:02:52.810> all

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
but most of these can be these can all

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.510 
but most of these can be these can all
be<00:02:52.990> made<00:02:53.230> by<00:02:53.410> heroes<00:02:53.710> but<00:02:54.130> he<00:02:54.250> also<00:02:54.400> have

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
be made by heroes but he also have

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.820 
be made by heroes but he also have
gotten<00:02:54.820> some<00:02:55.000> really<00:02:55.270> good<00:02:55.810> rank<00:02:56.230> for<00:02:56.440> seeds

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
gotten some really good rank for seeds

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.290 
gotten some really good rank for seeds
that<00:02:57.010> have<00:02:57.070> come<00:02:57.280> out<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.910> think<00:02:58.180> that

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
that have come out and I think that

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.330 
that have come out and I think that
these<00:02:58.540> are<00:02:58.780> going<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.230> increase<00:02:59.650> you<00:03:00.190> know

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
these are going to increase you know

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.040 
these are going to increase you know
these<00:03:00.550> are<00:03:00.610> going<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.030> increase<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.570> matchups

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
these are going to increase the matchups

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.510 
these are going to increase the matchups
that<00:03:02.110> heroes<00:03:02.500> really<00:03:02.770> struggle<00:03:03.310> with<00:03:03.340> at

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
that heroes really struggle with at

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.070 
that heroes really struggle with at
least<00:03:03.640> it's<00:03:03.850> going<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.090> increase<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.780> winning

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
least it's going to increase the winning

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.140 
least it's going to increase the winning
percentage<00:03:05.500> first<00:03:05.950> let's<00:03:06.130> start<00:03:06.190> with<00:03:06.610> black
