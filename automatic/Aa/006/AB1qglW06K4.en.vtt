you can see that this is owned down to 2

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.269 
you can see that this is owned down to 2
ohms<00:00:29.939> since<00:00:30.810> I'm<00:00:30.960> running<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.439> parallel<00:00:31.980> so

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
ohms since I'm running it in parallel so

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.290 
ohms since I'm running it in parallel so
it's<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.640> 4<00:00:32.910> ohm<00:00:33.059> sub<00:00:33.559> got<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> wired<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.190> parallel

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
it's a 4 ohm sub got a wired in parallel

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.510 
it's a 4 ohm sub got a wired in parallel
as<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.570> diagram<00:00:37.079> shows<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> kicker

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
as this diagram shows this is a kicker

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.709 
as this diagram shows this is a kicker
book<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:43.250> it's<00:00:44.250> parallel<00:00:44.520> wire<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:45.510> see

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
book so it's parallel wire you can see

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.250 
book so it's parallel wire you can see
it<00:00:45.840> says<00:00:46.110> dual<00:00:46.700> 4-ohm<00:00:47.700> voice<00:00:47.910> coil<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.780> equals

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260

to<00:00:49.379> own<00:00:49.860> load<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.969> wired<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> up<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.780> like

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
to own load and I wired it up just like

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.830 
to own load and I wired it up just like
the<00:00:52.110> example<00:00:52.199> shows<00:00:53.270> so<00:00:54.270> we're<00:00:54.570> sitting<00:00:54.750> there

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840

that your wiring is right is you put it

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.480 
that your wiring is right is you put it
on<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:31.640> 200<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:33.680> just<00:01:34.680> put<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> new<00:01:35.040> battery<00:01:35.280> in

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
on on 200 I just put a new battery in

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.620 
on on 200 I just put a new battery in
this<00:01:35.579> thing<00:01:35.640> why<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.210> dead

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
this thing why is it dead

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.069 
this thing why is it dead
put<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.350> home<00:01:37.560> 200<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.520> then<00:01:38.670> put<00:01:39.079> positive

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
put it on home 200 and then put positive

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.740 
put it on home 200 and then put positive
here<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.040> go<00:01:41.189> across<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.299> other<00:01:42.420> coal

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
here and you go across to the other coal

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.929 
here and you go across to the other coal
for<00:01:43.049> negative<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.649> you'd<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> screen

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
for negative and you'd see on the screen

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.200 
for negative and you'd see on the screen
it<00:01:45.060> would<00:01:45.119> say<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> me<00:01:46.170> anyhow<00:01:47.060> that's<00:01:48.060> how

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it would say to me anyhow that's how

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.389 
it would say to me anyhow that's how
you're<00:01:48.420> gonna<00:01:48.509> wire<00:01:48.750> up<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.049> kicker<00:01:49.229> subs<00:01:49.619> you

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
you're gonna wire up the kicker subs you

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.410 
you're gonna wire up the kicker subs you
can<00:01:50.520> see<00:01:50.759> got<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> poly<00:01:51.930> field<00:01:53.149> got<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> two

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
can see got the poly field got the two

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.850 
can see got the poly field got the two
ports<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.229> top

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
ports and the top

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.929 
ports and the top
this<00:01:56.280> box<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.759> separated<00:01:57.450> from<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.590> factory

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
this box is separated from the factory

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.380 
this box is separated from the factory
so<00:02:01.539> you<00:02:01.600> want<00:02:01.929> to<00:02:01.990> pour<00:02:02.200> each<00:02:02.380> side<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:02.979> box

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
so you want to pour each side of the box

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.120 
so you want to pour each side of the box
one<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.539> a<00:02:04.600> half<00:02:04.719> inch<00:02:04.990> wide<00:02:05.170> six<00:02:05.619> inches<00:02:05.920> long

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
one and a half inch wide six inches long

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.559 
one and a half inch wide six inches long
for<00:02:06.539> now<00:02:07.539> we'll<00:02:07.719> wire<00:02:07.899> it<00:02:08.019> up<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:10.420> we'll<00:02:10.539> see

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
for now we'll wire it up and we'll see

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.530 
for now we'll wire it up and we'll see
how<00:02:10.869> this<00:02:10.989> thing<00:02:11.049> bangs
