00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.760 

what's<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:39.020> it<00:00:40.020> gives<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.410> bunch<00:00:40.620> of

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
what's it have it gives you a bunch of

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.830 
what's it have it gives you a bunch of
little<00:00:41.780> ideas<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:43.200> designs<00:00:44.480> on<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:47.719> and<00:00:48.719> then

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
little ideas for designs on it and then

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.810 
little ideas for designs on it and then
again<00:00:49.140> there's<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:50.129> instructions<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
again there's just more instructions I

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.420 
again there's just more instructions I
think<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.629> yeah<00:00:51.809> basically<00:00:52.620> how<00:00:53.010> these<00:00:53.190> pens

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
think so yeah basically how these pens

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:02.470 
think so yeah basically how these pens
work<00:00:54.469> is<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:56.000> know<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.149> could<00:00:57.239> hear<00:00:57.539> it

we'll see how it works alright so I'm

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.999 
we'll see how it works alright so I'm
starting<00:02:08.479> off<00:02:08.599> by<00:02:08.810> painting<00:02:09.080> two<00:02:09.410> coats<00:02:09.739> of

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
starting off by painting two coats of

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.410 
starting off by painting two coats of
CIA's<00:02:10.989> chalkboard<00:02:11.989> paint<00:02:12.319> pot<00:02:13.150> this<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.330> have

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
CIA's chalkboard paint pot this you have

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.000 
CIA's chalkboard paint pot this you have
to<00:02:14.510> be<00:02:14.569> very<00:02:14.599> careful<00:02:15.019> with<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:15.560> try<00:02:15.799> and<00:02:15.860> get

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
to be very careful with and try and get

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.160 
to be very careful with and try and get
it<00:02:16.190> even<00:02:16.610> because<00:02:16.970> it's<00:02:17.150> really<00:02:17.420> easy<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.900> see

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
it even because it's really easy to see

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.289 
it even because it's really easy to see
if<00:02:18.260> it's<00:02:18.410> not<00:02:18.650> even<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.819> dries<00:02:20.030> really

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
if it's not even and it dries really

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.020 
if it's not even and it dries really
quickly<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:21.560> if<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:21.799> go<00:02:21.980> over<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.519> again<00:02:22.610> it'll

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
quickly so if you go over it again it'll

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.610 
quickly so if you go over it again it'll
pretty<00:02:23.390> much<00:02:23.510> just<00:02:23.720> take<00:02:23.989> off<00:02:24.170> what<00:02:24.379> you<00:02:24.470> just

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
pretty much just take off what you just

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.480 
pretty much just take off what you just
put<00:02:24.890> on

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.950 

now<00:02:28.490> i'm<00:02:28.610> using<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.970> nail<00:02:29.180> pens<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.690> create

designs this is my first time actually

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.030 
designs this is my first time actually
using<00:02:32.510> these<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.200> was<00:02:33.320> just<00:02:33.440> testing<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:33.920> out

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
using these so I was just testing it out

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.190 
using these so I was just testing it out
doing<00:02:34.430> pretty<00:02:34.610> random<00:02:35.060> designs<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.750> see<00:02:35.930> how

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
doing pretty random designs to see how

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.090 
doing pretty random designs to see how
they<00:02:36.410> work

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.790 

as<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:43.450> can<00:02:43.570> see<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:44.080> was<00:02:44.290> pretty<00:02:44.530> much<00:02:44.770> a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
as you can see this was pretty much a

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.280 
as you can see this was pretty much a
failure<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.640> zebra<00:02:46.120> print<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:47.080> thing<00:02:47.260> about

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
failure of a zebra print the thing about

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.380 
failure of a zebra print the thing about
these<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:47.740> that<00:02:47.950> they're<00:02:48.370> not<00:02:48.550> pointed<00:02:49.150> at<00:02:49.270> the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
these is that they're not pointed at the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.090 
these is that they're not pointed at the
tips<00:02:49.630> they're<00:02:49.960> not<00:02:50.110> really<00:02:50.320> precise<00:02:50.800> enough

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
tips they're not really precise enough

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.480 
tips they're not really precise enough
to<00:02:51.370> do<00:02:51.520> really<00:02:51.790> fine<00:02:52.150> detailed<00:02:52.840> designs<00:02:56.490> the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
to do really fine detailed designs the

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.590 
to do really fine detailed designs the
cool<00:02:57.700> thing<00:02:57.880> about<00:02:57.910> these<00:02:58.300> is<00:02:58.360> that

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
cool thing about these is that

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.350 
cool thing about these is that
apparently<00:02:59.170> before<00:03:00.070> you<00:03:00.670> put<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.910> top<00:03:01.120> coat

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
apparently before you put the top coat

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.600 
apparently before you put the top coat
on<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.900> could<00:03:02.050> wipe<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.470> marker<00:03:02.830> off<00:03:03.070> with

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
on you could wipe the marker off with

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.760 
on you could wipe the marker off with
just<00:03:03.910> water<00:03:04.150> which<00:03:04.690> was<00:03:04.990> what<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:05.350> was<00:03:05.500> trying

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
just water which was what I was trying

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.620 
just water which was what I was trying
to<00:03:05.830> do<00:03:05.980> there<00:03:06.250> on<00:03:06.460> my<00:03:06.610> failure<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.240> a<00:03:07.330> zebra

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
to do there on my failure of a zebra

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.570 
to do there on my failure of a zebra
nail<00:03:07.810> but<00:03:08.410> for<00:03:08.590> some<00:03:08.740> reason<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.160> white<00:03:09.370> did

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
nail but for some reason the white did

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.910 
nail but for some reason the white did
not<00:03:09.730> wipe<00:03:09.970> off<00:03:10.180> for<00:03:10.450> me<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:11.140> pink<00:03:11.380> came<00:03:11.740> off

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
not wipe off for me the pink came off

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.130 
not wipe off for me the pink came off
really<00:03:12.160> easily<00:03:12.520> though<00:03:12.970> now<00:03:13.630> just<00:03:13.840> putting<00:03:14.080> on

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
really easily though now just putting on

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.320 
really easily though now just putting on
a<00:03:14.200> topcoat<00:03:14.500> that<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.610> came<00:03:15.820> within<00:03:16.030> that

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
a topcoat that it came within that

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:32.320 
a topcoat that it came within that
topcoat<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.080> that's<00:03:17.920> it

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330
