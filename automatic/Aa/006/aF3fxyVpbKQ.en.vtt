00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
update well I'm not really driving it

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.930 
update well I'm not really driving it
I'm<00:00:10.530> sort<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.830> drifting<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.340> because<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.759> rano

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
I'm sort of drifting it because I rano

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.339 
I'm sort of drifting it because I rano
order<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.330> see<00:00:12.450> what<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.719> thing<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:12.960> like<00:00:13.290> if

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
order to see what this thing is like if

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.440 
order to see what this thing is like if
I<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:14.190> know<00:00:14.250> take<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.549> on<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.670> track<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:14.940> try

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
I you know take it on the track and try

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.660 
I you know take it on the track and try
to<00:00:15.509> go<00:00:15.630> sideways<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.430> it's<00:00:17.430> not<00:00:17.550> really

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
to go sideways with it it's not really

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.120 
to go sideways with it it's not really
that<00:00:17.880> bad<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.690> changed<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.470> stock<00:00:19.980> suspension

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
that bad I changed the stock suspension

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.070 
that bad I changed the stock suspension
setup<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.760> something<00:00:21.029> else<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.570> it's<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.050> little

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
setup to something else so it's a little

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.820 
setup to something else so it's a little
bit<00:00:22.260> more<00:00:22.650> easier<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.189> control<00:00:23.660> but<00:00:24.660> it's<00:00:25.080> not

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
bit more easier to control but it's not

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.500 
bit more easier to control but it's not
like<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.519> instantly<00:00:26.880> realize<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.390> this

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
like you instantly realize that this

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.490 
like you instantly realize that this
thing<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.720> not<00:00:27.869> supposed<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.199> go<00:00:28.320> sideways

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
thing is not supposed to go sideways

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.279 
thing is not supposed to go sideways
like<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:28.920> not<00:00:29.150> it's<00:00:30.150> sort<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.689> very

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
like it's not it's sort of like very

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.120 
like it's not it's sort of like very
racing<00:00:31.859> car<00:00:32.070> ish<00:00:32.390> you<00:00:33.390> know<00:00:33.510> when<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.710> take<00:00:34.980> it

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
racing car ish you know when you take it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.350 
racing car ish you know when you take it
out<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.399> want<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> go<00:00:35.760> sideways<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.270> it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
out and you want to go sideways with it

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.049 
out and you want to go sideways with it
it's<00:00:36.570> not<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.750> bad<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.399> actually<00:00:38.670> if

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
it's not that bad but if you actually if

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.220 
it's not that bad but if you actually if
you<00:00:39.149> put<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> little<00:00:39.450> bit<00:00:39.600> more<00:00:39.719> time<00:00:39.840> into<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
you put a little bit more time into the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.750 
you put a little bit more time into the
the<00:00:40.680> suspension<00:00:41.129> stuff<00:00:41.309> like<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.640> could

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the suspension stuff like that you could

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.490 
the suspension stuff like that you could
probably<00:00:42.000> get<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.780> drift<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.350> lot

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
probably get this to the drift a lot

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.190 
probably get this to the drift a lot
easier<00:00:43.620> than<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:45.239> know<00:00:45.360> whatever<00:00:45.960> set

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
easier than then you know whatever set

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.720 
easier than then you know whatever set
up<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.379> used<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.800> video<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.190> literally<00:00:47.610> got

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
up I used in this video I literally got

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.400 
up I used in this video I literally got
this<00:00:48.030> guy<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.750> looked<00:00:48.989> at<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.350> was

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
like hmm i wonder if i can drift this

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.110 
like hmm i wonder if i can drift this
and<00:00:51.809> that's<00:00:52.649> usually<00:00:52.800> my<00:00:53.129> my<00:00:53.820> mentality

drive car like yeah my wonder if i can

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.029 
drive car like yeah my wonder if i can
drift<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.340> yeah<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.449> don't<00:01:00.870> know<00:01:00.930> GT<00:01:01.410> has<00:01:01.770> just

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
drift this yeah I don't know GT has just

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.619 
drift this yeah I don't know GT has just
done<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.460> me<00:01:02.579> since<00:01:02.879> instead<00:01:03.510> of

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
done that to me since instead of

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.350 
done that to me since instead of
drifting<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.110> game<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.820> know<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.119> were

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
drifting in this game so you know I were

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.760 
drifting in this game so you know I were
to<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.930> actually<00:01:07.170> shift<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.470> so

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
to see if I can actually shift this so

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.100 
to see if I can actually shift this so
it<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.189> drift<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.119> possible<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:09.990> you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it can drift it is possible and if you

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.179 
it can drift it is possible and if you
spend<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.500> bit<00:01:10.590> more<00:01:10.740> time<00:01:10.950> than

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
spend a little bit more time than

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.130 
spend a little bit more time than
whatever<00:01:11.430> two<00:01:12.180> minutes<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.689> gave<00:01:12.960> my

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
whatever two minutes that I gave my

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.560 
whatever two minutes that I gave my
suspension<00:01:13.619> setup<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:15.030> will<00:01:15.060> definitely<00:01:15.360> get

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
suspension setup you will definitely get

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.149 
suspension setup you will definitely get
this<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.320> sideways<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.770> little<00:01:16.830> bit<00:01:17.070> better

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
this to go sideways a little bit better

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.630 
this to go sideways a little bit better
than<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.580> net<00:01:18.150> than<00:01:18.689> me<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.340> not

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
than the net than me but it's a it's not

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.789 
than the net than me but it's a it's not
about<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.060> literally<00:01:21.360> got<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> scare<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.140> went

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
about I literally got the scare I went

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.249 
about I literally got the scare I went
and<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.759> did<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.060> seas<00:01:24.270> 11<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> for

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and I I did the seas 11 to get it for

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.530 
and I I did the seas 11 to get it for
free<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.710> then<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.159> what<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.240> changed<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
free and then I what I changed the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.640 
free and then I what I changed the
suspension<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.140> took<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> truck

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
suspension and I took it on the truck

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.050 
suspension and I took it on the truck
and<00:01:28.710> tried<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.189> drift<00:01:29.430> with<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.909> is

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and tried to drift with it so this is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.929 
and tried to drift with it so this is
like<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.900> think<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.310> third<00:01:32.640> lap

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
like I think this is like the third lap

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.670 
like I think this is like the third lap
because<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.450> spun<00:01:33.840> out<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.229> first<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
because I spun out on the first and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.499 
because I spun out on the first and
second<00:01:35.040> lap<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:35.400> actually<00:01:36.030> smell<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.360> like

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
second lap like actually smell like like

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.780 
second lap like actually smell like like
right<00:01:36.540> there<00:01:37.040> as<00:01:38.040> soon<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.490> did<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
right there as soon as I did the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.490 
right there as soon as I did the
transition<00:01:39.270> over<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> other

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
transition over to that to the other

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.140 
transition over to that to the other
corner<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.009> then<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.250> point<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:41.970> for

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
corner and then I just point out for

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.330 
corner and then I just point out for
some<00:01:42.270> reason<00:01:42.509> anyway<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.530> did<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.829> twice<00:01:44.070> as

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
some reason anyway and I did it twice as

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.359 
some reason anyway and I did it twice as
well<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:45.090> there<00:01:45.390> yeah<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.710> not<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> bad<00:01:47.159> if

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
well but there yeah it's not the bad if

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.260 
well but there yeah it's not the bad if
you're<00:01:47.520> gonna<00:01:47.610> go<00:01:47.700> take<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.970> out<00:01:48.060> sideways

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
you're gonna go take it out sideways

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.730 
you're gonna go take it out sideways
it's<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.720> my<00:01:48.840> favorite<00:01:49.020> card<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> drift<00:01:49.590> in

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it's not my favorite card to drift in

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.980 
it's not my favorite card to drift in
obviously<00:01:50.159> however<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.000> really<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:51.810> like

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
obviously however I really really like

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.330 
obviously however I really really like
the<00:01:52.140> way<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.290> thing<00:01:52.560> looks<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.920> love<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.250> way

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it looks I love the way it actually

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.959 
it looks I love the way it actually
drives<00:01:55.079> as<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.860> normal<00:01:56.280> care<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:56.820> an

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
drives as a normal care you know as an

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.080 
drives as a normal care you know as an
actual<00:01:57.380> touring<00:01:58.380> /<00:01:58.680> DTM<00:01:59.219> care<00:01:59.490> which<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.850> what

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
actual touring / DTM care which is what

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.230 
actual touring / DTM care which is what
it's<00:02:00.360> actually<00:02:00.600> supposed<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.259> be<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.969> so<00:02:02.969> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
it's actually supposed to be like so it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.300 
it's actually supposed to be like so it
is<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:04.110> really<00:02:04.439> good<00:02:04.680> when<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.009> when<00:02:05.280> you

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
is really really good when you when you

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.789 
is really really good when you when you
use<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.579> for<00:02:05.759> its<00:02:06.360> actual<00:02:06.869> purpose<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:07.619> what

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
use it for its actual purpose but what

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.050 
use it for its actual purpose but what
are<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.920> take<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.129> up<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.340> drifting<00:02:08.610> again<00:02:08.729> as

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
are you take it up for drifting again as

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.780 
are you take it up for drifting again as
I<00:02:09.179> said<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.899> not<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.590> best<00:02:10.739> best<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.550> crisis

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
I said it's not the best best of crisis

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.710 
I said it's not the best best of crisis
to<00:02:11.849> deal<00:02:11.940> with<00:02:12.270> but

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
to deal with but

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.810 
to deal with but
it's<00:02:14.020> it's<00:02:14.470> very<00:02:14.800> very<00:02:15.130> good<00:02:15.340> if<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.670> can

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
it's it's very very good if you can

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.700 
it's it's very very good if you can
actually<00:02:16.450> add<00:02:16.570> an<00:02:16.930> even<00:02:17.170> better<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.620> on

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
actually add an even better to it on

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.030 
actually add an even better to it on
this<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.130> then<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.640> stock<00:02:19.390> one<00:02:19.620> you'd<00:02:20.620> have

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
this and then the stock one you'd have

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.770 
this and then the stock one you'd have
so<00:02:21.430> much<00:02:21.490> fun<00:02:21.670> driving<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.360> thing<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.720> I

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
so much fun driving this thing and I

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.570 
so much fun driving this thing and I
think<00:02:22.810> it'll<00:02:23.590> get<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> really<00:02:24.130> good<00:02:24.160> time<00:02:24.400> on

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
think it'll get a really good time on

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.680 
think it'll get a really good time on
the<00:02:24.670> track<00:02:24.820> as<00:02:25.000> well<00:02:25.030> one<00:02:25.330> thing<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.510> didn't

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
the track as well one thing I didn't

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.560 
the track as well one thing I didn't
like<00:02:25.720> about<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.470> for<00:02:27.430> drifting<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:28.120> that

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
like about this and for drifting is that

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.030 
like about this and for drifting is that
that<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.140> can't<00:02:29.260> change<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.770> transmission

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
that you can't change the transmission

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.340 
that you can't change the transmission
at<00:02:30.310> all<00:02:30.460> so<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.730> stuck<00:02:31.300> with<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.570> standard

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
at all so you stuck with the standard

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.110 
at all so you stuck with the standard
normal<00:02:32.530> transmission<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:33.940> can't

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
normal transmission that you can't

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.970 
normal transmission that you can't
change<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:35.050> know<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.320> gear<00:02:35.500> ratios<00:02:35.830> or

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
change you know the gear ratios or

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.010 
change you know the gear ratios or
anything<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:37.390> really<00:02:37.660> can't<00:02:37.870> help

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
anything so that you really can't help

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.570 
anything so that you really can't help
yourself<00:02:38.320> with<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.530> but<00:02:38.800> anyway<00:02:39.100> that's

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
yourself with that but anyway that's

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.620 
yourself with that but anyway that's
about<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:39.850> hopefully<00:02:40.210> guys<00:02:40.450> have<00:02:40.570> enjoyed

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
about it hopefully guys have enjoyed

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.790 
about it hopefully guys have enjoyed
