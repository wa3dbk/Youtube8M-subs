what can you say about the game whoa
it's<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.210> rough<00:00:12.389> game<00:00:12.660> well<00:00:12.960> we<00:00:13.320> played<00:00:13.559> pretty

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
it's a rough game well we played pretty

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.560 
it's a rough game well we played pretty
well<00:00:13.889> but<00:00:16.160> the<00:00:17.160> opponent<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.940> prunus<00:00:18.359> they

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
well but the opponent the prunus they

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.170 
well but the opponent the prunus they
were<00:00:18.630> pretty<00:00:18.960> well<00:00:19.050> pretty<00:00:19.920> good<00:00:20.160> also<00:00:20.430> but<00:00:23.180> I

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
were pretty well pretty good also but I

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.509 
were pretty well pretty good also but I
think<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.769> learn<00:00:25.890> how<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.189> play

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
think we we have to learn how to play

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.390 
think we we have to learn how to play
when<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:27.720> leading<00:00:28.170> by<00:00:28.199> one<00:00:28.590> goal<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
when we are leading by one goal at the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.780 
when we are leading by one goal at the
end<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:30.439> but<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.650> good<00:00:31.859> win<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.430> I'm

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
end so but it was a good win but I'm

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.670 
end so but it was a good win but I'm
still<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> little<00:00:33.510> bit<00:00:33.660> disappointed<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.380> we

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
still a little bit disappointed that we

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.090 
still a little bit disappointed that we
didn't<00:00:35.010> get<00:00:35.160> all<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.090> three<00:00:36.329> points<00:00:37.100> describe

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
to nothing so I think that was down the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.620 
to nothing so I think that was down the
bottom<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.920> we<00:01:55.920> talked<00:01:56.219> after<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.969> game<00:01:57.299> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
