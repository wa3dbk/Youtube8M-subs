00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.490
 we are ready to participate in our 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.170
 tournament and to apply what has been learned 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.869
 up to here but what we must now 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.029
 ask us and how to deal with it in cash 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.980
 game a closed game strategy 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.869
 properly mixed with more actions 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.760
 open and considered the strategy 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.010
 optimal because the buy in ones increase 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.789
 never but in tournaments the inexorable increase 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.439
 of the blinds 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.239
 if you want to stay the protagonist you 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.250
 forces to constantly increase the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.079
 your stack ie the number of chips that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.120
 you have to be even more 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.739
 flexible you must always be ready to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.719
 change your game not just for 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.340
 confusing opponents but also for 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.200
 adapt to the various phases of the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.730
 competition 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.629
 however, summarize the various tactics 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.670
 basic game closed and substantially 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.110
 the revival in that tournament 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.750
 that the strategy is considered 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.489
 optimal in cash games few games 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.469
 choosing only starting cards of 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.409
 high quality when you're in the game if 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.150
 often favored avoid dangerous all in 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.369
 unless you are really very much 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.320
 favorite to win the showdown because the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.659
 your basic strategy and survive a 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.240
 all the costs to enjoy the adrenaline of 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.220
 tournament for as long as possible 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.049
 I must say that survive for a long time in a 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.030
 important tournament is really one 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.350
 feeling gratifying especially if 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.350
 you are not yet a great expert 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.380
 if instead you play aggressively you want 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.630
 say that you participate in many more hands from 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.549
 any position you play with any 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.710
 combination of high cards with ace e 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.420
 a low card with connectors and not 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.820
 you care too much about your position at 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.829
 table compared to the button that problem 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.170
 there is with this style you also enjoy 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.700
 the more the problem, however, is why 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.740
 play aggressively and much more 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.570
 difficult to play in a closed way 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.430
 you will find many more hands involved 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.710
 I should make difficult choices on the flop 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.880
 with mediocre points like a pair very much 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.049
 low 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.820
 in other words to play 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.040
 aggressively you have to be very good 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.990
 reading your opponents is very safe 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.700
 in the management of the bets 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.140
 that's why if you are a beginner don't 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.759
 you can afford to adopt this 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.619
 style because it leads you to situations 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.300
 complex in which players more 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.220
 experts 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.420
 they will be able to easily bring you 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.340
 all the chips away 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.740
 on the other hand, however, the aggressive style 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.600
 has many advantages like that 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.560
 to collect more dishes 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.420
 without a fight 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.060
 especially when opponents have cards 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.050
 shoddy and decide to pass 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.910
 regardless of what you have in 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.770
 but no 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.930
 also will force your opponents to 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.970
 difficult readings because if you bet 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.160
 similar with multiple types of different cards 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.080
 they will have fewer points available 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.330
 reference to which to connect yours 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.220
 play creating this image 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.020
 aggressive I could even win big 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.270
 dishes with good cards because 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.280
 opponents will not believe you easily 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.200
 when you bet if you want to play in 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.000
 this way I warn you it will have to be 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.040
 prepared for strong fluctuations of yours 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.160
 stack a bit like being in the mountains 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.380
 what we have seen so far 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.760
 about normal players but 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.250
 be careful because in important tournaments 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.320
 I could find you facing players 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.630
 super aggressive who have the ability 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.700
 to take action to the extreme we are 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.680
 talking about characters like gas hansen e 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.870
 daniel negreanu that super style 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.790
 aggressive they invented and applied it 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.010
 and for this they have become famous and 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.959
 rich opponents like them do not give you 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.239
 truce take advantage of every circumstance 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.130
 to put yourself under pressure and point yourself 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.440
 in the face with any type of paper 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.690
 shows intimidated and they point 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.150
 games closed and they continue to 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.940
 betting your stack is lower you will come 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.920
 attacked is really difficult 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.970
 face them because you are always below 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.470
 pressure 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.060
 and there are also some missing dishes 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.840
 they care too much they put it 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.459
 in account 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.650
 they know they often go to showdown from 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.040
 disadvantaged but how many times they stole i 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.020
 dark 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.910
 how many times the flop really helped 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.950
 their unpredictable cards 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.160
 how many times their bluffs have had 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.630
 success and then how to behave if you 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.200
 find yourself facing one of these 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.930
 players 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.239
 well against a super aggressive yet 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.670
 once the best defense is attack 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.830
 if you have a discreet hand in front of one 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.360
 them bet forget the neck do a 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.459
 nice breath and place a nice raise 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.660
 without blinking if you have one 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.220
 very strong hand 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.739
 then perhaps the right decision is 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.300
 just the col because it is very probable 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.550
 that he will do your job himself 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.459
 that is 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:23.890
 still note you have to learn ad 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.510
 be doomed regardless of yours 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.790
 natural inclination closed or 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.620
 aggressive at the start of each tournament is 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.720
 important that you make a plan of 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.310
 game that will largely depend on 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.570
 goals you ask yourself if you 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.580
 you will simply be content with 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.290
 survive for as long as possible 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.960
 then your plan will be to apply 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.670
 basically the game closed all the 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.590
 first phase of the tournament when the blinds are 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.690
 still relatively little respect 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.210
 to the stages is the amount of chips that 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.650
 you own will play the rule then 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.480
 wait patiently for the moment 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.670
 appropriate to do some double ups 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.830
 or double your stack in the 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.870
 intermediate part to stay on average 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.690
 of chips while in the eventual part 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.430
 final if he gets there he will have to improvise 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.930
 then there are the players who participate 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.570
 to a tournament with the stated objective 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.640
 to place in the respect prize area 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.650
 to mere survival in this case 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.880
 must risk something more 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.280
 possible plan is to play 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.930
 foaming in the early stages when the 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.250
 Most players play closed 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.200
 and he doesn't want to risk it 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.810
 you can continue like this until you are with 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.669
 a stack about three times the average 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.140
 and at this point you will be playing 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.000
 closed when most 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.010
 players will be forced to start 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.690
 take substantial risks for 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.010
 stay abreast 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.810
 if the plan works what you have 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.940
 accumulated you should ferret into the 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.800
 premium area and when I would arrive at 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.520
 decide how to play depending on the 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.800
 circumstances 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.230
 but if you are an aggressive player or 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.210
 super aggressive you won't settle for 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.130
 these goals will aim to win straight 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.380
 the tournament or at least reach the first ones 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.040
 positions and you will take all the risks 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.320
 needed 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.600
 in other words you will play 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.370
 aggressively or super aggressively 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.740
 not just the initial phase but 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.660
 basically the whole tournament and when 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.460
 you will find yourself chipleader at the table or 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.350
 when he will be the first in the ranking for 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.120
 the number of chips will not close you in 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.800
 defense but you will continue to assert the 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.840
 strength of your chips against players 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.640
 who run less than you sure 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.410
 some more risk but if you want 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.180
 winning this is the price to pay 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.040
 the particular moment of the tournament in which 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.580
 super aggressive players give the 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.590
 their best 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.380
 is what is defined in the bubble 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.300
 in the bubble the prize area is rather 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.350
 close and nobody wants to leave it 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.690
 to run away 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.910
 for example there are 27 awards and they are 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.560
 there are 35 players left 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.720
 reasoning that takes almost everyone 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.570
 they only think of resisting entering into 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.580
 27 and they play closed very close are 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.220
 willing to pass hands in situations 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.110
 which they would have raised an hour before 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.330
 this is the moment when the super 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.280
 aggressive shows his true strength e 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.110
 it really attacks without fear 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.870
 constantly raising and stealing i 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.490
 holes make the samples take the 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.400
 best time at the cost of risk 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.320
 elimination on the finish line 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.970
 but one thing is certain whatever is yours 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.039
 whatever the style you have 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.660
 chosen to adopt you will not be able to adopt 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:08.720
 always and only that for a whole tournament 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.830
 the adversaries would notice it 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.520
 would take appropriate countermeasures e 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:16.110
 for you the game would be closed 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.699
 occasionally you will have to vary and you will see 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.990
 that the most important dishes would tend to 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:20.460
 to win them right after these 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.889
 sudden gear changes that 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.419
 they will leave their opponents unprepared 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:26.760
 in fact after you 've consolidated 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:28.830
 a closed player image will steal i 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.360
 blinds and bluffs will succeed 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.310
 after you have shown yourself super 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.110
 aggressive will see you when 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.030
 I would have the best hand thinking that you 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:39.510
 is still playing garbage hands 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:41.010
 when it works it's a great pleasure for you 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.720
 however the task of finding the 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.650
 good time to change style e 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.650
 take the victory home with you
