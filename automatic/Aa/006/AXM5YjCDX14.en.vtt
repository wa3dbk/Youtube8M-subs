00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.180
 international known throughout the world based on raw meat vediam 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.640
 lessons we need for the realization 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.630
 5 tablespoons of chopped parsley 5 tablespoons of red Tropea onion 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.890

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.129

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.740

 therefore we realize if you had it dear tartar 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.540
 from the 3 lemons I made 16 slices that will be used to decorate the dishes + 4 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.380
 spoons of juice topped with capers the onion parsley notarized 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.760
 very small cubes the meat many prefer to grind asthma in this 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.560
 cut way. with the knife the meat is written to many less now let's see how 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.330
 first of all it is necessary to remove the white parts from the thread 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.910
 sometimes wrap it and then cut it into thin slices the slices will go 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.260
 cut into small strips 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.720
 we amalgamate everything 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.700
 to compose the dish we just have to split the meat into 4 equal parts 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.899
 give a hemispherical shape and make a small hollow the center of which 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.899

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:17.939
