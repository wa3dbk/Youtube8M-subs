00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.460
 Cuba is immersed in a process 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.710
 transition of analog television 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.050
 to digital television from the month of 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.180
 June more than 45 thousand homes in the 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.950
 Cuban capital are part of the zone 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.900
 of demonstration where they are made 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.300
 testing transmission and reception 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.070
 digital terrestrial signal to know 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.990
 about the process of implementing the 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.699
 new system on the island a team of 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.260
 Cuba today went to the institute 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.900
 of research and development of 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.790
 telecommunications the ccl one of the 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.830
 entities involved in the process 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.970
 lasseter is the institute of 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.829
 research and development 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.280
 telecommunications of the Ministry of 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.250
 communications and our role within 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.020
 this great digital television project 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.930
 is fundamentally concentrated in the 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.510
 theme of technology assimilation 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.829
 or rather the absorption of 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:03.670
 technology for its later diffusion 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.530
 innovation introduction and innovation with 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 the goal of developing solutions 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.690
 own and pay with them to 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.480
 progressive reach of independence 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.850
 technological 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.360
 right now I am in a stage 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.360
 initial 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.010
 of the multiple re standards 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.600
 envelopes consulting bibliography 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.030
 international as the one 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.000
 replay 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.860
 right now I am using a 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.940
 development card 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.940
 of development of silent are missing 3 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.940
 specifically 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:46.410
 simulation / badness software and the 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.410
 bajeta side is basically 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.020
 as I explained is an initial stage with 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.450
 the objective that in the future the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.060
 design that is to say the internal software of 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.880
 this re multiplexer equipment is 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.909
 own oil a property module 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.880
 intellectual here is one of the 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.399
 equipment that is part of the chain of 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.860
 transmission that is also the one 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.590
 allows is the protagonist that they can 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.230
 multiply several channels like this 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.000
 eight television programs within 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.600
 the same frequency channel within the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.330
 six months 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.130
 but it was not the last one that came out 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.220
 last time you 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:33.230
 that saliva is provoked therefore 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.230
 has corrected a lot the errors of 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.100
 Y 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.510
 what is the European therefore has 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.819
 some schemes 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.189
 of modulation and in coding 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.420
 superiors are presented in the 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.640
 field tests that have been done here 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.810
 in Cuba in other countries such as Venezuela 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.020
 in Latin America and has shown that it 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.040
 plays way several times of 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.950
 rectors, I 'm not working 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.940
 and evaluate the analogical lack of 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.950
 decoder boxes 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.209
 what is the quality you have in class 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.250
 the logic is given the 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.019
 television directly to produce the 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.140
 mountain in this set 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.930
 we have two televisions as you see 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.629
 in one you are watching a program in the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.180
 another one we are seeing a pattern pattern that 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.760
 generates this instrument and with which 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.489
 can measure several parameters that 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.530
 They have television television 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.480
 digital terrestrial is considered the 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.400
 second major revolution in the sector of 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.620
 telecommunications its introduction 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.510
 on the island represents without a doubt 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.670
 countless benefits for 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.860
 inhabitants will allow an improvement in 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.989
 the quality of the reception and will extend the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.880
 offer available in number of channels and 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.880
 system versatility cost 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.100
 the military selection as well has 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.740
 commented or looks good 10 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.740
 the difference is presented with the 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.740
 TV 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.050
 in the case of removing the case the diet 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.520
 always looks good will allow 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.020
 take advantage of the frequency spectrum of 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.780
 our country for the same possibility 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.850
 that this equipment offers 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.230
 and to be able to transmit several programs 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.540
 that we usually know as several 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.730
 television channels 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.460
 of the same frequency channel is going to 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.110
 allow to take advantage of the rest of the 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.390
 frequency space in future 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.640
 services that are going to be offered 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.260
 to the population then and to a point of 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.840
 more technical and related Vista 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.430
 our institute 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.680
 right now this gives us the 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.310
 possibility that 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.650
 next years a quite period 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.720
 we have enough ska we can not have 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.430
 self development as I said 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.320
 previously property modules 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.720
 intellectual characteristic of our country 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.910
 good in the end they will pay without hesitation 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.620
 to the technological independence that is 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.550
 searching 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.110
 in several years 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.190
 the opportunity is point of view 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.630
 professional to have type of 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.310
 vampire these technologies equipment 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.190
 Novelties in the country 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.340
 the professional point of view 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.920
 an immense opportunity to develop 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.140
 continue to overcome the end of the era 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.240
 Analogue is about to arrive Cuban 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.980
 It remains outside the arrival of television 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.240
 digital to the homes of the green alligator 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.240
 it's already near
