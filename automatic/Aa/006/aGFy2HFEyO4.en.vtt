weeks<00:00:27.900> ago<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.640> I<00:00:29.640> had<00:00:30.090> heard<00:00:30.300> about<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.630> Marc

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
weeks ago and I had heard about the Marc

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.870 
weeks ago and I had heard about the Marc
Jacobs<00:00:31.140> foundation<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.550> was<00:00:32.700> debating

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
Jacobs foundation and I was debating

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.630 
Jacobs foundation and I was debating
between<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.899> one<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.680> Chanel<00:00:35.040> Lumiere

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
between that one in the Chanel Lumiere

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.110 
between that one in the Chanel Lumiere
so<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.960> decided<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.559> pick<00:00:37.800> up<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> sample<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
so I decided to pick up a sample of the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.930 
so I decided to pick up a sample of the
gel<00:00:39.329> foundation<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.460> try<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.520> out<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.910> see

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
gel foundation and try it out to see

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.310 
gel foundation and try it out to see
which<00:00:42.180> one<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.840> would<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.079> better

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
which one I think I would like better

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.220 
which one I think I would like better
now<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.670> haven't<00:00:45.210> tried<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.390> Chanel<00:00:45.809> gloomier

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
now I haven't tried this Chanel gloomier

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.840 
now I haven't tried this Chanel gloomier
foundation<00:00:46.800> yet<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.789> will

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
foundation yet but I think I will

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.529 
foundation yet but I think I will
probably<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.750> bit<00:00:48.930> later<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:50.149> as<00:00:51.149> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
probably a little bit later on but as I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.630 
probably a little bit later on but as I
said<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.780> picked<00:00:52.170> up<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> sample<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.250> did<00:00:53.460> it

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
said I picked up the sample and I did it

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.920

few specs that I had on it now when I

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.969 
few specs that I had on it now when I
first<00:01:30.090> applied<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.900> noticed<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.950> was

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
first applied it I noticed that it was

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.450 
first applied it I noticed that it was
light<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.640> medium<00:01:32.790> coverage<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:34.040> that<00:01:35.040> was

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
light to medium coverage and that was

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.090 
light to medium coverage and that was
just<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.140> application<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.829> over<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
just with one application all over the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.330 
just with one application all over the
face<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.509> decided<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.259> another

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
face so I decided to do another

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.520 
face so I decided to do another
application<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:42.150> two<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.750> noticed<00:01:43.200> that

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
application and with two I noticed that

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.190 
application and with two I noticed that
the<00:01:43.799> foundation<00:01:44.310> was<00:01:44.369> very<00:01:44.729> buildable<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.600> had

that<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.209> do<00:02:18.360> like<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.900> Marc<00:02:19.080> Jacobs

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
that I do like the Marc Jacobs

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.770
