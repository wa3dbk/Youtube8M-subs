that's enough time for people to form a

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.269 
that's enough time for people to form a
basic<00:00:21.119> opinion<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.839> device<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.140> know<00:00:22.529> was

basic opinion of the device you know was
it<00:00:23.460> worth<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.640> upgrade<00:00:23.849> or<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.630> features

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
it worth the upgrade or the features

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.310 
it worth the upgrade or the features
good<00:00:25.140> enough<00:00:25.439> whatever<00:00:26.009> so<00:00:26.970> as<00:00:27.210> such<00:00:27.689> cam<00:00:28.109> has

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
up on the site now and it seems like his

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.520 
up on the site now and it seems like his
basic<00:00:33.150> impression<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.900> about<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.500> I

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
basic impression is about what I

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.299 
basic impression is about what I
expected<00:00:35.340> we're<00:00:36.170> serious<00:00:37.170> great<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.829> camera

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
expected we're serious great the camera

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.130 
expected we're serious great the camera
is<00:00:38.340> great<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.449> know<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> device<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
is great it's you know the device is a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.080 
is great it's you know the device is a
little<00:00:40.350> bit<00:00:40.469> faster<00:00:40.620> nothing<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.579> write<00:00:42.030> home

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
little bit faster nothing to write home

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.660 
little bit faster nothing to write home
about<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.570> still<00:00:43.350> cool<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:44.340> overall

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
about but still cool but overall

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.650 
about but still cool but overall
upgrading<00:00:45.420> from<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.660> for<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.230> isn't<00:00:47.010> worth<00:00:47.219> it

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
upgrading from a for it isn't worth it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.410 
upgrading from a for it isn't worth it
people<00:00:48.660> from<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.899> 3g<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.559> 3gs<00:00:49.590> I'd<00:00:50.399> say<00:00:50.760> yes

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
people from a 3g or 3gs I'd say yes

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.240 
people from a 3g or 3gs I'd say yes
probably<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.590> would<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.920> worth<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> upgrade

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
probably it would be worth the upgrade

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.099 
probably it would be worth the upgrade
just<00:00:53.730> because<00:00:53.969> you're<00:00:54.120> jumping<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.899> much

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
just because you're jumping up so much

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.500 
just because you're jumping up so much
in<00:00:55.289> performance<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.160> design<00:00:56.339> and<00:00:56.730> stuff<00:00:56.910> but

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
in performance and design and stuff but

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.389 
in performance and design and stuff but
people<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:57.929> upgrading<00:00:58.440> from<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.679> four-cam

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
people are upgrading from the four-cam

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.610 
people are upgrading from the four-cam
says<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.000> within<00:01:00.179> a<00:01:00.300> few<00:01:00.329> days<00:01:00.660> he<00:01:00.960> didn't

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
says that within a few days he didn't

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.259 
says that within a few days he didn't
even<00:01:01.920> realize<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.280> he<00:01:02.460> was<00:01:02.579> using<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.940> 4s

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
even realize that he was using a 4s

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.119 
even realize that he was using a 4s
anymore<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.070> indistinguishable<00:01:05.070> from

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
anymore it's just indistinguishable from

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.240 
anymore it's just indistinguishable from
the<00:01:05.460> four<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:07.050> know<00:01:07.140> basically<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the four so you know basically it's a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.880 
the four so you know basically it's a
great<00:01:08.430> device<00:01:08.550> but<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> iphone<00:01:10.049> 4<00:01:10.470> now

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
great device but so is the iphone 4 now

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.859 
great device but so is the iphone 4 now
despite<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> iphone<00:01:11.729> 4s<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.360> sort<00:01:12.780> of

despite the iphone 4s is sort of

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.609 
despite the iphone 4s is sort of
lackluster<00:01:13.799> response<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.869> public<00:01:16.259> didn't

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
lackluster response the public didn't

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.319 
lackluster response the public didn't
really<00:01:17.100> seem<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.579> mind<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.090> there<00:01:18.210> weren't

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
really seem to mind that there weren't

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.510 
really seem to mind that there weren't
