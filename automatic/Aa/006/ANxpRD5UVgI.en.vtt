00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that Central Park I didn't know where

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.319 
that Central Park I didn't know where
Central<00:00:41.010> Park<00:00:41.250> was<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.910> looked<00:00:42.120> pretty

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329

walking through that park right now is

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.600 
walking through that park right now is
probably<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.299> their<00:01:15.780> way<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.350> or<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.189> their

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the darkness into the woods now this is

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.969

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
the point in the story where I have to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.910 
the point in the story where I have to
like<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.579> little<00:01:32.729> caveat<00:01:33.420> because<00:01:33.900> when<00:01:34.890> I

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
like have a little caveat because when I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.640 
like have a little caveat because when I
tell<00:01:35.280> gay<00:01:35.549> friends<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.509> story<00:01:37.020> at<00:01:37.350> this

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
point no one blinks an eye but that's

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.940 
point no one blinks an eye but that's
because<00:01:41.479> everyone<00:01:42.479> who's<00:01:42.780> gay<00:01:43.140> either<00:01:43.530> has

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
because everyone who's gay either has

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.770 
because everyone who's gay either has
had<00:01:44.340> hundreds<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.000> anonymous<00:01:45.509> sexual

encounters or has a very good friend who
has<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.439> they're<00:01:49.829> used<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.220> stories<00:01:50.579> like

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
