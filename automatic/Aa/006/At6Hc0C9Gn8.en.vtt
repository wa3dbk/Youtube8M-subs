00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
from what I've heard so far what they

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.480 
from what I've heard so far what they
advertised<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.470> actually<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.979> little

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
advertised is that it actually a little

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.209 
advertised is that it actually a little
better<00:01:56.640> than<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.000> GoPro<00:01:57.770> made<00:01:58.770> chest<00:01:59.040> mount

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
better than the GoPro made chest mount

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.770 
better than the GoPro made chest mount
because<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.490> sits<00:01:59.670> up<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.880> little<00:02:00.000> higher<00:02:00.240> isn't

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
because it sits up a little higher isn't

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.709

just clamping on the side is getting

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.920 
just clamping on the side is getting
your<00:03:45.760> sound<00:03:45.940> buttons<00:03:46.209> but<00:03:46.329> once<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:46.540> position

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
your sound buttons but once you position

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.050 
it right there just not being very smart
there<00:03:50.160> you<00:03:51.160> know<00:03:51.250> it's<00:03:51.370> very<00:03:51.400> easy<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:51.880> use<00:03:52.030> for

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
there you know it's very easy to use for

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.920 
there you know it's very easy to use for
your<00:03:52.450> your<00:03:53.140> camera<00:03:54.390> for<00:03:55.390> example<00:03:55.810> if<00:03:55.900> that

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
your your camera for example if that

opens<00:03:56.250> no<00:03:57.690> holds<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:58.810> right<00:03:58.959> there<00:03:59.250> feels<00:04:00.250> very

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
opens no holds it right there feels very

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.110 
opens no holds it right there feels very
like<00:04:00.700> right<00:04:01.390> now<00:04:02.250> if<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.459> come<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.790> comp<00:04:04.000> were

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
to make sure it is really versatile I'm

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.100 
to make sure it is really versatile I'm
also<00:04:20.560> going<00:04:20.739> to<00:04:20.799> try<00:04:21.010> mounting<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.489> with<00:04:22.060> my

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
also going to try mounting it with my

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.529 
also going to try mounting it with my
old<00:04:23.530> iPod<00:04:23.949> Touch<00:04:24.189> which<00:04:24.400> is<00:04:24.520> will<00:04:25.300> give<00:04:25.419> you

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
old iPod Touch which is will give you

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:26.939 
old iPod Touch which is will give you
roughly<00:04:25.810> an<00:04:25.930> idea<00:04:26.169> of<00:04:26.259> what<00:04:26.409> an<00:04:26.500> iPhone<00:04:26.830> would

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
roughly an idea of what an iPhone would

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.339 
roughly an idea of what an iPhone would
be<00:04:27.099> or<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.669> thinner<00:04:28.000> phone<00:04:28.270> because<00:04:28.539> it's<00:04:28.659> as

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
be or a thinner phone because it's as

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.320 
be or a thinner phone because it's as
you<00:04:29.470> can<00:04:29.590> see<00:04:29.819> definitely<00:04:30.819> thinner<00:04:31.000> than<00:04:31.210> the

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
you can see definitely thinner than the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.800 
you can see definitely thinner than the
s3<00:04:31.539> you<00:04:32.469> know<00:04:33.150> sure<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.539> know<00:04:34.629> it's

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
s3 you know sure you know it's

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.020 
s3 you know sure you know it's
definitely<00:04:35.259> definitely<00:04:35.590> smaller<00:04:36.009> so<00:04:36.699> it<00:04:36.909> also

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
definitely definitely smaller so it also

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.730 
definitely definitely smaller so it also
works<00:04:37.569> very<00:04:37.810> well<00:04:37.900> with<00:04:38.050> this<00:04:38.669> you<00:04:39.669> can<00:04:39.789> see

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
works very well with this you can see

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.279 
works very well with this you can see
holds<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:41.830> very<00:04:42.009> nicely<00:04:42.449> again<00:04:43.449> very<00:04:43.689> secure

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
holds it very nicely again very secure

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.809 
holds it very nicely again very secure
having<00:04:44.949> my<00:04:45.099> hand<00:04:45.310> they're<00:04:45.430> getting<00:04:45.639> nervous

having my hand they're getting nervous

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:49.020 
having my hand they're getting nervous

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
but that's pretty secure guys that's not

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.570 
but that's pretty secure guys that's not
going<00:04:49.210> anywhere<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:50.680> know<00:04:50.770> I<00:04:50.800> mean<00:04:50.979> granted<00:04:51.460> I
