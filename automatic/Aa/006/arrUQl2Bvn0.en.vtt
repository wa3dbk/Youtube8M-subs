can shoot me up on your knees like this

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.589 
can shoot me up on your knees like this
remember<00:00:30.369> Egyptian<00:00:30.910> means<00:00:31.210> you<00:00:31.270> just<00:00:31.390> move

remember Egyptian means you just move

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.390 
remember Egyptian means you just move
the<00:00:31.689> knees<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:32.290> then<00:00:32.890> you<00:00:32.980> could<00:00:33.160> I<00:00:33.190> use<00:00:33.370> your

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
the knees and then you could I use your

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.020 
the knees and then you could I use your
quads<00:00:33.850> and<00:00:34.240> let<00:00:34.540> it<00:00:34.660> really<00:00:35.110> all<00:00:35.320> go<00:00:36.030> without

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
quads and let it really all go without

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.670 
quads and let it really all go without
involving<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:37.720> hip<00:00:38.020> so<00:00:38.140> we<00:00:38.230> don't<00:00:38.410> want<00:00:38.620> you

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
involving the hip so we don't want you

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.840 
involving the hip so we don't want you
to<00:00:38.770> hip<00:00:38.980> up<00:00:39.190> and<00:00:39.310> down<00:00:39.489> so<00:00:39.610> that's<00:00:39.700> the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
to hip up and down so that's the

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.979 
to hip up and down so that's the
Egyptian<00:00:40.180> shimmy<00:00:40.210> but<00:00:40.540> we're<00:00:40.630> gonna<00:00:40.750> try<00:00:40.930> to

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
Egyptian shimmy but we're gonna try to

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.270 
Egyptian shimmy but we're gonna try to
do<00:00:41.110> this<00:00:41.230> later<00:00:41.470> because<00:00:41.770> you<00:00:41.829> can<00:00:42.040> see<00:00:42.160> me

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
do this later because you can see me

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.760 
do this later because you can see me
with<00:00:42.760> a<00:00:42.790> circle<00:00:43.329> okay<00:00:43.720> kind<00:00:44.470> of<00:00:44.530> looks<00:00:44.680> like

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
with a circle okay kind of looks like

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.970 
with a circle okay kind of looks like
this<00:00:48.390> okay<00:00:49.390> so<00:00:49.600> what<00:00:50.110> is<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.290> circle<00:00:50.830> this<00:00:50.920> is

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
this okay so what is a circle this is

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.680 
this okay so what is a circle this is
very<00:00:51.250> important<00:00:51.730> to<00:00:51.820> learn<00:00:51.970> the<00:00:52.240> circle<00:00:52.600> is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
very important to learn the circle is

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.360 
very important to learn the circle is
actually<00:00:52.990> parallel<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.740> the<00:00:53.860> floor<00:00:54.160> that's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
actually parallel to the floor that's

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.560 
actually parallel to the floor that's
what<00:00:54.490> I<00:00:54.520> want<00:00:54.730> you<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:54.880> kind<00:00:55.060> of<00:00:55.150> understand

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
what I want you to kind of understand

what I want you to kind of understand
and<00:00:55.810> it<00:00:56.110> kind<00:00:56.290> of<00:00:56.320> goes<00:00:56.470> like<00:00:56.560> this<00:00:56.830> if<00:00:57.430> you

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
and it kind of goes like this if you

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.440 
and it kind of goes like this if you
imagine<00:00:58.180> this<00:00:58.980> picture<00:01:00.150> it's<00:01:01.150> going<00:01:01.210> to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
imagine this picture it's going to

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.330 
imagine this picture it's going to
mckernon<00:01:01.720> this<00:01:02.050> move<00:01:02.230> weight<00:01:02.800> easier<00:01:03.280> than

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
mckernon this move weight easier than

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.300 
mckernon this move weight easier than
anything<00:01:03.640> else<00:01:03.910> honestly<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.710> very<00:01:06.040> very

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
anything else honestly it's a very very

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.340 
anything else honestly it's a very very
visual<00:01:06.729> move<00:01:06.909> so<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.360> simple<00:01:07.689> start<00:01:07.900> swinging

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
visual move so the simple start swinging

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.109 
visual move so the simple start swinging
your<00:01:08.470> belly<00:01:08.650> button<00:01:08.979> right<00:01:09.220> and<00:01:09.640> then<00:01:09.939> it<00:01:10.000> kind

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
your belly button right and then it kind

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.630 
your belly button right and then it kind
of<00:01:10.150> goes<00:01:10.270> forward<00:01:10.689> and<00:01:10.990> then<00:01:11.350> it<00:01:11.439> goes<00:01:11.560> down

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
of goes forward and then it goes down

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.140 
of goes forward and then it goes down
between<00:01:12.640> your<00:01:12.759> legs

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
between your legs

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.030 
between your legs
and<00:01:13.299> then<00:01:13.570> it<00:01:13.659> comes<00:01:13.840> back<00:01:14.170> up<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:14.799> then<00:01:14.950> it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
and then it comes back up and then it

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.950 
and then it comes back up and then it
goes<00:01:15.159> back<00:01:15.220> in<00:01:15.579> your<00:01:15.700> lower<00:01:15.880> back<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.299> then<00:01:16.840> it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
goes back in your lower back and then it

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.280 
goes back in your lower back and then it
goes<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.200> get<00:01:17.380> from<00:01:17.590> belly<00:01:17.770> button<00:01:18.130> down

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
goes to get from belly button down

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.040 
goes to get from belly button down
forward<00:01:20.340> down<00:01:21.450> forward<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.570> think<00:01:22.630> if<00:01:22.960> you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
forward down forward I think if you

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.570 
forward down forward I think if you
think<00:01:23.110> about<00:01:23.380> that<00:01:23.710> image<00:01:23.890> it's<00:01:24.280> going<00:01:24.310> to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
think about that image it's going to

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.100 
think about that image it's going to
make<00:01:24.730> it<00:01:24.820> so<00:01:25.000> easy<00:01:25.030> so<00:01:25.570> you<00:01:25.600> start<00:01:25.960> with<00:01:25.990> your

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
make it so easy so you start with your

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.960 
make it so easy so you start with your
simple<00:01:26.530> Egyptian<00:01:26.950> shimmy<00:01:26.980> this<00:01:27.550> is<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.790> kind

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
simple Egyptian shimmy this is the kind

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.540 
simple Egyptian shimmy this is the kind
of<00:01:28.000> move<00:01:28.150> obviously<00:01:28.360> when<00:01:28.720> I<00:01:28.750> just<00:01:28.930> decide<00:01:29.550> I'm

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
of move obviously when I just decide I'm

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.740 
of move obviously when I just decide I'm
gonna<00:01:30.670> remember<00:01:30.940> my<00:01:31.210> rule

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
gonna remember my rule

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.390 
gonna remember my rule

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
just a little trick that makes that move

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.240 
just a little trick that makes that move
look<00:02:25.870> actually<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.590> simple<00:02:26.740> look<00:02:27.040> much

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
look actually that simple look much

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.440 
look actually that simple look much
bigger<00:02:27.430> than<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.819> actually<00:02:28.000> is

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
bigger than it actually is

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.420 
bigger than it actually is
