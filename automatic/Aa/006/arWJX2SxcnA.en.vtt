00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.260 
really know what those things
are<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.460> kind<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.670> looks<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:46.729> blue<00:01:47.729> light<00:01:48.030> or

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
are it kind of looks like blue light or

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.990 
are it kind of looks like blue light or
something<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.079> city<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.409> golf<00:01:49.790> which<00:01:50.790> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
something then the city of golf which is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.050 
something then the city of golf which is
also<00:01:51.390> reminiscent<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:52.049> spelunky<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> guess<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
also reminiscent of spelunky I guess the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.359 
also reminiscent of spelunky I guess the
game<00:01:54.210> does<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.689> story<00:01:55.079> your<00:01:55.380> arm<00:01:55.560> even

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
game does have a story your arm even

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.670 
game does have a story your arm even
hawking's<00:01:56.820> which<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.090> an<00:01:57.240> explorer<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.590> is

on this menu button the main menu you

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.530 
on this menu button the main menu you
can<00:03:23.130> put<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.280> timer<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:23.850> can<00:03:24.060> do<00:03:24.150> our<00:03:24.299> time

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
can put a timer so you can do our time

like<00:04:57.729> I<00:04:57.759> said<00:04:57.909> you<00:04:58.180> can't<00:04:58.449> kind<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.780> have<00:04:58.870> to

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
like I said you can't kind of have to

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.270 
like I said you can't kind of have to
understand<00:04:59.349> that<00:04:59.470> if<00:04:59.560> you're<00:04:59.680> not<00:04:59.919> good<00:05:00.250> at

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
understand that if you're not good at

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.149 
understand that if you're not good at
platformers<00:05:01.289> you're<00:05:02.289> not<00:05:02.530> gonna<00:05:02.710> get<00:05:02.919> through

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
platformers you're not gonna get through

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:04.499 
platformers you're not gonna get through
the<00:05:03.370> game<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.699> game<00:05:03.819> is<00:05:03.849> extremely<00:05:04.090> difficult

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509
