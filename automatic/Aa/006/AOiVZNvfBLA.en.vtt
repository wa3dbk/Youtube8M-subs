00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.280
 hello and welcome many here again 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.320
 2013 so have now 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.800
 25 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.730
 almost finished the freedom still had 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.670
 small mistakes 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.560
 Now I've finished the two before 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.189
 the whole bug fixes overworked 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.279
 and years now works great too 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.150
 flawless course here lures you 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.870
 was loaded and no errors so that 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:42.230
 that's five times for the front loader 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.640
 tractor with front loader is the too 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.710
 right and is displayed what appended 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.269
 is that with them now 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.969
 but that's normal because of me 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.370
 receiving 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:55.070
 everything works naturally 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.320
 also to hold the function bale 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.180
 it is actually the original one 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.469
 We have revised the entry above 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.870
 a few hills over it 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.250
 it just looks bigger when it's built 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.720
 and looks a little more stable yes I have 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.450
 it back here already a few bales 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.570
 we will prepare and test it immediately 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.570
 times 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.729
 you also have to pay attention to that 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.119
 coalition in front of the jag also so 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.890
 make sure that you enter more accurately 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:32.509
 that's a bit realistic too 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:35.270
 So we say from the rhine to the 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.630
 stop beautiful it is important that you 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:43.009
 that really nice always pay attention 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.770
 back now we see the ground-solving 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.570
 or hold the example too far 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.590
 it can not be up there that it is not 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.100
 you just come a bit 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.530
 Up and down paint exists were solved 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.649
 so if we pick up now you see 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.969
 She fixes the whole ball and we 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:05.649
 can do what he wanted to stay 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.649
 So we keep staying that way 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:15.450
 to dump so many behind 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.860
 everything stays up now over 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.599
 to argue what is real or not 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.819
 well I would say six bales creates 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.140
 actually normal tugs her 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.330
 you do not have to pay anything 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.040
 Two also goes because he is not 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.390
 flying in why and fly down 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.519
 so you can swim the barrier here 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.099
 could one then just those soon 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:39.299
 I do not have it on it now 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:40.590
 nice back fix so took the 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.560
 bavaria you can let go again 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.079
 drive out of it and the two are beautiful 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.849
 above so I think you can do that too 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.819
 more space for three high for the people 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.650
 Get rid of your train quickly 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.870
 do not want to know how many there 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.819
 it's really just going to happen here 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:06.350
 with so many we look that way 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:12.370
 halfway exactly 1 drive yes yes that 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.370
 drive well then can still so 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.780
 pretty much human, too 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.400
 press like rix 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.290
 the bavaria was attached, I believe 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.090
 they do not demand, or they are ok above 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.400
 yet this is now the time 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:33.800
 do not grow stupid because we do so 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.600
 that we were out of here so press 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.690
 Be the first soft fastened only 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.260
 that's it and you can only be the first one 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.510
 Do what you want to do here 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.680
 Everyone decides for himself whether he is like that 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.030
 a lot or not you can of course 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.800
 also with 1 at the make 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.590
 it's just about that's really 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:04:02.630
 be held yes these are too many 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:07.220
 you can see it again the iks button and 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.520
 theoretically that's what I wanted 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.960
 Not 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.960
 but then we just start now 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.150
 and you can just with one 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.380
 do nothing okay that is not there now 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.380
 We have to refrain at first 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.620
 starts a little resumed 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.410
 so and now it may be that live 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.820
 would not work for this purpose have 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.260
 does not work because I'm still in 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:37.139
 the air in I have to go down 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.800
 go forward a little bit nice 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.400
 to adjust 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.950
 and now it works so it works 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.250
 important that you adapt that to that 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.560
 really works fine 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:56.870
 what could we do again? 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.870
 we do not fly around so pure 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:04.950
 okay that's really all 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:07.680
 We understood that extreme the whole time 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:12.150
 with the input that now looks the 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.860
 your air is now floating okay 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.800
 others have fallen but you can 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.460
 theoretically directly the bavaria 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.700
 bring land to the point of sale 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.700
 just over 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:34.759
 in the sales office business pack and 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.080
 The choice is sold automatically here 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.690
 then important that he presses again 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.620
 so that they are solved then that too 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.500
 stay that way then let's have a look 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.259
 You can see a shop here 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.400
 here's the v2 now it has become 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.050
 actually have nothing more nations 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.240
 I inserted this now because I do not have one 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.770
 Maybe you have names because you 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.139
 someone can take your name place 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.330
 a gaal perhaps therefore a brand of 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:02.780
 normal she has my own hardware store 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.270
 therefore have ore operating costs 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.190
 ten a day and land 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.669
 I could have still barriers purely 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.960
 again derigs says but you can see that 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.659
 There is nothing more to say about it 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.340
 She says I built a structure here 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:18.129
 and another version for the title 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:22.280
 I would also upload later 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:24.560
 So the water is good too 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.500
 far from my ideas of a murder 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.759
 you find on my channel and over 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.039
 Of course I am looking forward to nike or abo 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:33.319
 on you have fun with the place and we 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:36.130
 see us at the next video people 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.130
 See you
