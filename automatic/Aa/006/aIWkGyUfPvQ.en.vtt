00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
then you know or you can just stick a

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.620 
then you know or you can just stick a
knife<00:03:57.489> into<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.000> see<00:03:58.120> if<00:03:58.180> is<00:03:58.239> any<00:03:58.390> blood

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
knife into it and see if is any blood

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.229 
knife into it and see if is any blood
coming<00:03:58.930> out<00:03:59.019> or<00:03:59.230> another<00:04:00.190> way<00:04:00.640> of<00:04:00.670> doing<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.090> is

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
coming out or another way of doing it is

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.309 
coming out or another way of doing it is
to<00:04:01.360> pull<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:02.190> thigh<00:04:03.190> off<00:04:03.579> and<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:05.079> can<00:04:05.170> check

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
to pull the thigh off and you can check

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.580 
to pull the thigh off and you can check
it<00:04:05.440> like<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:06.269> so<00:04:07.269> what<00:04:07.450> I<00:04:07.480> do<00:04:07.599> is<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:07.900> stick

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
it like that so what I do is I stick

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.539 
it like that so what I do is I stick
this<00:04:09.390> thermometer<00:04:10.390> into<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.799> thigh<00:04:12.040> here<00:04:12.370> and

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
this thermometer into the thigh here and

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:22.260 
this thermometer into the thigh here and
I<00:04:12.849> check<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.180> like<00:04:13.299> that<00:04:21.030> which<00:04:22.030> is<00:04:22.180> the

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
I check it like that which is the

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.490 
I check it like that which is the
thickest<00:04:22.630> in<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.870> biggest<00:04:23.110> part<00:04:23.320> of<00:04:23.440> the
