00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
tutorial which the first time we've ever

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.290 
tutorial which the first time we've ever
had<00:00:16.049> one<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.770> game<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.119> actually

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
had one in the game and it actually

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.960 
had one in the game and it actually
doubles<00:00:18.900> as<00:00:19.140> our<00:00:19.289> main<00:00:19.529> menu<00:00:19.980> Brian<00:00:20.369> who's

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
doubles as our main menu Brian who's

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.160 
doubles as our main menu Brian who's
playing<00:00:21.300> back<00:00:21.449> there<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.750> actually<00:00:22.020> hit<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
overlay pops up and so he can access any

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.429 
overlay pops up and so he can access any
area<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> game<00:00:26.789> but<00:00:27.660> he<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.930> collapsing

get<00:00:28.590> right<00:00:28.740> back<00:00:28.920> into<00:00:29.189> our<00:00:29.550> interactive

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
get right back into our interactive

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.179 
get right back into our interactive
tutorial<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.050> now<00:00:31.500> what's<00:00:31.769> cool<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
tutorial and now what's cool and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.090 
tutorial and now what's cool and
different<00:00:32.279> about<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.210> actually

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
different about this is it's actually

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.470 
different about this is it's actually
context-sensitive<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:35.790> he's<00:00:36.210> moving

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
context-sensitive so as he's moving

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.090 
context-sensitive so as he's moving
around<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> ring<00:00:36.809> depending<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:37.770> where<00:00:37.950> he's

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
around the ring depending on where he's

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.560 
around the ring depending on where he's
at<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> new<00:00:38.550> prompt<00:00:38.879> will<00:00:39.030> come<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.360> thats

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
at a new prompt will come up thats

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.869 
at a new prompt will come up thats
related<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.079> where<00:00:40.350> he's<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.790> not

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
related to where he's at so it's not

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.400 
related to where he's at so it's not
your<00:00:42.000> traditional<00:00:42.149> tutorial<00:00:42.870> where<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.110> force

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
your traditional tutorial where we force

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.510 
your traditional tutorial where we force
you<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> walk<00:00:43.800> through<00:00:43.980> kind<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.309> linear

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
you to walk through kind of a linear

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.119 
you to walk through kind of a linear
path<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.780> execute<00:00:46.170> these<00:00:46.289> things<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.770> actually

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
path to execute these things is actually

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.250 
path to execute these things is actually
more<00:00:47.309> exploration<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:48.690> he's<00:00:48.870> moving<00:00:49.110> around

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
more exploration as he's moving around

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.010 
more exploration as he's moving around
the<00:00:49.410> ring<00:00:49.440> inside<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.820> he's<00:00:51.660> see<00:00:51.780> new

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the ring inside and out he's see new

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.410 
the ring inside and out he's see new
tips<00:00:52.320> pop<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> see<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> tip<00:00:53.969> pop<00:00:54.180> up

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
tips pop up so you see a tip pop up

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.229 
tips pop up so you see a tip pop up
Brian<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.440> execute<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.980> tip<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.059> what

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
Brian can execute that tip and then what

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.360 
Brian can execute that tip and then what
happens<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.170> little<00:00:58.559> check<00:00:58.739> mark<00:00:58.949> comes<00:00:59.190> up

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
happens is a little check mark comes up

on you can go ahead and just the AI
setting<00:01:54.960> right<00:01:55.500> now<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.100> dummy

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
setting right now we have it on dummy

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.499 
setting right now we have it on dummy
mode<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.030> do<00:01:57.210> whatever<00:01:57.360> you

different<00:02:00.509> difficulty<00:02:00.960> level<00:02:01.320> settings<00:02:02.009> you

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
different difficulty level settings you

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.429 
different difficulty level settings you
can<00:02:02.159> do<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.399> as<00:02:02.520> well<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.810> momentum<00:02:04.049> if

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
can do that as well and the momentum if

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.870 
can do that as well and the momentum if
you<00:02:04.530> want<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> go<00:02:04.829> ahead<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.340> put<00:02:05.549> onto<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
you want to go ahead and put onto a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.059 
you want to go ahead and put onto a
signature<00:02:06.689> or<00:02:06.840> finish<00:02:07.229> your<00:02:07.380> momentum<00:02:07.799> level

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
signature or finish your momentum level

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.889 
signature or finish your momentum level
so<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.340> practice<00:02:08.550> each<00:02:09.330> superstars

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
so you can practice each superstars

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.180 
so you can practice each superstars
finishing<00:02:10.319> moves<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.649> can<00:02:10.770> do<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.009> as<00:02:11.160> well

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
finishing moves you can do that as well

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.550 
finishing moves you can do that as well
so<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.640> great<00:02:11.879> way<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.090> kind<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.480> practice<00:02:13.410> in

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
so a great way to kind of practice in

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.940 
so a great way to kind of practice in
this

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950
