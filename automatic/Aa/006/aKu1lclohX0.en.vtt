as I close the lid that it is quite a

to break it we have actually done some
three<00:00:27.840> foot<00:00:28.019> drop<00:00:28.230> test<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.769> one<00:00:28.980> so

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
three foot drop test with this one so

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.919 
three foot drop test with this one so
she<00:00:29.279> don't<00:00:29.609> tell<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> HP<00:00:30.179> folks<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.750> does

she don't tell the HP folks but it does

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.260 
she don't tell the HP folks but it does
in<00:00:31.170> fact<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.740> bounce<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.250> does<00:00:32.520> very<00:00:33.030> nicely

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
in fact just bounce it does very nicely

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.569 
in fact just bounce it does very nicely
on<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.630> drop<00:00:33.899> as<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:35.100> see<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.430> got<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
on a drop as you can see it's got a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.100 
on a drop as you can see it's got a
handle<00:00:35.910> across<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.329> back<00:00:36.480> also<00:00:36.840> which<00:00:36.989> is

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
handle across the back also which is

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.270 
handle across the back also which is
great<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> younger<00:00:37.710> kids<00:00:37.860> makes<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
great for the younger kids makes it a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.619 
great for the younger kids makes it a
little<00:00:38.370> easier<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.820> carry<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.210> hopefully

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
little easier to carry and hopefully

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.030 
little easier to carry and hopefully
less<00:00:39.809> likely<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.230> get<00:00:40.410> dropped<00:00:40.649> which<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
less likely to get dropped which is a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.880 
less likely to get dropped which is a
good<00:00:41.250> thing<00:00:41.420> on<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.750> sides<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.649> you'll<00:00:43.800> see

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
good thing on the sides of it you'll see

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.319 
good thing on the sides of it you'll see

haven't<00:01:31.409> had<00:01:31.590> any<00:01:31.799> trouble<00:01:32.130> with<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> Linux

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
haven't had any trouble with the Linux

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.069 
haven't had any trouble with the Linux

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
distribution that we've installed on it

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.960 
distribution that we've installed on it
took<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:35.100> tweaking<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.670> works<00:01:35.850> out

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
took a little tweaking but it works out

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.940 
took a little tweaking but it works out
very<00:01:36.030> nicely<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:37.079> model<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.650> if<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.829> have

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
very nicely on this model so if you have

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.710 
very nicely on this model so if you have
the<00:01:38.070> younger<00:01:38.340> kids<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.790> good<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.329> take

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the younger kids it's a good one to take

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.109 
the younger kids it's a good one to take
a<00:01:39.780> look<00:01:39.869> at<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> real<00:01:41.130> fan<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.700> keyboard

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
a look at not a real fan of the keyboard

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.359 
a look at not a real fan of the keyboard
it<00:01:42.270> feels<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.689> little<00:01:42.810> bit<00:01:42.960> too<00:01:43.229> flat<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.920> with

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it feels a little bit too flat but with

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.469 
it feels a little bit too flat but with
the<00:01:44.490> kids<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:44.880> think<00:01:45.180> they're<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.420> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the kids I don't think they're going to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.510 
the kids I don't think they're going to
really<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.899> problem<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
really have a problem with that so not a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.789 
really have a problem with that so not a
bad<00:01:47.759> model<00:01:48.000> worth<00:01:48.270> considering<00:01:48.869> keep<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.560> mind

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
bad model worth considering keep in mind

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.530 
bad model worth considering keep in mind
the<00:01:49.979> size<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.549> again<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.000> may<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.299> problem

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
the size of it again it may be a problem

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.999 
the size of it again it may be a problem
for<00:01:51.869> some<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.049> your<00:01:52.229> netbook<00:01:52.409> cards<00:01:52.829> but

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
for some of your netbook cards but

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.340 
for some of your netbook cards but
probably<00:01:53.670> not<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.689> keep<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.930> mind<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
probably not so just keep in mind is a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.440 
probably not so just keep in mind is a
little<00:01:55.649> bit<00:01:55.799> larger<00:01:56.130> than<00:01:56.159> typical<00:01:56.700> my

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
little bit larger than typical my

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.030 
little bit larger than typical my
favourite<00:01:57.840> netbook<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.350> these<00:01:58.500> two<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.890> course

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
favourite netbook of these two of course

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.310 
favourite netbook of these two of course
is<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.430> 1103<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> think<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.869> said<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
is the 1103 I think it said just a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.050 
is the 1103 I think it said just a
little<00:02:01.350> bit<00:02:01.619> nicer<00:02:01.799> it's<00:02:02.189> obviously<00:02:02.759> quite<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
little bit nicer it's obviously quite a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.270 
little bit nicer it's obviously quite a
bit<00:02:03.270> smaller<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:04.469> doesn't<00:02:04.740> take<00:02:04.829> up<00:02:04.950> near<00:02:05.159> as

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
bit smaller it doesn't take up near as

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.740 
bit smaller it doesn't take up near as
much<00:02:05.399> space<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.850> feels<00:02:05.880> quite<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> bit<00:02:06.540> lighter

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
much space it feels quite a bit lighter

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.449 
much space it feels quite a bit lighter
as<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.290> see<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.710> very<00:02:07.950> thin<00:02:08.250> by

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
as you can see it is very thin by

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.380 
as you can see it is very thin by
comparison<00:02:08.989> it<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.200> also<00:02:10.530> about<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.950> same

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
comparison it is also about the same

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.750 
comparison it is also about the same
so<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:11.870> can<00:02:12.290> choose<00:02:12.530> between<00:02:12.740> recognized<00:02:13.430> or

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
so you can choose between recognized or

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.050 
so you can choose between recognized or
nicer<00:02:14.450> look<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:15.500> one<00:02:15.709> has<00:02:15.980> standard<00:02:16.760> ports

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
nicer look this one has standard ports

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.750 
nicer look this one has standard ports

keyboard<00:02:50.630> on<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:50.989> 210<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:51.620> one<00:02:51.769> really

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
keyboard on the 210 and this one really

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.020 
keyboard on the 210 and this one really
isn't<00:02:52.130> that<00:02:52.280> it's<00:02:52.489> more<00:02:52.610> like<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.760> little

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
isn't that it's more like a little

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.330 
isn't that it's more like a little
island<00:02:53.209> style<00:02:53.630> kind<00:02:53.840> of<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.959> thing<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:55.130> doesn't

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
island style kind of a thing it doesn't

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.040 
island style kind of a thing it doesn't
feel<00:02:55.580> quite<00:02:55.850> as<00:02:56.090> good<00:02:56.239> but<00:02:56.450> it's<00:02:56.600> not<00:02:56.750> not<00:02:56.989> a

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
feel quite as good but it's not not a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.170 
feel quite as good but it's not not a
bad<00:02:57.320> keyboard<00:02:57.830> one<00:02:58.550> of<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.700> nice<00:02:58.880> things

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
bad keyboard one of the nice things

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.210 
bad keyboard one of the nice things
about<00:02:59.269> this<00:02:59.600> particular<00:03:00.080> model<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.590> you're

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
about this particular model is you're

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.460 
about this particular model is you're
not<00:03:01.370> getting<00:03:01.640> quite<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.970> beefy<00:03:02.350> plastic<00:03:03.350> that

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
not getting quite the beefy plastic that

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.810 
not getting quite the beefy plastic that
you<00:03:03.620> get<00:03:03.739> on<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:03.890> 100e<00:03:04.370> but<00:03:04.550> what<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:04.760> are

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
you get on the 100e but what you are

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.960 
you get on the 100e but what you are
getting<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.300> a<00:03:05.330> 7200<00:03:06.050> RPM<00:03:06.440> 250<00:03:07.310> gig<00:03:07.489> drive<00:03:07.700> for

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
getting is a 7200 RPM 250 gig drive for

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.060 
getting is a 7200 RPM 250 gig drive for
the<00:03:08.060> same<00:03:08.269> basic<00:03:08.630> price<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.110> this<00:03:09.830> model

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
the same basic price and this model

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.009 
the same basic price and this model
seems<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.550> be<00:03:10.700> tweaked<00:03:11.120> up<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.420> little<00:03:11.600> bit<00:03:11.810> for

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
seems to be tweaked up a little bit for

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.020 
seems to be tweaked up a little bit for
performance<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.709> is<00:03:12.940> significantly<00:03:13.940> faster

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
performance it is significantly faster

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.699 
performance it is significantly faster
it<00:03:14.510> feels<00:03:14.780> at<00:03:14.959> least<00:03:15.110> significantly<00:03:15.260> faster

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
it feels at least significantly faster

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.100 
it feels at least significantly faster
than<00:03:15.920> 180<00:03:16.700> I<00:03:16.940> think<00:03:17.239> it<00:03:17.299> may<00:03:17.450> have<00:03:17.600> a<00:03:17.630> lot<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.989> do

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
than 180 I think it may have a lot to do

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.960 
than 180 I think it may have a lot to do
with<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:18.440> hard<00:03:18.709> drive<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.130> just<00:03:19.370> feels<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.820> bit

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
with that hard drive it just feels a bit

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.780 
with that hard drive it just feels a bit
more<00:03:20.180> responsive<00:03:21.160> one<00:03:22.160> of<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.310> nice<00:03:22.489> things

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
more responsive one of the nice things

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.550 
more responsive one of the nice things
about<00:03:22.910> this<00:03:23.239> one<00:03:23.450> as<00:03:23.570> well<00:03:23.750> as<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.079> HP<00:03:24.320> has

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
about this one as well as the HP has

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.199 
about this one as well as the HP has
fixed<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.980> lot<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.400> issues<00:03:25.730> that<00:03:25.760> I've<00:03:25.970> had

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
fixed a lot of the issues that I've had

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.090 
fixed a lot of the issues that I've had
with<00:03:26.390> prior<00:03:26.660> HP<00:03:27.170> netbooks<00:03:27.560> one<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.040> the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
with prior HP netbooks one of the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.830 
with prior HP netbooks one of the
biggest<00:03:28.459> beefs<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.880> ever<00:03:29.030> had<00:03:29.269> was<00:03:29.540> with<00:03:29.780> the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
biggest beefs I ever had was with the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.009 
biggest beefs I ever had was with the
210<00:03:30.739> which<00:03:31.100> had<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.340> battery<00:03:31.700> that<00:03:32.030> popped<00:03:32.840> out

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
210 which had a battery that popped out

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.840 
210 which had a battery that popped out
the<00:03:33.200> back<00:03:33.410> if<00:03:33.680> you'll<00:03:33.829> recall<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.489> the

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
the back if you'll recall and the

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.340 
the back if you'll recall and the
latches<00:03:35.269> were<00:03:35.360> really<00:03:35.660> loose<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.170> what

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
latches were really loose so what

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.110 
latches were really loose so what
happened<00:03:36.709> as<00:03:36.799> kids<00:03:37.040> would<00:03:37.190> grab<00:03:37.430> this<00:03:37.670> battery

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
happened as kids would grab this battery

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.420 
happened as kids would grab this battery
and<00:03:38.360> grab<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.690> netbook<00:03:38.989> by<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.170> battery<00:03:39.620> with

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
and grab the netbook by the battery with

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.130 
and grab the netbook by the battery with
a<00:03:40.700> flipper<00:03:40.910> latch<00:03:41.150> on<00:03:41.450> accident<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.049> they

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
a flipper latch on accident and they

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.199 
a flipper latch on accident and they
skew<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.010> then<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.160> break<00:03:43.549> in<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.790> case<00:03:43.940> on

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
skew it and then a break in the case on

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.789 
skew it and then a break in the case on
the<00:03:44.329> 210<00:03:44.510> this<00:03:45.019> one<00:03:45.170> doesn't<00:03:45.440> suffer<00:03:45.709> from

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
the 210 this one doesn't suffer from

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.949 
the 210 this one doesn't suffer from
that<00:03:46.070> because<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.910> six<00:03:47.120> cell<00:03:47.329> battery<00:03:47.360> is<00:03:47.810> all

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
that because the six cell battery is all

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.539 
that because the six cell battery is all
enclosed<00:03:48.290> as<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.680> can<00:03:48.829> see<00:03:49.010> which<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.220> very

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
enclosed as you can see which is very

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.300 
enclosed as you can see which is very
nice<00:03:49.730> also<00:03:50.630> from<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:51.049> repair<00:03:51.500> perspective<00:03:52.130> and

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
nice also from a repair perspective and

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.039 
nice also from a repair perspective and
