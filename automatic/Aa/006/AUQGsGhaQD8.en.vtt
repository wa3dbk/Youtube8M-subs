00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
the rocket air for well I clean off any

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.039 
the rocket air for well I clean off any
particles<00:02:05.880> because<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.509> just<00:02:06.659> went<00:02:06.899> here

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
particles because if you just went here

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.380

with the microfiber cloth and there was

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.160 
with the microfiber cloth and there was
particles<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.390> here<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.810> may

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
particles on here you may

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.870 
particles on here you may
a scratch<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.800> coating<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.400> lens<00:02:14.610> so

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
a scratch the coating of the lens so

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.309 
a scratch the coating of the lens so
I'll<00:02:15.209> go<00:02:15.390> like<00:02:15.599> this<00:02:15.840> I'll<00:02:16.020> clean<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.470> off<00:02:16.590> or

way so once that's done and all the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.460 
way so once that's done and all the
particles<00:02:24.420> are<00:02:24.720> moved<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.200> it's<00:02:25.290> just

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
particles are moved and it's just

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.589 
particles are moved and it's just
fingerprints<00:02:26.130> left<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.550> take<00:02:27.000> out<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.390> lens

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
fingerprints left I take out the lens

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.930 
fingerprints left I take out the lens
cloth<00:02:28.550> boom<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.480> breathe<00:02:30.810> on<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.260> huh<00:02:32.069> so<00:02:32.819> it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
gets foggy and then I just start from

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.550 
gets foggy and then I just start from
the<00:02:35.970> outside<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.750> doesn't<00:02:36.900> matter<00:02:37.110> where<00:02:37.380> you

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
it is nice and clean that lens is done

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.180 
it is nice and clean that lens is done
but<00:02:45.450> also<00:02:45.660> don't<00:02:46.019> forget<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.410> back<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:47.069> the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
but also don't forget the back of the

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.390 
but also don't forget the back of the
lens<00:02:47.480> also<00:02:48.480> can<00:02:48.780> get<00:02:48.959> fingerprints<00:02:49.769> so<00:02:50.160> same

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
lens also can get fingerprints so same

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.240 
lens also can get fingerprints so same
thing<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.940> use<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.720> use<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.440> canned<00:02:52.680> air<00:02:52.980> I

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
thing I use I use the canned air I

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.770 
thing I use I use the canned air I
breathe<00:02:54.150> on<00:02:54.390> it

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
breathe on it

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.550 
breathe on it

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
and then there's tougher lenses

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.920 
and then there's tougher lenses
sometimes<00:03:01.830> like<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.130> 14<00:03:02.549> to<00:03:02.670> 24<00:03:03.209> there's<00:03:03.840> a

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
lot of glass here so the same thing I'll

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.320 
lot of glass here so the same thing I'll
use<00:03:07.049> my<00:03:07.080> rocket<00:03:07.709> air<00:03:07.920> or<00:03:08.580> I'll<00:03:08.730> use<00:03:08.850> my<00:03:09.030> canned
