00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
recommendation is to be very very

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.039 
recommendation is to be very very
patient<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.189> try<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:45.360> frustrated<00:01:45.420> I

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
patient and try not to get frustrated I

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.649 
patient and try not to get frustrated I
remember<00:01:46.979> when<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.159> was<00:01:47.250> trying<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:48.030> learn<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
remember when I was trying to learn the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.080 
remember when I was trying to learn the
setup<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.189> definitely<00:01:50.189> got<00:01:50.430> frustrated<00:01:50.970> in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
setup I definitely got frustrated in

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.020 
setup I definitely got frustrated in
rage<00:01:51.299> quit<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> couple<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:52.110> times<00:01:52.460> yes<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.670> am<00:01:53.729> I

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
rage quit a couple of times yes I am I

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.600 
rage quit a couple of times yes I am I
rage<00:01:54.420> quit<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.770> bad<00:01:56.159> habit<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.549> mine

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
rage quit it's it's a bad habit of mine

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.440 
rage quit it's it's a bad habit of mine
but<00:01:57.530> but<00:01:58.530> yeah<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.820> said<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.180> got

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
but but yeah I like I said you just got

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.910 
but but yeah I like I said you just got
to<00:02:00.630> be<00:02:00.750> patient<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.350> definitely<00:02:01.770> different

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
to be patient it's definitely different

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.490 
to be patient it's definitely different
from<00:02:02.040> anything<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.490> I've<00:02:02.759> ever<00:02:02.790> played<00:02:03.119> and

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
from anything that I've ever played and

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.170 
from anything that I've ever played and
if<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.649> played<00:02:04.979> with<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.340> red<00:02:05.490> dot<00:02:05.640> sight<00:02:05.939> or

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
if you played with the red dot sight or

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.419 
if you played with the red dot sight or
the<00:02:06.540> ACOG<00:02:06.930> scope<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.799> one<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.979> your<00:02:08.039> snipers

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the ACOG scope for one of your snipers

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.669 
the ACOG scope for one of your snipers
it's<00:02:08.700> definitely<00:02:09.030> different<00:02:09.390> from<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.679> and

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
it's definitely different from that and

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.080 
it's definitely different from that and
i'd<00:02:10.770> say<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.039> actually<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> lot<00:02:11.520> harder<00:02:11.580> than

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
i'd say it's actually a lot harder than

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.920 
i'd say it's actually a lot harder than
using

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
using

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.319 
using
the<00:02:13.930> red<00:02:14.079> dot<00:02:14.230> or<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.620> ACOG<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.640> like<00:02:15.999> anything

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
the red dot or the ACOG so like anything

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:17.699 
the red dot or the ACOG so like anything
in<00:02:16.420> life<00:02:16.450> it's<00:02:16.840> going<00:02:17.019> to<00:02:17.079> take<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.439> no<00:02:17.530> time

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
in life it's going to take you no time

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.649 
in life it's going to take you no time
and<00:02:18.099> practice<00:02:18.219> but<00:02:18.609> when<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:18.939> when<00:02:19.299> you<00:02:19.329> do

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
and practice but when you when you do

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.289 
and practice but when you when you do
dedicate<00:02:20.079> time<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.319> actually<00:02:21.060> getting<00:02:22.060> better

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
dedicate time to actually getting better

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.759 
dedicate time to actually getting better
it's<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:23.049> know<00:02:23.139> of<00:02:23.260> course<00:02:23.379> you're<00:02:23.590> going<00:02:23.709> to

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
it's you know of course you're going to

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.190 
it's you know of course you're going to
get<00:02:23.829> better<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.359> just<00:02:25.359> stick<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.689> it<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:25.959> it's

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
get better so just stick to it and it's

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.080 
get better so just stick to it and it's
definitely<00:02:26.439> worth<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.829> getting<00:02:27.790> back<00:02:27.909> to<00:02:27.999> the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
definitely worth it getting back to the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.110 
definitely worth it getting back to the
gameplay<00:02:28.359> here<00:02:28.930> though<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:30.069> actually<00:02:30.730> killed

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
gameplay here though I actually killed

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.979 
gameplay here though I actually killed
those<00:02:31.269> two<00:02:31.450> guys<00:02:31.599> with<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.959> c-4<00:02:32.489> without<00:02:33.489> even

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
those two guys with the c-4 without even

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.149 
those two guys with the c-4 without even
pressing<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.170> button<00:02:35.439> I<00:02:35.590> guess<00:02:35.799> they<00:02:35.920> threw<00:02:36.129> a

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
pressing the button I guess they threw a

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.039 
pressing the button I guess they threw a
grenade<00:02:36.310> or<00:02:36.489> something<00:02:36.939> and<00:02:37.239> get<00:02:37.840> themselves

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
grenade or something and get themselves

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.159 
grenade or something and get themselves
killed<00:02:38.379> which<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:38.829> a<00:02:38.859> which<00:02:39.639> is<00:02:39.790> cool<00:02:39.939> as<00:02:40.359> for

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:41.169 
killed which is a which is cool as for

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.170 
killed which is a which is cool as for
the<00:02:41.290> gameplay<00:02:41.799> I<00:02:42.010> must<00:02:42.489> say<00:02:42.669> that<00:02:42.819> it<00:02:42.939> has<00:02:43.030> been

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
the gameplay I must say that it has been

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.750 
the gameplay I must say that it has been
absolute<00:02:43.719> blast<00:02:43.989> to<00:02:44.230> try<00:02:44.469> to<00:02:44.530> learn<00:02:44.829> and<00:02:45.430> just

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
absolute blast to try to learn and just

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
lot of fun and that's one of the reasons

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.050 
lot of fun and that's one of the reasons
why<00:03:20.829> I<00:03:20.859> play<00:03:21.069> video<00:03:21.310> games<00:03:21.519> so<00:03:21.790> that's

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
why I play video games so that's

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.490 
why I play video games so that's
definitely<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.629> plus<00:03:22.870> for<00:03:23.169> me<00:03:23.229> and<00:03:23.409> then

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
definitely a plus for me and then

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.429 
definitely a plus for me and then
definitely<00:03:23.979> reason<00:03:24.370> for<00:03:24.609> me<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.509> pursue<00:03:25.930> this

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:26.439 
definitely reason for me to pursue this

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.580 
definitely reason for me to pursue this
class<00:03:27.099> setup<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.750> this<00:03:29.109> next<00:03:29.319> clip<00:03:29.530> is

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
class setup so this next clip is

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.289 
class setup so this next clip is
probably<00:03:29.949> my<00:03:30.159> favorite<00:03:30.189> clip<00:03:30.699> out<00:03:30.879> of<00:03:31.030> the
