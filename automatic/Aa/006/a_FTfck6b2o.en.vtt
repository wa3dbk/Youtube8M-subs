00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.529 
didn't really think that I was going to
build<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> deck<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> mean<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.150> didn't<00:00:21.359> count<00:00:21.480> a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
build the deck I mean I didn't count a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.939 
build the deck I mean I didn't count a
play<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.960> player<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> back<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.769> little

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
play that I player on the back a little

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.300 
play that I player on the back a little
bit<00:00:23.130> Michael<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:24.060> really<00:00:24.330> fun<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:26.070> when

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
bit Michael I was really fun I but when

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.339 
bit Michael I was really fun I but when
canada<00:00:26.910> i<00:00:26.939> went<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> watch<00:00:27.390> assume<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.199> was

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
canada i went to watch assume that was

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.529 
canada i went to watch assume that was
dead<00:00:28.529> didn't<00:00:28.830> really<00:00:28.980> give<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.220> any<00:00:29.369> thought

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
dead didn't really give it any thought

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.250 
dead didn't really give it any thought
but<00:00:30.539> then<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:31.109> don't<00:00:31.740> watch<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.070> felt<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.669> I

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
but then I don't watch I felt like I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.290 
but then I don't watch I felt like I
feel<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:34.350> giving<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> deck<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.130> chance<00:00:35.969> to

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
feel like giving the deck a chance to

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.910 
feel like giving the deck a chance to
see<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.510> if<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.840> Eamon<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.500> still<00:00:37.800> be

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
see that if it Eamon can still be

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.340 
see that if it Eamon can still be
competitive<00:00:38.399> or<00:00:38.489> not<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.690> my<00:00:39.750> testing

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
competitive or not and in my testing

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.080 
competitive or not and in my testing
it's<00:00:40.649> actually<00:00:41.070> worked<00:00:41.309> out<00:00:41.460> pretty<00:00:41.670> well<00:00:41.820> i

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
it's actually worked out pretty well i

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.790 
it's actually worked out pretty well i
will<00:00:42.270> give<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.570> guys<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.320> glaring

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
will give you guys the one that glaring

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.459 
will give you guys the one that glaring
weakness<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> deck<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.660> if<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.170> do

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
weakness to the deck is that if you do

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.360 
weakness to the deck is that if you do
not<00:00:46.680> get<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.039> count<00:00:47.460> down<00:00:47.700> or<00:00:48.260> Sark<00:00:49.370> before

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
not get to count down or Sark before

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.790 
not get to count down or Sark before
year<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.180> see<00:00:52.050> me<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.320> don't<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
year and see me if you don't get to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860 
year and see me if you don't get to
count<00:00:53.190> down<00:00:53.370> before<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.090> 10<00:00:54.390> cards

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
count down before do you have 10 cards

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.900 
count down before do you have 10 cards
left<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.410> your<00:00:55.530> deck<00:00:55.590> clearly<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.670> lose

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
left in your deck clearly you lose

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.310 
left in your deck clearly you lose
because<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> deck<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.870> very<00:00:58.109> one-dimensional

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
because the deck is very one-dimensional

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.920 
because the deck is very one-dimensional
now<00:00:58.949> except<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.000> lava<00:01:00.180> go<00:01:00.359> i'm<00:01:00.480> off<00:01:00.600> ago<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
now except for lava go i'm off ago and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.150 
now except for lava go i'm off ago and
could<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.079> your<00:01:01.199> alternate<00:01:01.590> wind<00:01:01.739> condition

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
could be your alternate wind condition

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.009 
could be your alternate wind condition
but<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.520> don't<00:01:03.329> know<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.570> only<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.930> off

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
but I don't know you only get it off

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.299 
but I don't know you only get it off
like<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.409> only<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:04.860> long<00:01:04.949> gone<00:01:05.159> like

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
like the only one with long gone like

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.410 
like the only one with long gone like
twenty<00:01:05.549> percent<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.970> time<00:01:06.119> thirty

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
twenty percent of the time thirty

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.170 
twenty percent of the time thirty
percent<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> time<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.950> that's<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> next

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
percent of the time so that's the next

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.740 
percent of the time so that's the next
one<00:01:09.390> glaring<00:01:09.600> weakness<00:01:10.549> but<00:01:11.549> that's<00:01:12.510> about<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
one glaring weakness but that's about it

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.570 
one glaring weakness but that's about it
open<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> back<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.619> cuz<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:14.100> another<00:01:14.400> deck

open the back that I cuz of another deck

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.830 
open the back that I cuz of another deck
is<00:01:14.729> actually<00:01:14.970> still<00:01:15.119> pretty<00:01:15.360> solid<00:01:15.689> my

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
is actually still pretty solid my

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
opinion so we're gonna go in the main on

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.499 
opinion so we're gonna go in the main on
the<00:01:18.570> side<00:01:18.810> no<00:01:19.080> explain<00:01:19.790> how<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> person<00:01:21.360> better

a<00:01:30.180> magic<00:01:30.479> mapped<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.810> was<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.020> know<00:01:31.079> what

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
a magic mapped I was it you know what

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.929 
a magic mapped I was it you know what
 it<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.829> design<00:01:32.070> looks<00:01:32.189> cool<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.670> want<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
 it the design looks cool I want to

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.609 
 it the design looks cool I want to
get<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.570> grabbed<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:35.150> zoom<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
get it so I grabbed it so zoom in and I

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.469 
get it so I grabbed it so zoom in and I
will<00:01:37.799> start<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> profile<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.700> first

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
will start with the profile so first

more<00:05:10.220> time<00:05:10.460> on<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.669> stack<00:05:10.880> in<00:05:11.000> a<00:05:11.030> backup<00:05:11.300> I

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
more time on the stack in a backup I

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.500 
more time on the stack in a backup I
really<00:05:12.289> do<00:05:12.380> feel<00:05:12.410> this<00:05:12.710> deck<00:05:12.919> is<00:05:13.100> still<00:05:13.669> okay

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
it's not amazing it's very very linear

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.969 
it's not amazing it's very very linear
for<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:17.300> fact<00:05:17.479> that<00:05:17.539> if<00:05:17.690> you<00:05:17.780> don't<00:05:17.930> draw<00:05:18.289> the

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
for the fact that if you don't draw the

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.920 
for the fact that if you don't draw the
countdown<00:05:19.490> before<00:05:19.760> you<00:05:20.030> have<00:05:20.120> ten<00:05:20.360> cards<00:05:20.660> in

your<00:05:21.020> deck<00:05:21.080> or<00:05:21.500> if<00:05:21.590> you<00:05:21.710> have<00:05:21.800> ten<00:05:22.070> cards<00:05:22.280> in

your deck or if you have ten cards in
your<00:05:22.490> deck<00:05:22.550> you<00:05:23.180> need<00:05:23.360> to<00:05:23.450> rely<00:05:23.660> on<00:05:23.690> lava<00:05:24.020> golem
