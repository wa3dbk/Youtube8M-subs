00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.670 
sure so this is the typical box fan that
we<00:01:47.820> all<00:01:48.000> grew<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.329> right<00:01:48.509> absolutely<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
we all grew up with right absolutely and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.010 
we all grew up with right absolutely and
that's<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.950> lab<00:01:50.360> powerful<00:01:51.360> fan<00:01:51.659> where<00:01:51.899> it's

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that's a lab powerful fan where it's

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.690 
that's a lab powerful fan where it's
gonna<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.290> throwing<00:01:52.530> tons<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.130> air<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.430> one

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
gonna be throwing tons of air in one

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.179 
gonna be throwing tons of air in one
single<00:01:54.180> direction<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:55.560> know<00:01:55.649> we've<00:01:55.950> all<00:01:56.159> been

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
single direction you know we've all been

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.340 
single direction you know we've all been
there<00:01:56.520> where<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:57.090> get<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> blast<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.899> air<00:01:58.079> your

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
there where you get a blast of air your

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.170 
there where you get a blast of air your
hair's<00:01:58.680> blowing<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.250> your<00:01:59.399> own<00:01:59.520> house

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
hair's blowing in your own house

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.060 
hair's blowing in your own house
but<00:02:00.540> then<00:02:00.720> we<00:02:00.900> moved<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.590> evolved<00:02:02.040> to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
but then we moved on and we evolved to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.460 
but then we moved on and we evolved to
an<00:02:02.370> oscillating<00:02:03.120> fan<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.750> that's<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.230> really

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
an oscillating fan and that's a really

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.530 
an oscillating fan and that's a really
nice<00:02:04.680> feature<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.580> oftentimes<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.360> very

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
nice feature but oftentimes it's very

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.620 
nice feature but oftentimes it's very
loud<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.410> get<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:09.270> know<00:02:09.360> air

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
loud and you get the you know air

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.840 
loud and you get the you know air
movement<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.259> then<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.679> goes<00:02:10.800> away<00:02:10.979> but<00:02:11.640> what

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
movement and then it goes away but what

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.700 
movement and then it goes away but what
we<00:02:11.970> want<00:02:12.180> with<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.840> what<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.140> gives<00:02:13.500> us

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
we want with this and what the gives us

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.850 
we want with this and what the gives us
homes<00:02:14.370> gives<00:02:14.700> us<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.150> an<00:02:15.450> air<00:02:15.720> circulator<00:02:16.590> and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
homes gives us is an air circulator and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.470 
homes gives us is an air circulator and
we're<00:02:17.130> showing<00:02:17.310> some<00:02:17.610> bubbles<00:02:18.000> here<00:02:18.240> because

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
we're showing some bubbles here because

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.570 
we're showing some bubbles here because
it's<00:02:19.020> all<00:02:19.200> about<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:19.620> ratcheting<00:02:20.250> this

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
it's all about this ratcheting this

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.640 
it's all about this ratcheting this
rotating<00:02:21.180> grill<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.780> what's<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.380> nice<00:02:22.590> about

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
rotating grill and what's so nice about

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.160 
rotating grill and what's so nice about
that<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.490> as<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:24.180> turns<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.810> front

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
that is that as this turns on the front

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.350 
that is that as this turns on the front
of<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.410> front<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.550> fan<00:02:26.730> it's<00:02:27.150> going<00:02:27.300> to

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
of the front of the fan it's going to

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.240 
of the front of the fan it's going to
help<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.690> move<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.050> air<00:02:28.200> all<00:02:28.470> around<00:02:29.040> so

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
help to move the air all around so

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.949
