level<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.770> demo<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.490> was<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> little

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
level up in the demo it was a little

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.450 
level up in the demo it was a little
hard<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.180> find<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.450> part<00:01:27.690> of<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.840> though<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.770> in

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
hard to find a part of you though but in

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.860 
hard to find a part of you though but in
any<00:01:29.640> other<00:01:29.850> world<00:01:30.060> I'd<00:01:30.300> probably<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.660> lot

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
any other world I'd probably a lot

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.730 
any other world I'd probably a lot
easier<00:01:35.270> from<00:01:36.270> level<00:01:36.600> 50<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> weight<00:01:37.620> of

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
easier from level 50 all the weight of

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.220 
easier from level 50 all the weight of
55<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.730> if<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.390> wish<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.750> could<00:01:39.840> even<00:01:39.960> go<00:01:40.170> to

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
55 and if you wish you could even go to

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.110 
55 and if you wish you could even go to
over<00:01:40.590> 60<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.330> wouldn't<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.590> didn't

over 60 but I wouldn't and I didn't

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.730 
over 60 but I wouldn't and I didn't
because<00:01:45.120> it<00:01:45.270> gets<00:01:45.600> really<00:01:45.840> boring<00:01:46.080> trading<00:01:46.590> on

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
because it gets really boring trading on

want<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.459> go<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.580> luda<00:02:19.819> grim<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:21.080> regret

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
want to go to luda grim but I regret

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.259 
want to go to luda grim but I regret
that<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.040> shouldn't<00:02:22.340> burnt<00:02:22.610> there<00:02:22.790> was<00:02:22.819> a<00:02:23.030> lot

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
that I shouldn't burnt there was a lot

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.350 
that I shouldn't burnt there was a lot
faster<00:02:23.750> experience<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.640> like<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> map

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
faster experience and I like the map

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.979 
faster experience and I like the map
better<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:29.140> from<00:02:30.140> oval<00:02:30.610> 60-62<00:02:31.720> turnout<00:02:32.720> robo

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
better to from oval 60-62 turnout robo

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.710 
better to from oval 60-62 turnout robo
so<00:02:33.430> that's<00:02:34.430> why<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.730> would<00:02:35.090> recommend<00:02:35.420> just

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
so that's why I would recommend just

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.119 
so that's why I would recommend just
coming<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:35.989> robust<00:02:36.260> cuz<00:02:36.440> you're<00:02:36.590> gonna<00:02:36.680> come

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
coming to robust cuz you're gonna come

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:43.559 
coming to robust cuz you're gonna come
here<00:02:37.310> anyways<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.760> train<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.690> might<00:02:39.440> as<00:02:39.590> well
