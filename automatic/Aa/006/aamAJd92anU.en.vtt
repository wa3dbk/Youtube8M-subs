 I know a new one is in October, let's say 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.389
 like this 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.490
 although I have already made some videos 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.990
 had never done with flights anywhere 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.810
 neither video nor anything 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.470

 I've never heard of anything like that. 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.769
 until after some friends of mine 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.809

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.969

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:48.899
 better and youtube 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.520

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.260
 October 4th 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.290
 I have not purchased by the drawee 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.659
 while I will not be able to make games 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.820
 online but I will make a career 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.430
 I'm going to do a whole season of 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.400
 career called with you with whom 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:20.820
 on the field the channel and let's start now 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.799
 already created a player I already have 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:31.290
 another career created because the game is 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:36.560
 obvious and already have idea of what to do two 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.560
 goals reddot 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:12.709
 the number is going to be the number is going to be 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.709
 possible 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:24.050
 four days to December 31 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.790
 right right 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.610
 3.6 grange will play with whoever logo 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.110
 legend right opined 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:41.880
 With this man, but she will stay. 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.140
 with your chances of getting off at 205 okay 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.740
 I think it's more or less what you're 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.440
 Come in and teaching is a game that 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.600
 I went well and did not like dogs that 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.610
 they do not see that the interb a 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.380
 but who put the goal conceded not only 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.590
 because it 's the most talked about that I do not like 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.010
 but that the rights of these ready 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.010
 things 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:24.540
 luck does not want either a book 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:35.480
 normal for coac coloron and a 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:35.480
 bracelet to white and I will put and two eps 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:49.970
 2010 is not border sales 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:13.260
 it is normal to last last very well 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.489
 near the last cup in 2000 at xgen 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.750
 change the southeast stays with this malls 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.940
 I think I think I'll leave it. 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.650
 so conquer this from the case 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.130
 And now you're running like you. 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.210
 like to steal first to buy 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.870
 here things 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.240
 the kobe braynt therefore currents 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.979
 happens big is that I think they opt for 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.840
 cyclone 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.389
 even because there are no debtors I think 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.830
 the cycle is good 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:44.639
 now I'll leave it a little is that the 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.729
 I play and talk a little more with you 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.319
 I think I think this or that 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:54.389
 Contrary to what most people say 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:55.470
 this is very different from the 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.240
 plate 3 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.949
 contrary to what many people say is a lot 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.509
 people if they mark tribes I notice that 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.300
 because the name of the plate 3 if a fan 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.190
 city ​​has now become much more 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.190
 difficult 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.740
 by the way I go to the other side that is 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:15.419
 Great Field Base Making Launches 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.940
 free and not to be tempted child 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.500
 was in the winter of the plate 3 got a 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.000
 triumph I'm going to pay taxes and not be 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.120
 told that the dogs were named 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.819
 cover 13 and edit on the 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:31.070
 my player was determined to drop 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:33.720
 of fifa and so ready but won the 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:40.979
 Thursday in itu had already created this 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:42.599
 smell the stir and now I think it's already 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.490
 much more that it is in high and physical 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.870
 although I did not send a thing 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.380
 Something they helped said they had 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.940
 seriously a fact that is that the 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.050
 goals seem to form a barrier 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.270
 When are you leaving? 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.889
 I mean, I do not know how to ball in the 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.050
 second also a barrier forces 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.300
 for August so I do not leave 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.430
 It's one thing I do not know what 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.830
 Happens but happens is a case 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.690
 however the stretches of lenses are 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.490
 back to what show fell so that the 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:13.560
 video is that we will try I will not try 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.250
 have a good performance so that video and 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.250
 by now
