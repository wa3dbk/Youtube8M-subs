Turkey and that's what you're looking at
here<00:00:23.869> these<00:00:24.869> are<00:00:25.050> ancient<00:00:25.619> ancient<00:00:25.830> tracks

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
here these are ancient ancient tracks

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.480 
here these are ancient ancient tracks
that<00:00:27.840> no<00:00:28.109> doubt<00:00:28.349> are<00:00:28.529> thousands<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.070> years<00:00:29.220> old

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
that no doubt are thousands of years old

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.200 
that no doubt are thousands of years old
some<00:00:30.090> say<00:00:30.740> potentially<00:00:31.740> millions<00:00:32.279> now<00:00:33.090> as

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
some say potentially millions now as

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.020 
some say potentially millions now as
crazy<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.750> sounds<00:00:34.579> when<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.610> look<00:00:35.910> at

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
crazy as that sounds when you look at

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.060 
crazy as that sounds when you look at
these<00:00:36.180> tracks<00:00:36.480> there's<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.440> lot<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.829> evidence

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
these tracks there's a lot of evidence

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.840 
these tracks there's a lot of evidence
that<00:00:39.110> these<00:00:40.110> tracks<00:00:40.500> were<00:00:40.710> indeed<00:00:41.280> made<00:00:41.610> by

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
that these tracks were indeed made by

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.619 
that these tracks were indeed made by
vehicles<00:00:42.620> not<00:00:43.620> by<00:00:43.829> irrigation<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
vehicles not by irrigation and the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.600 
vehicles not by irrigation and the
reason<00:00:46.110> being<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.500> because<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.070> also<00:00:47.219> see

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
reason being is because you can also see

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.049 
reason being is because you can also see
the<00:00:47.760> scrape<00:00:48.090> marks<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:50.039> side<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.610> these

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the scrape marks on the side as these

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.819 
the scrape marks on the side as these
vehicles<00:00:51.390> try<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> make<00:00:52.140> their<00:00:52.350> way<00:00:52.500> through

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
vehicles try to make their way through

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.069 
vehicles try to make their way through
here<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.879> they're<00:00:54.120> saying<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.449> when<00:00:54.960> these

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
here now they're saying that when these

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.950 
here now they're saying that when these
tracks<00:00:55.410> were<00:00:55.620> originally<00:00:56.250> formed<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.690> rock

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
tracks were originally formed the rock

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.599 
tracks were originally formed the rock
was<00:00:58.890> much<00:00:59.219> softer<00:01:00.559> that's<00:01:01.559> how<00:01:01.800> long<00:01:02.070> ago<00:01:02.100> this

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
was much softer that's how long ago this

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.840 
was much softer that's how long ago this
was<00:01:03.350> now<00:01:04.350> these<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.769> all<00:01:04.949> theories<00:01:05.489> because

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
was now these are all theories because

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.570 
was now these are all theories because
no<00:01:06.570> scientist<00:01:07.200> has<00:01:07.290> come<00:01:07.619> out<00:01:07.830> or<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.369> don't

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
no scientist has come out or I don't

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.730 
no scientist has come out or I don't
believe<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.150> going<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> come<00:01:09.570> out<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.049> put<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
believe is going to come out and put a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.590 
believe is going to come out and put a
