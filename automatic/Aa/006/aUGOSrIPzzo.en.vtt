00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.590
 the second part of my video tutorials for our 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.890
 I apologize more precisely for what 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.310
 very late for some drugs 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.340
 fixes just the screen came 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.910
 so today i will tell 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.190
 a little paralyzed i will tell the most that 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.670
 neither is the easiest way to 24 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.670
 the scale 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:46.090
 sorry 118 the simplest way 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:52.970
 it's just that I'm not easier out of the car 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:55.240
 pulled moving 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.240
 there is 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:05.330
 now let her look for untwist 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.960
 showed load here are missing 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.090
 engine 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.090
 like three wolves now microscope 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.939
 left . 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:45.920
 and the latter can be different than 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.430
 team bypass chevrolet corvette 1990 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.430
 Year of release 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:56.530
 Urals open or 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.200
 only make up not 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.700
 well as you know here turn around 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.060
 so we are on wheels doctor nipples wheels 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.060
 wives 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.900
 did not try 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.810
 must be own just before i 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.810
 I will have a bite nippers 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.310
 now do 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.459
 you have 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.780
 This is my dear s. now there is 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.060
 This line on which I hold my finger 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.280
 put on repeating account to be quiet 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.400
 started talking about 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:11.040
 on this rack we just have to 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:13.680
 bend and get something like this 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.640
 I donâ€™t know the rack 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.640
 a great connection has been lit since I am now 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.150
 I will wear the wheel and show clearly how you 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.150
 here sometime 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.670
 they are very simple 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.380
 here's the collapse you see how 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.640
 now tell you all the same with the fire 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:43.540
 this method is very simple 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.540
 I do not know I'm not the personal but not seen 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.769
 show on 4 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:56.330
 and this is your wheel you will need it 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:04:00.260
 matches or lighter as a cat is 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.910
 we light this design match 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.410
 Now I was going to show you what I would do. 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.410
 on my hands 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.629
 I 'll hold my dinner with my finger 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:17.010
 just got ready already then I will 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.010
 keep so familiar 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.709
 wait for the match 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.360
 and just below the same place where to solder 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.099
 read will appear 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.099
 you just and heat up if I'm afraid 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.110
 you played 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.470
 heats up now hold on until our 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.680
 machine tool 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.100
 so we got 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.100
 collapse 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:56.030
 wheels wospac there food from the forest is not 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:59.050
 strive to headquarters same clarified 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.050
 because things do not know 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:10.080
 24 scale 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.740
 it should be on wheels 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.740
 brake disk 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.840
 screwdriver to a more comfortable sky 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.240
 here he is a brake disk she is a girl 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.819
 shows 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:28.370
 he won't let the wheel go up 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.370
 up and my model therefore drives 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:36.330
 now we just dress all four 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:45.259
 wheels on the places and at us power 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:45.259
 camber of the top rack of all will stand 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:54.870
 You see a finger show. 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.289
 you just debug them so i broke it off 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.009
 me 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:01.440
 just to get in here called evil 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.930
 here too were small stands I broke them off 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.229
 just broken off she keeps all the wheels off 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.750
 me in all seriousness keeps sheets of 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:14.000

 show it we collect everything in the same manner 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.990
 put the engine there if you have it 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.759
 Well, since I will redo more 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.389
