00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hi here on the blog of the ge 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.529
 Today's video was a suggestion that a 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.150
 very reader who left us here 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.190
 comments asking me to do it 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.150
 some videos and with tourists with 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.520
 cooking things like apron the glove and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.039
 these things I thought I had idea 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.460
 I liked it, but it's not in my 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.350
 plans to make it so fast but 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.080
 side of here also of a person 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.109
 talking in my ear and it's 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.940
 Because it was good in the tournament for me and there. 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.399
 These days I went to an hour of 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.530
 to decide on an independent super- 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.570
 by the way I love it when the attendants 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.899
 are attentive because I think this 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.500
 deference then sweet lady showed me 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.410
 a very cool thing and I think it's a 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.629
 100% cotton fabric already came in a way 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.270
 In other words, all the drawings were already 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.579
 only I cut and sew it said it is 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.570
 supercommunity and this then has several 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.870
 prints 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.090
 here I have 65 centimeters of fabric and 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.700
 was around 12 reais 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.770
 and look how nice opic on the side of the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.619
 front already has a straight - laced format 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.229
 apron already has squid or part of 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.479
 front of the back is the ribbons that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.240
 will hold on the environmental waistline and here 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.479
 in the part of the neck and still come the tips 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.080
 how best to ride and I found the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.119
 Wonderful idea is very cool toe 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.520
 There's still a pocket here for you. 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.170
 put forward in the mental tuper Ãºltil 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.150
 for those who are learning to sew 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.890
 is starting to venture into the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.140
 sewing machine and if you do not 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.689
 find this fabric already with the drawings 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.670
 I'll leave it here on the bank. 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.860
 information all the measurements you 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.299
 to cut another tissue if 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.549
 Do you want to do too? 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.829
 so I hope you like it a lot 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.100
 remembering that in this video I'm going to do the 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.659
 apron and glove still have a part 2 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.659
 these things that tourists from 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.509
 You cook because my mother's beautiful. 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.310
 wanting a jerk to finish and not 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.100
 I think it's cool to share with you. 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.799
 Because you already asked me and asked for 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.640
 You order it then that's what it says 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.640
 Let's mature 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.490
 we will use the tricoline fabric one 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.650
 another detained by fire and I will use 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.480
 the crystal plastic which is optional 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.819
 so we put one over the other 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.800
 for those who already remember the three together 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.510
 I'll leave this feeling I say 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.120
 culture is left for finish 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.520
 more beautiful then it 's just us 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.520
 move all sides and trim 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.170
 already will take advantage to cut 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.269
 other pieces too and you can cut 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.709
 all the reds in the drawing that the works of 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.709
 culture are already included 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.060
 charged this rectangle and another one 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.500
 what can you make a dishcloth and a 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.930
 coffee wipe 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.239
 then show you how it was 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.549
 Let's start the assembly by the pocket 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.159
 so we'll bend an inch 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.019
 from all the sides and we will pass this 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:23.879
 will make our culture fic 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.879
 more perfect when sewing 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.810
 Let's have a seam in the two 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.330
 sides and bottom and I then 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:04:02.430
 that to pass another stitch well yields 1 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:04:04.920
 pp point now we will work with Rica 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.470
 the two largest will be the neck and 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.630
 the two smaller ones on the sides at the waist 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.700
 of the neck let's put one on the 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.400
 other right on right and let's 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.070
 and to the side ciranda and 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.950
 I cut a little bit of the people so that 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.320
 they get harder and there we go 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.470
 will pinch too and we'll sew 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.050
 and we all spend an itch in 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.140
 three sides leaving some to sew 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.020
 So we can untap them afterwards. 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:38.300
 They're going to stay like this, let's go through a seam. 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.300
 good yields so that they violate the order 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.270
 and now we are going to the assembly 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.240
 we positioned our neck by the 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.500
 inside this way and put 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.140
 and do the same thing with the 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.400
 side turns always leaving them 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.400
 Turns inside 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.640
 Let's put the crystal and 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.650
 after the lining fabric 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.600
 let's hit all the sides 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.480
 leaving a liability underneath has 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.810
 stitched we were able to draw 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:26.970
 after curing we cut the excess and 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:28.950
 we are now a culture 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.960
 straight line around to do the 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.270
 finish to close the opening that the 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:49.290
 people left down and roll is 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:51.390
 ready to make the glove is simpler 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.150
 than the apron we will need the two 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.850
 pieces of fabric two pieces of lining 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.570
 and acrylic blanket and there we will assemble a 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:03.500
 sandwich having acrylic and acrylic blanket 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:07.680
 fabric of the stamp 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:10.530
 and then we'll put a poor man 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.050
 the other in this way so that the 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.600
 fire is on the outside where the 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.510
 two fabrics from the print stand together 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.880
 and then we will affect all parts 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.919
 and we will sew and after sewing the 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.370
 people will take the excesses and we will 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.370
 to dodge 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.979
 to finish the part of 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.259
 down we fold in one 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:38.089
 centimeter and pass a culture straight 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:40.099
 I took a little bit of elastic and 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:42.009
 some little dots just to the house of the 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:48.169
 my mother who was hanging on the wall 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:51.199
 is ready and your line with blanket 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:53.719
 and the fabric of the liner was 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.550
 all of culture and then I will 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:57.649
 Answered that I had left. 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.149
 I put it in the bar of a dishcloth 

00:06:57.649 --> 00:07:02.889
 I really hope you liked it. 

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:02.889
 and good culture says
