down to boosters and hiding spots you

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.379 
down to boosters and hiding spots you
know<00:04:25.350> they<00:04:25.590> can<00:04:25.740> get<00:04:25.889> like<00:04:26.039> right<00:04:26.310> in<00:04:26.340> here<00:04:26.490> and

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
it's it's pretty bad and there's pretty

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.620 
it's it's pretty bad and there's pretty
much<00:04:34.740> only<00:04:34.950> one<00:04:35.310> more<00:04:35.580> useful<00:04:36.060> spot<00:04:36.300> on<00:04:36.479> this

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
much only one more useful spot on this

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.900 
much only one more useful spot on this
map<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.200> I<00:04:37.320> saved<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.950> for<00:04:38.130> Alaska's<00:04:38.669> well

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
map and I saved it for Alaska's well

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.930 
map and I saved it for Alaska's well
it'll<00:04:39.360> probably<00:04:39.630> take<00:04:39.870> me<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.530> do<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.860> do<00:04:41.039> it

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
it'll probably take me to do to do it

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.779 
it'll probably take me to do to do it
takes<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.330> little<00:04:42.510> bit<00:04:42.660> of<00:04:42.720> practice<00:04:43.789> you
