00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.040 
that because they're taking it the
reason<00:05:11.759> I<00:05:11.819> say<00:05:11.849> that<00:05:12.000> is<00:05:12.150> it's<00:05:12.449> a<00:05:12.569> thirty-nine

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
reason I say that is it's a thirty-nine

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.619 
reason I say that is it's a thirty-nine

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
in California not here but I mean eleven

in California not here but I mean eleven
percent<00:05:17.849> in<00:05:17.969> California<00:05:18.599> so<00:05:18.840> I<00:05:19.310> mentioned<00:05:20.310> his

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
percent in California so I mentioned his

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.450 
percent in California so I mentioned his
alcoholism<00:05:21.090> and<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:22.050> know<00:05:22.349> he<00:05:22.500> did<00:05:22.650> cocaine<00:05:23.159> for

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
alcoholism and I know he did cocaine for

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.589 
alcoholism and I know he did cocaine for
20<00:05:23.759> years<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.650> you<00:05:25.650> would<00:05:25.860> say<00:05:25.969> that<00:05:26.969> there

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
20 years so you would say that there

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.300 
20 years so you would say that there
were<00:05:27.690> a<00:05:27.719> lot<00:05:28.020> of<00:05:28.050> in<00:05:28.349> statistics<00:05:29.039> you<00:05:29.190> would

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
were a lot of in statistics you would

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.580 
were a lot of in statistics you would
say<00:05:29.490> there<00:05:29.639> are<00:05:29.699> a<00:05:29.729> lot<00:05:29.909> of<00:05:29.940> confounding

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
say there are a lot of confounding

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.200 
say there are a lot of confounding
variables<00:05:31.590> in<00:05:31.800> this<00:05:31.949> case<00:05:32.219> so<00:05:32.550> it<00:05:32.669> wasn't<00:05:33.060> just

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
variables in this case so it wasn't just

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.499 
variables in this case so it wasn't just
divorced<00:05:33.930> but<00:05:34.830> that's<00:05:35.069> clearly<00:05:35.490> was<00:05:35.969> a<00:05:36.000> factor

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
divorced but that's clearly was a factor

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.269 
divorced but that's clearly was a factor
because<00:05:36.840> it<00:05:36.990> made<00:05:37.229> him<00:05:37.469> do<00:05:37.620> television<00:05:37.949> he

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:38.279 
because it made him do television he

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:40.279 
because it made him do television he
didn't<00:05:38.460> want<00:05:38.669> to<00:05:38.759> do<00:05:38.849> television<00:05:39.210> his<00:05:39.840> attempt
