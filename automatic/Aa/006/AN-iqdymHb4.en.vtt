00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 hey people are nice to you again 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.770
 of course, there are those again today 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.839
 most important news of the last week of 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.839
 I am marine and here comes fix 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.059
 rockstar would like to be a successor 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.760
 of red dead redemption 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.109
 everything is missing is time has 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.359
 a developer in a commentary of 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.800
 rockstar blogs newswire we said 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.090
 never try hastily one 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.439
 to succeed, that means 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.119
 not that he will eventually come through 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.680
 we have so many great 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.420
 games that we like to realize 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.070
 want the problem is always with which 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.920
 and at what time again 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.660
 can roxette promised 2015 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.800
 announce new games and maybe 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.160
 yes, there is a chance to one 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.300
 successor of red dead redemption 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.379
 I still puzzle you last week 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.270
 let's leave second playable 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.430
 characters will be 3 and now 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.110
 we know it's a wonderfully scarred one 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.809
 woman who despite her young years too 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.489
 she has won her gray 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.079
 add as a playable character 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.520
 opens us many as playful 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.379
 possibilities though they like one 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.910
 but the main character is not 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.100
 playable character on the same 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.809
 stage like gerald in the game is always 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.580
 still around him his story and therefore 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.110
 as you the player the decision and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.720
 encounters the master lie ahead 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.360
 will be more info on soon following three 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.110
 wild hunt arrives on 19 may 2015 for pc 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.850
 ps4 and xbox to say that we long for 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.950
 The multiplayer means to have waited 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.509
 would be the understatement of the year 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.890
 the bad news is that we 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.659
 still no exact date for the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.850
 Implementation have the good news 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.290
 is that we in crazy trailer and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.540
 an interview with the song mission 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.070
 We have designers from gta 5 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.290
 again the usual reasons for 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.880
 any delays in getting it were 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.009
 more difficult than we thought it is 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.780
 It's all the better and besides, it only comes 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.490
 that's how we play with story and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.950
 Gameplay extra effort 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.659
 but we still have it 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.040
 Of course, many new information about it 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.820

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.820

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
 wiesmann 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.230
 There are two big announcements for 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.150

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.890
 progress can be made in the finished game 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.480

 Members can choose from two monsters and 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.989
 to become eight different hunters 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.060
 on the other hand, all golfer may 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.860
 look forward to the third monster 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.390
 a bit weaker than his monster base 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.870
 But that would probably also the ags too 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.879
 his 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.530
 his special feature is probably his 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.879
 ability to teleport 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.190
 in the best case with a poor hunter in the 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.480
 tow the courage will not be too easy 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.280
 go by the hand but for 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.720
 powerful terror under the mega worry 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.720
 if it is run properly 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.530

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.800
 demand of the hacker group the 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.610
 prevent publication of the film 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.590

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.180
 kim jong us people believes everything he does

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.280

 everyone must have pp and kaka staffed 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.620
 otherwise the man would explode but 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.620
 that's true with the dolphins 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.910

 american style how many times do the usa want 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.550
 nevertheless make the same mistake like that 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.550
 often as needed

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.730
 heaviest tongue-breaker in the world 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.500
