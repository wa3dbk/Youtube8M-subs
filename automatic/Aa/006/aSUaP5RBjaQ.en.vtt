front of it cuz it's got so much lift
and<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.900> can<00:03:29.990> throw<00:03:30.080> it<00:03:30.200> just<00:03:30.230> like<00:03:30.410> that

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
and you can throw it just like that

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.890 
and you can throw it just like that
you<00:03:31.160> know<00:03:31.250> just<00:03:31.459> run<00:03:31.610> that<00:03:31.760> hook<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:32.870> just

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
barely skin it when it's really skinny

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.520 
barely skin it when it's really skinny
water<00:03:35.420> like<00:03:35.600> it's<00:03:35.780> no<00:03:35.900> one<00:03:36.050> to<00:03:36.110> move<00:03:36.230> it<00:03:36.350> pretty

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
water like it's no one to move it pretty

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.190 
water like it's no one to move it pretty
fast<00:03:36.740> I<00:03:37.160> take<00:03:37.760> my<00:03:37.910> line<00:03:38.120> Clippers<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:38.990> just

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
fast I take my line Clippers and I just

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.880 
fast I take my line Clippers and I just
take<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:40.870> just<00:03:41.870> take<00:03:41.990> a<00:03:42.020> little<00:03:42.260> trim<00:03:42.560> off<00:03:42.740> the

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
take I just take a little trim off the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.310 
take I just take a little trim off the
edge<00:03:43.010> about<00:03:43.220> like<00:03:43.490> that<00:03:43.840> was<00:03:44.840> that<00:03:44.959> there<00:03:45.140> for

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
edge about like that was that there for

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.990 
edge about like that was that there for
it<00:03:45.440> it<00:03:45.950> just<00:03:46.100> gives<00:03:46.310> it<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.490> little<00:03:46.640> bit<00:03:46.760> less

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
it it just gives it a little bit less

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.150 
it it just gives it a little bit less
resistance<00:03:47.600> and<00:03:47.840> so<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.350> can<00:03:48.620> reel<00:03:48.769> it<00:03:48.920> a<00:03:48.980> little

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
resistance and so I can reel it a little

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.699 
resistance and so I can reel it a little
faster<00:03:49.610> without<00:03:50.330> a<00:03:50.360> gurgling<00:03:50.720> on<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.019> top<00:03:51.230> now

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
faster without a gurgling on the top now

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.560 
faster without a gurgling on the top now
in<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.950> morning<00:03:52.280> time<00:03:52.430> or<00:03:53.209> if<00:03:53.450> you're

vibration and because of this color that

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.920 
vibration and because of this color that
I'm<00:04:15.769> using<00:04:15.950> is<00:04:16.130> kind<00:04:16.280> of<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.430> pearlescent<00:04:16.930> it's

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
I'm using is kind of a pearlescent it's

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.300 
I'm using is kind of a pearlescent it's
got<00:04:18.140> some<00:04:18.290> glitter<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:18.830> puts<00:04:19.010> off<00:04:19.100> a<00:04:19.160> lot

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
got some glitter and it puts off a lot

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.340 
got some glitter and it puts off a lot
of<00:04:19.400> flash<00:04:19.609> to<00:04:19.640> how<00:04:20.359> big<00:04:20.570> of<00:04:20.600> a<00:04:20.750> bullet<00:04:21.049> way<00:04:21.140> I

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
of flash to how big of a bullet way I

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.670 
of flash to how big of a bullet way I
think<00:04:21.470> is<00:04:21.830> 16th<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.970> 38<00:04:23.450> to<00:04:23.630> 1/16<00:04:24.080> ounces<00:04:24.560> all

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
think is 16th a 38 to 1/16 ounces all

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.920 
think is 16th a 38 to 1/16 ounces all
you<00:04:24.800> need<00:04:24.950> I'm<00:04:25.310> going<00:04:25.490> tungsten<00:04:26.060> so<00:04:26.270> it's<00:04:26.870> a

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
you need I'm going tungsten so it's a

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.800 
you need I'm going tungsten so it's a
little<00:04:27.140> smaller<00:04:27.440> for<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.770> weight<00:04:27.950> I<00:04:28.690> throw<00:04:29.690> it

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
little smaller for the weight I throw it

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.630 
little smaller for the weight I throw it
on<00:04:29.870> a<00:04:29.930> real<00:04:30.229> long<00:04:30.470> rod<00:04:30.710> so<00:04:30.890> I<00:04:30.919> hold<00:04:31.160> my<00:04:31.250> rod<00:04:31.400> tip

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
on a real long rod so I hold my rod tip

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.280 
on a real long rod so I hold my rod tip
up<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:31.880> real<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.390> then<00:04:32.810> if<00:04:32.900> they<00:04:32.990> blow<00:04:33.200> up

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
up and real it and then if they blow up

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.659 
up and real it and then if they blow up
on<00:04:33.410> it<00:04:33.500> miss<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:33.800> you<00:04:33.890> can<00:04:33.979> drop<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:34.370> net<00:04:34.490> weight

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
on it miss it you can drop it net weight

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:35.770 
on it miss it you can drop it net weight
takes<00:04:34.880> it<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.180> bottom<00:04:35.390> they'll<00:04:35.540> come<00:04:35.690> back

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780
