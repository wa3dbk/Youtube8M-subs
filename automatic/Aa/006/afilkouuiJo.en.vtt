an<00:00:25.710> AAA<00:00:25.859> i<00:00:26.279> use<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.390> all<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.529> parts<00:00:28.859> except

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
an AAA i use the all of the parts except

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.110 
an AAA i use the all of the parts except
for<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.570> 1k<00:00:30.570> parts<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> ball<00:00:31.500> itself

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
for the 1k parts and the ball itself

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.560 
for the 1k parts and the ball itself
from<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.180> CRT<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.320> monitor<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.420> this<00:00:36.420> is

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
from the CRT of a monitor and this is

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.150 
from the CRT of a monitor and this is
the<00:00:36.660> kind<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.960> quill<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.860> get<00:00:37.980> on<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
the kind of quill that you get on the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.000 
the kind of quill that you get on the
inside<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.210> as<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.660> see<00:00:39.800> there's<00:00:40.800> two

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
inside and as you can see there's two

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.580 
inside and as you can see there's two
wires<00:00:41.280> each<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.760> there<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.899> coils<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.320> use

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
wires each on there and the coils I use

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.220 
wires each on there and the coils I use
there<00:00:43.920> were<00:00:43.980> four<00:00:44.280> wires<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.210> 150<00:00:45.989> wines

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
there were four wires so I 150 wines

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.029 
there were four wires so I 150 wines
which<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.219> basically<00:00:47.520> three<00:00:47.850> layers<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.239> 50

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
which is basically three layers of 50

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.389 
which is basically three layers of 50
forward<00:00:50.039> backward<00:00:50.399> forward<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.969> then<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:52.020> went

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
forward backward forward and then I went

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.709 
forward backward forward and then I went
while<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> end<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:53.879> wire<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.300> starve<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
while the end of one wire to starve and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.970 
while the end of one wire to starve and
although<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> end<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.320> wanted<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.860> have

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
although the end of wanted to have

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.819 
although the end of wanted to have
another<00:00:56.010> two<00:00:56.730> ended<00:00:57.000> up<00:00:57.090> with<00:00:57.530> 600<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.649> each

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
another two ended up with 600 on each

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.520 
another two ended up with 600 on each
side<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.969> that's<00:01:00.180> 1200<00:01:00.719> wines<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.260> I've<00:01:01.350> got<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
side so that's 1200 wines and I've got a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.289 
side so that's 1200 wines and I've got a
MJ<00:01:02.449> 13mm<00:01:03.449> 9l<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.710> transistor<00:01:05.309> I'll<00:01:06.060> show

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
MJ 13mm 9l as the transistor I'll show

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.210 
MJ 13mm 9l as the transistor I'll show
you<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> does<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.260> very<00:01:07.470> loud<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
you what it does it's very loud was the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.300 
you what it does it's very loud was the
thing<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.520> noticed<00:01:09.000> oh<00:01:11.810> yeah<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.260> that's<00:01:14.130> not

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
thing I noticed oh yeah so that's not

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.899 
thing I noticed oh yeah so that's not
too<00:01:14.369> bad<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.930> change<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.470> frequency

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.860 

sounds<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.030> you're<00:01:21.180> struggling<00:01:21.509> itself

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.890 

there<00:01:25.870> we<00:01:25.960> go<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.200> there<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.880> yeah<00:01:28.330> not<00:01:28.510> bout<00:01:28.690> it

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
there we go to there so yeah not bout it

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.660 
there we go to there so yeah not bout it
uses<00:01:29.290> a<00:01:29.320> couple<00:01:29.890> hundred<00:01:29.980> milliamps<00:01:30.430> though

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
uses a couple hundred milliamps though

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.740 
uses a couple hundred milliamps though
200<00:01:31.180> actually<00:01:31.510> spot<00:01:32.290> on<00:01:32.500> at<00:01:32.650> full<00:01:32.830> brightness

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
200 actually spot on at full brightness

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750 
200 actually spot on at full brightness
but<00:01:34.750> but<00:01:35.350> not<00:01:35.470> too<00:01:35.680> bad<00:01:35.920> luck<00:01:36.160> acquire<00:01:36.580> a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
but but not too bad luck acquire a

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.180 
but but not too bad luck acquire a
building<00:01:37.180> that<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.530> we'll<00:01:38.830> shut<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.160> thing

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
building that so we'll shut the thing

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.790 
building that so we'll shut the thing
off<00:01:40.800> okay<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:42.190> over<00:01:42.970> here<00:01:43.000> we've<00:01:43.540> got<00:01:43.770> wait<00:01:44.770> a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
off okay and over here we've got wait a

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.230 
off okay and over here we've got wait a
minute<00:01:45.130> I<00:01:45.220> will<00:01:45.340> stop<00:01:45.610> there<00:01:45.820> we<00:01:45.910> are<00:01:46.030> just

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
minute I will stop there we are just

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.410 
minute I will stop there we are just
resting<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.720> against<00:01:47.790> hairy<00:01:48.790> ass<00:01:49.000> back<00:01:49.210> on

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
resting it against hairy ass back on

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.570 
resting it against hairy ass back on
again<00:01:49.540> that's<00:01:50.110> that<00:01:50.290> one<00:01:50.470> that<00:01:50.620> rejuvenated<00:01:51.370> a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
again that's that one that rejuvenated a

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.360 
again that's that one that rejuvenated a
few<00:01:52.480> days<00:01:52.690> ago<00:01:52.900> but<00:01:53.740> what<00:01:53.860> I<00:01:53.890> wanted<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.250> show

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
few days ago but what I wanted to show

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.400 
few days ago but what I wanted to show
was<00:01:54.730> my<00:01:54.940> see<00:01:55.480> cell<00:01:55.800> which<00:01:56.800> is<00:01:57.010> made<00:01:57.250> from<00:01:57.550> a

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
was my see cell which is made from a

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.390 
was my see cell which is made from a
seashell<00:01:59.410> there<00:01:59.910> and<00:02:02.250> neurons<00:02:03.250> the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
seashell there and neurons the

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.070 
seashell there and neurons the
oscillator<00:02:03.820> pretty<00:02:04.180> nicely<00:02:04.390> indeed<00:02:04.810> we've

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
oscillator pretty nicely indeed we've

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.680 
oscillator pretty nicely indeed we've
only<00:02:05.230> for<00:02:05.380> about<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.560> week<00:02:05.740> now<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:06.660> uses<00:02:07.660> a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
only for about a week now and uses a

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.410 
only for about a week now and uses a
couple<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.080> weird<00:02:08.470> things<00:02:08.740> perhaps<00:02:09.010> so<00:02:09.820> I<00:02:10.149> use

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
couple of weird things perhaps so I use

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.320 
couple of weird things perhaps so I use
his<00:02:10.570> epsom<00:02:10.899> salts<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.730> pinch<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.880> salt

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
his epsom salts a pinch of salt

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.150 
his epsom salts a pinch of salt
substitute<00:02:13.960> not<00:02:14.320> much<00:02:14.500> more<00:02:14.770> because<00:02:15.040> then

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
substitute not much more because then
