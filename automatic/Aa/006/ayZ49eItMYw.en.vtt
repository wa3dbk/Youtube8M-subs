partially<00:01:48.370> freezing<00:01:48.729> I<00:01:48.940> can<00:01:49.090> go<00:01:49.180> ahead<00:01:49.240> and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
partially freezing I can go ahead and

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.149 
partially freezing I can go ahead and
start<00:01:49.659> prepping<00:01:49.870> our<00:01:50.080> broccoli<00:01:50.260> just<00:01:50.950> got<00:01:51.130> a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
start prepping our broccoli just got a

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.680 
start prepping our broccoli just got a
couple<00:01:51.430> stalks<00:01:51.640> here<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.180> I'm<00:01:52.299> gonna<00:01:52.390> get<00:01:52.540> rid

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
couple stalks here and I'm gonna get rid

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.110 
couple stalks here and I'm gonna get rid
of<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:53.020> stem<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.250> usually<00:01:54.430> hang<00:01:54.850> on<00:01:55.000> to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
of the stem and I usually hang on to

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.850 
of the stem and I usually hang on to
these<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.540> add<00:01:55.630> them<00:01:55.750> to<00:01:55.900> soups<00:01:56.110> or<00:01:56.530> like

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
these and add them to soups or like

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
broccoli soup out of them so you don't

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.130 
broccoli soup out of them so you don't
have<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:01.060> throw<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.299> away<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:01.780> then<00:02:02.020> we'll

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
have to throw it away and then we'll

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.530 
have to throw it away and then we'll
just<00:02:02.260> start<00:02:02.500> sort<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:02.950> slicing<00:02:03.940> at<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.180> bottom

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
just start sort of slicing at the bottom

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.780 
just start sort of slicing at the bottom
here<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:05.020> get<00:02:05.200> these<00:02:05.380> florets<00:02:06.310> off<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.729> you

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
here to get these florets off and you

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.130 
here to get these florets off and you
want<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.030> keep<00:02:07.240> them<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.540> their<00:02:07.659> little<00:02:07.840> cute

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
want to keep them in their little cute

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.190 
want to keep them in their little cute
tree<00:02:08.380> shape<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:09.549> know<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:10.119> validate<00:02:11.049> yourself

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
tree shape you know to validate yourself

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.320 
tree shape you know to validate yourself
making<00:02:11.769> authentic<00:02:12.730> kind<00:02:12.820> of<00:02:12.940> use<00:02:13.030> food<00:02:13.209> at

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
making authentic kind of use food at

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.289 
making authentic kind of use food at
home<00:02:13.799> looks<00:02:14.799> a<00:02:14.890> lot<00:02:15.010> prettier<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.430> way<00:02:18.299> and

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
home looks a lot prettier that way and

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.729 
home looks a lot prettier that way and
then<00:02:19.570> once<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:19.810> get<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.110> center<00:02:20.440> where<00:02:20.709> it

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
then once you get to the center where it

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.500 
then once you get to the center where it
looks<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.340> little<00:02:21.430> bit<00:02:21.640> tricky<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.269> start

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
looks a little bit tricky to start

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.870 
looks a little bit tricky to start
separating<00:02:22.900> if<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.769> florets<00:02:24.400> are<00:02:24.549> really

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
separating if the florets are really

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.520 
separating if the florets are really
small<00:02:25.120> when<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:26.019> go<00:02:26.140> ahead<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.380> cut

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
small when you just go ahead and cut

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.110 
small when you just go ahead and cut
this<00:02:26.650> little<00:02:26.890> centerpiece<00:02:27.340> in<00:02:27.580> half<00:02:27.820> or<00:02:28.090> even

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
this little centerpiece in half or even

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.330 
this little centerpiece in half or even
quarters<00:02:28.720> if<00:02:28.870> it's<00:02:29.019> really<00:02:29.230> big<00:02:29.410> just<00:02:29.980> depends

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
quarters if it's really big just depends

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.979 
quarters if it's really big just depends
you<00:02:30.430> kind<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.670> want<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.850> just<00:02:30.910> make<00:02:31.720> sure<00:02:31.870> you

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
you kind of want to just make sure you

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.780 
you kind of want to just make sure you
keep<00:02:32.170> them<00:02:32.350> all<00:02:32.549> approximately<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.640> same

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
keep them all approximately the same

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.180 
keep them all approximately the same
size<00:02:34.080> okay<00:02:35.080> awesome

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
size okay awesome

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.800 
size okay awesome
that<00:02:36.489> didn't<00:02:36.760> really<00:02:36.820> take<00:02:37.090> ten<00:02:37.269> minutes<00:02:37.570> but

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
that didn't really take ten minutes but

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.990 
that didn't really take ten minutes but
uh<00:02:37.920> let's<00:02:38.920> pretend<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.670> meat<00:02:39.850> is

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
uh let's pretend like the meat is

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.979 
uh let's pretend like the meat is
partially<00:02:40.480> frozen<00:02:40.690> huh<00:02:41.370> between<00:02:42.370> me<00:02:42.609> and<00:02:42.760> you

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
partially frozen huh between me and you

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.509 
partially frozen huh between me and you
all<00:02:43.989> right<00:02:44.139> are<00:02:44.320> not<00:02:44.709> quite<00:02:44.950> partially<00:02:45.370> frozen

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
all right are not quite partially frozen

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.660 
all right are not quite partially frozen
meat

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
meat

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.580 
meat
but<00:02:47.060> we're<00:02:47.240> gonna<00:02:47.360> just<00:02:47.630> start<00:02:47.990> slicing<00:02:48.349> it

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
but we're gonna just start slicing it

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.710 
but we're gonna just start slicing it
really<00:02:48.800> thinly<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.490> you<00:02:50.030> can<00:02:50.180> kind<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.480> see<00:02:50.630> it

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
really thinly and you can kind of see it

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.330 
really thinly and you can kind of see it
better<00:02:50.870> on<00:02:51.020> this<00:02:51.140> side<00:02:51.200> I'll<00:02:51.470> show<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:52.280> you

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
better on this side I'll show you so you

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.670 
better on this side I'll show you so you
see<00:02:52.520> this<00:02:52.670> grain<00:02:53.150> lines<00:02:53.420> here<00:02:53.900> that<00:02:54.110> run

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
see this grain lines here that run

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.830 
see this grain lines here that run
perpendicular<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.880> direction<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.569> the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
perpendicular to the direction of the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.330 
perpendicular to the direction of the
length<00:02:57.050> of<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.290> meat<00:02:57.440> we're<00:02:58.010> gonna<00:02:58.130> cut

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
length of the meat we're gonna cut

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.280 
length of the meat we're gonna cut
against<00:02:58.730> those<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.270> we<00:02:59.390> want<00:02:59.569> to<00:02:59.630> cut<00:02:59.780> this<00:03:00.050> way

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
against those so we want to cut this way

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.960 
against those so we want to cut this way
and<00:03:01.040> that's<00:03:01.190> gonna<00:03:01.310> help<00:03:01.489> make<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.790> really

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
and that's gonna help make it really

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:11.770 
and that's gonna help make it really
tender<00:03:04.989> that<00:03:05.989> way<00:03:06.170> first<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:09.010> then<00:03:10.780> it's

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
tender that way first and then it's

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.300 
tender that way first and then it's
really<00:03:11.989> thin<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.590> if<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:12.800> want<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.010> even<00:03:13.190> do

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
really thin and if you want to even do

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.960 
really thin and if you want to even do
it<00:03:13.430> like<00:03:13.610> on<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.790> diagonal<00:03:14.450> that's<00:03:14.690> fine<00:03:15.050> too

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
it like on a diagonal that's fine too

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.570 
it like on a diagonal that's fine too
and<00:03:16.970> I'll<00:03:17.209> do<00:03:17.360> this<00:03:17.510> same<00:03:18.100> basic<00:03:19.100> method

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
and I'll do this same basic method

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.090 
and I'll do this same basic method
recipe<00:03:20.360> with<00:03:20.840> chicken<00:03:21.319> breasts<00:03:21.680> or<00:03:21.769> chicken

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
thighs sometimes as well just mix it up

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.220 
thighs sometimes as well just mix it up
and<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.340> can<00:03:25.489> add<00:03:25.640> carrots<00:03:26.510> or<00:03:26.750> onion<00:03:27.049> or

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
and you can add carrots or onion or

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.750 
and you can add carrots or onion or
whatever<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:28.069> we're<00:03:28.190> just<00:03:28.220> gonna<00:03:28.430> keep<00:03:28.640> it

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
whatever but we're just gonna keep it

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.160 
whatever but we're just gonna keep it
simple<00:03:28.790> with<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.330> beef<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.600> broccoli<00:03:29.720> today

simple with the beef and broccoli today
and<00:03:31.040> as<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.220> sliced<00:03:31.580> I'm<00:03:31.970> dropping<00:03:32.330> into<00:03:32.450> this
