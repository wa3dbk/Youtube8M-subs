just has a a slight shortcut to the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.810 
just has a a slight shortcut to the
mouth<00:01:36.810> give<00:01:37.439> me<00:01:37.469> a<00:01:37.560> better<00:01:37.740> performance<00:01:38.369> so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
mouth give me a better performance so

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.550 
mouth give me a better performance so
you're<00:01:38.939> still<00:01:39.149> getting<00:01:39.719> a<00:01:39.840> great<00:01:39.869> performing

up to us even though it's an entry-level

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.340 
up to us even though it's an entry-level
unit<00:01:42.929> and<00:01:44.149> I<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.359> have<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> quick<00:01:46.049> look<00:01:46.229> at

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
unit and I just have a quick look at

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.889 
unit and I just have a quick look at
this<00:01:46.579> bung<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.759> here<00:01:47.969> this<00:01:48.179> is<00:01:48.240> provided<00:01:48.600> with

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
this bung on here this is provided with

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.270 
this bung on here this is provided with
the<00:01:48.990> octopus<00:01:49.350> say<00:01:50.179> soft<00:01:51.179> flexible<00:01:51.719> bung<00:01:52.280> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the octopus say soft flexible bung it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
the octopus say soft flexible bung it
just<00:01:53.490> fits<00:01:53.700> into<00:01:53.969> the<00:01:54.030> mouthpiece<00:01:54.350> just

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
just fits into the mouthpiece just

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.870 
just fits into the mouthpiece just
pushes<00:01:55.740> home<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.789> actual

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
pushes home and then the actual

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.090 
pushes home and then the actual
mouthpiece<00:01:57.359> grips<00:01:57.630> lock<00:01:58.350> into<00:01:58.619> place<00:01:58.770> so

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
mouthpiece grips lock into place so

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.679 
mouthpiece grips lock into place so
that's<00:01:59.280> nice<00:01:59.609> and<00:01:59.819> secure<00:02:00.090> from<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.420> point

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
that's nice and secure from that point

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.840 
that's nice and secure from that point
but<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.679> a<00:02:01.710> quick-release<00:02:01.979> system<00:02:02.429> as<00:02:02.729> well

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
but it is a quick-release system as well

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.309 
but it is a quick-release system as well
so<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.179> can<00:02:03.299> actually<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.869> pot<00:02:04.109> this

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
so you can actually have this pot this

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.249 
so you can actually have this pot this
fitted<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> your<00:02:05.130> BCD<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.819> clip<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.689> in

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
fitted to your BCD on a clip and in

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.559 
fitted to your BCD on a clip and in
emergency<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.160> quickly<00:02:08.479> pull<00:02:09.479> it
