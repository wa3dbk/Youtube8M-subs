consider<00:02:02.700> before<00:02:02.969> putting<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:04.340> another

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
consider before putting in another

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.219 
consider before putting in another
aftermarket<00:02:06.210> deck

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
aftermarket deck

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.449 
aftermarket deck
now<00:02:09.229> if<00:02:09.319> you<00:02:09.410> look<00:02:09.500> in<00:02:09.649> there<00:02:09.769> I<00:02:10.009> have<00:02:10.250> all<00:02:10.429> my

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
now if you look in there I have all my

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.259 
now if you look in there I have all my
satellite<00:02:11.030> radio<00:02:11.330> gear<00:02:12.010> now<00:02:13.010> all<00:02:13.519> that<00:02:13.879> has<00:02:13.940> to

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
satellite radio gear now all that has to

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.759 
satellite radio gear now all that has to
be<00:02:14.360> wired<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.750> back<00:02:14.989> of<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.260> deck<00:02:15.500> the

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
be wired to the back of the deck the

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.800 
be wired to the back of the deck the
reason<00:02:16.190> why<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.370> consider<00:02:16.879> this<00:02:17.120> before<00:02:17.720> you

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
reason why you consider this before you

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.869 
reason why you consider this before you
put<00:02:17.989> your<00:02:18.080> stereo<00:02:18.500> in<00:02:18.620> is<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.459> way<00:02:19.580> every

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
put your stereo in is so that way every

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.820 
put your stereo in is so that way every
time<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.090> buy<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> new<00:02:20.750> piece<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.530> don't<00:02:21.709> have

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
time you buy a new piece you don't have

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.740 
time you buy a new piece you don't have
to<00:02:21.920> keep<00:02:22.040> pulling<00:02:22.550> your<00:02:22.700> stereo<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.330> suggest

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
to keep pulling your stereo I suggest

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.900 
to keep pulling your stereo I suggest
buying<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.349> all<00:02:24.470> at<00:02:24.620> once<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.069> just<00:02:25.610> putting

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
buying it all at once and just putting

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.300 
buying it all at once and just putting
it<00:02:26.060> all<00:02:26.209> in<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:27.140> reason<00:02:27.500> why<00:02:27.620> is<00:02:27.680> it's<00:02:28.220> a

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
it all in the reason why is it's a

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.479 
it all in the reason why is it's a
headache<00:02:28.580> once<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:30.019> have<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.769> keep<00:02:30.980> cutting

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
headache once you have to keep cutting

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.550 
headache once you have to keep cutting
wires<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.120> re<00:02:32.239> crimping<00:02:32.720> because<00:02:33.290> they<00:02:33.500> do

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
wires and re crimping because they do

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.729 
wires and re crimping because they do
branch<00:02:34.010> off<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.610> same<00:02:34.819> wires<00:02:35.090> sometimes

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
branch off of the same wires sometimes

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.100 
branch off of the same wires sometimes
see<00:02:36.739> for<00:02:36.950> me<00:02:37.180> what<00:02:38.180> I've<00:02:38.269> done<00:02:38.390> in<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:38.690> car<00:02:38.900> is

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
and then this draws power you can see my

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.910 
and then this draws power you can see my
GPS<00:02:48.670> cord<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:50.120> know<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.900> charges<00:02:51.380> my<00:02:51.470> GPS

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
that actually ties it off my deck power

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.580 
that actually ties it off my deck power

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
amp mine I did notice the difference one

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.580 
amp mine I did notice the difference one
in<00:03:21.889> volume<00:03:22.430> two<00:03:23.209> in<00:03:23.540> control<00:03:24.049> just<00:03:24.470> the

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
in volume two in control just the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.860 
in volume two in control just the
although<00:03:25.220> control<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.000> speaker<00:03:26.420> getting

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
although control of the speaker getting

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.780 
although control of the speaker getting
the<00:03:26.989> different<00:03:27.500> pitches<00:03:27.859> and<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.250> sounds<00:03:28.639> out

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
the different pitches and the sounds out

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.940 
the different pitches and the sounds out
that's<00:03:29.750> why<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:29.959> actually<00:03:30.170> went<00:03:30.470> for<00:03:30.620> this<00:03:30.709> deck

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
that's why I actually went for this deck

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.680 
that's why I actually went for this deck
is<00:03:31.130> because<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.459> has<00:03:31.579> a<00:03:31.609> nice<00:03:31.819> equalizer<00:03:32.540> on

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
is because it has a nice equalizer on

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.559 
is because it has a nice equalizer on
there<00:03:33.019> I<00:03:33.200> can<00:03:33.680> adjust<00:03:33.980> every<00:03:34.519> style<00:03:35.420> of

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
there I can adjust every style of

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.180 
there I can adjust every style of
frequency<00:03:36.049> that<00:03:36.200> those<00:03:36.650> speakers<00:03:37.040> are

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
frequency that those speakers are

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.430 
frequency that those speakers are

still a fun project in making if you
look<00:04:57.990> at<00:04:58.169> it<00:04:58.320> it's<00:04:58.800> just<00:04:59.040> one<00:04:59.190> thing<00:04:59.340> to

consider if you're going to be buying

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.430 
consider if you're going to be buying
everything<00:05:03.510> separate<00:05:03.930> make<00:05:04.080> sure<00:05:04.200> you're<00:05:04.320> not

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
everything separate make sure you're not

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.920 
everything separate make sure you're not
double<00:05:04.740> crimping<00:05:05.130> wires<00:05:05.370> if<00:05:05.700> you<00:05:06.180> have<00:05:06.479> you

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
double crimping wires if you have you

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.500 
double crimping wires if you have you
know<00:05:07.080> a<00:05:07.320> wire<00:05:07.979> you<00:05:08.220> need<00:05:08.400> to<00:05:08.520> crimp<00:05:08.820> on<00:05:09.000> what

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
know a wire you need to crimp on what

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.940 
know a wire you need to crimp on what
you've<00:05:09.630> already<00:05:09.750> crimped<00:05:10.139> on<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.380> don't<00:05:10.740> make

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
you've already crimped on it don't make

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.710 
you've already crimped on it don't make
a<00:05:10.979> second<00:05:11.460> cut<00:05:11.639> the<00:05:12.090> reason<00:05:12.360> why<00:05:12.479> is<00:05:12.539> you're

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
a second cut the reason why is you're

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.900 
a second cut the reason why is you're
adding<00:05:12.930> more<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.410> more<00:05:13.710> resistance<00:05:14.310> to<00:05:14.820> the

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
adding more and more resistance to the

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.850 
adding more and more resistance to the
wire<00:05:15.060> every<00:05:15.210> time<00:05:15.510> you<00:05:15.660> add<00:05:15.780> a<00:05:15.810> connection<00:05:16.380> so

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
wire every time you add a connection so

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.159 
wire every time you add a connection so
make<00:05:17.039> sure<00:05:17.070> if<00:05:17.370> you're<00:05:17.520> going<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:18.000> be<00:05:18.930> adding

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
make sure if you're going to be adding

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.800 
make sure if you're going to be adding
take<00:05:20.070> the<00:05:20.190> other<00:05:20.340> crimp<00:05:20.610> out<00:05:20.820> of<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.030> equation

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
take the other crimp out of the equation

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.300 
take the other crimp out of the equation
and<00:05:21.930> just<00:05:21.990> wreak<00:05:22.350> ramp<00:05:22.620> all<00:05:22.800> three<00:05:23.160> of<00:05:23.220> those

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
and just wreak ramp all three of those

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.670 
and just wreak ramp all three of those
wires<00:05:23.639> or<00:05:23.910> two<00:05:24.060> wires<00:05:24.270> together<00:05:24.600> all<00:05:25.440> right

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
wires or two wires together all right

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.150 
wires or two wires together all right
so<00:05:26.400> those<00:05:26.550> are<00:05:26.669> tips<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.030> tricks<00:05:27.270> for<00:05:27.419> me<00:05:27.660> and
