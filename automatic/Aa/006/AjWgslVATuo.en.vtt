our<00:00:00.179> convergence<00:00:00.989> divergence<00:00:01.230> what<00:00:01.979> do<00:00:02.100> you

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
our convergence divergence what do you

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.610 
our convergence divergence what do you
mean<00:00:02.370> yes<00:00:03.240> everything's<00:00:03.899> converging<00:00:04.470> but

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
mean yes everything's converging but

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.430 
mean yes everything's converging but
it's<00:00:04.799> also<00:00:04.980> diverging<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:06.000> was<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:06.930> want<00:00:07.379> to

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
it's also diverging I was I want to

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.220 
it's also diverging I was I want to
suggest<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.540> that<00:00:09.540> while<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.809> lot<00:00:10.019> of

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
suggest to you that while a lot of

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.940 
suggest to you that while a lot of
things<00:00:10.559> are<00:00:10.769> converging<00:00:11.519> all<00:00:11.929> true

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
things are converging all true

things are converging all true
intervention<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.610> do<00:00:14.880> will<00:00:15.420> be<00:00:15.450> about

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
intervention that you do will be about

intervention that you do will be about
divergence<00:00:17.250> will<00:00:18.119> be<00:00:18.300> about<00:00:18.660> doing<00:00:19.109> something

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
divergence will be about doing something

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.330 
divergence will be about doing something
special<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.369> doing<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.210> different

special and doing it different

convergence<00:00:35.640> wins<00:00:36.030> for<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> consumer<00:00:37.290> when

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
convergence wins for the consumer when

I don't want to be rude but I'm saying

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.800 
I don't want to be rude but I'm saying
that<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.220> an<00:01:20.340> issue<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.240> challenge

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
that this is an issue it's a challenge

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.530 
that this is an issue it's a challenge
at<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.409> bottom<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> pyramid<00:01:23.540> especially

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
at the bottom of the pyramid especially

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.950 
at the bottom of the pyramid especially
and<00:01:25.070> most<00:01:26.070> people<00:01:26.549> want<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.180> product<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.780> do

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and most people want a product to do

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.380 
and most people want a product to do
just<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:28.500> thing<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.880> really<00:01:30.180> well

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
just one thing and do it really well

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.050 
just one thing and do it really well
which<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.380> why<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.650> future<00:01:32.040> will<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.700> many

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
which is why the future will be many

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.179 
which is why the future will be many
many<00:01:33.390> many<00:01:33.600> more<00:01:33.780> products<00:01:34.380> as<00:01:34.500> well<00:01:35.130> as

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
many many more products as well as

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.030 
many many more products as well as
sometimes<00:01:36.060> multiple<00:01:36.630> e<00:01:36.990> functioning<00:01:37.770> them

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
sometimes multiple e functioning them

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.990 
sometimes multiple e functioning them
but<00:01:38.970> who<00:01:39.210> really<00:01:39.570> wants<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.049> web-enabled

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
but who really wants a web-enabled

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.319 
but who really wants a web-enabled
fridge<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.329> mean<00:01:43.229> really<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:44.820> know<00:01:44.909> what<00:01:45.299> a

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
fridge I mean really you know what a

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.810 
fridge I mean really you know what a
crazy<00:01:45.840> idea<00:01:46.290> I've<00:01:46.740> had<00:01:47.100> Weibull<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
crazy idea I've had Weibull the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.770 
crazy idea I've had Weibull the
web-enabled

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
web-enabled

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.530 
web-enabled
dustbin<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.770> my<00:01:50.220> kitchen<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:50.820> years<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
dustbin in my kitchen for years it's a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.700 
dustbin in my kitchen for years it's a
complete<00:01:51.960> waste<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.409> time

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
complete waste of time

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.940 
complete waste of time
the<00:01:53.250> idea<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.270> click<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.720> throw<00:01:55.079> when<00:01:55.829> you

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the idea is you click and throw when you

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.130 
the idea is you click and throw when you
throw<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.340> away<00:01:56.490> another<00:01:57.270> one<00:01:57.540> comes<00:01:57.810> through

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
throw it away another one comes through

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.510 
throw it away another one comes through
the<00:01:58.259> door<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.770> following<00:01:59.189> day<00:02:00.860> no<00:02:01.860> my<00:02:02.100> friends

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the door the following day no my friends

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.929 
the door the following day no my friends
sometimes<00:02:02.790> we<00:02:03.180> go<00:02:03.390> stark<00:02:03.810> raving<00:02:04.939> technology

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
sometimes we go stark raving technology

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.589 
sometimes we go stark raving technology
mad<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.860> lose<00:02:08.160> touch<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:08.910> what<00:02:09.450> is

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
mad and we lose touch with what is

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.229 
mad and we lose touch with what is
actually<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.009> make<00:02:11.190> individual<00:02:12.000> lives

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
actually going to make individual lives
