of the newest balls they have in their
high<00:00:34.390> performance<00:00:34.960> line<00:00:35.199> and<00:00:35.559> I<00:00:35.980> gotta<00:00:36.399> tell

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
high performance line and I gotta tell

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.520 
high performance line and I gotta tell
you<00:00:36.730> it's<00:00:36.879> really<00:00:37.059> interesting<00:00:37.510> I<00:00:37.960> was<00:00:38.440> just

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
you it's really interesting I was just

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.890 
you it's really interesting I was just
at<00:00:38.650> the<00:00:38.739> PBA<00:00:39.040> winter<00:00:39.430> swing<00:00:39.699> and<00:00:40.000> I<00:00:40.600> saw<00:00:40.780> this

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
at the PBA winter swing and I saw this

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.869 
at the PBA winter swing and I saw this
ball<00:00:41.080> get<00:00:41.260> thrown<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.710> lot<00:00:41.920> and<00:00:42.190> I<00:00:42.400> think<00:00:42.430> scoops

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
ball get thrown a lot and I think scoops

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.149 
ball get thrown a lot and I think scoops
knows<00:00:43.089> why<00:00:43.269> it's<00:00:44.260> great<00:00:44.470> for<00:00:44.769> high<00:00:44.920> rev

knows why it's great for high rev

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.160 
knows why it's great for high rev
players<00:00:45.489> and<00:00:45.820> high<00:00:46.150> ball<00:00:46.390> speed<00:00:46.690> players<00:00:46.900> or

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
players and high ball speed players or

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.470 
players and high ball speed players or
combination<00:00:47.920> of<00:00:48.010> both<00:00:48.129> yeah<00:00:48.909> and<00:00:49.210> it<00:00:49.300> really
