00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.720
 tÃ©lam 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.580
 is that you charge me taxes and how they do 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.530
 one million monthly 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:21.020
 means that your income is enough 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:23.860
 high capacity so that 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.860
 it is quite high 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.029
 good map and a position 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.160
 down we have to win it of course 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.550
 of course onwards it will not happen 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.550
 no one 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:56.719
 that he was on the right and I was 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.719
 down if it went what misfortune 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.490
 of these inventions is a matter of pushing 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.470
 it's a matter of pushing and besides you already 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.880
 can penetrate frontally without 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.880
 problems then you say bear 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:21.859
 but this peace against him shot at the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.859
 right to the right there is one 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:32.980
 of 71 but it is not closed uncle I would have 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.480
 liked to close to give it to me 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.640
 210 5 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.270
 there are two arteries I hope there 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.270
 missing 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.360
 and then pull strip pulling suction back 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.260
 I already have back 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.770
 34 tea has it eaten which was to 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.770
 you know 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.140
 look because because the artillery what 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.960
 to 0 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.180
 and me here 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.990
 the study of the whole art part 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.080
 if the right and when it is solvent to your 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.700
 more port 13 come to him comes from come 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.500
 come come come come come come 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.360
 they come 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.640
 quiet in theory I did not hear about 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.100
 penetrate 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.280
 run Run Run 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.090
 he's also going to die 74 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.090
 did not arrive 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:05.630
 Take cover here is worth it for 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:08.890
 below us it will be a little more 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.340
 stay here but by my side 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.340
 among us 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:22.320
 stick you have the 310 and 5 ass for the 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.320
 broken chains or not with 30 life 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:32.340
 but from there to there and to 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.110
 there's no more 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.110
 me 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.180
 they are waiting 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:56.200
 and now he's going to stow them for them 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.910
 for them it is worth it, it will be a place for me 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.010
 maneuver 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.290
 inside has to be there no one spinning 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.290
 I'm going to turn 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.290
 imagined 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.540
 like you 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.100
 Misses disparate 9 seconds 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.959
 to try 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.959
 Come stop turning your chin by shooting 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.320
 on the side you want 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.360
 of the knees that detected 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.690
 he shoots he shoots he does not shoot worth 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.690
 OK OK 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.890
 we keep eating more half turn of 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.890
 win follow 666 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:57.639
 I go with VECTOR, I defend wing 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.630
 I assure you that you can have three there 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.720
 artillery if there are more attacks there 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.720
 above 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:10.760
 an out that bauza has been good that 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.760
 was any effect 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.139
 has tried to penetrate me with the area that 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.139
 that could be penetrated before 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:31.950
 in motion at 400 meters 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:31.950
 in quiet plan and now when 75 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:43.389
 reloaded if it now lights up damage 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.730
 and just shoot at me 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.889
 Now you're finished Atlantean 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.400
 fails last to him 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.400
 maximum I can do 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:06.620
 five thousand years 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:09.350
 and that's it 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.720
 no no I did 5,000 damage 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.050
 think I said yes but there are still 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.050
 Many 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.849
 he has not lost his life either 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.110
 she is going goes down can be 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.950
 commit suicide out there I think 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:32.000
 it's water seems to me the left where 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:35.530
 water and cucumber remain 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.530
 because I know part of this 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.630
 if he waits for you, he wrote first and ran 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.289
 all for what are the uncle tanks for 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.039
 burst 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.039
 because 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:55.710
 There is someone on the right 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.880
 to me at the moment the most seen 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.210
 Look Look Look at the Panther Game 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.210

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:06.819
 I give my name to this one you go to 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:06.819
 down 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.930
 stable and at the moment shoot at me 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:18.110
 21 god have left him with 70 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.060

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.699
 very good 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.340
 Oh God, there were 4200 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.020
