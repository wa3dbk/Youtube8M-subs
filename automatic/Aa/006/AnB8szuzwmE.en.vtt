00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:14.879
 klaus for technology and the mobile 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.800
 there are also the shows events and 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.420
 barcelona at the mobile world congress i 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.170
 have a pretty special one here 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.980
 smartphone for you that's that 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.610
 be gossau 2 or how square biz itself 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.520
 call yourself 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.720
 an american company 22 guys or 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.460
 two men who are now getting together 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.210
 have and build your dream smartphone 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.120
 wanted to 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.180
 and that has a lot in it 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.340
 we have unusual equipment for one thing 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.900
 front cameras a 3 10 megapixel camera 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.340
 behind a 21 megapixel camera both 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.530
 thus stabilizes in anti-blur 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.540
 then we have a keppler backside 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.040
 which makes for a fairly light device 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:59.150
 now the weight data 141 41 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.290
 came for a 5 inch device with thicker 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.960
 domestic equipments 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.320
 certainly not bad 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.640
 aluminum frame which runs around where we are 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.760
 these beautiful worked buttons 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.730
 You can still see a few specialties 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.800
 while dedicated camera button 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.690
 Here's another specialty 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.510
 He has developed his own technique 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.790
 to full hd 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.020
 wirelessly transmitted to the television 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.850
 you can tell your uncle about it 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.149
 You can plug in TV without 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.800
 jerk and in full HD resolution content 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.180
 transferred from the phone there 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.100
 it will be very exciting again 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.720
 we the appliance them look inside the one 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.860
 be 64 gigabyte memory already fixed 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.710
 built what he is not without but 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.240
 obviously the manufacturers have fun 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.430
 to have a lot of memory with you 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.850
 want that not everything about the cloud 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.550
 push 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.920
 here are two micro sd card slots 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.440
 the pasture is installed to 128 gigabytes 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.790
 according to the current state of technology 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.890
 So you can record up to 320 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.060
 gigabyte memory you can in this 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.220
 Part of carrying 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.020
 we will see more specialty here 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.850
 the back of the closed model 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.789
 that's what the pure fractal design is called 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.400
 so antennae a fatal pattern like us 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.750
 know this from the apple people 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.340
 So far in this form is one 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.010
 antenna the obvious imprinted 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.800
 So the forwarding of the material in it 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.420
 this is not just a design 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.520
 but that should be especially good 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.960
 reception properties 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.490
 So they are a whole lot of specialties 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.100
 which one so with the big ones 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.680
 industry leaders samsung htc and co not 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.020
 Will that be a big one now? 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.310
 Customer market is there 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.600
 I think in any case right 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.310
 exciting that someone is completely different 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.110
 goes and really has the courage 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.310
 his own darling smartphone 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.190
 to build, so to speak 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.850
 after the own good the very most 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.710
 it does not have that are just daddy 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.780
 centimeters in depth but as I said 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.700
 it is not difficult and has 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.910
 otherwise very solid equipment in it 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.080
 hd display 5 inch with gorilla glass of beer 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.330
 protected 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.640
 3 gb ram in it is also right 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.640
 Neatly two and a half liters of heart 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.880
 quadcore qualcomm snapdragon cpu in it 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.180
 one with four point 4.4 it insists that 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.280
 supports nfc lte bluetooth 4.0 low 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.880
 energy everything you just think 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.420
 can the usb port we down here 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.800
 even usb 3.0 is capable of all that 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.710
 is waterproof and one more 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.910
 special feature is has stereo speakers 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.980
 So both here and below 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.590
 upper edge we have speakers and 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.300
 Of course, harman Kardon really did 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.000
 was intended to provide decent sound 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.070
 I do not here could now 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.610
 one can but we want also times 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.260
 have faith is in itself an announcement 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.920
 one thing is also possible after the 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:53.270
 standard so there is hardly anything 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.760
 what could be missing on one 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.500
 instead of 100, there is still poor software 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.200
 So some special software that 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.400
 the device against eavesdropping and the like 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.660
 is to make sure that you have to 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.950
 then in detail, look at what that 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.110
 indeed 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.650
 what is that first I have to say 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.920
 that sounds very exciting of course 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.500
 also very fluid and should be in the second 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.540
 quarter 2015 then actually on the 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.930
 Market announced is very nice 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.430
 a little longer to dollar for 599 in the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.770
 us the exact prices as it then in 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.690
 the usa look in europe will look like 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.130
 could not be mentioned here yet 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.540
 long but so after the motto yes times 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.550
 look at what the conversion rates are 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.820
 say I still want to steer in because of it 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.700
 all pipapo tap on that is then 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.750
 also around the 600 euro will be what 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.190
 the said equipment 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.540
 yes of course it is a lot of money 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.970
 and i would never put that much money in it 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.320
 But for that , especially the 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.510
 special stories in here 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.310
 I would say it is still stuck 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.210
 an absolutely reasonable price resp 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.550
 understandable that you do not do something like that 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.860
 just in 200 euro devices in pack 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.330
 Can the device there is in the application looks 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.770
 gray or black who is on the 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.430
 right side looks red again 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.800
 and there is a white version 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.300
 as far as klaus for techno feeling mobile 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.630
 it is here on the stand of siders 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.220
 with the riester or v2 I'll show you 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.230
 short is a bit too of 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.970
 the side i really like the design 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.530
 quite well managed even if it 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.500
 not the slimmest device for that 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.540
 But world is not a game of its own 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.530
 It has the courage to own features 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.030
 maybe not implement too 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.310
 Here again briefly an off the 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.570
 happens 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.340
 and I think it's very exciting sometimes 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.530
 such devices to be seen off the beaten track 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.980
 mainstream the samsung htc and consorts 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.980
 and to offer
