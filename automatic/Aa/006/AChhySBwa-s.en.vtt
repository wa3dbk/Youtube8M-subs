fact that it's now a premium game not a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.240 
fact that it's now a premium game not a
freemium<00:00:24.480> one<00:00:24.750> although<00:00:25.619> as<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.099> see

baggage leftover from a game built using
freemium<00:00:31.920> architecture<00:00:32.640> apparently<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.630> was

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
freemium architecture apparently it was

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.270 
freemium architecture apparently it was
originally<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.469> free-to-play<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
originally going to be free-to-play and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.639 
originally going to be free-to-play and
then<00:00:35.640> part<00:00:35.969> way<00:00:36.120> through<00:00:36.149> development<00:00:36.809> 2k

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
then part way through development 2k

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.459 
then part way through development 2k
decided<00:00:38.100> no<00:00:38.879> will<00:00:39.180> actually<00:00:39.660> make<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.020> premium

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
decided no will actually make it premium

99 question is how much of the freemium

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.760 
99 question is how much of the freemium
architecture<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.090> left<00:00:48.270> over<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.840> how<00:00:49.559> much

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
architecture is left over and how much

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.680 
architecture is left over and how much
does<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.100> impact<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:50.910> experience<00:00:51.480> with

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
quick fix is a hundred stars so I'll do

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.850 
quick fix is a hundred stars so I'll do
that<00:01:41.250> that's<00:01:41.880> not<00:01:41.970> too<00:01:42.240> bad<00:01:42.710> there<00:01:43.710> always

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
that that's not too bad there always

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.740 
that that's not too bad there always
seems<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.399> enough<00:01:44.670> currency<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.329> pay<00:01:45.479> for

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
seems to be enough currency to pay for

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.300 
seems to be enough currency to pay for
repairs<00:01:46.009> which<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.159> fine<00:01:47.570> but<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.920> mere<00:01:50.070> fact

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
that there is currency in a premium game

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.950

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
are

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.440 
are
tires<00:03:50.540> squealing<00:03:50.959> like<00:03:51.349> banshees<00:03:52.310> from<00:03:53.090> hell

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
tires squealing like banshees from hell

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.819 
tires squealing like banshees from hell
now<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.510> might<00:03:56.780> notice<00:03:56.930> there's<00:03:57.379> no<00:03:57.560> rearview

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
now you might notice there's no rearview

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.879 
now you might notice there's no rearview
mirror<00:03:58.420> or<00:03:59.420> side<00:03:59.780> mirrors<00:04:00.170> or<00:04:00.379> anything<00:04:00.739> the

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
mirror or side mirrors or anything the

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.440 
mirror or side mirrors or anything the
only<00:04:00.980> indicator<00:04:01.459> there's<00:04:01.760> someone<00:04:02.000> behind<00:04:02.150> me

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
only indicator there's someone behind me

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.809 
only indicator there's someone behind me
is<00:04:02.780> that<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:02.989> little<00:04:03.200> orange<00:04:03.739> yellow<00:04:04.159> triangle

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
is that a little orange yellow triangle

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.149 
is that a little orange yellow triangle
floating<00:04:05.209> around<00:04:05.299> the<00:04:05.510> bottom<00:04:05.719> of<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.870> screen

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
floating around the bottom of the screen

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.009 
floating around the bottom of the screen
very<00:04:07.159> very<00:04:07.639> slowly<00:04:07.999> around<00:04:08.269> this<00:04:08.480> corner

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
very very slowly around this corner

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.649 
very very slowly around this corner
painfully<00:04:09.739> slowly<00:04:10.010> in<00:04:10.280> fact<00:04:10.519> and<00:04:10.790> this<00:04:11.419> one

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
painfully slowly in fact and this one

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.509 
painfully slowly in fact and this one
too<00:04:11.840> it's<00:04:12.079> a<00:04:12.139> big<00:04:12.290> old<00:04:12.439> hairpin<00:04:12.859> there<00:04:13.250> we<00:04:13.370> go

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
too it's a big old hairpin there we go

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.529 
too it's a big old hairpin there we go
there's<00:04:14.120> also<00:04:14.299> no<00:04:14.629> map<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.729> can't<00:04:17.120> tell

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
there's also no map so I can't tell

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.270 
there's also no map so I can't tell
where<00:04:17.780> I'm<00:04:17.959> going<00:04:18.320> beyond<00:04:18.799> what<00:04:18.949> I<00:04:18.979> see<00:04:19.160> in

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
where I'm going beyond what I see in

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.570 
where I'm going beyond what I see in
front<00:04:19.340> of<00:04:19.549> me<00:04:19.699> again<00:04:20.239> maybe<00:04:20.479> that's<00:04:20.690> a

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
front of me again maybe that's a

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.620 
front of me again maybe that's a
realistic<00:04:22.580> thing<00:04:22.820> they're<00:04:23.180> going<00:04:23.360> for<00:04:23.509> the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
realistic thing they're going for the

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.719 
realistic thing they're going for the
realism<00:04:24.020> edge<00:04:24.289> there's<00:04:24.650> no<00:04:24.919> virtual<00:04:25.550> map

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729

floating<00:04:26.180> up<00:04:26.270> in<00:04:26.389> my<00:04:26.509> car<00:04:26.750> most<00:04:26.960> of<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.169> time

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
floating up in my car most of the time

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.350 
floating up in my car most of the time
apart<00:04:28.669> from<00:04:28.759> sat-nav<00:04:30.610> but<00:04:31.610> either<00:04:31.789> way<00:04:31.970> makes

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
apart from sat-nav but either way makes

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.450 
apart from sat-nav but either way makes
it<00:04:32.479> difficult<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.930> see<00:04:33.039> what's<00:04:34.039> coming<00:04:34.280> ahead

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
it difficult to see what's coming ahead

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.070 
it difficult to see what's coming ahead
and<00:04:34.880> it's<00:04:35.090> also<00:04:35.240> kind<00:04:35.419> of<00:04:35.539> difficult<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:35.900> tell

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
and it's also kind of difficult to tell

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.860 
and it's also kind of difficult to tell
how<00:04:36.740> far<00:04:37.070> behind<00:04:37.250> me<00:04:37.520> they<00:04:37.820> are<00:04:37.849> I<00:04:38.240> don't<00:04:38.720> know

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
how far behind me they are I don't know

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.770 
how far behind me they are I don't know

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
if this guy's right on my heels or not

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.100 
if this guy's right on my heels or not
which<00:04:41.780> is<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:41.930> little<00:04:42.199> bit<00:04:42.289> strange<00:04:44.110> the

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
which is a little bit strange the

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.930 
which is a little bit strange the
visuals<00:04:45.530> are<00:04:45.680> relatively<00:04:46.310> smart<00:04:46.580> these

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
visuals are relatively smart these

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.719 
visuals are relatively smart these
things<00:04:47.180> always<00:04:47.360> look<00:04:47.449> kind<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:48.130> clean<00:04:49.130> very

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
things always look kind of clean very

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.040 
things always look kind of clean very
clean<00:04:50.060> to<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.360> point<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.659> looking<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:51.020> little

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
clean to the point of looking a little

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:58.460 
clean to the point of looking a little
bit<00:04:52.449> clinical<00:04:53.449> if<00:04:53.780> you<00:04:54.020> know<00:04:54.139> what<00:04:54.259> I<00:04:54.289> mean

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.680 

the<00:04:59.010> reason<00:04:59.280> I've<00:04:59.400> tended<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.090> lean<00:05:00.270> towards

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
the reason I've tended to lean towards

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.080 
the reason I've tended to lean towards
arcade<00:05:01.050> races<00:05:01.470> recently<00:05:01.950> is<00:05:02.040> that<00:05:02.070> while<00:05:03.060> I

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
arcade races recently is that while I

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.640 
arcade races recently is that while I

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.920 
was impressed when Gran Turismo
originally<00:05:05.370> came<00:05:05.580> out<00:05:05.760> in<00:05:06.000> on<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.210> ps1<00:05:06.570> and

Turismo 5 it all starts feeling a bit

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.920 
Turismo 5 it all starts feeling a bit
sterile<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:25.520> there<00:05:26.520> was<00:05:26.610> less<00:05:26.790> fun<00:05:27.240> involved

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
sterile and there was less fun involved

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.020 
sterile and there was less fun involved
in<00:05:28.230> it<00:05:28.350> I<00:05:28.470> thought<00:05:28.800> it's<00:05:29.430> great<00:05:29.610> if<00:05:29.760> you<00:05:29.880> are<00:05:30.000> a

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
in it I thought it's great if you are a

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.610 
in it I thought it's great if you are a
real<00:05:30.240> petrol<00:05:30.930> head<00:05:31.080> obviously<00:05:31.650> but<00:05:32.280> um<00:05:33.500> it<00:05:34.500> all

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
real petrol head obviously but um it all

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.140 
real petrol head obviously but um it all
becomes<00:05:34.980> a<00:05:35.130> little<00:05:35.250> bit<00:05:35.400> too<00:05:35.790> much<00:05:35.910> about

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
becomes a little bit too much about

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.290 
becomes a little bit too much about
menus<00:05:36.660> and<00:05:36.930> and<00:05:37.170> balancing<00:05:37.950> and<00:05:38.130> stuff<00:05:38.760> that<00:05:38.790> I

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
menus and and balancing and stuff that I

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.510 
menus and and balancing and stuff that I
don't<00:05:40.110> know<00:05:40.200> it<00:05:40.500> just<00:05:40.650> never<00:05:40.740> felt<00:05:41.010> as<00:05:41.250> as

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
don't know it just never felt as as

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.130 
don't know it just never felt as as
entertaining<00:05:42.120> in<00:05:42.540> that<00:05:42.720> kind<00:05:42.930> of<00:05:42.990> raw

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140
