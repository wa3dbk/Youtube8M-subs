I'm going to teach you how to put

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.599 
I'm going to teach you how to put
backspin<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> golf<00:00:21.600> ball<00:00:21.949> step<00:00:22.949> one<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
backspin on a golf ball step one is to

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.250 
backspin on a golf ball step one is to
transfer<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.330> little<00:00:24.480> bit<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.869> weight<00:00:25.050> across

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
transfer a little bit of weight across

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.189 
transfer a little bit of weight across
to<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> left-hand<00:00:26.130> side<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.240> 60<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.779> 70%

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
to the left-hand side so that 60 to 70%

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.700 
to the left-hand side so that 60 to 70%
of<00:00:28.619> our<00:00:28.710> weight<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.189> our<00:00:29.550> left<00:00:29.820> foot<00:00:30.619> from<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
of our weight is on our left foot from a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.650 
of our weight is on our left foot from a
normal<00:00:32.009> golf<00:00:32.130> setup<00:00:32.489> position<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.329> need

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
normal golf setup position we just need

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.250 
normal golf setup position we just need
to<00:00:33.750> open<00:00:33.780> up<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> club<00:00:34.440> very<00:00:34.649> slightly<00:00:35.070> and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
to open up the club very slightly and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.410 
to open up the club very slightly and
then<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.469> grip<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.010> also<00:00:38.670> draw<00:00:39.030> our<00:00:39.180> left

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
then we grip it and also draw our left

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.360 
then we grip it and also draw our left
foot<00:00:39.570> back<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> body<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.739> very<00:00:40.860> slightly

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
foot back so the body is very slightly

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.690 
foot back so the body is very slightly
open<00:00:41.899> step<00:00:42.899> three<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.340> wrist

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
open step three is to the wrist

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.040 
open step three is to the wrist
immediately<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:46.050> backswing<00:00:47.719> you<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.870> see

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
immediately on the backswing you can see

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.330 
immediately on the backswing you can see
that<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> club<00:00:49.500> head<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.710> moved<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.129> long<00:00:50.280> way

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
that the club head is moved a long way

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.020 
that the club head is moved a long way
my<00:00:51.120> arm<00:00:51.300> hasn't<00:00:51.510> moved<00:00:51.719> very<00:00:51.899> far<00:00:52.730> step<00:00:53.730> four

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
my arm hasn't moved very far step four

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.029 
my arm hasn't moved very far step four
is<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.449> make<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> swing<00:00:54.989> making<00:00:55.410> sure<00:00:55.649> that

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
is to make the swing making sure that

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.220 
is to make the swing making sure that
the<00:00:56.160> hands<00:00:56.670> lead<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> club<00:00:57.510> head<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> way

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the hands lead the club head all the way

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.400 
the hands lead the club head all the way
through<00:00:58.559> impact

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.590 

Step<00:01:07.410> five<00:01:07.440> is<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.010> make<00:01:08.280> sure<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:09.120> catch<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
Step five is to make sure we catch the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.930 
Step five is to make sure we catch the
ball<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:10.170> before<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.620> ground<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.760> make

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
ball just before the ground and we make

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.600 
ball just before the ground and we make
an<00:01:12.090> accelerating<00:01:12.810> swing<00:01:13.170> into<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.860> ball<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
an accelerating swing into the ball to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.910 
an accelerating swing into the ball to
do<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:15.140> make<00:01:16.140> sure<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.380> don't<00:01:16.530> swing<00:01:16.770> back

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
do this make sure you don't swing back

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.640 
do this make sure you don't swing back
too<00:01:17.130> far<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:18.750> you're<00:01:18.870> accelerating

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
too far and that you're accelerating

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.080 
too far and that you're accelerating
nicely<00:01:20.310> into<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> golf<00:01:20.790> ball<00:01:25.790> okay<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
nicely into the golf ball okay so the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.580 
nicely into the golf ball okay so the
first<00:01:27.210> thing<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.479> remember<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.470> we

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
first thing to remember is that we

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.890 
first thing to remember is that we
transfer<00:01:28.830> about<00:01:29.280> 60%<00:01:30.210> percent<00:01:30.510> well<00:01:30.690> weight

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
transfer about 60% percent well weight

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.469 
transfer about 60% percent well weight
to<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.170> left-hand<00:01:31.590> side<00:01:31.880> but<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:33.000> open<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
to the left-hand side but we open up the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.350 
to the left-hand side but we open up the
club<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.080> body<00:01:34.260> just<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.680> touch<00:01:35.090> we<00:01:36.090> break

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
club and the body just to touch we break

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.330 
club and the body just to touch we break
the<00:01:36.510> wrists<00:01:36.840> immediately<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.920> backswing

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
the wrists immediately on the backswing

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.040 
the wrists immediately on the backswing
and<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.030> leave<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> hands<00:01:39.900> going

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
and we leave with the hands going

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.590 
and we leave with the hands going
through<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.650> finally<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:42.030> make<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.390> nice

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
through and finally to make a nice

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.560 
through and finally to make a nice
accelerating<00:01:43.380> swing<00:01:43.680> through<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.160> golf<00:01:44.340> ball

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
accelerating swing through the golf ball

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.590 
accelerating swing through the golf ball
and<00:01:46.160> that's<00:01:47.160> how<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.430> put<00:01:47.700> backspin<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.300> a<00:01:48.420> go

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and that's how to put backspin on a go

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.840 
and that's how to put backspin on a go
