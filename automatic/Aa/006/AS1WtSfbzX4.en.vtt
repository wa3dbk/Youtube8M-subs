defenses are in the core and most of the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.810 
defenses are in the core and most of the
outer<00:00:17.880> defenses<00:00:18.690> are<00:00:18.900> pretty<00:00:19.260> good<00:00:19.500> for<00:00:20.490> lava

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820

holo attack so the main idea will be

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.300 
holo attack so the main idea will be
during<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.810> clan<00:00:28.109> castle<00:00:28.140> taking<00:00:28.949> them<00:00:29.130> out

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
on the left corner and the idea of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.969 
on the left corner and the idea of
gathering<00:01:06.390> them<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.080> left<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.560> because

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
gathering them on the left is because

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.890 
gathering them on the left is because
that's<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> location<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> Queen<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.689> I'm

not gonna use a balloon drop on them

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.120 
not gonna use a balloon drop on them
it's<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.150> total<00:01:12.570> waste<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:13.020> troops<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:14.040> I'm

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
them you don't have to gather them fully

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.109

2+1<00:02:16.079> that's<00:02:16.590> 3<00:02:16.950> 5<00:02:17.310> 7<00:02:17.700> 9<00:02:18.890> 11<00:02:19.890> 12<00:02:21.650> 14<00:02:22.670> 16<00:02:23.670> 18<00:02:26.599> about

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
2+1 that's 3 5 7 9 11 12 14 16 18 about

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.179 
2+1 that's 3 5 7 9 11 12 14 16 18 about
20<00:02:28.079> balloons<00:02:28.409> and<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:29.400> think<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.849> took<00:02:29.909> some<00:02:30.900> more

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
20 balloons and I think I took some more

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.130 
20 balloons and I think I took some more
maybe<00:02:32.189> 22<00:02:32.760> or<00:02:32.849> 24<00:02:33.359> I<00:02:33.420> don't<00:02:33.629> remember<00:02:33.810> exactly

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
maybe 22 or 24 I don't remember exactly

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.339 
maybe 22 or 24 I don't remember exactly
so<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.950> took<00:02:35.069> few<00:02:35.459> more<00:02:36.000> as<00:02:36.209> extra<00:02:36.900> balloons<00:02:37.200> you

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
so I took few more as extra balloons you

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.910 
so I took few more as extra balloons you
never<00:02:37.560> know<00:02:37.769> what<00:02:38.579> happened<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.569> about<00:02:40.379> 24

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
never know what happened so about 24

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.470 
never know what happened so about 24
billions<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.370> good<00:02:41.579> enough<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:41.970> once<00:02:42.239> all<00:02:42.450> of

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
billions is good enough and once all of

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.710 
billions is good enough and once all of
the<00:02:42.689> of<00:02:43.590> those<00:02:43.890> defenses<00:02:44.370> are<00:02:44.519> down<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:45.540> can

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
the of those defenses are down you can

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.509 
the of those defenses are down you can
send<00:02:46.129> hogs<00:02:47.389> right<00:02:48.389> into<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.870> core<00:02:49.159> so<00:02:50.159> that's

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
send hogs right into the core so that's

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.110 
send hogs right into the core so that's
going<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.819> be<00:02:50.879> hogs<00:02:51.329> and<00:02:52.459> all<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.790> troops

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
going to be hogs and all of the troops

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.259 
going to be hogs and all of the troops
are<00:02:54.269> all<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> spells<00:02:55.109> are<00:02:55.349> gonna<00:02:55.500> be<00:02:55.739> used

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
are all of the spells are gonna be used

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.410 
are all of the spells are gonna be used
in<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.510> core<00:02:57.889> because<00:02:58.889> there<00:02:59.489> is<00:02:59.579> no<00:02:59.879> reason

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
in the core because there is no reason

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.899 
in the core because there is no reason
to<00:03:00.720> use<00:03:01.049> any<00:03:01.319> spells<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.430> outside<00:03:02.790> the

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
to use any spells to the outside the

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.910 
to use any spells to the outside the
fences<00:03:03.299> those<00:03:03.599> rules<00:03:03.900> are<00:03:04.019> totally<00:03:04.500> enough<00:03:04.739> to

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
fences those rules are totally enough to

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.190 
fences those rules are totally enough to
get<00:03:05.099> those<00:03:05.310> down<00:03:05.579> and<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.780> going<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.049> be<00:03:07.170> a

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
get those down and it's going to be a

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.440 
get those down and it's going to be a
very<00:03:07.260> easy<00:03:07.650> attack<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.609> would<00:03:08.879> work<00:03:09.120> even

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
very easy attack and it would work even

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.339 
very easy attack and it would work even
if<00:03:09.720> if<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.139> base<00:03:10.379> was<00:03:11.090> with<00:03:12.090> higher<00:03:12.900> level

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
if if that base was with higher level

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.349 
if if that base was with higher level
defenses<00:03:13.889> as<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.250> can<00:03:14.400> see<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.639> whiskers<00:03:15.000> are

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
defenses as you can see the whiskers are

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.689 
defenses as you can see the whiskers are
maxed<00:03:16.109> and<00:03:16.230> some<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.950> arch<00:03:17.099> towers<00:03:17.489> and

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:17.699 
maxed and some of the arch towers and

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:21.229 
maxed and some of the arch towers and
cannons<00:03:18.150> are<00:03:18.389> maxed<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.669> it<00:03:20.669> would<00:03:20.910> work<00:03:21.180> very

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
cannons are maxed so it would work very

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.449 
cannons are maxed so it would work very
well<00:03:21.690> because<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.620> doesn't<00:03:23.040> really<00:03:23.190> matter

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
well because it doesn't really matter

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.610 
well because it doesn't really matter
the<00:03:23.790> level<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.180> your<00:03:24.239> defenses<00:03:24.959> they're<00:03:25.169> not<00:03:25.410> a

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
the level of your defenses they're not a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.530 
the level of your defenses they're not a
factor<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:26.579> kind<00:03:26.849> of<00:03:26.940> attack<00:03:27.209> because

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
factor in this kind of attack because

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.990 
factor in this kind of attack because
they<00:03:27.690> are<00:03:27.750> very<00:03:27.810> centered<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.829> are<00:03:29.819> not

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
they are very centered and are not

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.140 
they are very centered and are not
affecting<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:31.349> outer<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:32.519> outer<00:03:32.639> part<00:03:33.030> of

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
affecting the outer the outer part of

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.420 
affecting the outer the outer part of
the<00:03:33.209> base<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:34.079> let's<00:03:34.739> see<00:03:34.889> the<00:03:35.040> attack<00:03:35.280> now<00:03:37.430> so

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
the base so let's see the attack now so

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.360 
the base so let's see the attack now so
this<00:03:39.150> war<00:03:39.419> is<00:03:39.540> pretty<00:03:39.810> much<00:03:40.019> over<00:03:40.260> but<00:03:40.620> i'm

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
this war is pretty much over but i'm

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.689 
this war is pretty much over but i'm
gonna<00:03:41.609> do<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.790> cleanup<00:03:42.150> attack<00:03:42.599> on<00:03:42.930> number<00:03:44.180> 11

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
gonna do a cleanup attack on number 11

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.360 
gonna do a cleanup attack on number 11
that's<00:03:47.699> the<00:03:47.909> base<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.359> i'm<00:03:48.479> gonna<00:03:48.659> do<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:49.370> holo

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
that's the base and i'm gonna do a holo

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.420 
that's the base and i'm gonna do a holo
attack<00:03:50.819> because<00:03:51.569> your<00:03:52.560> defenses<00:03:53.069> are<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.310> the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
attack because your defenses are in the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.629 
attack because your defenses are in the
center<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:53.819> i<00:03:54.030> kan<00:03:54.269> doen<00:03:55.310> all<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.519> the

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
center and i kan doen all of the

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.780 
center and i kan doen all of the
defense's<00:03:57.829> outside<00:03:58.829> so<00:03:59.129> the<00:03:59.340> plan<00:03:59.519> is<00:03:59.549> going

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
defense's outside so the plan is going

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.360 
defense's outside so the plan is going
to<00:03:59.849> be<00:03:59.970> sent<00:04:00.269> two<00:04:00.720> balloons<00:04:01.019> at<00:04:01.440> they<00:04:02.069> searched

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
to be sent two balloons at they searched

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.740 
to be sent two balloons at they searched
our<00:04:02.639> and<00:04:02.940> get<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.959> clan<00:04:04.169> castle<00:04:04.199> troops<00:04:04.560> out

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
our and get the clan castle troops out

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.369 
our and get the clan castle troops out
get<00:04:06.750> rid<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.019> them<00:04:07.290> somehow<00:04:07.590> okay<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:09.379> then

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
get rid of them somehow okay and then

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.379 
get rid of them somehow okay and then
attack<00:04:10.709> from<00:04:10.949> this<00:04:11.159> direction<00:04:11.340> with<00:04:11.909> a<00:04:11.940> golem

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
attack from this direction with a golem

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.699 
attack from this direction with a golem
and<00:04:12.569> few<00:04:12.989> Wizards<00:04:13.169> and<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.650> King<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.849> take<00:04:15.030> out

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
and few Wizards and the King to take out

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.469 
and few Wizards and the King to take out
the<00:04:16.709> Queen<00:04:17.010> as<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.400> can<00:04:17.549> see<00:04:17.729> she<00:04:17.789> jumps<00:04:18.299> out

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
the Queen as you can see she jumps out

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.930 
the Queen as you can see she jumps out
of<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.900> walls<00:04:19.409> so<00:04:20.010> it<00:04:20.220> should<00:04:20.430> be<00:04:20.459> easy<00:04:20.609> to

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
of the walls so it should be easy to

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.300 
of the walls so it should be easy to
take<00:04:21.209> her<00:04:21.389> out<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.870> after<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.740> i'm<00:04:23.039> going<00:04:23.219> to

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
take her out and after that i'm going to

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.899 
take her out and after that i'm going to
start<00:04:24.620> dropping<00:04:25.620> balloons<00:04:25.979> about<00:04:26.430> two

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
start dropping balloons about two

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:27.740 
start dropping balloons about two
balloons<00:04:27.210> at

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
balloons at

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.360 
balloons at
each<00:04:27.870> defense<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.890> shoots<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:31.800> shoots<00:04:32.070> air

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
each defense that shoots that shoots air

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.590 
each defense that shoots that shoots air
