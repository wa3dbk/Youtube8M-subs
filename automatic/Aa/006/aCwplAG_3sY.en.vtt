spider will cost every 40 seconds next

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.430 
spider will cost every 40 seconds next
one<00:00:05.040> down<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.299> the<00:00:06.299> one<00:00:07.639> is<00:00:09.440> an<00:00:10.440> example<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
one down is the one is an example of the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.859 
one down is the one is an example of the
four<00:00:13.440> do<00:00:13.590> statement<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.849> one<00:00:15.089> will<00:00:15.330> check<00:00:16.699> PL

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
four do statement this one will check PL

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.220 
four do statement this one will check PL
so<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.830> my<00:00:20.550> table<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.449> my<00:00:21.600> map<00:00:22.519> here's<00:00:23.519> my<00:00:23.580> map

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
so in my table on my map here's my map

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.750 
so in my table on my map here's my map
my<00:00:25.230> table<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.800> my<00:00:25.920> map<00:00:26.130> my<00:00:26.820> team<00:00:27.060> settings<00:00:27.599> I

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
my table on my map my team settings I

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.870 
my table on my map my team settings I
have<00:00:29.760> my<00:00:30.920> play<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:31.949> called<00:00:32.369> PL<00:00:32.880> play<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> one<00:00:34.880> as

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
have my play is called PL play a one as

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.790 
have my play is called PL play a one as
you<00:00:36.120> see<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.600> got<00:00:36.989> rid<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.320> Capitals

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
you see it I got rid of the Capitals

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.229 
you see it I got rid of the Capitals
because<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.190> found<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.610> annoying<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.000> put<00:00:39.149> that

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
because I found it annoying to put that

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.310 
because I found it annoying to put that
in<00:00:39.360> every<00:00:39.450> single<00:00:39.750> time<00:00:40.579> go<00:00:41.579> back<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.450> code

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.860 

so<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.590> code<00:00:46.860> here<00:00:46.969> checks<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.539> on

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
so this code here checks the on

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.709 
so this code here checks the on
conditions<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.820> whether<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.030> player<00:00:51.270> squad

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
conditions for whether the player squad

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.639 
conditions for whether the player squad
is<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.260> range<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.489> player<00:00:53.789> squad<00:00:54.649> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
is in range and the player squad the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.139 
is in range and the player squad the
player<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.730> checking<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:58.969> PR<00:00:59.969> player

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
player it's checking for is PR player

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.149 
player it's checking for is PR player
whatever<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.719> whatever<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.530> is

whatever this is and whatever this is is

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
put it in your code needs to be followed

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.320 
put it in your code needs to be followed
by<00:01:16.140> two<00:01:16.200> dots<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.369> anything<00:01:17.640> after

here say for example mob

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.300 
here say for example mob
then<00:01:27.079> you<00:01:27.380> will<00:01:27.530> need<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.799> add<00:01:28.100> two<00:01:28.939> dots<00:01:29.229> after

then you will need to add two dots after

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.249 
then you will need to add two dots after

you'll<00:03:06.180> notice<00:03:06.450> here<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.690> have<00:03:07.019> zero

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
you'll notice here I have zero

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.300 
you'll notice here I have zero
conditions<00:03:08.690> this<00:03:09.690> sort<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.590> statement<00:03:10.860> you

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
conditions this sort of statement you

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.940 
conditions this sort of statement you
use<00:03:11.700> for<00:03:12.239> setting<00:03:12.720> variables<00:03:13.170> at<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.680> start

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
use for setting variables at the start

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.309 
use for setting variables at the start
of<00:03:14.010> your<00:03:14.100> map<00:03:14.330> if<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.450> has<00:03:15.569> zero<00:03:15.810> conditions

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
of your map if it has zero conditions

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.600 
of your map if it has zero conditions
then<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.680> will<00:03:16.769> run<00:03:16.950> at<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.130> very<00:03:17.310> start<00:03:17.400> of

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
then it will run at the very start of

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.640 
then it will run at the very start of
the<00:03:17.730> map<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:19.640> I'm<00:03:20.640> one<00:03:20.970> time<00:03:21.150> event<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:22.560> will

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
the map so I'm one time event it will

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.640 
the map so I'm one time event it will
only<00:03:22.799> happen<00:03:23.040> once<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:24.600> entire<00:03:24.959> time<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.470> map

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
only happen once the entire time the map

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.690 
only happen once the entire time the map
runs<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:27.510> will<00:03:27.660> be<00:03:27.750> at<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.989> very<00:03:28.170> start

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
runs and that will be at the very start

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.089 
runs and that will be at the very start
because<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:29.790> those<00:03:29.910> conditions<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.950> will

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
because of those conditions and it will

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.000 
because of those conditions and it will
turn<00:03:32.250> off<00:03:32.400> these<00:03:32.640> effects<00:03:33.680> which<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.830> let<00:03:34.950> a

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
turn off these effects which I let a

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.699 
turn off these effects which I let a
turn<00:03:35.280> on<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.610> map<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:37.140> will<00:03:37.319> set<00:03:37.560> a

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
turn on the map and it will set a

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.360 
turn on the map and it will set a
variable<00:03:38.130> 20<00:03:39.560> basically<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.769> set<00:03:41.250> up<00:03:41.340> my

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
variable 20 basically I set up my

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
variable 20 basically I set up my
variables<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:43.190> make<00:03:44.190> sure<00:03:44.220> any<00:03:44.940> effects<00:03:45.239> are

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
variables and make sure any effects are

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.099 
variables and make sure any effects are
off<00:03:45.540> I<00:03:45.930> get<00:03:46.380> my<00:03:46.500> on<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:48.750> wait<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.900> turn

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
off I get my on that I can wait a turn

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:56.530 
off I get my on that I can wait a turn
on<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:50.570> yeah<00:03:51.620> next<00:03:52.620> one<00:03:52.799> is<00:03:53.010> my<00:03:53.609> own<00:03:54.150> event<00:03:54.540> I

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
on and yeah next one is my own event I

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.940 
on and yeah next one is my own event I
did<00:03:57.540> cut<00:03:57.780> out<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:58.109> little<00:03:58.290> bit<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.590> this<00:03:58.709> code

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
did cut out a little bit of this code

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.979 
did cut out a little bit of this code
because<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.220> was<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> little<00:03:59.579> complex<00:04:00.390> for<00:04:00.930> an

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
because it was a little complex for an

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.250 
because it was a little complex for an
example<00:04:01.549> but<00:04:02.549> I'll<00:04:03.209> explain<00:04:03.720> this<00:04:03.900> little

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
example but I'll explain this little

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.650 
example but I'll explain this little
section<00:04:04.410> here

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
section here

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.030 
section here
for<00:04:06.290> this<00:04:06.410> one<00:04:07.990> it<00:04:08.990> checks<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.710> see<00:04:09.890> if<00:04:09.920> the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
for this one it checks to see if the

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.720 
for this one it checks to see if the
boss<00:04:10.310> is<00:04:10.340> alive<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.120> if<00:04:11.540> he's<00:04:11.780> two<00:04:12.170> ads<00:04:12.730> on

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
boss is alive and if he's two ads on

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.780 
boss is alive and if he's two ads on
dead<00:04:14.180> if<00:04:14.990> the<00:04:15.530> bus<00:04:15.710> is<00:04:15.740> alive<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.400> he's<00:04:16.610> two

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
dead if the bus is alive and he's two

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:26.170 
dead if the bus is alive and he's two
ads<00:04:17.060> of<00:04:17.239> dead<00:04:17.680> we<00:04:18.680> will<00:04:22.570> spawn<00:04:24.640> he's<00:04:25.640> two<00:04:25.970> ads

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
ads of dead we will spawn he's two ads

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.550 
ads of dead we will spawn he's two ads
again<00:04:28.300> you<00:04:29.300> can<00:04:29.450> just<00:04:29.600> ignore<00:04:29.750> this<00:04:30.260> little

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
again you can just ignore this little

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.040 
again you can just ignore this little
section<00:04:30.740> here<00:04:30.950> that's<00:04:31.400> basically<00:04:32.360> a<00:04:32.480> variable

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
section here that's basically a variable

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.280 
section here that's basically a variable
of<00:04:33.230> what<00:04:34.210> card<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.510> play<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:37.930> this<00:04:38.930> one<00:04:39.140> down

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
of what card to play and this one down

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.230 
of what card to play and this one down
here<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:41.060> just<00:04:41.270> checks<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.350> see<00:04:42.590> if<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.580> timer

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
here it just checks to see if the timer

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.470 
here it just checks to see if the timer
has<00:04:44.750> run<00:04:45.130> or<00:04:46.130> we<00:04:46.520> start<00:04:46.760> some<00:04:46.910> time<00:04:47.060> line<00:04:47.240> I

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
has run or we start some time line I

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.870 
has run or we start some time line I
originally<00:04:48.080> had<00:04:48.350> a<00:04:48.470> check<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.550> see<00:04:49.730> at<00:04:49.790> the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
originally had a check to see at the

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.310 
originally had a check to see at the
time<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.120> had<00:04:50.300> passed<00:04:50.690> a<00:04:50.840> certain<00:04:51.080> amount<00:04:51.230> of

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
time I had passed a certain amount of

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.700 
time I had passed a certain amount of
time<00:04:51.530> so<00:04:51.860> it<00:04:51.980> was<00:04:52.100> born<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:53.420> ads<00:04:53.570> every<00:04:54.410> X<00:04:54.590> in

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
time so it was born the ads every X in

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.540 
time so it was born the ads every X in
10<00:04:54.890> seconds<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:55.790> you<00:04:55.880> had<00:04:56.000> time<00:04:56.240> to<00:04:56.480> enhance

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.300 

yeah<00:05:01.550> that<00:05:01.730> basically<00:05:02.240> covers<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.810> scripting

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
yeah that basically covers the scripting

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.310 
yeah that basically covers the scripting
you'll<00:05:04.310> notice<00:05:04.640> my<00:05:04.850> scripting<00:05:05.300> goes<00:05:05.570> in<00:05:05.900> and

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
you'll notice my scripting goes in and

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.720 
you'll notice my scripting goes in and
out<00:05:06.470> a<00:05:06.830> lot<00:05:08.050> I'll<00:05:09.050> explain<00:05:09.530> why<00:05:09.800> I<00:05:09.830> do<00:05:10.010> that<00:05:12.730> ok

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
out a lot I'll explain why I do that ok

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.560 
out a lot I'll explain why I do that ok
it's<00:05:14.330> full<00:05:15.760> here<00:05:16.760> we<00:05:16.880> go<00:05:17.030> would<00:05:17.210> go<00:05:17.300> with<00:05:17.450> this

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
it's full here we go would go with this

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:25.210 
it's full here we go would go with this
one<00:05:19.990> state<00:05:21.580> will<00:05:22.580> start<00:05:23.120> on<00:05:23.390> the<00:05:24.320> base<00:05:24.530> on<00:05:25.070> the

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
one state will start on the base on the

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.680 
one state will start on the base on the
far<00:05:25.400> left<00:05:25.700> you'll<00:05:28.180> document<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:29.360> then<00:05:29.390> you

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
far left you'll document and then you

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.230 
far left you'll document and then you
need<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:29.990> tap<00:05:30.770> in<00:05:31.010> every<00:05:31.460> time<00:05:31.669> you<00:05:31.790> move<00:05:31.940> up<00:05:32.090> a

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
need to tap in every time you move up a

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.010 
need to tap in every time you move up a
level<00:05:32.360> in<00:05:32.630> your<00:05:32.780> code<00:05:34.240> so<00:05:35.240> your<00:05:35.600> state<00:05:35.810> names

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
level in your code so your state names

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.400 
level in your code so your state names
we<00:05:36.350> your<00:05:37.150> statements<00:05:38.150> will<00:05:38.270> be<00:05:38.300> one<00:05:38.930> in<00:05:39.140> and

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
we your statements will be one in and

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.220 
we your statements will be one in and
then<00:05:40.150> you<00:05:41.150> need<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:41.390> tap<00:05:41.600> in<00:05:41.810> for<00:05:42.020> your

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
then you need to tap in for your

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.350 
then you need to tap in for your
conditions<00:05:42.710> and<00:05:42.980> then<00:05:43.400> if<00:05:44.000> we<00:05:44.150> put<00:05:44.330> a

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
conditions and then if we put a

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.880 
conditions and then if we put a
condition<00:05:44.570> in<00:05:44.870> here<00:05:45.220> we<00:05:46.220> would<00:05:46.460> top<00:05:47.180> it<00:05:47.210> across

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
condition in here we would top it across

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.710 
condition in here we would top it across
12<00:05:48.890> here<00:05:49.220> for<00:05:50.030> the<00:05:50.150> opening<00:05:50.480> of<00:05:50.570> that

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
12 here for the opening of that

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.740 
12 here for the opening of that
condition<00:05:50.900> which<00:05:52.210> I'm<00:05:53.210> thinking<00:05:53.540> of<00:05:53.630> an

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
condition which I'm thinking of an

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.480 
condition which I'm thinking of an
example<00:05:54.260> also<00:05:54.410> we'll<00:05:54.830> just<00:05:54.980> grab<00:05:55.100> one<00:05:55.370> from

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
example also we'll just grab one from

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.640 
example also we'll just grab one from
over<00:05:55.730> here

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
over here

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:04.420 
over here
grab<00:05:58.370> that<00:06:00.009> tub<00:06:01.009> in<00:06:01.280> your<00:06:01.910> condition<00:06:03.130> as<00:06:04.130> you

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
grab that tub in your condition as you

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.249 
grab that tub in your condition as you
can<00:06:04.550> see<00:06:04.759> here<00:06:05.060> and<00:06:05.240> then<00:06:05.389> open<00:06:05.750> your<00:06:05.810> bracket

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
can see here and then open your bracket

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:11.409 
can see here and then open your bracket
and<00:06:07.120> then<00:06:08.120> you<00:06:08.240> need<00:06:08.360> to<00:06:08.479> tab<00:06:08.750> in<00:06:08.990> your<00:06:10.419> next

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
and then you need to tab in your next

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.730 
and then you need to tab in your next
two<00:06:11.570> parts<00:06:12.430> all<00:06:13.430> three<00:06:14.000> parts<00:06:14.560> this<00:06:15.560> is

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
two parts all three parts this is

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.680 
two parts all three parts this is
basically<00:06:16.160> makes<00:06:16.460> it<00:06:16.580> nice<00:06:16.759> and<00:06:16.970> easy<00:06:17.090> to<00:06:17.419> read

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
basically makes it nice and easy to read

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.400 
basically makes it nice and easy to read
and<00:06:19.479> that<00:06:20.479> way<00:06:20.600> people<00:06:20.780> can<00:06:21.020> follow<00:06:21.199> your

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
and that way people can follow your

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.680 
and that way people can follow your
cloud<00:06:21.680> easier<00:06:22.190> and<00:06:22.460> you<00:06:23.060> can<00:06:23.240> follow<00:06:23.419> your<00:06:23.600> own

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
cloud easier and you can follow your own

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.020 
cloud easier and you can follow your own
code<00:06:23.960> easier<00:06:25.360> I<00:06:27.490> think<00:06:28.490> that<00:06:28.610> basically

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
code easier I think that basically

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.080 
code easier I think that basically
covers<00:06:29.150> a<00:06:29.509> scripting
