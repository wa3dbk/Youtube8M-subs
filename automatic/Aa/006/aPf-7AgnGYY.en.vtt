00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
gameplay on this particular map I was

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.600 
gameplay on this particular map I was
wondering<00:01:01.979> why<00:01:02.040> I<00:01:02.070> was<00:01:02.159> having<00:01:02.430> such<00:01:02.549> a

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
wondering why I was having such a

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.660 
wondering why I was having such a
difficult<00:01:02.699> time<00:01:03.949> taking<00:01:04.949> down<00:01:05.280> enemies

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
difficult time taking down enemies

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.510 
difficult time taking down enemies
especially<00:01:05.880> close<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:07.190> medium<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.340> long

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
especially close in medium to long

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.780 
especially close in medium to long
distance<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.479> an-94<00:01:09.810> fires<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.790> two-round

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
distance the an-94 fires a two-round

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.370 
distance the an-94 fires a two-round
burst<00:01:11.940> which<00:01:12.479> puts<00:01:12.720> us<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.960> first<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
burst which puts us to the first in the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.109 
burst which puts us to the first in the
second<00:01:13.680> board<00:01:13.860> English<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.399> the<00:01:14.430> same<00:01:14.700> point

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
second board English on the same point

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.230 
second board English on the same point
that's<00:01:15.899> your<00:01:16.049> aiming<00:01:16.729> but<00:01:17.729> when<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.000> removed

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
that's your aiming but when you removed

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.410 
that's your aiming but when you removed
engaging<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.049> moving<00:01:19.409> target<00:01:19.649> close<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.789> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
engaging a moving target close in you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.529 
engaging a moving target close in you
have<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.689> wait<00:01:21.899> for<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.140> weapon<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.100> settle

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
have to wait for the weapon to settle

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.179 
have to wait for the weapon to settle
before<00:01:24.539> you<00:01:24.780> get<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.990> next<00:01:25.229> burst<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.680> target

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
before you get the next burst on target

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.830 
before you get the next burst on target
and<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.759> think<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.060> was<00:01:27.210> why<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.630> was<00:01:27.750> taking

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and I think that was why it was taking

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.840 
and I think that was why it was taking
me<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.439> long<00:01:28.469> take<00:01:28.950> some<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.250> these<00:01:29.310> through

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
me so long take some of these through

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.410 
me so long take some of these through
your<00:01:30.060> heart<00:01:30.509> hurts<00:01:30.719> down<00:01:30.930> at<00:01:31.259> close<00:01:31.469> range

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
your heart hurts down at close range

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.179 
your heart hurts down at close range
yeah<00:01:33.420> well<00:01:33.930> since<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.289> rate<00:01:34.469> of<00:01:34.500> fire<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:35.100> in

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
yeah well since the rate of fire be in

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.300 
yeah well since the rate of fire be in
ninety<00:01:35.460> four<00:01:35.670> things<00:01:35.969> at<00:01:36.119> 600<00:01:36.780> /<00:01:37.590> 1200

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
ninety four things at 600 / 1200

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.789 
ninety four things at 600 / 1200
theoretical<00:01:38.969> that<00:01:39.810> 1200<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.560> really

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
theoretical that 1200 is not really

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.069 
theoretical that 1200 is not really
achievable<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.429> real<00:01:41.579> life<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.509> 600

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
achievable in real life but the 600

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.690 
achievable in real life but the 600
years<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.859> managing<00:01:44.250> its<00:01:44.340> faster

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
years of this is managing its faster

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.190 
years of this is managing its faster
firing<00:01:44.880> weapons<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.539> these

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
firing weapons like these

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.180 
firing weapons like these
m16a3<00:01:47.200> or<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:49.230> falafels<00:01:50.230> doing<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:50.740> very<00:01:50.890> much

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
m16a3 or the falafels doing it very much

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.670 
m16a3 or the falafels doing it very much
but<00:01:51.820> when<00:01:52.180> you're<00:01:52.660> probably<00:01:53.020> taking<00:01:53.440> this

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
but when you're probably taking this

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.700 
but when you're probably taking this
weapon<00:01:54.120> around<00:01:55.120> the<00:01:55.270> map<00:01:55.480> you<00:01:56.470> have<00:01:56.560> to

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
rounds to defeat someone at hardcore and

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
five to six at range in normal I decided

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.920 
five to six at range in normal I decided
to<00:03:03.340> take<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.519> look<00:03:03.730> at<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:03.940> g3<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.540> see<00:03:04.720> if<00:03:04.810> this

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
to take a look at the g3 to see if this

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.229 
to take a look at the g3 to see if this
would<00:03:05.110> be<00:03:05.290> more<00:03:05.500> effective<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.820> g3

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
would be more effective and the g3

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.449 
would be more effective and the g3
causes<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.630> lot<00:03:07.810> more<00:03:07.959> damage<00:03:08.170> where<00:03:08.620> three

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
causes a lot more damage where three

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.940 
causes a lot more damage where three
bullets<00:03:10.209> will<00:03:10.360> take<00:03:10.570> your<00:03:10.780> enemy<00:03:11.380> down<00:03:11.530> close

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
bullets will take your enemy down close

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
bullets will take your enemy down close
and<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:13.720> only<00:03:13.930> in<00:03:14.200> hardcore<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:15.580> distance

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
and to only in hardcore and a distance

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.780 
and to only in hardcore and a distance
it'll<00:03:16.239> would<00:03:16.600> only<00:03:16.750> take<00:03:16.989> four<00:03:17.790> possibly

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
it'll would only take four possibly

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.479 
it'll would only take four possibly
maybe<00:03:19.060> five<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:20.170> I<00:03:21.040> found<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.459> could

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
maybe five and I found that I could

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.850 
maybe five and I found that I could
actually<00:03:21.970> hold<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.540> position<00:03:22.739> where<00:03:23.739> the

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
actually hold a position where the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.410 
actually hold a position where the
enemies<00:03:24.160> were<00:03:24.340> funneling<00:03:24.760> through<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.299> taken

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
enemies were funneling through and taken

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.850 
enemies were funneling through and taken
pretty<00:03:26.540> quickly<00:03:26.810> with<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.140> short<00:03:27.590> bursts

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
pretty quickly with the short bursts

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.080 
pretty quickly with the short bursts

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
from the g3 the weapon is very accurate

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.440 
from the g3 the weapon is very accurate
at<00:03:32.450> long<00:03:32.630> range<00:03:33.580> this<00:03:34.580> weapon<00:03:34.790> has<00:03:34.940> 20<00:03:35.300> in<00:03:35.390> the
