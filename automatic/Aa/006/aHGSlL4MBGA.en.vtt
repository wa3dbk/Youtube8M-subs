00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
God or provoke God that might actually

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.320 
God or provoke God that might actually
be<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.979> celestial<00:04:25.550> dragons<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:26.210> almost

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
be the celestial dragons and it almost

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.909 
be the celestial dragons and it almost
seems<00:04:26.600> like<00:04:26.660> they<00:04:26.960> might<00:04:26.990> be<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.470> natural
