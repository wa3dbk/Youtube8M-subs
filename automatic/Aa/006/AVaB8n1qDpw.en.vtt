00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.140 
it'll be ready to go all right so the
printer<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.799> by<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.040> way<00:03:15.189> the<00:03:15.400> exiting<00:03:15.939> for

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
printer and by the way the exiting for

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.119 
printer and by the way the exiting for
the<00:03:16.239> paper<00:03:16.449> is<00:03:16.660> right<00:03:16.840> on<00:03:16.959> top<00:03:17.230> fairly<00:03:17.769> handy<00:03:18.810> I

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
the paper is right on top fairly handy I

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.400 
the paper is right on top fairly handy I
believe<00:03:21.129> that<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.400> processor<00:03:22.120> runs<00:03:22.389> at<00:03:22.870> what

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
believe that the processor runs at what

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.759 
believe that the processor runs at what
is<00:03:23.500> this<00:03:23.650> 300<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.569> think<00:03:25.569> it's<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.840> 300<00:03:26.470> megahertz

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
is this 300 I think it's a 300 megahertz

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.930 
is this 300 I think it's a 300 megahertz
processor<00:03:28.199> as<00:03:29.199> I<00:03:29.379> said<00:03:29.680> it's<00:03:29.829> 16<00:03:30.190> pages<00:03:30.730> per

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
processor as I said it's 16 pages per

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.670
