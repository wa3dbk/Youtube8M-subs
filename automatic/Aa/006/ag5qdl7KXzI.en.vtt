suggestions for me and if I want to add
one<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.159> those<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.579> can<00:02:20.760> choose<00:02:21.060> where<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.420> want

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
one of those I can choose where I want

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.080 
one of those I can choose where I want
to<00:02:21.720> put<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.019> so<00:02:22.170> i<00:02:22.200> would<00:02:22.409> probably<00:02:22.709> put

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
to put it so i would probably put

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.410 
to put it so i would probably put
polygons<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.120> tech<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.849> then<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:27.000> course<00:02:27.060> you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
polygons in tech and then of course you

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.380 
polygons in tech and then of course you
can<00:02:27.569> actually<00:02:27.780> just<00:02:28.650> add<00:02:29.159> your<00:02:29.400> own<00:02:29.430> RSS<00:02:30.000> feed

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390
