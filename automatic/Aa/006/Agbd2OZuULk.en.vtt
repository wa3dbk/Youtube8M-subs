00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.730 
so we had the exciting discovery that we
actually<00:00:07.569> have<00:00:07.779> a<00:00:07.810> number<00:00:08.080> of<00:00:08.200> trees<00:00:08.710> and

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
actually have a number of trees and

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.640 
actually have a number of trees and
