00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello in this video lesson I'm going to give 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.620
 continuity to the previous two videos 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.300
 what I had done about the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.370
 Transformer for life lamp 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.980
 booming in 12 volts 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.929
 so here in this video specifically 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.140
 I'll teach you how does the measurement 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.660
 consumption of a circuit and how do you 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.510
 you can estimate the battery life 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.130
 feeding and circuit then I 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.920
 I got a team inside. 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.019
 I put the 10-ampere scale at 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.770
 tip in correct location 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.489
 the positive feeding it will be 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:43.170
 connected in series with a team inside then 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.129
 here I have the black tip connected in 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.100
 the inside of the team and the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.989
 will be connected to the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.579
 battery to power this 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.360
 circuit 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:02.550
 so with that we'll be able to know 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:06.270
 what current is being consumed 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.049
 for this circuit and based on that we 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.229
 we will be able to do the calculation and 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.630
 stimulating the duration of this battery is 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.310
 so here in the case 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.600
 I do not know if it's going to be legal to see. 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.799
 camera is the consumption of this circuit that 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.780
 is feeding this lamp 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:32.490
 in 12 volts is in the house of 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.880
 0.9 before or 900 mian loses then 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.640
 So we can know how long it's going. 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.369
 last battery with the circuit 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.560
 we do a very simple calculation 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.220
 I just explain that the lamp to stay 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.479
 It's better to see this calculation well. 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.700
 ever 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.710
 here for example I have a battery of 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.079
 12 volts which has a capacity of 7 amps 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.840
 the consumption of this circuit as we 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:06.159
 we measured was 0.9 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.429
 up to 900 skin family and then there we are 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.550
 estimate the duration of the 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.879
 the battery life we're going to do 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:21.640
 will divide the capacity which is 7 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:26.200
 amperes by 0.9 amperes which is the consumption 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.099
 of the circuit and in this case here gave 7.7 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.200
 hours 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.690
 Of course people here are thinking. 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.690
 at best, that is, it is 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.730
 new drummer that the battery is with 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.940
 the total load capacity in it and that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.280
 this will work in this range the ideal 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.900
 for us to have a more secure estimate 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.620
 Are we always going back a little? 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.629
 down here for example gave 7.7 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.730
 we can put it on and that this battery 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:58.660
 will be able to feed this 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.849
 fight for something between 6 and 7 hours 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.579
 so we can do this 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.170
 calculation if for example you have a 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:10.420
 nine-foot battery you would divide 9 with 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.920
 0.9 should last 10 hours 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.230
 and so on with any supper 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.359
 ability if you want for example 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.430
 to use is an automotive battery of 60 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:27.340
 feet to power circuit that goes 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:31.480
 do the same calculation would be 60 / 0.9 and 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.400
 you will have the estimated duration in hours 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.109
 So this video was just for doing this. 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.620
 complementation of the previous two months 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:42.450
 regarding this lamp circuit 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.430
 Fluorescent Battery for 12 Volt Battery 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.250
 and the next video will be what I had 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.349
 said that it is a system that I developed 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.620
 of emergency lamps that will 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.919
 use this inverter battery 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.290
 transformer reactor with personnel calls 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.110
 this lamp and one more basic circuit 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.900
 from a source 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.080
 the set adapted to function as 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.100
 battery charger in law that will 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.510
 switching is identifying when the 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:17.600
 electric power ended up in the normal 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.790
 and thereby turning on this lamp to 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.130
 function as an emergency light 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.830
 So I thank you for this. 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.140
 video if you have any questions regarding 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.510
