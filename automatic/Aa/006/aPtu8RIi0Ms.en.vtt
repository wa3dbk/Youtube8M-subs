00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
striped more than enough to do what you

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.279 
striped more than enough to do what you
have<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.730> now<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.420> other<00:00:57.570> thing<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:57.930> put

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
have to do now the other thing they put

have to do now the other thing they put
into<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.770> was<00:00:59.160> their<00:00:59.340> clicking<00:00:59.879> mechanism

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
into this was their clicking mechanism

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.060 
into this was their clicking mechanism
which<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.020> same<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.469> actually<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
which is the same that's actually in the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.719 
which is the same that's actually in the
salt<00:01:02.430> EAGA

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.429 

which<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.910> very<00:01:06.270> loud<00:01:06.600> very<00:01:07.439> strong<00:01:07.890> clicker

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
which is a very loud very strong clicker

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.980 
which is a very loud very strong clicker
they<00:01:10.439> made<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.520> similar<00:01:11.880> mechanism<00:01:12.090> on

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
they made it's a similar mechanism on

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.570 
they made it's a similar mechanism on
the<00:01:13.110> leverage<00:01:13.380> rag<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.070> salt<00:01:14.280> eat<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.549> a

the leverage rag the salt eat is a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
the leverage rag the salt eat is a
little<00:01:15.060> bit<00:01:15.180> smoother<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.780> not<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.140> not

little bit smoother it's not it's not
quite<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:17.010> notched<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:20.009> know

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
quite as notched but it's just you know

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.770 
quite as notched but it's just you know
in<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> price<00:01:20.729> range<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.180> let<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
in the price range for let for a

in the price range for let for a
leverage<00:01:22.110> red<00:01:22.290> real<00:01:22.530> hyperspeed<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.850> can't

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
leverage red real hyperspeed you can't

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.320 
leverage red real hyperspeed you can't
can't<00:01:25.229> top<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.970> other<00:01:27.119> nice<00:01:27.299> thing

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
can't top it and the other nice thing

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.359 
can't top it and the other nice thing
about<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.930> by<00:01:28.110> bringing<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.619> gearbox<00:01:28.890> so

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
about it is by bringing this gearbox so

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.789 
about it is by bringing this gearbox so
forward<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.299> reel<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:31.200> don't<00:01:31.439> lose<00:01:31.619> as

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
forward on this reel you don't lose as

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.219 
forward on this reel you don't lose as
much<00:01:31.979> torque<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:32.850> such<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> high<00:01:33.420> speed<00:01:33.479> ratio

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
much torque with such a high speed ratio

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.560 
much torque with such a high speed ratio
usually<00:01:34.619> when<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:34.979> into<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.310> mid<00:01:35.939> 6s<00:01:36.390> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
usually when you get into the mid 6s to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.230 
usually when you get into the mid 6s to
seven<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:38.070> tend<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.369> lose<00:01:38.549> some<00:01:38.759> torque<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
seven you tend to lose some torque and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.370 
seven you tend to lose some torque and
it<00:01:39.299> feels<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.570> you're<00:01:39.780> fighting<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.229> losing

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it feels like you're fighting a losing

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.310 
it feels like you're fighting a losing
battle<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.450> they've<00:01:42.450> found<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.869> way<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.020> fix

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
battle and they've found a way to fix

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.350 
battle and they've found a way to fix

that with with with this reel and also
the<00:01:45.509> salty<00:01:45.899> too<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.060> mean<00:01:48.060> all<00:01:48.270> around<00:01:48.570> it's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the salty too but I mean all around it's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.539 
the salty too but I mean all around it's
phenomenal<00:01:49.380> reel<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.770> if<00:01:50.070> you're<00:01:50.220> looking

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
phenomenal reel and if you're looking

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.789 
phenomenal reel and if you're looking
for<00:01:50.729> speed<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.780> want<00:01:52.049> something<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.619> reel
