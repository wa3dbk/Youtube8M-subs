00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 very outside hello how about greetings 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.890
 educational and today we are going to 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.649
 talk about two very interesting things 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.519
 but it's going to be from xbox one and very good 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.190
 true 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.139
 the first friends and applications as 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.379
 see the list of friends and how they work 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.230
 the applications in the xbox one if there 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.270
 a video with this with that subject and what 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.150
 second and something that was talked about a few 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.140
 days ago there seems to be a great chance of 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.230
 that the xbox one and good there is a 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.239
 cross bronx link crosstour play true 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.309
 what is typical of this that the voodoo people do not 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.570
 can play with the pc people good 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.850
 right now I'm going to talk a little not 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.530
 Well the first thing today is today a 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.530
 video on the xbox channel in which 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.840
 show how the application will be viewed 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.420
 in the friends list in the application 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.530
 for friends list in xbox 1 you are going 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.930
 to explain 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.469
 practically everything will show you how 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.570
 is this to upload videos your images the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.770
 Friends list or many things 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.070
 interesting everything is in English the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.930
 truth everything 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.190
 but what you can understand is that 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.520
 example not if you have a list of friends 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.920
 and of two friends not with all play or not 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.060
 with all you are a 100% friend that you play 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.590
 the game always 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.920
 also has a choice is to separate 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.670
 friends and also gives you an option that 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.710
 for example it 's like a follow by follow 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.430
 as a sub for its also going to exist 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.700
 in xbox one for example if you have your 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.560
 xbox 1 and I like you so much I can 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.470
 follow you I can know everything that 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.860
 do I can see your achievements I can know 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.560
 almost everything and if you 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.020
 You want to know the same thing that I do 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.670
 I do you can also follow something like that 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.320
 as facebook says whistle you were 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.760
 the followers also or as on twitter and 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.770
 something like that we can focus what 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.690
 we do but if you read the people who 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.460
 suddenly you do not want to show the world 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.110
 that you do what you play you the 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.240
 USSR and others will also be the 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.430
 privacy section not for us 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.010
 they are fucking and all that inclusive 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.650
 also this 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.630
 but who put the person in the video 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.710
 is going through an equal person and you 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.360
 usually attack that after you do not see the 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.670
 video and I told you in the video is the 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.380
 description is all in English and is a 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.960
 small turn of what the list of 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.310
 friends in xbox 1 gave me a little bit of 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.990
 fear when the egg put the name of 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.250
 a person and went on freedom that 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.740
 so give me a little bit of fear because 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.380
 Well, it's already as you want, it's already a 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.240
 little abuse of privacy not good 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.030
 but there it is so you already know you are 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.730
 video in the description of the tour of the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.110
 list of friends in the xbox 1 so 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.120
 I would be short he was hanged today 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.650
 and another thing else agree that it does 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.950
 a few days ago 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.110
 Philip Spencer was asked if there was a 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.329
 chance that the xbox 1 gamers can 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.920
 play with the PC gamer and said 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.650
 You do not have any comment on that 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.920
 do not want to comment anything and I said good 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.730
 Now it seems to me that if not and good day 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.400
 from today 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.849
 this man phil spencer yes today monday 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.409
 talked about this not about the xbox 1 and 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.980
 pc players in which you 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:09.040
 they could play good he said that 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.959
 it's common sense ladies if I do not think 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.629
 something far away I think that in the future if 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.420
 the console people obviously talk about 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.310
 your console we will be able to play with the 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.810
 pc people is something that comes and is 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.049
 something that is just around the corner 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.299
 so no need to worry about was 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.060
 commenting on the film is thinking sir is a 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.220
 important person in what is macros 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.290
 so there's a great chance that I'm still 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.000
 since he said no the comments to 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.790
 respect I think yes I think that 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.370
 would come 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.189
 a cross plane or between people from xbox 1 and 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.340
 pc people is the simplest thing is what 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:47.300
 more sensible that there may be but I hope 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.770
 may this be soon 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.120
 I hope it's not soon out there 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.900
 Fish people do not agree with 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.610
 that's the truth because a lot in asics in 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.160
 Multiple game console 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.930
 PC difference that there is not but I 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.350
 I would like to know if pc people are 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.060
 according to that 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.310
 the truth 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.930
 you obviously comment the people of 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.180
 pc is not going to like this would lend 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.920
 happy for them as console gamer me 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.690
 yes and I'm glad to play with people from pc 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.090
 the truth though the graphic difference 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.630
 it's huge since pc people are going to 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.690
 have better better graphics is obvious 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.700
 you had to be very new to say 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.620
 that the console is better than the pc but 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.840
 people will have to wait to see what happens 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.570
 but so far the xbox 1 has 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.000
 more chance of being able to have this game 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.830
 cross over from ipc console to the 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.960
 moment is winning so I say goodbye 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.430
 fidocs to the favorites and obviously 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.320
 we will see you in the vicinity to see 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.560
 link the building so you can see the video 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:50.210
 of friends in xbox 1 as it would look like 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.979
 tour and good it seems that pc and xbox as much 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.370
 likely that if an hour if we do not see 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.370
 chat
