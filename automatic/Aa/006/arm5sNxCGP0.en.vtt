00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
a little loose and there's some minor

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.980 
a little loose and there's some minor
gap<00:02:37.250> opens<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.140> did<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.380> mostly<00:02:40.780> not<00:02:41.780> sure

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
gap opens so it did it mostly not sure

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.770 
gap opens so it did it mostly not sure
you<00:02:42.140> notice<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:44.709> there's<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.800> small<00:02:46.040> gap<00:02:46.340> here

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
you notice it there's a small gap here

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.750 
you notice it there's a small gap here
it's<00:02:47.780> really<00:02:48.080> not<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.260> noticeable<00:02:48.760> unless

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
it's really not that noticeable unless

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.800 
it's really not that noticeable unless
you're<00:02:50.000> really<00:02:50.239> trying<00:02:51.110> hard<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.500> look<00:02:51.709> so

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
you're really trying hard to look so

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.449 
you're really trying hard to look so
personally<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:53.900> not<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.050> big<00:02:54.290> deal<00:02:54.320> but<00:02:55.160> I

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
personally it's not a big deal but I

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.970 
personally it's not a big deal but I
thought<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.540> was<00:02:56.600> worth<00:02:56.750> mentioning<00:02:57.290> her<00:02:57.440> cat

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
thought it was worth mentioning her cat

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.130 
thought it was worth mentioning her cat
ears<00:02:58.310> were<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.940> slight<00:02:59.420> issue<00:02:59.630> when<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.020> was

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
ears were a slight issue when I was

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.530 
ears were a slight issue when I was
trying<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.350> switch<00:03:00.560> them<00:03:00.709> out<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.880> you<00:03:01.940> do<00:03:02.330> get

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
trying to switch them out so you do get

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.130 
trying to switch them out so you do get
to<00:03:02.750> headbands<00:03:03.200> this<00:03:03.560> one<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.700> one<00:03:04.850> would

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
to headbands this one and the one would

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.710 
to headbands this one and the one would
you<00:03:06.140> see<00:03:06.350> in<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.650> box<00:03:06.940> basically<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.510> little

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
you see in the box basically the little

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.720 
you see in the box basically the little
flowers<00:03:09.080> so<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.160> could<00:03:10.310> choose<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.519> switch

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
flowers so you could choose to switch

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.380 
flowers so you could choose to switch
out<00:03:10.940> with<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.209> cat<00:03:11.510> ears<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.820> they<00:03:13.820> do<00:03:13.880> take<00:03:14.360> a

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
out with the cat ears and they do take a

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.580 
out with the cat ears and they do take a
little<00:03:14.600> effort<00:03:15.320> to<00:03:15.830> put<00:03:16.220> in<00:03:16.360> but<00:03:17.360> I<00:03:17.600> got<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.470> in

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
little effort to put in but I got it in

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.220 
little effort to put in but I got it in
and<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.400> think<00:03:19.790> they<00:03:20.060> did<00:03:20.209> an<00:03:20.299> okay<00:03:20.570> job<00:03:20.600> of<00:03:21.049> like

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
and I think they did an okay job of like

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.610 
and I think they did an okay job of like
covering<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:23.330> gaps<00:03:23.810> in<00:03:24.080> between<00:03:24.110> the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
covering the the gaps in between the

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.560 
covering the the gaps in between the
hair<00:03:25.269> so<00:03:26.269> i<00:03:26.799> think<00:03:27.799> that<00:03:28.010> part's<00:03:28.370> okay<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.910> the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
hair so i think that part's okay and the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.400 
hair so i think that part's okay and the
base<00:03:29.810> has<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:30.350> matte<00:03:30.620> finish<00:03:30.650> but<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.930> still

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
base has a matte finish but it still

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.699 
base has a matte finish but it still
catches<00:03:34.010> fingerprints<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.450> if<00:03:36.049> it<00:03:36.380> gets<00:03:36.560> on

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
catches fingerprints so if it gets on

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.230 
catches fingerprints so if it gets on
camera

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.600 

so<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.410> has<00:03:40.440> kind<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.890> like<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.100> matte<00:03:41.580> finish

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
so it has kind of like a matte finish

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.300 
so it has kind of like a matte finish
but<00:03:42.270> I<00:03:42.510> don't<00:03:43.500> know<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.680> can<00:03:43.890> still<00:03:44.130> get

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
but I don't know you can still get

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.040 
but I don't know you can still get
fingerprints<00:03:44.970> on<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.510> just<00:03:45.810> I'm<00:03:45.870> gonna

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
fingerprints on it so just I'm gonna

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.170 
fingerprints on it so just I'm gonna
keep<00:03:46.200> in<00:03:46.290> mind<00:03:46.500> but<00:03:47.490> you<00:03:47.670> should<00:03:47.850> be<00:03:47.880> fine<00:03:48.150> if

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
keep in mind but you should be fine if

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.640 
keep in mind but you should be fine if
you're<00:03:48.510> going<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.720> have<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.900> display<00:03:49.350> as<00:03:49.620> a

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
you're going to have a display as a

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.430 
you're going to have a display as a
