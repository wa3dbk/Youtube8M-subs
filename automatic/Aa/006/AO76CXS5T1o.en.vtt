by showing you how good the card I've
chosen<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:07.080> then<00:00:08.030> afterwards<00:00:09.030> I'll<00:00:09.269> tell<00:00:09.540> you

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
this way you can evaluate the card

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.930 
this way you can evaluate the card
without<00:00:12.990> your<00:00:13.230> AMD<00:00:13.740> or<00:00:13.950> Nvidia<00:00:14.490> hat<00:00:14.670> on
