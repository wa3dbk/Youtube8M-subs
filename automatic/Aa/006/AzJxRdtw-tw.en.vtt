00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
line of imax but it's basically just

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.770

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
like the new mouse and the mini server

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.190 
like the new mouse and the mini server
that<00:01:23.070> did<00:01:23.220> come<00:01:23.340> out<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.299> now<00:01:24.780> Jonathan

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
that did come out with so now Jonathan

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
alluded to this mini server I mean it's

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.440 
alluded to this mini server I mean it's
essentially<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.100> mac<00:01:29.310> mini<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:29.939> always<00:01:30.240> tense

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
essentially a mac mini with always tense

how in demand the Mac remaining in
gentlemen's<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:43.049> mean<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> mac<00:01:43.860> mini<00:01:43.890> with<00:01:44.280> no

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
gentlemen's I mean a mac mini with no

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.740 
gentlemen's I mean a mac mini with no
optical<00:01:44.850> drive<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
optical drive because you have to

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
optical drive because you have to
remember<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.350> server<00:01:46.560> version<00:01:47.070> does

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
remember that the server version does

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.639 
remember that the server version does
not<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> optical<00:01:48.090> drive<00:01:48.299> seems<00:01:49.259> kind<00:01:49.530> of

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
not have the optical drive seems kind of

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.910 
not have the optical drive seems kind of
odd<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.280> me<00:01:50.310> um<00:01:51.079> I'll<00:01:52.079> be<00:01:52.140> interested<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.710> see

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
odd to me um I'll be interested to see

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.499 
odd to me um I'll be interested to see
if<00:01:52.950> Apple<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.460> really<00:01:53.700> market<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.390> mean

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
if Apple can really market this I mean

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.480 
if Apple can really market this I mean
that<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:54.840> Apple's<00:01:55.320> good<00:01:55.560> at<00:01:55.649> one<00:01:55.890> thing<00:01:55.920> I'm

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that if Apple's good at one thing I'm

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.550 
that if Apple's good at one thing I'm
either<00:01:56.850> great<00:01:57.180> lots<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.810> stuff<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.320> thing

multi-touch interface on the top so the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.740 
multi-touch interface on the top so the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
click on the left or the right side that

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.839 
click on the left or the right side that
kind<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.470> thing<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.890> it's<00:02:50.340> something<00:02:50.819> very

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
kind of thing so it's something very

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.940 
kind of thing so it's something very
different<00:02:51.239> than<00:02:51.599> most<00:02:51.900> regular<00:02:52.620> mice<00:02:52.769> that

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
different than most regular mice that

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.199 
different than most regular mice that
we've<00:02:53.040> seen<00:02:53.370> out<00:02:53.549> there<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:53.970> it's<00:02:54.060> also

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
we've seen out there and it's also

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.000 
we've seen out there and it's also
completely<00:02:54.660> wireless<00:02:55.079> there<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.650> no<00:02:55.739> wired

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
completely wireless there is no wired

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.949 
completely wireless there is no wired
version<00:02:56.609> of<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:56.970> mouse<00:02:57.180> I'm<00:02:57.510> assuming<00:02:57.840> is

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
version of this mouse I'm assuming is

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.599 
version of this mouse I'm assuming is
using<00:02:58.260> bluetooth<00:02:58.620> probably<00:02:59.040> right<00:02:59.220> yeah

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
using bluetooth probably right yeah

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
to start causing problems for people who

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.140 
to start causing problems for people who

little track ball in the middle that
thing<00:04:45.640> always<00:04:45.880> jams<00:04:46.540> up<00:04:46.750> it<00:04:46.990> really<00:04:47.590> never

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
thing always jams up it really never

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.160 
thing always jams up it really never
works<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.610> way<00:04:48.730> it<00:04:48.850> should<00:04:48.910> and<00:04:49.330> we're<00:04:50.050> going

works the way it should and we're going
at<00:04:50.230> that<00:04:50.320> same<00:04:50.530> functionality<00:04:51.220> but<00:04:51.640> there's

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
at that same functionality but there's

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.790 
at that same functionality but there's
gonna<00:04:51.910> be<00:04:52.030> no<00:04:52.180> moving<00:04:52.450> parts<00:04:52.600> in<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.440> magic

could cause apple to take a little bit

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.860 
could cause apple to take a little bit
of<00:05:17.920> a<00:05:18.040> dip<00:05:18.280> in<00:05:18.460> green<00:05:18.730> pieces<00:05:19.030> ratings<00:05:19.660> because

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
of a dip in green pieces ratings because

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.630 
of a dip in green pieces ratings because
now<00:05:20.140> you've<00:05:20.320> got<00:05:20.350> a<00:05:20.740> device<00:05:21.070> that<00:05:21.100> requires

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
now you've got a device that requires

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.760 
now you've got a device that requires
batteries<00:05:21.910> it's<00:05:22.450> not<00:05:22.630> something<00:05:23.590> that's<00:05:23.620> just

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
batteries it's not something that's just

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.710 
batteries it's not something that's just
directly<00:05:24.220> wired<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:24.640> the<00:05:24.670> computer<00:05:25.150> so<00:05:25.690> that

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
directly wired to the computer so that

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.170 
directly wired to the computer so that
might<00:05:26.110> come<00:05:26.440> back<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:27.490> give<00:05:27.730> them<00:05:27.910> just<00:05:28.090> a

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
might come back to to give them just a

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.140 
might come back to to give them just a
