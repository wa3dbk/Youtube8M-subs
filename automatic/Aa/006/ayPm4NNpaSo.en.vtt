actually I remember playing that and in

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.320 
actually I remember playing that and in
this<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:41.130> game<00:04:41.370> he<00:04:41.580> ends<00:04:41.790> up<00:04:41.850> putting<00:04:42.150> us

for<00:04:49.890> us<00:04:49.980> against<00:04:50.430> Liverpool<00:04:50.820> which<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.180> good

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
for us against Liverpool which is a good

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.150
