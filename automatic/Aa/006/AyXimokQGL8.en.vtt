00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hello everyone to the yatta program 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.230
 world number one what makes the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.450
 success of the Japanese manufacturer 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.000
 answer in this journal is to me the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.370
 sheet a participative project opel and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.949
 finally now the jt and his guests more 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:21.510
 visible on TV and the first 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.119
 global car manufacturer is and 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.010
 remains toyota in a statement the firm 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.080
 Japan has announced that it has sold more 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.949
 9.9 million vehicles in the shadows 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.900
 2013 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.450
 enough to get ahead for the second year 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.130
 consecutive his eternal challenger 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.079
 general motors but the gap between 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.850
 two giants is tightening two hundred thousand 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.200
 vehicles only separate them 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.450
 the volkswagen group rides on the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.860
 third step of the podium with 9 5 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.390
 million models sold 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.250
 as for the symbolic bar of 10 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.050
 million it should soon be 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.969
 to be franchised toyota who counts it 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.910
 wait until 2013 already plans 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.039
 from last year in 2014 then toyota 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.140
 ultra confident which is what makes the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.520
 giant Japanese small cross we have 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.469
 asked the question to pascal pennec 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.329
 deputy editor reading 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.270
 moreover it must be understood that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.280
 Toyota has a global hold that is 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.560
 probably the widest all 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.090
 builders its competitors 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.960
 the main ones are well established a little 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.869
 worldwide 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.000
 general motors and volkswagen are very 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.390
 close but with a string of 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.640
 Mark 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.229
 but toyota what is its strength is 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.409
 that practically with a single brand 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.390
 it happens to wind of autan is also 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.210
 present on all continents 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.610
 it's almost still in europe where he has 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.590
 the most trouble to break through but finally he has 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.299
 a range that is good enough 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.770
 adapted to each of the continents for 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.900
 that they manage to fill all his 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.250
 goals and if toyota shines through her 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.810
 number one place in the world 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.460
 in France the manufacturer does not tip 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.439

 gabriel a concept signed opel finally not 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.310
 quite the idea comes from a 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.440
 finalist motorist to the call to 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.080
 projects launched mid-2013 by the division 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.000
 Belgian car manufacturer and which 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.360
 was to imagine the option 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.700
 Opel essential to the future of 1358 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.800
 later we discover gabriel a case 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.840

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.800
 the box emits an alert if you 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.750
 move a sensor mat further 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.760
 placed under the car seat of your 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.680

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.790
 useful or stupid we wanted are decided 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.320
 for opel this is a good way 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.420
 to prevent each summer the death of
