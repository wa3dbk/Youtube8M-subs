00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.980 

the<00:00:01.110> next<00:00:01.740> mode<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.840> color<00:00:03.840> burn<00:00:04.370> and<00:00:05.990> the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
the next mode is color burn and the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.020 
the next mode is color burn and the
color<00:00:07.740> burns<00:00:09.320> darken<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.440> image<00:00:11.000> by<00:00:12.000> using

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
color burns darken the image by using

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.860 
color burns darken the image by using
the<00:00:12.599> color<00:00:12.929> information<00:00:14.299> from<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.450> layer<00:00:15.660> on

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
the color information from the layer on

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.130 
the color information from the layer on
top<00:00:17.420> -<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:19.050> think<00:00:19.730> increases<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.000> contrast<00:00:21.600> of

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
top - I think increases the contrast of

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.019 
top - I think increases the contrast of
the<00:00:23.100> layer<00:00:23.820> underneath<00:00:24.769> so<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.189> mean<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the layer underneath so I mean the the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.120 
the layer underneath so I mean the the
white<00:00:27.210> layer<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:28.140> white<00:00:28.320> part<00:00:28.590> doesn't<00:00:29.010> have

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
white layer the white part doesn't have

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.790 
white layer the white part doesn't have
any<00:00:29.310> effect<00:00:29.490> while<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.179> black<00:00:30.420> part<00:00:30.960> has<00:00:31.410> like

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
any effect while the black part has like

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.010 
any effect while the black part has like
a<00:00:31.830> full<00:00:33.110> blackout<00:00:34.110> effect<00:00:34.559> there<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:36.020> classic

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
a full blackout effect there and classic

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.979 
a full blackout effect there and classic
color<00:00:37.230> burn<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.829> about<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.640> same<00:00:38.850> thing<00:00:39.120> you

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.260 

you<00:00:42.989> use<00:00:43.230> these<00:00:43.469> when<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.219> mean<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.030> want<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
you use these when I mean you want to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.779 
you use these when I mean you want to
get<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> dark<00:00:45.750> more<00:00:45.989> darker<00:00:46.440> image<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:47.190> I've

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
get a dark more darker image then I've

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.060 
get a dark more darker image then I've
done<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.750> want<00:00:48.960> multiply<00:00:49.530> then<00:00:49.860> if<00:00:49.950> you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
done if you want multiply then if you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.799 
done if you want multiply then if you
multiply<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.149> would<00:00:51.300> use<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> color

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
multiply so you would use the color

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.740 
multiply so you would use the color
burns<00:00:54.469> the<00:00:55.469> next<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.370> called<00:00:57.270> linear

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
burns the next one up is called linear

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.029 
burns the next one up is called linear
burn<00:00:57.960> and<00:01:00.079> that<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.260> usually<00:01:01.590> looks<00:01:01.739> pretty

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
burn and that one usually looks pretty

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.190 
burn and that one usually looks pretty
cool<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:03.180> linear<00:01:04.140> burn<00:01:04.350> darkens<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.369> image

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
cool the linear burn darkens the image

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.600 
cool the linear burn darkens the image
by<00:01:07.200> using<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.590> color<00:01:07.799> information<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
by using the color information of the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.490 
by using the color information of the
layer<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.000> top<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.689> decrease<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.290> brightness

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
layer on top to decrease the brightness

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.850 
layer on top to decrease the brightness
of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> layer<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> bottom<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.710> how

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
of the layer on the bottom so that's how

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.740 
of the layer on the bottom so that's how
that<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:14.280> works<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:14.850> see<00:01:15.150> how<00:01:15.509> it

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that one works and you can see how it

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.100 
that one works and you can see how it
works<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.740> full<00:01:17.009> black<00:01:17.310> down<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.110> not

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
works it's full black down here and not

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.499 
works it's full black down here and not
all<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.710> way<00:01:19.830> gone<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> full<00:01:20.909> one<00:01:21.119> full

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
all the way gone with a full one full

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.740 
all the way gone with a full one full
white<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:25.140> next<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:27.000> darker

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
white up here the next one is a darker

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.440 
white up here the next one is a darker
color<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.350> I'm<00:01:29.130> not<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.729> too<00:01:30.030> sure<00:01:30.060> how

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
color and I'm not really too sure how

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.600 
color and I'm not really too sure how
this<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.049> works<00:01:31.790> so<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.820> don't<00:01:33.299> often<00:01:33.930> use<00:01:34.200> it

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
this one works so I don't often use it

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.640 
this one works so I don't often use it
but<00:01:35.610> that's<00:01:36.210> how<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.439> see

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
but that's how this is what you can see

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.490 
but that's how this is what you can see
how<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.220> looks<00:01:39.619> it<00:01:40.619> looks<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:42.079> when<00:01:43.079> there's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
how it looks it looks like when there's

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.749 
how it looks it looks like when there's
a<00:01:43.560> dark<00:01:43.920> image<00:01:45.020> over<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.680> mean<00:01:47.430> when<00:01:47.610> there's

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
a dark image over I mean when there's

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.730 
a dark image over I mean when there's
like<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> light<00:01:48.240> image<00:01:48.600> over<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> dark<00:01:49.200> image<00:01:49.500> it

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
like a light image over a dark image it

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.880 
like a light image over a dark image it
like<00:01:49.979> completely<00:01:50.250> blasts<00:01:50.759> out<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> white<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
like completely blasts out the white and

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.010 
like completely blasts out the white and
when<00:01:52.890> there's<00:01:53.070> dark<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.909> image<00:01:54.180> or<00:01:54.479> video

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
when there's dark on the image or video

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.069 
when there's dark on the image or video
below<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:56.040> blasts<00:01:56.549> out<00:01:56.820> what's<00:01:57.450> ever<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.689> top

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
below it blasts out what's ever on top

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.500 
below it blasts out what's ever on top
as<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.860> see<00:01:59.009> there

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.460 

so<00:02:03.510> let's<00:02:03.960> head<00:02:04.680> over<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:06.200> lighter<00:02:07.200> ones

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
so let's head over to the lighter ones

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.590 
so let's head over to the lighter ones
the<00:02:07.800> first<00:02:07.980> one<00:02:08.160> we'll<00:02:08.310> start<00:02:08.550> with<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.030> ad<00:02:11.600> so

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
the first one we'll start with is ad so

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.230 
the first one we'll start with is ad so
with<00:02:12.990> ad<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:15.170> both<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.470> images<00:02:17.010> color<00:02:17.820> values

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
with ad the both the images color values

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.380 
with ad the both the images color values
are<00:02:18.540> added<00:02:18.750> together<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:20.550> clips<00:02:20.820> off<00:02:21.060> at

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
are added together and it clips off at

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.420 
are added together and it clips off at
the<00:02:21.630> full<00:02:21.900> white<00:02:22.140> there<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.070> when<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.250> have<00:02:23.400> a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
the full white there so when you have a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.180 
the full white there so when you have a
dark<00:02:23.730> image<00:02:24.180> put<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.570> on<00:02:24.690> top<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.470> looks<00:02:25.890> pretty

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
dark image put it on top it looks pretty

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.260 
dark image put it on top it looks pretty
cool<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:28.230> whole<00:02:28.380> thing<00:02:28.560> lightens<00:02:29.270> the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
cool in it the whole thing lightens the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.040 
cool in it the whole thing lightens the
image<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:33.140> lot<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.320> times<00:02:34.560> when<00:02:34.920> you're<00:02:35.250> adding

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
image a lot of times when you're adding

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.699 
image a lot of times when you're adding
explosions<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:38.240> visual<00:02:39.240> effects<00:02:39.590> like<00:02:40.590> in

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
explosions in in visual effects like in

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.070 
explosions in in visual effects like in
a<00:02:40.740> movie<00:02:40.950> you'll<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.000> like<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.660> use<00:02:42.840> these

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
a movie you'll you like to use these

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.550 
a movie you'll you like to use these
this<00:02:43.770> ad<00:02:44.070> mode<00:02:44.400> because<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.540> helps<00:02:45.870> blend<00:02:46.410> it

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
this ad mode because it helps blend it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.980 
this ad mode because it helps blend it
in<00:02:46.709> better<00:02:46.980> with<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.310> background<00:02:50.270> so<00:02:51.270> we'll

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
in better with the background so we'll

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.870 
in better with the background so we'll
go<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.380> next<00:02:52.590> one<00:02:52.800> which<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.040> lighten<00:02:53.610> and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
go to the next one which is lighten and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.290 
go to the next one which is lighten and
this<00:02:54.330> does<00:02:54.630> just<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.110> opposite<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.920> what

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
this does just the opposite of what

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.470 
this does just the opposite of what
darken<00:02:57.300> does<00:02:59.540> now<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:01.050> go<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:02.150> screen<00:03:03.150> here

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
darken does now we can go to screen here

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.690 
darken does now we can go to screen here
which<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.320> like<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.709> use<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.950> lot<00:03:06.410> screen<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.890> the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
which I like to use a lot screen is the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.360 
which I like to use a lot screen is the
opposite<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.150> multiply<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:11.160> color

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
opposite of multiply and the color

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.580 
opposite of multiply and the color
values<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.030> selected<00:03:12.209> layer<00:03:12.660> are<00:03:12.989> skilled

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
values of the selected layer are skilled

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.320 
values of the selected layer are skilled
above<00:03:13.890> their<00:03:14.070> original<00:03:14.489> values<00:03:14.880> based<00:03:15.090> on<00:03:15.239> the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
above their original values based on the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.090 
above their original values based on the
color<00:03:15.540> values<00:03:15.959> of<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.410> layer<00:03:16.620> underneath<00:03:17.690> so

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
color values of the layer underneath so

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.670 
color values of the layer underneath so
the<00:03:20.100> layer<00:03:20.730> on<00:03:20.850> top<00:03:21.120> there<00:03:21.510> which<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.560> the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
the layer on top there which is the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.030 
the layer on top there which is the
squish<00:03:22.980> know<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.420> like<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.320> use<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.739> one

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
squish know that I like to use this one

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.060 
squish know that I like to use this one
when<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.340> just<00:03:26.670> want<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.910> put<00:03:27.030> something<00:03:27.390> like

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
when I just want to put something like

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.949 
when I just want to put something like
maybe<00:03:29.070> like<00:03:29.310> scratches<00:03:30.090> or<00:03:30.360> something<00:03:30.810> like

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
maybe like scratches or something like

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.789 
maybe like scratches or something like
that<00:03:31.019> overtop<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:32.480> plain<00:03:33.480> background<00:03:33.750> I'll<00:03:34.470> use

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
that overtop a plain background I'll use

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.460 
that overtop a plain background I'll use
screen<00:03:35.459> or<00:03:35.700> multiply<00:03:36.150> depending<00:03:36.690> on<00:03:36.810> what<00:03:37.140> the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
screen or multiply depending on what the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.250 
screen or multiply depending on what the
scratches<00:03:38.010> are<00:03:38.280> colored<00:03:38.640> by<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.959> can<00:03:39.989> get

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
scratches are colored by and you can get

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.009 
scratches are colored by and you can get
a<00:03:40.290> cool-looking<00:03:41.209> scratched<00:03:42.209> up<00:03:42.450> background

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.759 

the<00:03:46.019> next<00:03:46.560> one<00:03:46.739> here<00:03:47.130> is<00:03:47.540> these<00:03:48.540> color<00:03:49.260> dodges

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
the next one here is these color dodges

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:57.020 
the next one here is these color dodges
here<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:51.320> Dodge<00:03:52.320> basically<00:03:53.100> takes<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:56.030> the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
here and a Dodge basically takes the the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.000 
here and a Dodge basically takes the the
color<00:03:57.269> information<00:03:57.930> from<00:03:58.260> each<00:04:00.620> Channel<00:04:01.650> so

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
color information from each Channel so

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.800 
color information from each Channel so
the<00:04:02.160> red<00:04:02.430> green<00:04:03.000> or<00:04:03.330> blue<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:05.120> it<00:04:06.230> applies<00:04:07.230> it

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
the red green or blue and it applies it

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.330 
the red green or blue and it applies it
to<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:10.120> bottom<00:04:11.120> image<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:12.560> increase

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
to the to the bottom image to increase

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.940 
to the to the bottom image to increase
the<00:04:13.489> brightness<00:04:13.610> and<00:04:14.300> that's<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.380> same<00:04:15.620> for

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
the brightness and that's the same for

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.960 
the brightness and that's the same for
all<00:04:16.609> these<00:04:16.880> dodges<00:04:17.329> I<00:04:18.340> mean<00:04:19.340> color<00:04:19.700> dodge<00:04:19.940> and

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
all these dodges I mean color dodge and

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.340 
all these dodges I mean color dodge and
classic<00:04:20.510> color<00:04:20.690> dodge<00:04:20.930> kind<00:04:21.169> of<00:04:21.230> look<00:04:21.320> the

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
classic color dodge kind of look the

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.650 
classic color dodge kind of look the
same<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.950> then<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.370> linear<00:04:22.760> dodge<00:04:23.030> is<00:04:23.360> kind

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
same and then the linear dodge is kind

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.120 
same and then the linear dodge is kind
of<00:04:23.720> like<00:04:23.930> ad<00:04:24.139> the<00:04:24.740> ad<00:04:24.770> mode<00:04:25.160> so<00:04:26.530> if<00:04:27.530> you<00:04:27.770> look<00:04:28.040> at

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
of like ad the ad mode so if you look at

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.300 
of like ad the ad mode so if you look at
that<00:04:28.310> they're<00:04:28.580> pretty<00:04:28.730> much<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:28.970> same<00:04:30.310> the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
that they're pretty much the same the

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.600 
that they're pretty much the same the
last<00:04:31.520> one<00:04:31.730> is<00:04:31.880> lighter<00:04:32.150> color<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:34.460> can

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
last one is lighter color and you can

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.950 
last one is lighter color and you can
see<00:04:34.790> that<00:04:34.970> that<00:04:35.210> was<00:04:35.330> kind<00:04:35.510> of<00:04:35.630> like<00:04:35.720> the

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
see that that was kind of like the

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.600 
see that that was kind of like the
darker<00:04:36.290> color<00:04:36.470> one<00:04:36.650> I'm<00:04:36.770> not<00:04:36.889> too<00:04:37.040> sure<00:04:37.220> how<00:04:37.250> it

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
darker color one I'm not too sure how it

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.379 
darker color one I'm not too sure how it
works<00:04:37.760> but<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.240> it<00:04:38.630> pretty<00:04:39.410> much<00:04:39.500> like<00:04:39.830> cuts

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
works but it it pretty much like cuts

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.570 
works but it it pretty much like cuts
anything<00:04:41.389> that's<00:04:41.630> uh<00:04:42.160> cuts<00:04:43.160> a<00:04:43.250> bunch<00:04:43.430> of

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
anything that's uh cuts a bunch of

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.640 
anything that's uh cuts a bunch of
things<00:04:43.729> out<00:04:43.940> I'm<00:04:44.270> not<00:04:44.810> too<00:04:45.020> sure<00:04:45.200> how<00:04:45.229> it<00:04:45.500> works

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
things out I'm not too sure how it works

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.580 
things out I'm not too sure how it works
but<00:04:45.860> if<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.250> looks<00:04:46.639> cool<00:04:46.880> when<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:47.930> use<00:04:48.290> it<00:04:48.470> on

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
but if it looks cool when you use it on

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.690 
but if it looks cool when you use it on
your<00:04:49.389> on<00:04:50.389> your<00:04:50.450> on<00:04:50.900> your<00:04:51.020> project<00:04:51.889> I<00:04:52.070> mean<00:04:52.340> you

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
your on your on your project I mean you

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.230 
your on your on your project I mean you
should<00:04:52.880> use<00:04:53.419> it<00:04:53.630> so<00:04:54.320> keep<00:04:54.800> always<00:04:55.250> experiment

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
should use it so keep always experiment

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.730 
should use it so keep always experiment
with<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.419> blending<00:04:56.750> modes<00:04:56.960> if<00:04:57.229> you<00:04:57.530> find

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
with the blending modes if you find

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.590 
with the blending modes if you find
something<00:04:58.070> cool<00:04:58.250> then<00:04:58.940> use<00:04:59.630> it<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:01.760> next<00:05:02.270> set

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
something cool then use it the next set

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.300 
something cool then use it the next set
here<00:05:03.530> these<00:05:04.070> are<00:05:04.280> lighting<00:05:06.100> blending<00:05:07.100> modes

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
here these are lighting blending modes

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.450 
here these are lighting blending modes
so<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.419> first<00:05:08.600> one<00:05:08.810> is<00:05:08.840> overlay<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:09.889> I<00:05:10.280> use

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
so the first one is overlay and I use

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.820 
so the first one is overlay and I use
that<00:05:10.729> one<00:05:10.910> a<00:05:11.300> decent<00:05:11.990> amount<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.530> the

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
that one a decent amount the the

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.029 
that one a decent amount the the
lighting<00:05:13.220> ones<00:05:13.460> increase<00:05:14.320> or<00:05:15.320> maybe

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
lighting ones increase or maybe

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.400 
lighting ones increase or maybe
intensify<00:05:16.669> the<00:05:16.729> the<00:05:17.570> contrast<00:05:18.110> and<00:05:18.350> the

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
intensify the the contrast and the

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.850 
intensify the the contrast and the
saturation<00:05:19.130> and<00:05:19.280> a/c<00:05:19.550> and<00:05:19.990> if<00:05:20.990> you<00:05:21.169> apply<00:05:21.830> it

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
saturation and a/c and if you apply it

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.590 
saturation and a/c and if you apply it
to<00:05:22.100> something<00:05:22.310> that's<00:05:22.580> like<00:05:22.970> fifty<00:05:23.300> percent

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
to something that's like fifty percent

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.469 
to something that's like fifty percent
gray<00:05:23.750> it's<00:05:24.110> not<00:05:24.320> really<00:05:24.620> gonna<00:05:24.740> do<00:05:25.039> anything

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
gray it's not really gonna do anything

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.060 
gray it's not really gonna do anything
like<00:05:26.479> as<00:05:26.690> you<00:05:26.810> can<00:05:26.960> see<00:05:27.140> here<00:05:27.500> where<00:05:27.710> it<00:05:27.800> starts

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
like as you can see here where it starts

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.420 
like as you can see here where it starts
getting<00:05:28.100> into<00:05:28.400> a<00:05:28.610> little<00:05:29.120> gray<00:05:29.330> but<00:05:30.140> or<00:05:31.039> down

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
getting into a little gray but or down

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.610 
getting into a little gray but or down
here<00:05:31.729> and<00:05:32.380> I<00:05:33.380> mean<00:05:34.600> once<00:05:35.600> once<00:05:36.020> you<00:05:36.080> get<00:05:36.289> away

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
here and I mean once once you get away

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.950 
here and I mean once once you get away
from<00:05:36.919> gray<00:05:37.310> which<00:05:37.729> is<00:05:37.760> total<00:05:38.330> white<00:05:38.510> or<00:05:38.690> total

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
from gray which is total white or total

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.350 
from gray which is total white or total
black<00:05:39.169> I<00:05:39.410> mean<00:05:39.680> in<00:05:40.310> between<00:05:40.729> those<00:05:40.910> values

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
black I mean in between those values

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.979 
black I mean in between those values
that<00:05:41.479> crease<00:05:41.810> some<00:05:41.990> interesting<00:05:42.590> effects
