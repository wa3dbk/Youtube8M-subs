 let's talk about pokemon hiding in 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.100
 effect there are several pokemon who have 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.079
 been present in some cartridges 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.110
 without most players 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.010
 know since they 've been here hide or 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.649
 well removed by game freak premier 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.620
 case but if our pokemon now very 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.440
 known he even has his wikipedia page it's 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.359
 so a pokemon bug appeared at the first 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.190
 generation 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.949
 for example if cooing is of type flying 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.650
 or electric pikachu and 20 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.780
 missing nos is of the type birds it's at 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.140
 say an unknown guy at the game who did 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.880
 no weakness or resistance 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.670
 the appearance of this pokemon is due to a 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.990
 wholesale system error when I do not 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.340
 can not find the values ​​to display a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.799
 pokemon encountered in the high 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.259
 herbs he replaces it with 0 and that makes 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.369
 to appear missing our it can take 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.130
 several forms 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.409
 the basic one you see now 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.229
 a similar 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.350
 yellow the shape of the ghosts that one can 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.859
 meet in the front town tower 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:43.009
 a skeleton of terra a skeleton of 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.689
 cabu topps the interest of catching this 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.979
 pokemon for players like you and 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.259
 me is if you have the chance 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.310
 it does not destroy your cartridge 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.869
 he will add 128 copies of the 6th objects 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.060
 you own at your bag 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.759
 and it's still very practical 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.530
 a flight masters or a super good 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.929
 the little story then would be that the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.450
 pokemon killed by the rocket team at the front 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.729
 city had a baby who decided to 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.489
 to avenge by recovering the skull and the bones 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.780
 of his mother is this pokemon fight 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.940
 then at the top of the tower from the front 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.610
 city ​​making him join his mom 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.980
 it's said that pokemon writers 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.599
 red blue and green had planned 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.040
 history as that of Kangoo 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.530
 rex and baby 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.220
 we always see in his pocket 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.500
 at birth 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.540
 so he would have become a bone the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.150
 taking away the skull of his mom when 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.590
 boureks but the story would have changed at 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.549
 last moment to become what we 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.220
 know now 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:40.190
 however the spirit of missing water so 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.750
 this pokemon forget would have endured and he 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.819
 would be just today 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.150
 the expression of the sentence that you can 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.620
 inflicted on pokemon in your game then 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.239
 are you going to exploit that 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.819
 pokemon just to increase your 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.410
 own wealth thanks to this bug that will 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.270
 take the risk of destroying his 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.980
 cartridge 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.890
 this pokemon were therefore present in 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.630
 red blue green and yellow versions and 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.460
 it is said that missing you would also be 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.500
 present in the x and y version 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.100
 in the form of easter egg to you to play 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.410
 I'll let you look for second case is 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.730
 one of the most mysterious pokemon 731 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.600
 it is said that a certain gentleman 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.180
 nakamura programmers had a small 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.580
 psychological concern and god he 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.040
 wanted to create a new nation 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.050
 empire of Japan and for that he wanted 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.630
 go through pokemon to manipulate 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.320
 directly the youth so he added 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.300
 a pokemon at the game the pokemon 731 in 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.870
 honor to his father who was working in 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.580
 unit 731 it was a secret unit of 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.100
 the Japanese army during the second 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.290
 world war where scientists 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.740
 work on biological weapons or 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.790
 chemicals and also made 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.940
 experiments on humans 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.430
 not cool that's what happens when you 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.290
 meet him he looks like a pokemon 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.330
 ghosts as in the tower from the front 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.280
 city ​​then it blinks and there 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.550
 appear images that can not be 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.910
 not really discern at first 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:12.070
 so here are the real pictures you can 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.900
 find them easily by typing unit 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.900
 731 on google 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.030
 in order so we see shiro here 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.010
 the commander of the unit then a photo 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.100
 experiments or surgery 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.200
 together do the surgery next 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.630
 we have a picture of the outside of the 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.450
 building 731 then an imperial flag 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.460
 Japanese and finally the outside of the 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.350
 building which is today open to 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.570
 public this time if you try to 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.790
 capture this pokemon the game will crash and 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.830
 by restarting you will have a blank screen 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.000
 with the game's music play 10 times 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.390
 faster than normal 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.740
 So I do not advise you for info 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.440

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.940
