00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:08.920
 Hey ! 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.920
 What is your current state of mind in preparation for tomorrow's Olympic team selection meeting every four years for tomorrow? 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.520
 With a good sense of tension 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.230
 I think I'm in the deputy secretary 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.480
 I Japan in watching Well Hirai's also a practice of today 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.480
 Smile was also seen , but how is it as a state? 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.439
 Have 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.579
 I was going to do something to do 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.829
 this 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.829
 In order to enjoy a sense of tension even a little 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.440
 Well, I have been working on it since last year 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.800
 I think it would be good if the results could be achieved 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.930
 A bird from the base that I've been working on since the end of last year 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.930
 The following can be said as a response to endurance strengthening 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:02.430
 Please, look at the race 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.280
 The other day Ueno Korea from the finish of the first time I say about the body come to here to sound 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.630
 It had been well acclaimed in Fu say also has changed 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.630
 The person in question specific month following the neighborhood 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.280
 Hey Is that so? 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.110
 Oh dear 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.170
 And that 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.400
 I think it's not easy 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.230
 Say so 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.410
 I think Krka tension is also to increase their own 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:36.180
 Well here player Olympics 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.550
 I think not quite the player I have bad tone in the player Tteyuu want out I want to go 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.430
 Ne 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.460
 I thought it was natural 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.950
 Oh dear 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.150
 The last is my concentration turn 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.900
 Not only all of the coming things 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.850
 I thought I want to endless out 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.850
 So everyone Daredare is I might try to ultra 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.980
 There is no such sweet tool 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:03.230
 Oh my dear 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:06.350
 Positive in the midst Well men's and of a higher priority than Well World Congress to say that one shot progress 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.490
 The preliminary round for the North Island's is of Well Olympic 3-game losing streak 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.760
 I think it will be the first barrier, but it seems to be a genuine fight 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.760
 Is it 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.430
 Oh dear 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:29.640
 in the world 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:32.810
 Japan's first strike on seeing that screening is very high opinion 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.810
 I think it's a tournament 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.260
 Tension that is not in another country 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.380
 Roughly to do unless taste in this April 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.090
 Among the top players in the world I mean determined the players are determined 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.640
 First of all 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.330
 If you do not slip through the tournament 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.330
 It is not good 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.770
 Not abroad 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.770
 I have to come in tension 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.750
 Solder in so kind of meaning 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.890
 From last year 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.890
 It is good because I have practiced properly 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.159
 Well representation rights acquisition Armor Of course words of the Olympic Games are also shown 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.670
 I think I will 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:23.140
 In that sense, what kind of goal do you think the tournament is like now ? 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.280
 Hm 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.280
 Don't let the meat separate 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:37.210
 I think that or not picking waiting to kind of this 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.580
 Or there are no more or to see the closure, such as if going to kill Well Do as you think 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.790
 But Well 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.450
 Looking to summer 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:49.010
 I 've been making it after all a 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.010
 Well I can't stop here 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:56.100
 What a big pectoral muscle taken ko 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:01.170
 I think I want to go pointing 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:06.210
 After all comments last year's comment 0 positive 100 and 200 totally different swim 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.870
 This kind of swimming is finished even after three months again from there I had was by saying 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.870
 It will be done 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.300
 I 'm starting to get out of my breath 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.300
 Oh dear 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.900
 For now 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.830
 This Japanese Championship 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.830
 Look at the result 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:29.840
 I think it depends on the outcome of this Japan Championship whether you can do Saturday 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.760
 Oh dear 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:42.820
 I would not do to be increased more speed 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.820
 As long as we look at the results of last year, we will have to strengthen the second phase more 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.050
 A lot of things you need to do 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:48.350
 It is in a 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.150
 This time 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:58.670
 We have a great game in preparation for how far we can go out 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:02.849
 In this tournament, if you can get a good time of 100 million or so, you can see yourself in summer 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:05.380
 It seems to be satisfied with this yourself on with an eye to the Olympic Games 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:08.780
 Do you have a feel 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:12.340
 You're not satisfied 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.340
 It is satisfactory if we put in early 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.640
 Well even in terms of recording 4 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.830
 I think 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.830
 Hey, do not go unless we put out a 6 stool record 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.900
 It is hard 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:36.030
 Give me a stop 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:39.030
 Well there is a qualifying of 100 meters quick 100 meters, but there is a shop of 10 series, but well copo's own 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.460
 Or something speak range and is a good race image in the middle 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.449
 If there is strategic 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:48.639
 I'm not necessarily speaking the strategy 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:51.490
 This doers still do not begin Curran 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:55.330
 I will also be a junior 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.430
 I will finish myself until my sense of tension comes here this year 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.150
 I think it's wind 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.750
 Oh dear 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.750
 Be bold 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.920
 I am 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.080
 To this and now 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.509
 I will Yes 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:15.439
 Yes , welcome to the Olympics 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:16.639
 I think that the feeling towards the Olympics is getting stronger again 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:20.319
 But around that 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.319
 It is now how is that to remember 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:29.090
 No, it's an Olympic screening, it 's a great number of media. 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.880
 Well that's once every four years 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.580
 Well that pressure 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.990
 Has been tasted many times 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:41.440
 I think I want to enjoy it a little bit 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.580
 Know has been also still hard practice 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.580
 So as not to lose to the pressure 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:50.680
 Well I think that I want to get myself strong one year this year 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.680
 One more day 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:07:02.260
 Hate-I have a two- year contract with Mr. Ms. 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.500
 And also became the Fu say that management noble high school students a after various Olympic 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.520
 I can receive it, but around here 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.680
 You or 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:13.070
 As a professional 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.070
 I do that for the best performance 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:23.310
 Well I think that I want to fight and fight 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:27.680
 Even if you look at the world, the players of Teraki are quite good 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:31.240
