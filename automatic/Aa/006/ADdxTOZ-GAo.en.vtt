done the side by side and I do notice
that<00:02:44.980> they<00:02:45.100> can<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.840> is<00:02:47.020> more<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.410> matte

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
that they can this is more of a matte

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.850 
that they can this is more of a matte
finish<00:02:47.920> where<00:02:48.370> this<00:02:48.520> is<00:02:48.760> more<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.180> like<00:02:49.210> a<00:02:49.360> dewy

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
finish where this is more of like a dewy

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.740 
finish where this is more of like a dewy
kind<00:02:50.860> of<00:02:50.980> natural<00:02:51.460> finish<00:02:51.820> so<00:02:52.120> I<00:02:52.150> do<00:02:52.270> see<00:02:52.600> that

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
kind of natural finish so I do see that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.560 
kind of natural finish so I do see that
difference<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:54.310> makeup<00:02:54.520> seems<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:55.330> kind

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
difference and the makeup seems to kind

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.710 
difference and the makeup seems to kind
of<00:02:55.630> stay<00:02:56.050> just<00:02:56.350> a<00:02:56.500> little<00:02:56.530> bit<00:02:56.860> better<00:02:57.720> it

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
of stay just a little bit better it

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.330 
of stay just a little bit better it
covered<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.440> made<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.710> coverage<00:03:00.130> like<00:03:00.310> a

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
covered and made the coverage like a

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.430 
covered and made the coverage like a
little<00:03:00.640> bit<00:03:00.790> more<00:03:01.060> intense<00:03:01.390> as<00:03:01.720> opposed<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.260> on

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
little bit more intense as opposed to on

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.660 
little bit more intense as opposed to on
this<00:03:02.650> side<00:03:03.960> so<00:03:04.960> I<00:03:05.410> definitely<00:03:05.950> can<00:03:06.400> already

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
this side so I definitely can already

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.280 
this side so I definitely can already
see<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.060> difference<00:03:07.090> just<00:03:07.570> from<00:03:07.840> putting<00:03:08.140> my

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
see the difference just from putting my

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.590 
see the difference just from putting my
makeup<00:03:08.500> on<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:09.520> I<00:03:09.550> want<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.000> see<00:03:10.150> how<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.420> wears

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.210 
airbrushed anymore there I definitely
notice<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.990> difference<00:03:52.290> when<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.440> first<00:03:52.710> put

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220

notice the difference when I first put
the<00:03:53.340> makeup<00:03:53.490> on<00:03:53.730> but<00:03:54.540> now<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:55.230> just<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:55.830> don't

the makeup on but now I just I don't
really<00:03:56.280> see<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.640> difference<00:03:57.060> it's<00:03:57.240> kind<00:03:57.450> of

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
really see a difference it's kind of

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.080 
really see a difference it's kind of
actually<00:03:57.900> accentuated<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.860> have<00:03:59.430> some<00:03:59.670> some

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
actually accentuated I have some some

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.940 
actually accentuated I have some some
pimples<00:04:00.420> down<00:04:00.630> here<00:04:00.990> that<00:04:01.560> are<00:04:01.680> kind<00:04:01.890> of

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
pimples down here that are kind of

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.000 
pimples down here that are kind of
drying<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.810> it<00:04:03.810> just<00:04:04.110> kind<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.320> accentuated

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
drying and it just kind of accentuated

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.220 
drying and it just kind of accentuated
any<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.340> my<00:04:05.520> dry<00:04:05.790> areas<00:04:06.390> where<00:04:06.840> I<00:04:06.870> had<00:04:07.110> the

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
any of my dry areas where I had the

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.590 
any of my dry areas where I had the
primer<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.920> would<00:04:08.850> say<00:04:09.000> if<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.240> don't<00:04:09.270> have

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
primer I would say if you don't have

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.350 
primer I would say if you don't have
oily<00:04:10.020> skin<00:04:10.050> skip<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.100> primer<00:04:11.490> altogether

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
oily skin skip this primer altogether

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.900 
oily skin skip this primer altogether
it's<00:04:12.780> not<00:04:13.170> necessary<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:14.160> doesn't<00:04:14.760> really

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
it's not necessary it doesn't really

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.479 
it's not necessary it doesn't really
make<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> difference<00:04:15.859> just<00:04:16.859> go<00:04:17.010> ahead<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.400> put

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
make a difference just go ahead and put

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.280 
make a difference just go ahead and put
on<00:04:17.580> your<00:04:17.730> foundation<00:04:17.880> over<00:04:18.510> your<00:04:18.660> moisturizer

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
on your foundation over your moisturizer

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.770 
on your foundation over your moisturizer
I<00:04:19.709> really<00:04:20.370> think<00:04:20.580> that<00:04:20.670> primers<00:04:21.150> are<00:04:21.330> kind<00:04:21.630> of

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
I really think that primers are kind of

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.540 
I really think that primers are kind of
for<00:04:22.109> people<00:04:22.320> with<00:04:22.620> oily<00:04:22.830> or<00:04:23.100> skin<00:04:24.110> unless<00:04:25.110> it

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
for people with oily or skin unless it

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.240 
for people with oily or skin unless it
you<00:04:26.550> know<00:04:26.669> got<00:04:26.940> some<00:04:27.480> sort<00:04:27.660> of<00:04:27.720> brightening<00:04:28.250> or

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
you know got some sort of brightening or

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.570 
you know got some sort of brightening or
anti<00:04:29.610> redness<00:04:30.330> or<00:04:31.050> something<00:04:31.320> like<00:04:31.440> that<00:04:31.650> so

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
anti redness or something like that so

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.100 
anti redness or something like that so
if<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.820> have<00:04:32.850> drier<00:04:33.240> skin<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.750> would<00:04:33.900> try<00:04:34.050> the

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
if you have drier skin I would try the

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.500 
if you have drier skin I would try the
brightening<00:04:34.590> formulation<00:04:35.250> F<00:04:35.850> primer<00:04:36.360> that

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
brightening formulation F primer that

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.940 
brightening formulation F primer that
urban<00:04:36.810> decay<00:04:37.020> has<00:04:37.260> because<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:37.830> would

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
urban decay has because that would

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.680 
urban decay has because that would
probably<00:04:38.160> work<00:04:38.400> a<00:04:38.640> little<00:04:38.730> bit<00:04:38.940> better<00:04:39.300> as

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
probably work a little bit better as

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.720 
probably work a little bit better as
opposed<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:41.720> this<00:04:42.720> primer<00:04:43.169> so<00:04:43.919> final<00:04:44.370> verdict

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
opposed to this primer so final verdict

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.310 
opposed to this primer so final verdict
I'm<00:04:45.000> not<00:04:45.540> gonna<00:04:45.690> buy<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:45.930> again

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
I'm not gonna buy it again

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.250 
I'm not gonna buy it again
