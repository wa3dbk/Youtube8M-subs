00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the tree of death all right now where

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.400 
the tree of death all right now where
the<00:00:25.140> build<00:00:25.380> stands<00:00:25.830> right<00:00:26.099> now<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:29.000> got<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
the build stands right now I got the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.560 
the build stands right now I got the
spindles<00:00:31.410> made<00:00:31.700> and<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:35.210> some<00:00:36.210> bolts<00:00:36.480> and

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
spindles made and I have some bolts and

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.940 
spindles made and I have some bolts and
stuff<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.050> axles<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.500> need<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> weld

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
stuff and the axles that I need to weld

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.650 
stuff and the axles that I need to weld
on<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.160> outside<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.850> steel<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
on the outside of the steel on the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.780 
on the outside of the steel on the
outside<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.110> spindle<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.399> I'll<00:00:41.520> probably

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
outside of the spindle and I'll probably

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.900 
outside of the spindle and I'll probably
be<00:00:42.180> doing<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.480> tonight<00:00:42.809> maybe<00:00:43.649> not<00:00:44.550> too<00:00:44.700> sure

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
be doing that tonight maybe not too sure

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.790 
be doing that tonight maybe not too sure
yet<00:00:45.530> also<00:00:46.530> got<00:00:46.710> some<00:00:46.739> fenders<00:00:47.309> made<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.910> it

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
yet also got some fenders made for it

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.840 
yet also got some fenders made for it
I'm<00:00:49.800> gonna<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.219> reinforce<00:00:50.430> those<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
I'm gonna have to reinforce those a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.310 
I'm gonna have to reinforce those a
little<00:00:51.030> bit<00:00:51.180> don't<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> things

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
little bit don't like the things

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.670 
little bit don't like the things
flopping<00:00:52.829> around<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.250> wobbling<00:00:54.289> but<00:00:55.289> yeah

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
flopping around and wobbling but yeah

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.580 
flopping around and wobbling but yeah
real<00:00:55.860> simple<00:00:56.989> it's<00:00:57.989> kind<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.379> that

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
real simple it's kind of like that

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.000 
real simple it's kind of like that
that's<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> really<00:00:59.760> did<00:01:00.649> nothing<00:01:01.649> too

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
that's all I really did nothing too

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.979 
that's all I really did nothing too
elaborate<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.000> I'll<00:01:03.180> probably<00:01:03.329> be<00:01:03.719> putting

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
elaborate but I'll probably be putting

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.479 
elaborate but I'll probably be putting
in<00:01:04.080> some<00:01:04.260> pieces<00:01:04.500> right<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.220> make<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.460> so

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
in some pieces right here to make it so

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.460 
in some pieces right here to make it so
that<00:01:05.610> way<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.939> doesn't<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.990> know<00:01:07.080> Bend

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that way it doesn't you know Bend

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.859 
that way it doesn't you know Bend
downward<00:01:09.320> I'd<00:01:10.320> also<00:01:10.650> cut<00:01:10.920> these<00:01:11.390> out<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.630> some

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
downward I'd also cut these out of some

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.429 
downward I'd also cut these out of some
inch<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.500> half<00:01:13.530> square<00:01:14.400> tubing<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.439> these

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
inch and a half square tubing and these

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.130 
inch and a half square tubing and these
are<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.939> be<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.360> wasn't<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> do

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
are going to be I wasn't going to do

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.080 
are going to be I wasn't going to do
this<00:01:19.320> initially<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.369> decided<00:01:20.670> might<00:01:20.970> as

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
this initially but I decided might as

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.330 
this initially but I decided might as
well<00:01:21.240> these<00:01:22.229> will<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> bottom

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
well these will be going on the bottom

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.800 
well these will be going on the bottom
right<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.900> then<00:01:25.229> I'll<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.740> welding

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
right here and then I'll be welding

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
right here and then I'll be welding
these<00:01:27.810> onto<00:01:28.259> here<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.799> then<00:01:29.159> wiring<00:01:29.700> them<00:01:29.820> all

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
these onto here and then wiring them all

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.359 
these onto here and then wiring them all
up<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.409> only<00:01:31.530> three<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.159> that's

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
up and you see only three here that's

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.160 
up and you see only three here that's
because<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.329> other<00:01:33.509> three<00:01:33.750> already

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
because I have the other three already

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.600 
because I have the other three already
done<00:01:34.470> let's<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.280> out<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.460> check<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.700> out<00:01:37.579> now<00:01:38.579> I

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
done let's go out and check it out now I

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
done let's go out and check it out now I
have<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> first<00:01:39.540> three<00:01:39.829> set<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:40.920> out<00:01:41.100> here

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:56.130 

and<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:53.110> steel<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:53.920> just<00:01:54.310> welded<00:01:55.120> right<00:01:55.360> well

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
and that steel is just welded right well

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.840 
and that steel is just welded right well
you<00:01:56.200> can't<00:01:56.410> see<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.620> weld<00:01:56.830> mark<00:01:57.070> behind<00:01:57.490> it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
you can't see the weld mark behind it

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.630 
you can't see the weld mark behind it
but<00:01:58.500> yeah<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.530> just<00:01:59.800> gelled<00:02:00.190> right<00:02:00.370> into<00:02:00.580> the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
but yeah I just gelled right into the

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.420 
but yeah I just gelled right into the
ground<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.530> then<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:02.590> have<00:02:02.740> these<00:02:02.920> wires<00:02:03.250> that

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
ground and then I have these wires that

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.100 
ground and then I have these wires that
connect<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.180> whole<00:02:04.360> thing<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.780> go<00:02:04.900> across

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
connect the whole thing that go across

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.050 
connect the whole thing that go across
the<00:02:05.410> ground<00:02:05.650> here<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:06.160> was<00:02:06.640> gonna<00:02:06.760> have<00:02:07.000> them

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
the ground here I was gonna have them

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.699 
the ground here I was gonna have them
going<00:02:07.270> up<00:02:07.479> here<00:02:07.780> but<00:02:07.960> then<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.170> thought<00:02:08.380> I'm

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
going up here but then I thought I'm

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.320 
going up here but then I thought I'm
gonna<00:02:08.800> have<00:02:09.039> birds<00:02:09.369> landing<00:02:09.880> on<00:02:10.060> them<00:02:10.209> and

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
gonna have birds landing on them and

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.100 
gonna have birds landing on them and
stuff<00:02:10.450> like<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:10.869> they'll<00:02:10.990> probably

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
stuff like that and they'll probably

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.520 
stuff like that and they'll probably
just<00:02:11.290> fall<00:02:12.070> over<00:02:12.570> so<00:02:13.570> what<00:02:13.870> I'm<00:02:13.930> gonna<00:02:14.110> be

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
just fall over so what I'm gonna be

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.979 
just fall over so what I'm gonna be
doing<00:02:14.920> this<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.760> where<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:15.910> connect<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
doing this is where I connect the

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.510 
doing this is where I connect the
battery<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.739> I<00:02:20.739> was<00:02:20.980> thing<00:02:21.100> about<00:02:21.280> making

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
battery and I was thing about making

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.340 
battery and I was thing about making
these<00:02:21.640> solar<00:02:21.910> cell<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.480> know<00:02:22.600> putting<00:02:23.140> up<00:02:23.260> a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
these solar cell you know putting up a

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.990 
these solar cell you know putting up a
solar<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.100> all<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.370> kind<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.580> stuff<00:02:24.700> but<00:02:24.940> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
solar and all that kind of stuff but the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.610 
solar and all that kind of stuff but the
problem<00:02:25.450> with<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.600> is<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.470> went

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
problem with that is that if I went

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.460 
problem with that is that if I went
solar<00:02:26.950> with<00:02:27.220> these<00:02:27.400> things<00:02:28.110> they<00:02:29.110> charge

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
solar with these things they charge

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.050 
solar with these things they charge
during<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.860> day<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.220> they'd<00:02:30.310> be<00:02:30.430> on<00:02:30.459> at<00:02:30.880> night

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
during the day and they'd be on at night

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.850 
during the day and they'd be on at night
and<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.420> don't<00:02:31.450> want<00:02:31.810> them<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.050> be<00:02:32.140> on<00:02:32.350> every

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
and I don't want them to be on every

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.270 
and I don't want them to be on every
single<00:02:32.890> dang<00:02:33.310> night<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:35.940> yeah<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:38.070> think<00:02:39.070> I'll

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
single dang night so yeah I think I'll

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.440 
single dang night so yeah I think I'll
just<00:02:39.430> stick<00:02:39.850> with<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.270> regular<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:41.290> know<00:02:42.450> 12

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
just stick with the regular you know 12

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.199 
just stick with the regular you know 12
volt<00:02:43.750> 7<00:02:44.200> amp<00:02:44.350> hour<00:02:44.530> battery<00:02:45.209> rechargeable

volt 7 amp hour battery rechargeable
things<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.870> then<00:02:46.959> whenever<00:02:47.080> we<00:02:47.350> come<00:02:47.500> out

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
things and then whenever we come out

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.860 
things and then whenever we come out
here<00:02:47.800> at<00:02:47.890> night<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.280> can<00:02:48.520> just<00:02:48.700> put<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:49.750> down<00:02:49.810> on

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
here at night I can just put it down on

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.289 
here at night I can just put it down on
the<00:02:50.019> ground<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.350> plug<00:02:50.620> them<00:02:50.709> in<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:52.060> wires

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
the ground and plug them in the wires

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.600 
the ground and plug them in the wires
I'm<00:02:52.690> eventually<00:02:53.080> gonna<00:02:53.320> bury<00:02:53.650> those<00:02:53.860> I'm

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
I'm eventually gonna bury those I'm

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.830 
I'm eventually gonna bury those I'm
gonna<00:02:54.700> come<00:02:54.880> out<00:02:54.970> here<00:02:55.120> with<00:02:55.209> a<00:02:55.239> little<00:02:55.299> shovel

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
gonna come out here with a little shovel

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.960 
gonna come out here with a little shovel
and<00:02:55.930> just<00:02:56.080> make<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.260> little<00:02:56.440> trench<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.280> stick

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970

them<00:02:58.090> down<00:02:58.239> in<00:02:58.420> there<00:02:58.630> don't<00:02:59.530> like<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.739> idea

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
them down in there don't like the idea

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.380 
them down in there don't like the idea
of<00:03:00.040> all<00:03:00.190> these<00:03:00.370> wires<00:03:00.580> being<00:03:00.820> exposed<00:03:01.150> like

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
of all these wires being exposed like

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.320 
of all these wires being exposed like
this<00:03:01.570> that's<00:03:01.810> not<00:03:01.870> very<00:03:02.430> very<00:03:03.430> good<00:03:03.700> idea

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.289 
mowers and my weed trimmer still they're
still<00:03:53.230> from<00:03:54.040> when<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:54.459> used<00:03:54.549> to<00:03:54.760> do<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.060> years

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
still from when I used to do it years

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.750 
still from when I used to do it years
back

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.110 

these<00:03:58.510> lawnmowers<00:03:59.049> worked<00:03:59.409> great<00:03:59.950> it's<00:04:00.849> just

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
these lawnmowers worked great it's just

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.280 
these lawnmowers worked great it's just
I<00:04:01.269> have<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:02.040> get<00:04:03.040> replacement<00:04:03.700> cables

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
I have to get replacement cables

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.569 
I have to get replacement cables
throttle<00:04:05.290> cables<00:04:05.650> for<00:04:05.829> these<00:04:06.010> because<00:04:06.280> they

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
throttle cables for these because they

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.819 
throttle cables for these because they
crusted<00:04:07.090> up<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.480> they<00:04:08.290> wouldn't<00:04:08.530> pull

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
crusted up and they wouldn't pull

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.080 
crusted up and they wouldn't pull
anymore<00:04:09.659> so<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.980> cable<00:04:12.280> will<00:04:12.430> pull<00:04:12.760> anymore

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
anymore so the cable will pull anymore

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.880 
anymore so the cable will pull anymore
or<00:04:13.450> nothing<00:04:13.810> so<00:04:13.989> I<00:04:14.019> got<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.290> get<00:04:14.379> a<00:04:14.440> whole<00:04:14.680> new

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
or nothing so I got to get a whole new

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.620 
or nothing so I got to get a whole new
replacement<00:04:15.549> cable<00:04:15.790> I<00:04:15.819> think<00:04:16.060> what<00:04:16.209> happened

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
replacement cable I think what happened

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.409 
replacement cable I think what happened
was<00:04:16.810> just<00:04:17.320> rain<00:04:18.280> or<00:04:18.519> water<00:04:18.729> or<00:04:18.940> whatever<00:04:19.090> got

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
was just rain or water or whatever got

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.969 
was just rain or water or whatever got
down<00:04:19.630> inside<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.019> cable<00:04:20.199> and<00:04:20.410> rusted<00:04:20.889> the

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
down inside the cable and rusted the

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.040 
down inside the cable and rusted the
cable<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.609> outside<00:04:22.000> sleeve<00:04:22.389> I'm<00:04:22.660> thinking

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
cable to the outside sleeve I'm thinking

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.990 
cable to the outside sleeve I'm thinking
because<00:04:23.979> it<00:04:24.100> doesn't<00:04:24.340> make<00:04:24.400> any<00:04:24.550> sense<00:04:24.639> why<00:04:24.970> I

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
because it doesn't make any sense why I

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.400 
because it doesn't make any sense why I
can't<00:04:25.389> pull<00:04:25.660> on<00:04:25.840> this<00:04:26.160> it<00:04:27.160> works<00:04:27.340> down<00:04:27.580> here<00:04:28.410> no

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
can't pull on this it works down here no

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.790 
can't pull on this it works down here no
that<00:04:29.650> works<00:04:30.419> but<00:04:31.419> it<00:04:31.660> just<00:04:31.900> doesn't<00:04:32.410> work<00:04:32.560> up

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
that works but it just doesn't work up

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.200 
that works but it just doesn't work up
here<00:04:33.070> I<00:04:33.100> can't<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.699> know<00:04:33.789> it's<00:04:33.940> just<00:04:34.030> not

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
here I can't you know it's just not
