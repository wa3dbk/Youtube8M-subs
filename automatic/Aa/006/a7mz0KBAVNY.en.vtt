00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.770
 all the rays of the sun are good dear viewers and 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.270
 subscribers with you kirikov yuki and today 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.210
 we 'll talk about such anime 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.220
 as sword art online namely about the first 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.050
 his season is generally strange of course but 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.270
 lately she herself is not accepted 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.790
 considered too overvalued and is 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.130
 video I will briefly talk about the plot a lot 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.140
 friend and of course I will try to prove that 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.130
 the work may be worthy 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.260
 your attention 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.480
 the plot unfolds in the near 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.800
 future where the process is well influenced by 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.140
 gaming industry 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.630
 more specifically, it was created 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.810
 virtual reality helmet mentally 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.400
 immersing a player in the gaming world 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.740
 everything is great and everyone is happy 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.170
 but here comes the game thundered she 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.800
 the whole world namely em am a sword art 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.140
 online 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.890
 and of course our main character is like 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.320
 for the same rig 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.810
 he is the kirito beta tests of the game itself 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.720
 during the official release comes out 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.159
 only 10,000 copies and all people immediately 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.830
 start to login 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.200
 like our main character everything seems to be 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.579
 well the game makes everyone happy 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.920
 study and other 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.659
 like after meeting one of the players 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.579
 together they discover what's in the game 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.740
 no exit button 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.320
 at first they think it's a bug or 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.359
 some flaw but soon everyone 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.700
 teleports to the main city where he himself 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:38.580
 developer kayaba akihiko gay with his 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.470
 appears before the players and says that 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.700
 they are all stuck in games without opportunity 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.490
 log out online 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.619
 until the entire game will not be passed along the way 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.900
 explaining that if you die in the game then 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.000
 die and in real naturally everywhere 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.369
 panic begins no one knows what 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.740
 do but those who participated in 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.840
 beta test like kerry ie plan 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.300
 action and he decides by all means 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.190
 It began to pump as quickly as possible and 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.159
 go home to see your family 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.710
 As for drawing, so here everything is cool 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.869
 I personally did not notice any defects 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.480
 the musical component is also high 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.880
 I especially liked the opening 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.580
 anime is filled with impossible humor 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.400
 jokes funny moments about which 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.390
 and it is involuntarily smiling 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.459
 the semantic load is not so much 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.750
 for everything is basically built on 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.730
 relationship between people 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.280
 that even in a game where everyone seems to be 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.739
 stick together to complete the game and 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.709
 break out of the virtual world but even 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.450
 there was a place of fraud 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.970
 inter-clan feud and killing players with 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.820
 aiming to get them well yes pretty much for 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.620
 clichÃ© a topic but here taking into account 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.110
 originality of the idea looks 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.750
 really good but the main thing is this 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.930
 the emotional component that 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.100
 the case makes the viewer nervous 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.079
 empathize with the main character and even 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.209
 rejoice with him all here in 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.340
 mainly on this and directed and this 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.200
 not at all bad yes everything can be 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.950
 pretty standard 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.019
 in ways 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.239
 but in my opinion everything is very great 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.489
 why as I said before they 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.310
 consider wow wildly overpriced 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.410
 everyone is so enthusiastic about him and so I don't know 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.480
 what is the reason how it all on me on 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.459
 the place is exactly what can make 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.190
 we watch them no matter what 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.350
 and this is in my opinion the most important thing though 2 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.040
 the arch of the first season somehow slowed down 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.290
 turnovers 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.200
 but only on a little sweet story 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.750
 relatively original idea is not bad 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.340
 the filing is all really great 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.060
 looks given all the moments 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.890
 produce 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.349
 line on this dear viewers and 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.930
 subscribers I'll finish everything literally 7 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.640
 even those who are not particularly familiar with anime i 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.950
 I recommend this work to 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.569

 correct then write in the comments
