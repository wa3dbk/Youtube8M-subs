nasty<00:05:54.240> fracture<00:05:55.240> of<00:05:55.540> the<00:05:55.930> both<00:05:56.560> bones<00:05:56.800> in<00:05:57.010> the

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
nasty fracture of the both bones in the

the<00:05:59.800> good<00:06:00.040> news<00:06:00.280> is<00:06:00.310> that<00:06:00.550> they're<00:06:00.940> in<00:06:01.030> the

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
the good news is that they're in the

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.090 
the good news is that they're in the
middle<00:06:01.330> of<00:06:01.510> the<00:06:01.690> in<00:06:02.350> the<00:06:02.500> middle<00:06:02.650> of<00:06:02.770> the<00:06:02.830> shaft

middle of the in the middle of the shaft

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.240 
middle of the in the middle of the shaft
which<00:06:03.820> gives<00:06:04.240> us<00:06:04.420> a<00:06:04.450> good<00:06:04.750> length<00:06:05.050> of<00:06:05.380> bone<00:06:06.040> on

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
which gives us a good length of bone on

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.820 
which gives us a good length of bone on
either<00:06:06.370> side<00:06:06.730> for<00:06:07.090> us<00:06:07.150> to<00:06:07.300> to<00:06:08.080> fly<00:06:08.290> implants

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
either side for us to to fly implants

either side for us to to fly implants
this<00:06:09.160> is<00:06:09.310> certainly<00:06:09.550> the<00:06:09.670> kind<00:06:09.820> of<00:06:09.880> fracture

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
this is certainly the kind of fracture

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.060 
this is certainly the kind of fracture
that's<00:06:10.360> not<00:06:10.600> going<00:06:10.780> to<00:06:10.840> deal<00:06:11.050> with<00:06:11.320> with<00:06:11.770> just

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
that's not going to deal with with just

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.220 
that's not going to deal with with just
a<00:06:12.160> splint<00:06:12.490> this<00:06:13.150> is<00:06:13.300> one<00:06:13.480> unfortunate<00:06:14.110> it's

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230

these little white pellets here that's
actually<00:06:52.940> those<00:06:53.240> are<00:06:53.270> actually<00:06:53.659> shotgun

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
actually those are actually shotgun

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.409 
actually those are actually shotgun
pellets<00:06:54.530> so<00:06:55.190> unfortunately<00:06:55.520> some<00:06:56.060> hunter

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:56.419 
pellets so unfortunately some hunter

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:58.779 
pellets so unfortunately some hunter
somewhere<00:06:56.810> took<00:06:57.080> a<00:06:57.229> took<00:06:57.800> a<00:06:57.949> pot<00:06:58.159> shot<00:06:58.190> at<00:06:58.490> him

00:06:58.779 --> 00:06:58.789 
somewhere took a took a pot shot at him

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.330 
somewhere took a took a pot shot at him
he<00:06:59.780> was<00:06:59.810> obviously<00:07:00.259> not<00:07:00.530> hunting<00:07:00.979> for<00:07:01.159> bear

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
he was obviously not hunting for bear

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.119 
he was obviously not hunting for bear
because<00:07:01.669> this<00:07:01.819> is<00:07:01.940> birdshot<00:07:02.449> this<00:07:02.690> is<00:07:02.949> this<00:07:03.949> is

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:04.129 
because this is birdshot this is this is

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:05.379 
because this is birdshot this is this is
the<00:07:04.219> kind<00:07:04.400> of<00:07:04.490> caliber<00:07:04.819> that<00:07:05.030> you<00:07:05.150> would<00:07:05.270> only

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:05.389 
the kind of caliber that you would only

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:15.100 
the kind of caliber that you would only
be<00:07:05.629> using<00:07:05.870> for<00:07:06.050> birds<00:07:06.500> certainly<00:07:06.979> not

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:25.070
