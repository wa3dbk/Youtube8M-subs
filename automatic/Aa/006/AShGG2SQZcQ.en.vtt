00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.069
 It could be like being again 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.960
 sequence of recipes and cooking course 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.029
 Peruvian puntocom 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.460
 let's continue when this sequence 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:15.380
 of desserts here we will introduce you 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.890
 and a mango handle flamed in rum with 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.470
 accompaniment of water and command 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.480
 and the side in the water can be 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:29.930
 any flavor no longer matters 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.890
 of flavor chocolate chips 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.160
 already then we are going to proceed 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.500
 the foot such that we want to use it here what 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.610
 that we are going to make this dessert I already have 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.100
 like mango handle here 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.570
 peeling day I already have here of this 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.810
 peeled way 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.140
 I have going to accompany as there are lots 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.120
 oim before an Andean fruit that comes 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.700
 this size already for those who suddenly 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.850
 we do not know much as a kind of 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.450
 balls that come in a species of 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.450
 capsules 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.200
 and then we will use for that animal 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.310
 made each sugar 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.590
 at the sugar level I only put 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.289
 a pan of cinnamon and cloves and water 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.960
 made or sugar to fit the 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.090
 consistent level nothing else and show them 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.960
 of that feels a bag of syrup 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:40.729
 let's throw water and it will be more or 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.509
 minus 50 grams a whole mango and then 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.789
 you can start suddenly 200 300 grams 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.789
 gonzÃ¡lez ron this is a very role 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.549
 terrific that tastes slightly 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:56.439
 the coffee we are going to proceed then 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.439
 make our mango 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.310
 first what I do the handle is 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.310
 we are going to contribute in segments 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.220
 but let them be the revolution 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.379
 we already have long so it can be 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.410
 colorful already and you can not miss anymore 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.450
 only the curve we always look for 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.750
 mangoes that they have any 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.820
 enough to carve 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.820
 then we have our mango there 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.820
 here 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.610
 already then 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.849
 first here I have no butter 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.750
 We put in a hot pan that does not 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.190
 it is also not very hot slightly 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.220
 we miss this why 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.850
 it does not come out easily 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.850
 acts 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.250
 good 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.750
 and there is little high center fire 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.130
 so you can 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.450
 all right 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.450
 once that 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.629
 we move 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.629
 retaking 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.550
 it is not possible that it satisfies you with closing 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.980
 a little more fire we let 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.379
 while that 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.379
 we have last let's contribute 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.380
 then it is paramount 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.599
 we unite little ones who study lemon 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.360
 big then only half of 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.110
 that memory as a spy is expo and 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.360
 let's do 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.920
 we miss our 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.920
 half an ounce of rumbear 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.960
 this rock couple has to be the 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.630
 fire very high so that you can 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.630
 change but we are very careful 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.630
 Y 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.810
 to mine 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.110
 I finished planning I finished leaving the 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.650
 fire is ready now let's proceed to 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.650
 serve now 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.740
 then that is ready 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.460
 we throw our water and mantle 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.480
 in that moment because I say 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:10.240
 it's like this in the end because if you do not leave us 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:14.860
 to do if it's not going to be one more love anymore 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.779
 let's proceed to serve then 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.009
 I have as a dish I have some 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:21.009
 decoration details 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.009
 then we proceed to serve 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.980
 and already our 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.980
 mangoes first 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.070
 let's go see 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.150
 always giving the point that some detail 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:58.900
 really to make it a little showy 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.900
 of our plate 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.810
 Y 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.479
 and no more 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.810
 let's order a little with all our 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.810
 plate 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.639
 and there we are going to put it by our side in 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:28.210
 the measuring part 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.210
 and ready 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:38.180
 netflix because if I do not thaw 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:42.729
 and I do not leave him he does not have to do 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:46.400
 a work of nothing we go to a spoon 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:49.660
 as I am doing and we form a 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.660
 small ball 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:59.010
 and they put him in the middle 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:01.500
 we already have sectors on our side and what 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:05.600
 what we do is now give 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.600
 a detail and then with a need 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.659
 and from there we are going to add our 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:13.960
 arguments that we actually go almost to 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:13.960
 final 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:20.430
 already 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.430
 for the our world 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.500
 Y 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.630
 Y 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.630
 we bathe with the syrup 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.870
 we are next 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:42.800
 let's go with all the ammunition because if 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:45.110
 we do not have our dessert there ready to 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.479
 that we can not enjoy but I can 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:51.940
 do at home with ease 

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:51.940
 then we put not this decoration 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.870
 and ready and there we have our handle 

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.870
 awarded his mantle
