back<00:01:21.350> this<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.670> robots<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.660> two

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
back this is this is the robots to two

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.240 
back this is this is the robots to two
feet<00:01:25.259> wide<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:27.380> this<00:01:28.380> wheelbase<00:01:28.979> is

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
feet wide and it's this wheelbase is

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.010 
feet wide and it's this wheelbase is
about<00:01:29.550> two<00:01:29.759> feet<00:01:29.789> so<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.270> made<00:01:30.539> it<00:01:30.690> I<00:01:30.780> just

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
about two feet so I made it I just

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.620 
about two feet so I made it I just
basically<00:01:31.530> made<00:01:31.830> it<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.039> square<00:01:32.429> and<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.330> sticks

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
basically made it a square and it sticks

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.719 
basically made it a square and it sticks
out<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> little<00:01:34.110> bit<00:01:34.259> back<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.340> little<00:01:35.610> bit

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
out a little bit back and a little bit

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:55.270 
out a little bit back and a little bit
in<00:01:35.880> front

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.610 

when<00:01:56.090> you're<00:01:56.300> looking<00:01:56.780> around<00:01:56.960> for<00:01:57.440> these

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
when you're looking around for these

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
when you're looking around for these
track<00:01:58.010> units<00:01:58.520> on<00:01:59.350> snowblowers<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.380> such<00:02:00.920> you

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
track units on snowblowers and such you

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.000 
track units on snowblowers and such you
have<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:02.060> be<00:02:02.180> careful<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.870> smooth<00:02:03.320> idler

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
have to be careful the smooth idler

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.910 
have to be careful the smooth idler
wheel<00:02:04.300> would<00:02:05.300> build<00:02:05.570> up<00:02:05.750> snow<00:02:06.080> between<00:02:06.470> the

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
wheel would build up snow between the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.249 
wheel would build up snow between the
track<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:08.600> wheel

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
track and the wheel

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.340 
track and the wheel
you<00:02:09.740> know<00:02:09.860> snowball<00:02:10.430> effect<00:02:11.200> making<00:02:12.200> it

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
you know snowball effect making it

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.170 
you know snowball effect making it
increase<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.280> increase<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.730> increase<00:02:13.820> in

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
increase and increase and increase in

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.560 
increase and increase and increase in
diameter<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.840> then<00:02:15.080> crack<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:16.570> track

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
diameter and then crack the track

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.690 
diameter and then crack the track
actually<00:02:17.960> one<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.410> these<00:02:18.560> tracks<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.250> actually

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
actually one of these tracks is actually

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.310 
actually one of these tracks is actually
slightly<00:02:20.060> longer<00:02:20.540> than<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.870> other<00:02:21.080> because

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
slightly longer than the other because

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.980 
slightly longer than the other because
there's<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.680> crack<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.280> I've<00:02:22.970> got<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.540> metal

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
there's a crack in it I've got a metal

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.230 
there's a crack in it I've got a metal
brace<00:02:24.230> right<00:02:24.620> here<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.250> almost<00:02:25.640> touches<00:02:26.090> the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
brace right here that almost touches the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.230 
brace right here that almost touches the
wheels<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.840> keeps<00:02:27.590> them<00:02:27.770> clean<00:02:28.120> people<00:02:29.120> have

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
wheels that keeps them clean people have

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.420 
wheels that keeps them clean people have
asked<00:02:29.450> me<00:02:29.480> how<00:02:29.540> much<00:02:29.750> does<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.050> weigh<00:02:30.440> right

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
asked me how much does this weigh right

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.520 
asked me how much does this weigh right
now<00:02:31.640> with<00:02:31.940> this<00:02:32.120> configuration<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.380> weighs

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
now with this configuration it weighs

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:43.309 
now with this configuration it weighs
160<00:02:34.340> pounds

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.789 

the<00:02:43.890> blade<00:02:44.189> is<00:02:44.519> is<00:02:45.090> run<00:02:45.390> by<00:02:45.569> an<00:02:45.719> Arduino<00:02:46.409> and

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
the blade is is run by an Arduino and

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.699 
the blade is is run by an Arduino and
then<00:02:47.280> I've<00:02:47.700> got<00:02:47.879> some<00:02:47.909> software<00:02:48.719> on<00:02:49.049> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
then I've got some software on the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.830 
then I've got some software on the
Arduino<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.430> that's<00:02:50.579> all<00:02:50.849> on<00:02:51.150> my<00:02:51.359> youtube

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
Arduino and that's all on my youtube

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.380 
Arduino and that's all on my youtube
channel<00:02:52.069> so<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:53.400> linear<00:02:53.730> actuators

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
channel so that linear actuators

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.119 
channel so that linear actuators
actually<00:02:54.900> working<00:02:55.200> as<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.650> digital

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
actually working as a digital

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.259 
actually working as a digital
proportional<00:02:57.060> servo<00:02:57.569> if<00:02:58.109> I<00:02:58.200> move<00:02:58.439> the<00:02:58.620> stick

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
proportional servo if I move the stick

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.020 
proportional servo if I move the stick
here<00:03:00.349> it<00:03:01.349> finds<00:03:01.799> that<00:03:01.920> position<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.760> stays

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
here it finds that position and it stays

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.789 
here it finds that position and it stays
there<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.019> other<00:03:04.109> nice<00:03:04.409> thing<00:03:04.439> about

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
there but the other nice thing about

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.830 
there but the other nice thing about
this<00:03:05.159> configuration<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:06.209> is<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.540> it's<00:03:06.689> so

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
this configuration is is that it's so

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.569 
this configuration is is that it's so
quiet<00:03:08.689> so<00:03:09.689> that's<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.290> that's<00:03:10.500> where<00:03:10.829> it<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.189> as

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
quiet so that's it that's where it is as

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:18.410 
quiet so that's it that's where it is as
of<00:03:11.909> December<00:03:12.840> 18<00:03:13.670> 2011<00:03:16.639> which<00:03:17.639> also<00:03:17.939> happens

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
of December 18 2011 which also happens

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.330 
of December 18 2011 which also happens
to<00:03:18.480> be<00:03:18.599> an<00:03:18.840> unbelievably<00:03:19.680> warm<00:03:20.010> day<00:03:20.310> in

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
to be an unbelievably warm day in

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.030 
to be an unbelievably warm day in
Minnesota
