piece<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.619> plate<00:00:19.949> steel<00:00:20.359> and<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.720> actually<00:00:21.900> got

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
piece of plate steel and I actually got

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.750 
piece of plate steel and I actually got
a<00:00:22.199> hook<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> quarter<00:00:22.859> inch<00:00:23.010> steel<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
a hook a quarter inch steel on the

a hook a quarter inch steel on the
inside<00:00:24.619> that's<00:00:25.619> actually<00:00:25.980> welded<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
inside that's actually welded to the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.620 
inside that's actually welded to the
Buick<00:00:26.789> frame<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.990> Nova<00:00:28.170> front<00:00:28.590> clip<00:00:29.630> so

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
Buick frame and the Nova front clip so

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.939 
Buick frame and the Nova front clip so
that<00:00:30.750> made<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:30.990> once<00:00:31.470> they<00:00:31.590> had<00:00:31.740> everything

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that made it once they had everything

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.580 
that made it once they had everything
leveled<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:33.110> straight<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.579> plumb<00:00:35.579> bob<00:00:35.820> dot

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
leveled and straight and plumb bob dot

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.160 
leveled and straight and plumb bob dot
did<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.950> both<00:00:38.129> sides<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.170> boxed

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
did that on both sides and then I boxed

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.479 
did that on both sides and then I boxed
in<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> frame<00:00:42.559> to<00:00:43.559> make<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.829> look<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.430> a

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
in the frame to make it look like a

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.760 
in the frame to make it look like a
frame<00:00:44.789> again<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:46.170> give<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> lot<00:00:46.590> more

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
frame again and to give you a lot more

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.170 
frame again and to give you a lot more
strength<00:00:49.010> this<00:00:50.010> particular<00:00:50.399> site<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.059> is

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
strength this particular site here is

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.310 
strength this particular site here is
got<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.829> idler<00:00:52.829> arm<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.780> did<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
got the idler arm so what I did is the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.990 
got the idler arm so what I did is the
bolts<00:00:55.590> usually<00:00:56.010> were<00:00:56.129> bolted<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.610> inside

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
bolts usually were bolted to the inside

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.450 
bolts usually were bolted to the inside
he<00:00:57.809> catches<00:00:58.320> seals<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.859> side<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.219> frame

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
he catches seals on this side of frame

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.459 
he catches seals on this side of frame
in<00:00:59.609> ANOVA<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.239> access<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.809> bolt<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.289> way

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
in ANOVA and you access to bolt that way

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.689 
in ANOVA and you access to bolt that way
well<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.739> wasn't<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> work<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.609> this

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
well that wasn't going to work in this

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.329 
well that wasn't going to work in this
case<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.180> get<00:01:03.329> steel<00:01:04.260> bushings<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.890> here

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
case I get steel bushings in here

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.370 
case I get steel bushings in here
and<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.299> runs<00:01:06.450> all<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.720> way<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.080> frame

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and it runs all the way to this frame

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.350 
and it runs all the way to this frame
rail<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.890> then<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.220> were<00:01:08.280> 12<00:01:08.880> outs<00:01:09.119> for

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
rail and then there were 12 outs for

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.179 
rail and then there were 12 outs for
this<00:01:09.510> piece<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.170> plates<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.650> their<00:01:10.740> wallet<00:01:11.100> to

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
this piece of plates and their wallet to

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.670 
this piece of plates and their wallet to
that<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.689> frames<00:01:12.990> actually<00:01:13.320> bolted

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
that so now this frames actually bolted

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.950 
that so now this frames actually bolted
together<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> front<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.640> welded<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
together in the front and welded so I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.390 
together in the front and welded so I
make<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:16.500> stronger<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.250> I'll

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
make that a little stronger and I'll

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.999 
make that a little stronger and I'll
probably<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> same<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:19.380> backside

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
probably do the same on the backside

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.640 
probably do the same on the backside
I'll<00:01:21.000> make<00:01:21.270> fishings<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.869> after<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.259> hole<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
I'll make fishings and after the hole to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.410 
I'll make fishings and after the hole to
hold<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> backside<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.670> bolt<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> backside

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
hold the backside and bolt the backside

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.670 
hold the backside and bolt the backside
and<00:01:24.659> it'll<00:01:25.619> keep<00:01:25.860> everything<00:01:26.189> tight<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
and it'll keep everything tight so I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.620 
and it'll keep everything tight so I
make<00:01:28.950> my<00:01:29.070> plates<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.700> got<00:01:29.850> trim<00:01:30.119> off<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> frame

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
make my plates I got trim off the frame

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.770 
make my plates I got trim off the frame
net<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.079> side<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:32.009> yellow<00:01:32.220> line<00:01:32.460> is

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
net on this side I really yellow line is

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.210 
net on this side I really yellow line is
square<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.320> make<00:01:34.560> my<00:01:34.710> plates

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
square that up and make my plates

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.149 
square that up and make my plates
well<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.240> then<00:01:36.799> do<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.860> little<00:01:38.009> bit<00:01:38.130> more

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
well this then do a little bit more

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.730 
well this then do a little bit more
welding<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.850> side<00:01:39.170> obviously<00:01:40.170> guy<00:01:40.590> wait

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
welding in this side obviously guy wait

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.200 
welding in this side obviously guy wait
until<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.100> body<00:01:41.280> off<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.090> in

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
until I get the body off so I can get in

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.200 
until I get the body off so I can get in
here<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.630> weld<00:01:43.170> up<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.640> joint<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.909> along

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
here and weld up that joint and along

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.330 
here and weld up that joint and along
the<00:01:45.329> frame<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.960> little<00:01:46.770> bit<00:01:46.890> down<00:01:47.070> there

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the frame and a little bit down there

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.960 
the frame and a little bit down there
but<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> most<00:01:48.360> part<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:49.250> mean<00:01:50.250> grinding

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
but for the most part I mean grinding

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.819 
but for the most part I mean grinding
and<00:01:51.119> sandblasting<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:51.990> side<00:01:52.229> here<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.560> done

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and sandblasting this side here is done

it's<00:02:02.330> easier<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:05.000> that<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.120> where<00:02:06.300> we're

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it's easier to do so that is where we're

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
lot of time they go on this so it'll

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.500
