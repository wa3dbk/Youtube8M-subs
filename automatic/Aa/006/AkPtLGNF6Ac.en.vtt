a fire attack if this was the other way
around<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:39.480> element<00:03:39.780> was<00:03:40.109> nature<00:03:40.650> and

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
around and this element was nature and

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:41.870 
around and this element was nature and
this<00:03:40.920> was<00:03:41.069> in<00:03:41.160> front<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.489> fire<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.819> would

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
this was in front of the fire it would

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.180 
this was in front of the fire it would
be<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.060> major<00:03:42.329> attack<00:03:42.720> but<00:03:43.470> for<00:03:43.620> some<00:03:43.799> reason

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
be a major attack but for some reason

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.860 
be a major attack but for some reason
nature<00:03:44.670> attacks<00:03:44.760> are<00:03:45.120> stronger<00:03:45.450> against<00:03:45.660> fire

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
nature attacks are stronger against fire

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.390 
nature attacks are stronger against fire
attacks<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:46.350> don't<00:03:46.530> know<00:03:46.650> why<00:03:46.799> they<00:03:47.040> just<00:03:47.220> are

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
attacks I don't know why they just are

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.030 
attacks I don't know why they just are
red<00:03:48.150> star<00:03:48.329> for<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.510> fire<00:03:48.720> attack<00:03:49.109> that's<00:03:49.920> the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
red star for the fire attack that's the

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.390 
red star for the fire attack that's the
normal<00:03:50.310> type<00:03:50.519> attack<00:03:50.849> to<00:03:51.000> fire<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.980> we<00:03:53.310> are

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
normal type attack to fire and we are

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.490 
normal type attack to fire and we are
gonna<00:03:53.519> do<00:03:53.760> physical<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.569> don't<00:03:55.290> know<00:03:55.349> if<00:03:55.440> you

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
gonna do physical I don't know if you

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.839 
gonna do physical I don't know if you
level<00:03:55.739> up<00:03:55.769> your<00:03:55.920> dragons<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.549> can<00:03:56.700> have

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
level up your dragons you can have

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.089 
level up your dragons you can have
better<00:03:57.120> cooldown<00:03:57.630> times<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.170> have<00:03:58.260> no<00:03:58.410> idea<00:03:58.739> but

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
better cooldown times I have no idea but

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.879 
better cooldown times I have no idea but
that'd<00:03:59.670> be<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.819> nice<00:04:00.000> addition<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.599> game

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
that'd be a nice addition to the game

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.900 
that'd be a nice addition to the game
you<00:04:01.889> know<00:04:01.980> if<00:04:02.099> they<00:04:02.190> kind<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.459> modify<00:04:02.849> the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
you know if they kind of modify the

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.759 
you know if they kind of modify the
battle<00:04:03.359> system<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:03.930> every<00:04:04.230> dragon<00:04:04.650> doesn't

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
battle system so every dragon doesn't

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.979 
battle system so every dragon doesn't
have<00:04:04.950> exactly<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.579> same<00:04:05.819> thing<00:04:06.150> or<00:04:06.630> maybe

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
have exactly the same thing or maybe

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.659 
have exactly the same thing or maybe
rare<00:04:07.319> dragons<00:04:07.859> can<00:04:08.010> have<00:04:08.160> more<00:04:08.370> powerful

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
rare dragons can have more powerful

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:16.060 
rare dragons can have more powerful
attacks<00:04:11.780> that<00:04:12.780> was<00:04:12.900> bad

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.770 

okay<00:04:17.070> then<00:04:17.459> so<00:04:17.880> we<00:04:18.000> lost<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.359> battle<00:04:18.570> that

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
okay then so we lost that battle that

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.490 
okay then so we lost that battle that
was<00:04:18.930> terrible

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500
