five<00:01:32.490> kills<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.060> bloodthirsty<00:01:33.720> merciless

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
five kills like bloodthirsty merciless

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.990 
five kills like bloodthirsty merciless
ruthless<00:01:35.990> relentless<00:01:37.520> brutal<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.820> then<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
ruthless relentless brutal and then a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.819 
ruthless relentless brutal and then a
nuclear<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.689> think<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.590> order<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
nuclear I think was like in the order of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.550 
nuclear I think was like in the order of
how<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> went<00:01:41.250> then<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.909> means<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.560> advanced

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
how it went then that means in advanced

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.649 
how it went then that means in advanced
warfare<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.610> probably<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.210> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.600> be

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
warfare it's probably just going to be

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.510 
warfare it's probably just going to be
another<00:01:45.930> quote<00:01:46.409> unquote<00:01:46.560> nuclear<00:01:47.159> maybe<00:01:47.340> not

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
another quote unquote nuclear maybe not

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.700 
another quote unquote nuclear maybe not
called<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.909> nuclear<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.079> another<00:01:49.380> stupid

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
called a nuclear but just another stupid

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
kem strikes but you know obviously I

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.590 
kem strikes but you know obviously I
could<00:02:26.250> have<00:02:26.370> miscounted<00:02:26.850> one<00:02:27.180> or<00:02:27.300> two<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.540> I
