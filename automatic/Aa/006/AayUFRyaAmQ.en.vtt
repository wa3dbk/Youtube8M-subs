00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the four seem to be a little noisy as a

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.970 
the four seem to be a little noisy as a

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
was considering the Lexus then it came

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.500 
was considering the Lexus then it came
out<00:02:22.260> at<00:02:22.440> 42<00:02:22.650> thousand<00:02:22.950> dollars<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.519> that<00:02:24.390> was

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
too much and they seem to have

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.059 
too much and they seem to have
