this<00:05:16.199> gives<00:05:16.440> it<00:05:16.530> a<00:05:16.620> special<00:05:16.740> sense<00:05:17.159> of<00:05:17.340> place

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
this gives it a special sense of place

ninety percent of our practicing as the
exam<00:05:33.210> sustainable<00:05:34.050> farming<00:05:34.440> methods<00:05:34.860> and

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
exam sustainable farming methods and

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.159 
exam sustainable farming methods and
actually<00:05:35.879> the<00:05:35.970> family<00:05:36.300> dis<00:05:36.479> announces<00:05:36.930> last

year they wanted to send you a hundred

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.110 
year they wanted to send you a hundred
percent<00:05:38.789> by<00:05:39.319> 2008<00:05:40.370> so<00:05:41.370> it<00:05:41.580> is<00:05:41.699> something<00:05:41.940> for

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
percent by 2008 so it is something for
