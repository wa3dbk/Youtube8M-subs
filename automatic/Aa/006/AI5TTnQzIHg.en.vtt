00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
you have to work out based on what

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.790 
you have to work out based on what
people<00:03:10.850> are<00:03:11.090> doing<00:03:11.270> whether<00:03:12.050> they're<00:03:12.680> the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
whether they're simply trying to force

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.570 
whether they're simply trying to force
people<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.090> run<00:03:20.270> through<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.600> cards<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:22.430> only

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
people to run through the cards the only

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.610 
people to run through the cards the only
thing<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:22.850> does<00:03:23.090> let<00:03:23.360> it<00:03:23.450> down<00:03:23.660> is<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:24.200> for

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
thing that does let it down is that for

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.460 
thing that does let it down is that for
characters<00:03:25.190> are<00:03:25.430> effectively<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.210> same

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
characters are effectively the same

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.460 
characters are effectively the same
these<00:03:27.470> guys<00:03:27.710> here<00:03:28.960> and<00:03:29.960> these<00:03:30.110> are<00:03:30.290> all<00:03:30.320> the

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
these guys here and these are all the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.730 
these guys here and these are all the
ones<00:03:30.680> which<00:03:30.980> basically<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:33.140> have<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.350> control

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
ones which basically you have to control

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.230 
ones which basically you have to control
the<00:03:33.860> certain<00:03:34.100> amount<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.400> numbers<00:03:34.940> and<00:03:34.970> the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
the certain amount of numbers and the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.120 
the certain amount of numbers and the
amount<00:03:35.810> you<00:03:35.990> have<00:03:36.020> to<00:03:36.170> control<00:03:36.590> is<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:36.890> same

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
amount you have to control is the same

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.030 
amount you have to control is the same
so<00:03:37.820> so<00:03:38.450> really<00:03:39.040> it's<00:03:41.110> it<00:03:42.110> would<00:03:42.350> I<00:03:42.470> would<00:03:42.950> have

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
so so really it's it would I would have

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.380 
so so really it's it would I would have
preferred<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.550> if<00:03:43.580> basically<00:03:44.060> there<00:03:44.270> were

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
preferred it if basically there were

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.700 
preferred it if basically there were
there<00:03:44.750> were<00:03:44.840> seven<00:03:45.110> different<00:03:45.230> characters

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
there were seven different characters

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.040 
there were seven different characters
with<00:03:45.890> seven<00:03:46.220> different<00:03:46.630> objectives<00:03:47.630> but<00:03:47.810> I

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
with seven different objectives but I

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.690 
with seven different objectives but I
can<00:03:48.320> appreciate<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:48.860> that<00:03:49.010> might<00:03:49.400> have<00:03:49.550> been

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
can appreciate that that might have been

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.240 
can appreciate that that might have been
a<00:03:49.730> bit<00:03:49.880> too<00:03:50.060> tricky<00:03:50.530> now<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.590> start<00:03:51.920> off<00:03:51.980> with

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
a bit too tricky now you start off with

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.540 
a bit too tricky now you start off with
a<00:03:52.280> starting<00:03:53.180> hand<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.570> cards<00:03:54.370> these<00:03:55.370> will

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
a starting hand of cards these will

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.940 
a starting hand of cards these will
normally<00:03:55.850> be<00:03:55.880> in<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.180> pile<00:03:56.510> like<00:03:56.540> so<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:57.320> each

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
normally be in a pile like so and each

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.000 
normally be in a pile like so and each
turn<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:58.700> can<00:03:58.850> play<00:03:59.060> a<00:03:59.090> card<00:03:59.650> if<00:04:00.650> you<00:04:00.770> look<00:04:00.920> at

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
turn you can play a card if you look at

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.030 
turn you can play a card if you look at
the<00:04:01.040> card<00:04:01.340> it's<00:04:01.640> got<00:04:01.880> a<00:04:01.910> flavor<00:04:02.360> text<00:04:02.900> or<00:04:03.050> its

at the top of each card as you can see
here<00:04:09.380> our<00:04:09.560> icons<00:04:10.600> now<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.660> actual<00:04:12.050> icons<00:04:13.000> all
