in<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.950> egg<00:02:51.070> I<00:02:51.370> mean<00:02:51.550> it<00:02:52.270> takes<00:02:52.480> him<00:02:52.630> about<00:02:52.780> 50

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
in the egg I mean it takes him about 50

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.640 
in the egg I mean it takes him about 50
days<00:02:53.650> or<00:02:54.010> 6<00:02:54.340> 50<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.730> 60<00:02:55.030> days<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.510> hatch<00:02:55.690> since

days<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.320> somehow<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.989> humidity<00:03:01.989> and

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
days so somehow the humidity and

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.250 
days so somehow the humidity and
temperature<00:03:02.709> where<00:03:03.280> her<00:03:03.489> egg<00:03:03.700> was<00:03:03.940> managed<00:03:04.510> to

temperature where her egg was managed to

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.370 
temperature where her egg was managed to
be<00:03:05.440> just<00:03:05.800> right<00:03:06.040> for<00:03:06.100> two<00:03:06.550> months<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.380> then
