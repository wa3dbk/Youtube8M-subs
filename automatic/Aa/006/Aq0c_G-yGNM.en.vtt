00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:11.250
 Talk to me, I'm here to make a video. 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:14.190
 quickie on the corolla cv and a 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:24.260
 engine to bring them valve system 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:27.260
 variable is r x there 1.8 136 horses a 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
 gasoline 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:38.910
 I woke to black begins she 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.079
 depending on the angle of view you end up 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:49.320
 confusing rather like the dark green 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:55.680
 but it's very beautiful and I have this 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.750
 car only 22 months ago 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.879
 I did a research and everything to know that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.699
 car to buy sand and I was very 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.700
 between the civic corolla and the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.380
 Megane and I decided for Corolla in 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.850
 some videos that we have to listen to 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.700
 internet decided to do it here too 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.960
 to try to help some who have 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.619
 any doubt that could be 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.460
 resolved with a video of taking the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.400
 doubts here 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.900
 This is the leather bench but it did not have 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.990
 leather bench I took this life 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.650
 with its conservation status of 2006 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.210
 and had no leather seat and I went ee 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.650
 I bought anyway I got a 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.900
 discount I wanted with bank 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.360
 leather and had it put on with 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.790
 I bought it from a collective purchase site in 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.070
 what was the ball show 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.970
 the 840 pay ball show was show 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.600
 ball 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:00.719
 glove holder he has in the case of a 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:03.479
 time it has a damper on the door. 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.939
 so highlight its interior is quite 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.930
 There is no glove door on the door. 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.910
 door 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:15.230
 have here the focus is right here 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.880
 has down here also receives a 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.060
 ashtray is but can save any 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.820
 something else also has this 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.050
 compartment here with four with the 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.310
 dividers 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:32.630
 You can also put in a lot of stuff. 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:40.730
 has this part here can put had 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:46.820
 tube and also the chest still has it here 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.800
 low here only serves to put 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.780
 currency but I know the currency that it 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.320
 hitting the car is so quiet inside 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.260
 his 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.440
 look does not really call much attention 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.510
 the acoustic system is not 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.150
 You're practically nothing much. 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.130
 silent dn damping system 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.710
 you go anywhere you one 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.060
 innocent and does not transmit directly to the 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.930
 team the wheel 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.240
 understood ball show I liked myself and 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.280
 put a coin that made noise in 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.610
 cushion a silent card like that 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.350
 here I really was a little bit here 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:31.700
 the adjustment of the mirrors is not 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:34.070
 the dashboard has no on-board computer and c 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.200
 the x there does not have a trip computer 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.290
 the following it comes with onboard computer 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.270
 and also comes with autopilot and 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:48.739
 plus the fog lights and if here the 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:50.959
 weverton are so but not economical 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.480
 more economical with more than enough items 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.470
 it is becoming a very cost effective 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.650
 best 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.880
 therefore x is the best seller of the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.530
 corolla category one was a misstep 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.320
 my not paying attention too 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.010
 in the matter of sound an original sound 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.750
 only he is not and 3 what I thought 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.790
 he was 3 but he is not even have one 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.750
 normal system here it only connects with the 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.580
 key in the key which also happens to 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.370
 the glasses 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.229
 I'm just an automated but it just adds up with 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.689
 car connected to the switch on 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:34.199
 if it is not connected with the plate it does not 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:37.139
 one touch is only one of the 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:39.150
 driver and only knows with a touch only 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.460
 the driver's 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.759
 the position that I have a meter and 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.129
 Ninety is a good position to drive. 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:51.060
 he has a good vision is tall nor does he have a 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:52.680
 good vision in all angles here I 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.340
 I think it's very good 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.900
 But I think maybe the bank of the 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.159
 driver with height adjustment but I 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.469
 I think he could download a little bit 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:04.370
 more to stay a little lower 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:09.319
 he has these levers here in the 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:12.319
 portamala and right fuel tank 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:20.159
 he water inside it 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:28.610
 he opened here knows that the trunk is 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:28.610
 pretty fun on the good very good and 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:35.300
 very good too 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.300
 up to the back 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.419
 I found that here too very high I 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.310
 I think it could have been lower but 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:52.069
 the car model is not seen for example 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.069
 He does not have this tunnel, right? 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:06:00.120
 I found it a bit high but lower 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.250
 little automatic is the first vehicle 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.129
 automatic not 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.050
 I also know that consumption and 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:10.620
 power is slightly decreased 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.990
 on this issue but I did not bother 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.930
 The commander thinks it's very good and that's it. 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.270
 I still have to adapt to the issue of 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.909
 automatic gearbox feels good for good 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:29.250
 in when the left foot on something 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:32.039
 here but it's ok, ok 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:35.480
 This is it, people, I hope. 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:37.730
 You liked it there and if you 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:43.660
 Until you have any doubt have your 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:49.810
 dock a hug corolla 2006 1.8 x there 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.810
 Toyota's gasoline has been
