doubles a lot of guys to practice them

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.800 
doubles a lot of guys to practice them
you<00:01:47.700> know<00:01:47.820> they'll<00:01:47.970> already<00:01:48.120> say<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.660> you

though<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.870> of<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:55.020> best<00:01:55.229> things<00:01:55.410> I've

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
though but one of the best things I've

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.580 
though but one of the best things I've
ever<00:01:55.560> seen<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.030> do<00:01:57.210> or<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.960> did<00:01:58.260> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
ever seen that I do or that I did and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.670 
ever seen that I do or that I did and
still<00:01:59.040> should<00:01:59.310> do<00:01:59.600> are<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.960> doubles<00:02:01.440> where

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
still should do are the doubles where

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.850 
still should do are the doubles where
you<00:02:01.770> accent<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.190> second<00:02:02.610> note<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.910> instead<00:02:03.150> of

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
you accent the second note so instead of

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.850 
you accent the second note so instead of
instead<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.610> E<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.330> two<00:02:06.360> E<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.860> think

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
instead of one E and a two E and think

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.620 
instead of one E and a two E and think
of<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.130> just<00:02:08.490> mentally<00:02:09.470> count<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:10.800> one<00:02:11.630> and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
of it just mentally count it as one and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.570 
of it just mentally count it as one and
two<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.330> accent<00:02:15.870> like<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.230> 1e<00:02:16.560> 1e<00:02:17.280> n

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
two and so the accent like the 1e 1e n

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.270 
two and so the accent like the 1e 1e n
to<00:02:18.120> nth<00:02:18.480> will<00:02:18.750> be<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.959> second<00:02:19.410> stroke<00:02:19.770> instead

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
to nth will be the second stroke instead

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.370 
to nth will be the second stroke instead
of<00:02:20.430> one<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:22.110> two<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.050> what<00:02:25.290> you

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
of one and two and is that what you

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.780 
of one and two and is that what you
really<00:02:25.530> want<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.800> do<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.250> second

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
really want to do is get the second

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.370 
really want to do is get the second
stroke<00:02:27.090> up<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.510> speed<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:27.780> instead<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.170> going

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
stroke up to speed so instead of going

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:40.729 
stroke up to speed so instead of going
one<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.850> think<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.560> way<00:02:39.739> let's

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
one and think of it this this way let's

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.210 
one and think of it this this way let's
have<00:02:40.860> like<00:02:41.070> da<00:02:41.459> Dada<00:02:41.880> da<00:02:42.270> Dada<00:02:42.690> da<00:02:43.080> da<00:02:43.470> da<00:02:43.920> that

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
have like da Dada da Dada da da da that

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.390 
have like da Dada da Dada da da da that
you<00:02:44.340> want<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.519> think<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:45.200> duh<00:02:46.200> duh<00:02:46.620> duh<00:02:47.010> duh

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
you want to think like duh duh duh duh

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.650 
you want to think like duh duh duh duh
duh<00:02:47.820> duh<00:02:48.239> duh<00:02:48.630> duh<00:02:49.049> you<00:02:49.709> know<00:02:49.769> what<00:02:49.860> I'm<00:02:49.920> saying

duh duh duh duh you know what I'm saying
so<00:02:51.660> your<00:02:51.840> second<00:02:52.410> stroke<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:53.180> at<00:02:54.180> least

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.200 

your<00:03:01.960> hands<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.820> well<00:03:03.820> you<00:03:03.910> don't<00:03:04.060> want

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
your hands and well you don't want

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.330 
your hands and well you don't want
always<00:03:04.360> want<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.630> second<00:03:04.960> one<00:03:04.990> water<00:03:05.340> you

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
always want the second one water you

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.520 
always want the second one water you
want<00:03:06.490> to<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:07.120> will<00:03:07.270> force<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.050> come<00:03:08.230> up<00:03:08.260> to

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
want to it will force it to come up to

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:28.260 
want to it will force it to come up to
the<00:03:08.620> same<00:03:08.800> dynamic<00:03:09.610> it's<00:03:09.790> like<00:03:26.010> just<00:03:27.270> for

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
the same dynamic it's like just for

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.880 
the same dynamic it's like just for
practice<00:03:29.550> again<00:03:30.550> like<00:03:30.730> I<00:03:30.820> said<00:03:30.880> just<00:03:31.030> said<00:03:31.890> go

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
practice again like I said just said go

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.180 
practice again like I said just said go
like<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.080> accidents<00:03:35.530> will<00:03:35.709> really<00:03:36.040> be<00:03:36.160> on

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
like so the accidents will really be on

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.430 
like so the accidents will really be on
the<00:03:36.489> second<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.540> know<00:03:37.660> they'll<00:03:37.840> say<00:03:38.020> like<00:03:38.200> one

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
the second you know they'll say like one

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.440 
the second you know they'll say like one
E<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:39.280> e<00:03:39.310> in<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.760> of<00:03:39.970> will<00:03:40.209> have<00:03:40.330> the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
E and the e in the of will have the

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.390 
E and the e in the of will have the
accent<00:03:40.900> over<00:03:41.140> but<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.650> sometimes<00:03:41.920> it's<00:03:42.100> easier

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
accent over but it sometimes it's easier

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.970 
accent over but it sometimes it's easier
to<00:03:42.489> think<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.790> can<00:03:42.940> slide<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.600> whole<00:03:43.780> thing

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
to think you can slide the whole thing

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.210 
to think you can slide the whole thing
to<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.100> lap<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:45.520> you<00:03:45.610> look<00:03:45.910> at<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.150> accents

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
to the lap so you look at the accents

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.640 
to the lap so you look at the accents
over<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.520> one<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.300> an<00:03:49.510> except<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.560> your

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
over the one and the an except that your

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.710 
over the one and the an except that your
shift<00:03:50.860> in<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.070> back<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.459> instead<00:03:51.760> of<00:03:51.820> going

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.330 

sometimes<00:03:55.720> just<00:03:56.110> mentally<00:03:56.709> for<00:03:56.950> your<00:03:57.070> brain

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
sometimes just mentally for your brain

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.150 
sometimes just mentally for your brain
and<00:03:57.550> hands<00:03:57.730> it's<00:03:57.910> easier<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.330> go<00:03:58.950> like<00:03:59.950> you'll

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
and hands it's easier to go like you'll

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.229 
and hands it's easier to go like you'll
so<00:04:00.790> start<00:04:01.030> with<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.180> pickup<00:04:01.510> note<00:04:01.750> like<00:04:02.350> so

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
so start with the pickup note like so

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:14.100 
so start with the pickup note like so
one<00:04:04.680> two<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:06.340> three<00:04:12.720> instead<00:04:13.720> of<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:13.959> the

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
one two and three instead of to the

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.060 
one two and three instead of to the
doctor<00:04:14.590> doctor<00:04:15.370> doctor<00:04:15.760> it's<00:04:16.350> doctor<00:04:17.350> doctor

and<00:04:18.220> it'll<00:04:18.430> help<00:04:18.580> you<00:04:18.760> so<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:19.570> start<00:04:19.870> really

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
and it'll help you so to start really

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:47.460 
and it'll help you so to start really
open<00:04:20.560> really<00:04:20.830> just<00:04:21.070> with<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.310> wrists<00:04:21.790> just

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.980 

defeats<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.650> purpose<00:04:48.830> because<00:04:49.220> once<00:04:49.460> you

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
defeats the purpose because once you

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.060 
defeats the purpose because once you
spend<00:04:50.990> a<00:04:51.050> lot<00:04:51.140> of<00:04:51.200> time<00:04:51.470> doing<00:04:51.650> that<00:04:51.860> but<00:04:51.980> he

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
spend a lot of time doing that but he

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.320 
spend a lot of time doing that but he
had<00:04:52.190> a<00:04:52.220> role<00:04:52.430> where<00:04:52.670> every<00:04:52.820> other<00:04:52.940> one<00:04:53.150> was

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
had a role where every other one was

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.690 
had a role where every other one was
louder<00:04:53.600> I<00:04:53.990> think<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:54.800> just<00:04:54.980> had<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.280> opposite

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
louder I think you just had the opposite

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:03.190 
louder I think you just had the opposite
effect<00:04:55.850> of<00:04:56.180> playing<00:04:56.750> it<00:05:01.780> just<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.990> get<00:05:03.110> your

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
effect of playing it just to get your

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:14.620 
effect of playing it just to get your
hands<00:05:03.380> used<00:05:03.620> to<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.920> the<00:05:04.430> same<00:05:12.460> anyway<00:05:13.460> so<00:05:13.630> so

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
hands used to the the same anyway so so

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.850 
hands used to the the same anyway so so
to<00:05:14.690> do<00:05:15.020> them<00:05:15.200> what<00:05:15.350> they<00:05:15.470> call<00:05:15.740> it<00:05:17.860> open

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
to do them what they call it open

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.040 
to do them what they call it open
meaning<00:05:19.460> where<00:05:19.730> you<00:05:19.820> really<00:05:20.090> rely<00:05:20.390> and<00:05:20.660> like

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
meaning where you really rely and like

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.750 
meaning where you really rely and like
you<00:05:21.440> know<00:05:21.560> you're<00:05:21.680> not<00:05:21.770> like<00:05:22.010> close<00:05:22.280> does<00:05:22.580> when

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
you know you're not like close does when

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:31.000 
you know you're not like close does when
they<00:05:22.850> say<00:05:23.030> clothes<00:05:23.240> I<00:05:23.420> mean<00:05:29.440> as<00:05:30.440> opposed<00:05:30.800> to

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
they say clothes I mean as opposed to

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:38.050 
they say clothes I mean as opposed to
open<00:05:31.970> which<00:05:32.150> is<00:05:32.300> like<00:05:36.310> first<00:05:37.310> really<00:05:37.730> open<00:05:37.970> you

and two it will come in really handy for

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:03.520 
and two it will come in really handy for
you<00:05:54.650> open<00:05:54.890> for<00:05:55.040> your<00:05:55.160> wrists<00:06:02.169> so<00:06:03.169> what<00:06:03.320> kind

you you that's just really to kind of
let<00:06:05.630> your<00:06:05.810> neural<00:06:06.770> network<00:06:07.130> whatever<00:06:07.340> know

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
let your neural network whatever know

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.700 
let your neural network whatever know
that<00:06:07.880> ii<00:06:08.450> know<00:06:08.540> should<00:06:08.780> be<00:06:08.900> at<00:06:09.169> least<00:06:09.200> as<00:06:09.530> loud

that ii know should be at least as loud

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
though slot is the first so what happens

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.250 
though slot is the first so what happens
is<00:06:13.250> sort<00:06:13.700> of<00:06:13.760> very<00:06:13.820> open<00:06:14.390> drawing<00:06:14.810> pretty<00:06:15.020> much

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
is sort of very open drawing pretty much

00:06:15.260 --> 00:07:03.760 
is sort of very open drawing pretty much
while<00:06:15.560> i<00:06:15.590> use<00:06:15.680> my<00:06:16.070> hands<00:06:16.340> like

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.460 

pulling<00:07:04.770> your<00:07:04.919> hand<00:07:05.130> up<00:07:05.310> Chris<00:07:06.050> which<00:07:07.050> by<00:07:07.409> the

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 
way I can't do it anyway but in mine

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.740 
way I can't do it anyway but in mine
you're<00:07:13.680> bypassing<00:07:14.130> any<00:07:14.370> middle<00:07:14.789> stroke<00:07:15.060> so

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
you're bypassing any middle stroke so

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:31.070 
you're bypassing any middle stroke so
it's<00:07:15.930> I<00:07:16.580> should<00:07:17.580> say<00:07:17.729> this<00:07:18.030> way<00:07:18.270> not<00:07:18.539> mine<00:07:30.080> you

it's I should say this way not mine you

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.650 
it's I should say this way not mine you
really<00:07:31.319> should<00:07:31.530> more<00:07:32.099> rely<00:07:32.430> on<00:07:33.440> the<00:07:34.440> box
