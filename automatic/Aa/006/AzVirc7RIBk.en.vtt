concept of clan fit i would say that the

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.059 
concept of clan fit i would say that the
idea<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:36.179> clan<00:01:36.630> hopping<00:01:37.080> or<00:01:37.229> hopping<00:01:37.920> from

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
clan to clan has really gotten a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.130 
clan to clan has really gotten a
negative<00:01:41.369> reputation<00:01:41.729> over<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> years<00:01:42.660> and

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
negative reputation over the years and

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.130 
negative reputation over the years and
clash<00:01:43.440> but<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.490> think<00:01:44.819> about<00:01:44.940> it<00:01:45.149> how<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
clash but if you think about it how is a

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.290 
clash but if you think about it how is a
person<00:01:46.440> supposed<00:01:46.679> to<00:01:47.069> know<00:01:47.369> what<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
person supposed to know what the

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.389 
person supposed to know what the
community<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.080> clan<00:01:49.319> is<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.709> overall<00:01:50.190> and

by community I just basically mean

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.020 
by community I just basically mean
whether<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> clan<00:01:53.009> members<00:01:53.369> are<00:01:53.520> nice<00:01:53.729> you

number of total war winds so as a result

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.120 
number of total war winds so as a result
you<00:02:03.270> definitely<00:02:03.840> have<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.140> try<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.619> bunch<00:02:04.920> of

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
you definitely have to try a bunch of

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.249 
you definitely have to try a bunch of
different<00:02:05.190> clans<00:02:05.819> out<00:02:06.060> get<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.929> know<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
different clans out get to know the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.080 
different clans out get to know the
members<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.920> at<00:02:08.069> least<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.490> couple<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.880> days

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.809 
members for at least a couple of days
and<00:02:09.420> then<00:02:10.140> decide<00:02:10.560> whether<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.099> clan<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
and then decide whether that clan is the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.910 
and then decide whether that clan is the
right<00:02:12.030> fit<00:02:12.270> for<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.660> now<00:02:13.260> in<00:02:13.380> terms<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.740> me

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
right fit for you now in terms of me

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.830 
right fit for you now in terms of me
personally<00:02:14.520> i<00:02:14.550> would<00:02:14.880> say<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.209> there<00:02:15.360> are<00:02:15.569> a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
personally i would say that there are a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.140 
personally i would say that there are a
number<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.560> factors<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.640> use<00:02:17.910> in

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
number of factors that you can use in

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.570 
number of factors that you can use in
order<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.750> determine<00:02:19.170> fit<00:02:19.560> for<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:20.459> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
order to determine fit for you so the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.130 
order to determine fit for you so the
first<00:02:20.790> thing<00:02:20.880> obviously<00:02:21.150> being<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.780> rules

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
first thing obviously being the rules

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.470 
first thing obviously being the rules
sometimes<00:02:22.920> not<00:02:23.160> all<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.580> rules<00:02:23.819> can<00:02:24.090> fit<00:02:24.330> in

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
sometimes not all the rules can fit in

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.510 
sometimes not all the rules can fit in
the<00:02:24.630> clan<00:02:24.870> description<00:02:25.380> box<00:02:25.590> make<00:02:26.160> sure<00:02:26.190> there

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
the clan description box make sure there

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.790 
the clan description box make sure there

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
is a place that outlines the clan rules

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.440 
is a place that outlines the clan rules
and<00:02:29.069> then<00:02:29.489> take<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.819> time<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.120> learn<00:02:30.270> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
and then take the time to learn the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.030 
and then take the time to learn the
rules<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:31.200> if<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.500> something<00:02:31.770> that

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
rules and see if this is something that

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.280 
rules and see if this is something that
you<00:02:32.250> as<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.580> player<00:02:32.880> can<00:02:33.510> manage<00:02:33.870> whether<00:02:34.080> this

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
you as a player can manage whether this

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.980 
you as a player can manage whether this
is<00:02:34.500> like<00:02:34.680> donation<00:02:35.220> minimums<00:02:35.670> or<00:02:35.880> visit<00:02:36.780> days

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
because sometimes you have to rely on

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.430 
because sometimes you have to rely on
Talon<00:03:23.730> all<00:03:23.970> Snipes<00:03:24.269> so<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.870> have<00:03:25.170> to

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
Talon all Snipes so you have to

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.880 
Talon all Snipes so you have to
basically<00:03:26.069> use<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.760> lot<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.090> gold<00:03:27.420> or<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:28.620> have

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
basically use a lot of gold or you have

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.670 
basically use a lot of gold or you have
to<00:03:29.190> rely<00:03:29.790> on<00:03:29.819> training<00:03:30.540> up<00:03:30.750> really<00:03:31.230> expensive

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
to rely on training up really expensive

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.740
