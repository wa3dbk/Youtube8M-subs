00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
into the back of the turbine and just

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.039 
into the back of the turbine and just
rotate<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.760> until<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.149> feel<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.420> grip<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
rotate it until you feel it grip in the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.920 
rotate it until you feel it grip in the
slums<00:01:04.939> so<00:01:05.939> now<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.270> our<00:01:06.390> tool<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
slums so now we have our tool in the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.980 
slums so now we have our tool in the
back<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> turbine<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.340> slots<00:01:08.990> next

back of the turbine in the slots next

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.780 
back of the turbine in the slots next
thing<00:01:10.110> we're<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.770> hold<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
thing we're going to do is just hold the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.480 
thing we're going to do is just hold the
red<00:01:12.060> anodized<00:01:12.990> rotor<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.830> back<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
red anodized rotor on the back of the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.359 
red anodized rotor on the back of the
turbine<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.479> our<00:01:15.689> fingers<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.350> we're<00:01:17.130> going

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
turbine with our fingers and we're going

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.460 
turbine with our fingers and we're going
to<00:01:17.400> turn<00:01:17.729> our<00:01:17.790> wrench<00:01:18.210> clockwise<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.320> it's

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
to turn our wrench clockwise so it's

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.039 
to turn our wrench clockwise so it's
left-hand<00:01:20.009> threads<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.820> normally<00:01:21.360> tightening

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
left-hand threads so normally tightening

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.440 
left-hand threads so normally tightening
but<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.939> loosen<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.119> we're

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
but this is going to loosen it so we're

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.340 
but this is going to loosen it so we're
turning<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.229> nut<00:01:25.409> clockwise<00:01:26.780> until<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:28.140> feel

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
turning the nut clockwise until we feel

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.560 
turning the nut clockwise until we feel
it<00:01:28.500> release<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.850> handpiece<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.479> I'm

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
it release out of the handpiece so I'm

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.060 
it release out of the handpiece so I'm
going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.869> give<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.200> few<00:01:31.229> extra<00:01:31.829> turns

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
going to just give it a few extra turns

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.760 
going to just give it a few extra turns
here<00:01:32.689> you'll<00:01:33.689> feel<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.049> kind<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.320> click<00:01:34.560> when

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
here you'll feel it kind of click when

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.090 
here you'll feel it kind of click when
it's<00:01:34.920> out<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.250> won't<00:01:35.340> come<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.729> yet<00:01:36.290> but<00:01:37.290> just

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
it's out it won't come out yet but just

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.859 
it's out it won't come out yet but just
tighten<00:01:38.490> or<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:39.030> all<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> way<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> right

until<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.619> feel<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.070> until<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.790> feels<00:01:41.970> like

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
until you feel it until it feels like

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.420 
until you feel it until it feels like
it's<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.420> loose<00:01:42.720> we're<00:01:43.680> gonna<00:01:43.770> then<00:01:44.070> turn

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
it's really loose we're gonna then turn

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.880 
it's really loose we're gonna then turn
the<00:01:44.700> turbine<00:01:45.030> around<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.689> use<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.619> other<00:01:46.770> end

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.730 
pushes the collet and the nut out of the
turbine<00:01:59.540> so<00:02:00.540> now<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.930> our<00:02:01.079> turbine<00:02:01.530> and

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
turbine so now we have our turbine and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.490 
turbine so now we have our turbine and
we<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.100> pushed<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.549> call<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.909> out<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.500> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
we just pushed the call it out and the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.319 
we just pushed the call it out and the
little<00:02:04.740> keeper<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> back<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.240> we

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
little keeper here on the back that we

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.229 
little keeper here on the back that we
just<00:02:06.509> thread<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.740> also<00:02:08.099> there<00:02:08.310> okay

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
just thread it out is also there okay

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.240 
just thread it out is also there okay
once<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.599> our<00:02:09.810> call<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.110> out<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
once we have our call it out of the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.780 
once we have our call it out of the
turbine

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
turbine

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.130 
turbine
it's

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
it's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.340 
it's
put<00:02:12.710> in<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.069> new<00:02:13.220> collar<00:02:13.550> so<00:02:14.420> on<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:15.110> end<00:02:15.230> of

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
put in the new collar so on the end of

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.350 
put in the new collar so on the end of
the<00:02:15.440> collet<00:02:15.830> there's<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.100> short<00:02:16.580> cylinder<00:02:17.120> end

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
the collet there's a short cylinder end

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.140 
the collet there's a short cylinder end
and<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.810> longer<00:02:18.110> cylinder<00:02:18.830> end<00:02:19.069> it's<00:02:19.940> very

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
and a longer cylinder end it's very

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.970 
and a longer cylinder end it's very
important<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:21.050> insert<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.680> short

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
important that you insert the short

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.260 
important that you insert the short
cylinder<00:02:22.670> end<00:02:22.880> into<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.750> turbine<00:02:24.610> first<00:02:25.610> so

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
cylinder end into the turbine first so

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.580 
cylinder end into the turbine first so
we're<00:02:26.390> going<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.569> take<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.840> short<00:02:27.110> cylinder

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
we're going to take the short cylinder

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.280 
we're going to take the short cylinder
end<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:28.190> our<00:02:28.340> collet<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.000> put<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:29.720> into<00:02:30.200> the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
end of our collet and put it into the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.370 
end of our collet and put it into the
back<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.740> turbine<00:02:31.450> we're<00:02:32.450> gonna<00:02:32.540> then<00:02:33.020> use

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
back of the turbine we're gonna then use

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.140 
back of the turbine we're gonna then use
our<00:02:33.650> collet<00:02:34.040> tool<00:02:34.220> here<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.760> we're<00:02:34.970> going<00:02:35.120> to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
our collet tool here and we're going to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.240 
our collet tool here and we're going to
push<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.840> back<00:02:36.050> of<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.350> up<00:02:36.560> into<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.890> turbine

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
push the back of it up into the turbine

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.810 
push the back of it up into the turbine
until<00:02:37.970> we<00:02:38.090> hear<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:38.390> click<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:40.250> just<00:02:40.489> clicked

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
until we hear it click it just clicked

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.449 
until we hear it click it just clicked
does<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.239> went<00:02:41.420> in<00:02:41.540> all<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.870> way<00:02:42.400> we're<00:02:43.400> gonna

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
does it went in all the way we're gonna

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.300 
does it went in all the way we're gonna
then<00:02:43.730> take<00:02:43.760> our<00:02:44.180> keeper<00:02:44.830> here<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.010> put<00:02:46.160> it

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
then take our keeper here and put it

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.190 
then take our keeper here and put it
back<00:02:46.459> in<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.850> end<00:02:47.000> it's<00:02:47.239> got<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.450> tapered<00:02:48.080> end

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
back in the end it's got a tapered end

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.620 
back in the end it's got a tapered end
on<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.800> slotted<00:02:49.310> end<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:50.090> tapered

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
on it and the slotted end the tapered

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.449 
on it and the slotted end the tapered
end<00:02:50.810> goes<00:02:51.019> into<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.620> back<00:02:51.800> of<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.100> turbine

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
end goes into the back of the turbine

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.060 
end goes into the back of the turbine
first<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.810> we're<00:02:53.959> going<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.200> insert<00:02:54.709> that<00:02:55.010> into

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
first so we're going to insert that into

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.610 
first so we're going to insert that into
the<00:02:55.760> turbine<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.300> then<00:02:57.170> we're<00:02:57.290> going<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.470> use

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
the turbine and then we're going to use

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.460 
the turbine and then we're going to use
the<00:02:57.800> slotted<00:02:58.220> end<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:59.209> our<00:02:59.360> collet<00:02:59.720> tool<00:02:59.930> to

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
the slotted end of our collet tool to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.229 
the slotted end of our collet tool to
thread<00:03:00.769> that<00:03:00.950> in<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.550> you'll<00:03:01.670> want<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:01.910> push<00:03:02.090> it

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
thread that in so you'll want to push it

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.640 
thread that in so you'll want to push it
in<00:03:02.330> just<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.630> little<00:03:02.660> ways<00:03:03.019> till<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.320> hits<00:03:03.440> the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
in just a little ways till it hits the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.710 
in just a little ways till it hits the
back<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:03.980> collet<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.459> then<00:03:05.420> these<00:03:05.660> are

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
back of the collet and then these are

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.660 
back of the collet and then these are
left-hand<00:03:06.350> threads<00:03:06.709> remember<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:07.519> we're

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
left-hand threads remember so we're

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.900 
left-hand threads remember so we're
going<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:07.880> tighten<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:09.140> nut

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
going to tighten this nut

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.509 
going to tighten this nut
counterclockwise<00:03:10.910> until<00:03:11.950> it's<00:03:12.950> all<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.220> way

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
counterclockwise until it's all the way

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.270 
counterclockwise until it's all the way
in<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:15.170> we're<00:03:15.320> going<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.500> give<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.830> few<00:03:16.010> turns

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
in so we're going to give it a few turns

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.300 
in so we're going to give it a few turns
here<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:19.480> it'll<00:03:20.480> go<00:03:20.600> down<00:03:20.780> in<00:03:21.019> there<00:03:21.260> quite<00:03:22.250> a

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
here and it'll go down in there quite a

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.560 
here and it'll go down in there quite a
ways<00:03:22.579> and<00:03:23.470> it'll<00:03:24.470> actually<00:03:24.880> stop<00:03:25.880> when<00:03:26.420> it's

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
ways and it'll actually stop when it's

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.220 
ways and it'll actually stop when it's
in<00:03:26.780> all<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:26.959> way

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
in all the way

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.220 
in all the way
so<00:03:27.980> just<00:03:28.280> stopped<00:03:28.579> on<00:03:28.850> me<00:03:29.030> let's<00:03:29.900> see<00:03:30.079> if<00:03:30.140> we

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
so just stopped on me let's see if we

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.400 
so just stopped on me let's see if we
can<00:03:30.350> get<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.500> really<00:03:30.709> close-up<00:03:31.190> view<00:03:31.820> here<00:03:32.410> of

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
can get a really close-up view here of

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.020 
can get a really close-up view here of
how<00:03:33.590> far<00:03:33.860> it's<00:03:34.040> down<00:03:34.250> in<00:03:34.489> there<00:03:34.670> I'm<00:03:34.790> guessing

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
how far it's down in there I'm guessing

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.090 
how far it's down in there I'm guessing
it's<00:03:35.360> down<00:03:35.540> in<00:03:35.780> there<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:35.989> good<00:03:36.320> eighth<00:03:36.560> of<00:03:36.980> an

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
it's down in there a good eighth of an

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.620 
it's down in there a good eighth of an
inch<00:03:37.250> down<00:03:37.640> in<00:03:37.880> there<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.209> it'll<00:03:38.450> actually

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
inch down in there and it'll actually

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.289 
inch down in there and it'll actually
stop<00:03:39.320> when<00:03:39.590> it's<00:03:39.739> in<00:03:39.890> all<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.070> way<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:41.090> just

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
stop when it's in all the way so just

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.660 
stop when it's in all the way so just
thread<00:03:41.600> that<00:03:41.810> nut<00:03:42.079> into<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.410> back<00:03:42.650> as<00:03:43.280> far<00:03:43.549> as

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
thread that nut into the back as far as

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.150 
thread that nut into the back as far as
you<00:03:43.790> can<00:03:43.910> get<00:03:44.090> it<00:03:44.239> counterclockwise<00:03:45.079> until<00:03:45.860> it

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
you can get it counterclockwise until it
