think<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.310> creates<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.820> deadly<00:00:30.240> chain<00:00:30.539> reaction

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
think it creates a deadly chain reaction

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.470 
think it creates a deadly chain reaction
where<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.009> end<00:00:32.219> up<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.579> people<00:00:32.610> reclining

someone ends up with a seat in their

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.690 
someone ends up with a seat in their

that<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.180> explain<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.610> like<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.270> got

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that I can explain it is like if you got

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.400 
that I can explain it is like if you got
robbed<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:50.309> said<00:00:50.579> okay<00:00:51.390> well<00:00:51.989> I've<00:00:52.170> been

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
robbed and you said okay well I've been

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.709 
robbed and you said okay well I've been
wronged<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.940> I'm<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.210> gonna<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.539> ahead<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
wronged so I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.770 
wronged so I'm just gonna go ahead and
rob<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.140> next<00:00:55.410> person<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.890> make<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.219> fair<00:00:56.780> it's

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
rob the next person to make it fair it's

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.990 
rob the next person to make it fair it's
crazy<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.590> an<00:00:58.739> entitlement<00:00:59.250> attitude

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
crazy it's like an entitlement attitude

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.479 
crazy it's like an entitlement attitude
and<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.660> distracts<00:01:01.199> from<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> bigger<00:01:01.859> problem

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and it distracts from the bigger problem

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.369 
and it distracts from the bigger problem
which<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.270> why<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:03.960> letting<00:01:04.110> these

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
which is why are we letting these

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.740 
which is why are we letting these
airlines<00:01:04.920> screw<00:01:05.549> us<00:01:05.729> cramming<00:01:06.299> us<00:01:06.420> into<00:01:06.659> these

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
airlines screw us cramming us into these

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.350 
airlines screw us cramming us into these
airplanes<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.470> sardines<00:01:08.040> how<00:01:08.939> about<00:01:09.119> some

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
airplanes like sardines how about some

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.929 
airplanes like sardines how about some
space<00:01:09.710> space<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.920> airlines<00:01:11.310> has<00:01:11.520> steadily

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
space space on airlines has steadily

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.240 
space space on airlines has steadily
declined<00:01:12.900> over<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> last<00:01:13.470> 20<00:01:13.770> years<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.159> I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
declined over the last 20 years and I

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.219 
declined over the last 20 years and I
imagine<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.939> only<00:01:15.090> gonna<00:01:15.330> get<00:01:15.540> even<00:01:15.869> smaller

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
imagine it's only gonna get even smaller

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.780 
imagine it's only gonna get even smaller
but<00:01:16.860> that's<00:01:17.009> not<00:01:17.100> even<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> story's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
but that's not even what the story's

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.850 
but that's not even what the story's
about<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.180> about<00:01:18.299> tall<00:01:18.720> people<00:01:18.990> don't<00:01:19.680> feel

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
about it's about tall people don't feel

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
about it's about tall people don't feel
bad<00:01:20.100> about<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.850> because<00:01:21.090> tall<00:01:21.509> people<00:01:21.750> are

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
bad about that because tall people are

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.660 
bad about that because tall people are
making<00:01:22.380> more<00:01:22.590> money<00:01:22.799> than<00:01:22.979> everyone<00:01:23.430> else

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
making more money than everyone else

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.670 
making more money than everyone else
that<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.450> something<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.229> known<00:01:25.439> in

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that is something that we have known in

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.160 
that is something that we have known in
America<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> long<00:01:26.909> time<00:01:27.270> there's<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.869> lot<00:01:27.900> of

America for a long time there's a lot of
research<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> back<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> new<00:01:29.549> study

gap<00:02:59.040> also<00:02:59.370> exists<00:03:00.150> in<00:03:00.269> women<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.709> has<00:03:01.829> an

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
gap also exists in women but it has an

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.920 
gap also exists in women but it has an
interesting<00:03:02.220> caveat<00:03:02.609> once<00:03:03.120> women<00:03:03.389> get<00:03:03.659> to<00:03:03.810> be

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
interesting caveat once women get to be

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.289 
interesting caveat once women get to be
over<00:03:04.260> 6<00:03:04.560> feet<00:03:04.799> tall<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.400> becomes<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.090> problem

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
over 6 feet tall it becomes a problem

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.039 
over 6 feet tall it becomes a problem
for<00:03:06.510> them

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
for them

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.860 
for them
so<00:03:07.379> women<00:03:08.310> who<00:03:08.609> are<00:03:08.700> above<00:03:09.090> average<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.659> height

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
so women who are above average in height

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.949 
so women who are above average in height
but<00:03:10.200> not<00:03:10.489> freakishly<00:03:11.489> tall<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.120> pretty

casually<00:03:13.319> tall<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.620> not<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.950> right<00:03:14.099> way<00:03:14.280> to

casually tall is not the right way to

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.390 
casually tall is not the right way to
describe<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.480> but<00:03:16.049> who<00:03:16.290> aren't<00:03:16.709> 6<00:03:17.040> feet<00:03:17.220> or

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
describe it but who aren't 6 feet or

describe it but who aren't 6 feet or
above<00:03:17.699> aren't<00:03:18.449> going<00:03:18.629> to<00:03:18.720> be<00:03:18.810> doing<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.139> best

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
above aren't going to be doing the best

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.610 
above aren't going to be doing the best
so<00:03:19.889> next<00:03:20.639> time<00:03:20.849> a<00:03:20.910> tall<00:03:21.329> person<00:03:21.569> crams<00:03:22.199> you<00:03:22.470> in

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
so next time a tall person crams you in

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.710 
so next time a tall person crams you in
on<00:03:22.769> your<00:03:22.949> airline<00:03:23.370> don't<00:03:24.120> feel<00:03:24.299> bad<00:03:24.510> about
