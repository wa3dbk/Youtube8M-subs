put the star to like star coming off of

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.589 
put the star to like star coming off of
it<00:02:08.310> or<00:02:09.289> you<00:02:10.289> could<00:02:10.440> do<00:02:10.760> like<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.819> tree<00:02:12.420> or

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
it or you could do like a tree or

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.400 
it or you could do like a tree or
something<00:02:12.629> inside<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.290> it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
something inside of it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.510 
something inside of it
and<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.680> have<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.010> kind<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.340> an

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.110 
and just have it be kind of like an
oval-shaped<00:02:15.300> cookie<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.460> one<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.820> open

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
oval-shaped cookie so this one is open

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.960 
oval-shaped cookie so this one is open
for<00:02:18.300> imagination<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.710> then<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.400> one<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.670> had

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
for imagination and then this one I had

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.070 
for imagination and then this one I had
a<00:02:21.000> hard<00:02:21.210> time<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.420> was<00:02:21.570> like<00:02:21.660> what<00:02:21.810> am<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.960> going

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
a hard time I was like what am I going

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.130 
a hard time I was like what am I going
to<00:02:22.140> do<00:02:22.290> with<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> bouncing<00:02:23.430> bunny

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
to do with this this is a bouncing bunny

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.110 
to do with this this is a bouncing bunny
and<00:02:25.140> then<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.590> came<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.830> me<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.760> Santa's

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
and then it came to me this is Santa's

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.930 
and then it came to me this is Santa's
sleigh<00:02:27.410> it's<00:02:28.410> obvious<00:02:28.920> right<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.760> just

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
sleigh it's obvious right like you just

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.780 
sleigh it's obvious right like you just
make<00:02:30.090> his<00:02:30.270> sleigh<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:31.380> red<00:02:31.740> maybe<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:32.610> have

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
make his sleigh in red maybe you have

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.480 
make his sleigh in red maybe you have
some<00:02:33.030> toys<00:02:33.270> right<00:02:33.960> here<00:02:34.380> this<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:34.980> obviously

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
some toys right here this is obviously

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.380 
some toys right here this is obviously
his<00:02:35.700> windshield<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:38.610> then<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.270> his

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
his windshield and then this is his

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.110 
his windshield and then this is his
landing<00:02:39.750> gear<00:02:39.960> like<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.530> little<00:02:41.030> bottom<00:02:42.030> of

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
landing gear like the little bottom of

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.660 
landing gear like the little bottom of
this<00:02:42.210> leg<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:43.560> obvious<00:02:43.920> right<00:02:44.010> it's<00:02:44.490> not<00:02:44.640> a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
this leg it's obvious right it's not a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.140 
this leg it's obvious right it's not a
bunny

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
bunny

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
bunny
it's<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.510> sleigh<00:02:45.780> with<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.050> windshield<00:02:48.170> anyway

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
it's a sleigh with the windshield anyway

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.410 
it's a sleigh with the windshield anyway
the<00:02:49.680> whole<00:02:49.830> idea<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.760> take<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.970> look<00:02:51.210> at<00:02:51.300> what

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
the whole idea is to take a look at what

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.450 
the whole idea is to take a look at what
you<00:02:51.570> already<00:02:51.780> have<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.530> figure<00:02:52.830> out<00:02:52.890> if<00:02:53.010> you

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
you already have and figure out if you

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.340 
you already have and figure out if you
can<00:02:53.490> reuse<00:02:54.210> it<00:02:54.390> just<00:02:54.720> because<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.050> cookie

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
can reuse it just because a cookie

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.540 
can reuse it just because a cookie
cutter<00:02:55.530> looks<00:02:55.890> like<00:02:56.010> it's<00:02:56.160> going<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.430> be<00:02:56.520> a

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
cutter looks like it's going to be a

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.520 
cutter looks like it's going to be a
bunny<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.060> can<00:02:57.180> easily<00:02:57.390> be<00:02:57.570> transforming<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.500> a

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
bunny it can easily be transforming to a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.020 
bunny it can easily be transforming to a
reindeer<00:02:58.980> or<00:02:59.010> Santa's<00:02:59.610> sleigh

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
reindeer or Santa's sleigh

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.600 
reindeer or Santa's sleigh
