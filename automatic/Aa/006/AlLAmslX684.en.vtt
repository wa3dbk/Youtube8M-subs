something again now this is a little bit

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.189 
something again now this is a little bit
here<00:00:57.329> where<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.480> got<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.690> basically<00:00:58.079> just

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
slowed down immediately after now you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.689 
slowed down immediately after now you
can't<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.440> almost<00:01:01.620> cannot<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
can't do it you almost cannot do it and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.640 
can't do it you almost cannot do it and
it<00:01:02.820> pretty<00:01:03.210> much<00:01:03.300> as<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.229> said<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> last

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
it pretty much as I said in the last

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.890 
it pretty much as I said in the last
time<00:01:05.040> which<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.280> probably<00:01:05.430> haven't<00:01:05.670> seen<00:01:05.900> it

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
time which you probably haven't seen it

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.929 
time which you probably haven't seen it
pretty<00:01:07.110> much<00:01:07.200> ruins<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.549> level<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
pretty much ruins it so this level is a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.020 
pretty much ruins it so this level is a
piece<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.320> deserves<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> die<00:01:11.040> yes

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
piece of and it deserves to die yes

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.840 
piece of and it deserves to die yes
it's<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.810> degenerate<00:01:13.350> piece<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.770> filth<00:01:14.040> okay

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it's a degenerate piece of filth okay

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.990 
it's a degenerate piece of filth okay
anyway<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:16.500> subhuman<00:01:17.130> scum<00:01:17.280> even<00:01:17.759> now<00:01:17.970> I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
further but they kind of got blocked in

further but they kind of got blocked in
there<00:01:43.430> it's<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> little<00:01:44.549> bit<00:01:44.759> about<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.090> level

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
there it's a little bit about this level

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.999 
there it's a little bit about this level
I<00:01:45.420> suppose<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:46.079> yeah<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.470> very<00:01:46.649> difficult

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
it's just kind of one of those levels

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.200 
it's just kind of one of those levels
that<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:48.930> overall<00:01:49.560> feels<00:01:50.369> very<00:01:50.759> like

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
