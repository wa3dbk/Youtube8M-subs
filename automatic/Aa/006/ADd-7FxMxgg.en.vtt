00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.100
 Good today. Let's do some tests. 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.550
 Let's see how it behaves in 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.480
 matter of fire to boil hurt 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.869
 prepare the food 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.869
 come on 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.710
 Let's take a closer look. 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.710
 on here 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:06.290
 works very well what is the mix of 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.119
 perfect fuel oxygen and now 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.210
 let's go to the first test do not be relax 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.210
 really 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.770
 Let's see how our water is. 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.900
 boiling 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.530
 who burned 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.030
 I'm using the larger line pieces 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.030
 You do not have to stay feeding all the time. 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.690
 is there our water boiling our 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:02:03.420
 next test let's do it good here 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:02:05.750
 defines the use plate of oil there that be 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.750
 son 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.849
 i 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.250
 a tip I give is not only put on 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.340
 bic for as long as it was already 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.769
 being grand 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.040
 put the salt after I saw it 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.860
 ready and that leaves the meat much more 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.220
 soft and holds all the juice inside the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.220
 charge 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.670
 I'll enjoy it , Gabriel. 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.810
 Let's take a closer look. 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:23.049
 I wish the other one today, it's going to be good. 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:27.430
 Then my friend the team is ready and 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:30.450
 very succulent plus a good performance until 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.450
 here is 50 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:44.840
 Let's go the next test so lets do 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:57.950
 care in the pot with a taste really 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:04:02.470
 a button bacon team from the one hour that 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.470
 as well as reduced well it is good to be good 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:14.350
 Let's hope to mix the flavors here. 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:19.450
 very well now reduced onion is green and 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:24.490
 put the flesh of our flesh 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:28.080
 I can not say what it is but I can 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.080
 ensure it is very tasty 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.710
 we went to the house as our flesh is 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:42.360
 I just put the green pepper and 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:46.720
 make a meal prepare the food 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:50.980
 in the pan of iron and fire, besides alceu 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.800
 key and especially that flavor 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:58.630
 Special 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:02.320
 in the hour that goes weak or one more plate 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.030
 finalized this was a bit more 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:10.360
 prepared to take a little longer than 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:12.840
 It works and works very well there. 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.840
 our role 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:22.919
 Good as I live in the area typically 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:29.759
 an Italian policy could not be lacking 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:32.120
 with salani now let's add to this a 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.120
 little brother 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.410
 just wait for this little cheese at a 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.410
 funny
