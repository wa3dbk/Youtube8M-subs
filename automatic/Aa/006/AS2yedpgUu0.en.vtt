something<00:03:03.210> like<00:03:03.360> 60<00:03:03.870> cents<00:03:04.260> for<00:03:04.410> these<00:03:04.530> and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
something like 60 cents for these and

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.420

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
then I bleached them out and tie-dyed

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.450 
then I bleached them out and tie-dyed
them<00:03:08.730> myself<00:03:09.770> using<00:03:10.770> like<00:03:10.950> these<00:03:11.130> little
