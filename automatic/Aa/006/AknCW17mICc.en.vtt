00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
coming with is fabricating 801 this is

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.269 
coming with is fabricating 801 this is
coming<00:00:23.189> with<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.760> snap<00:00:24.119> ring<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.359> 615<00:00:25.039> this<00:00:26.039> is

coming with the snap ring is 615 this is
like<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> different<00:00:27.660> stop<00:00:27.930> there<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.439> both

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
like a different stop there on both

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.220 
like a different stop there on both
phones<00:00:29.010> let's<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:30.240> quickly<00:00:30.449> do<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.990> with

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
phones let's just quickly do this with

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
the phone app first one good we go the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.630 
the phone app first one good we go the
Galaxy<00:00:35.610> a7<00:00:35.790> wall<00:00:36.300> speaker<00:00:36.750> there<00:00:37.370> let's<00:00:38.370> just

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
Galaxy a7 wall speaker there let's just

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.500 
Galaxy a7 wall speaker there let's just
open<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:41.480> contacts<00:00:43.969> yeah<00:00:44.969> here<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.390> have

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
open up the contacts yeah here we have

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.529 
open up the contacts yeah here we have
the<00:00:45.660> contact<00:00:46.020> apps<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:46.649> two<00:00:46.860> three<00:00:47.190> go<00:00:50.539> seems

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the contact apps one two three go seems

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.110 
the contact apps one two three go seems
like<00:00:51.750> pretty<00:00:52.050> much<00:00:52.260> equal<00:00:52.789> let's<00:00:53.789> check<00:00:53.969> out

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
like pretty much equal let's check out

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.340 
like pretty much equal let's check out
the<00:00:54.149> settings<00:00:56.870> what<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.289> go<00:01:00.140> again<00:01:01.140> pretty

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the settings what do we go again pretty

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.830 
the settings what do we go again pretty
much<00:01:01.410> equal<00:01:01.949> there<00:01:04.729> let's<00:01:05.729> check<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
much equal there let's check out the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.660 
much equal there let's check out the
calculator<00:01:09.740> see<00:01:10.740> which<00:01:11.040> one<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
calculator see which one is going to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.440 
calculator see which one is going to
open<00:01:11.909> up<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> calculator<00:01:12.710> faster<00:01:17.270> one<00:01:18.270> two

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
open up the calculator faster one two

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.330 
open up the calculator faster one two
three<00:01:18.750> go<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:21.600> seems<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.740> Express<00:01:23.040> Z<00:01:23.220> 2

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
three go it seems like the Express Z 2

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:33.030 
three go it seems like the Express Z 2
balls<00:01:23.640> quicker<00:01:27.140> check<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.490 

memo<00:01:34.040> versus<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.880> notes<00:01:35.180> let's<00:01:36.140> see<00:01:36.320> if<00:01:36.380> we

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
memo versus the notes let's see if we

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.490 
memo versus the notes let's see if we
have<00:01:36.620> a<00:01:36.650> note<00:01:37.040> app<00:01:37.310> on<00:01:37.520> xperia<00:01:37.910> z2<00:01:38.320> yeah<00:01:39.320> we

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
have a note app on xperia z2 yeah we

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.810 
have a note app on xperia z2 yeah we
have<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.800> key<00:01:40.300> and<00:01:41.890> we<00:01:42.890> are<00:01:43.010> going<00:01:43.160> to<00:01:43.220> compare

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
have the key and we are going to compare

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.520 
have the key and we are going to compare
the<00:01:43.970> key<00:01:44.240> versus<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.840> memo<00:01:46.540> one<00:01:47.540> two<00:01:47.780> three<00:01:48.080> go

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.170 

seems<00:01:51.530> like<00:01:51.850> pretty<00:01:52.850> much<00:01:52.940> equal<00:01:54.760> let's<00:01:55.760> open

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
seems like pretty much equal let's open

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.380 
seems like pretty much equal let's open
up<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.480> album<00:01:56.960> versus<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.500> gallery<00:01:58.180> one<00:01:59.180> two

up the album versus the gallery one two
three<00:01:59.690> go<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:02.390> seems<00:02:02.780> like<00:02:02.870> the<00:02:03.290> e7<00:02:04.190> asml

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
three go it seems like the e7 asml

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.070 
three go it seems like the e7 asml
squeaker<00:02:05.330> there<00:02:06.700> let's<00:02:07.700> open<00:02:08.149> up<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.450> camera

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
squeaker there let's open up the camera

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.400 
squeaker there let's open up the camera
app<00:02:10.600> here<00:02:11.600> on<00:02:11.810> both<00:02:12.020> devices<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:15.140> course

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
app here on both devices and of course

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.710 
app here on both devices and of course
to<00:02:15.500> do<00:02:15.680> have<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.980> camera<00:02:16.340> app<00:02:16.430> here<00:02:16.820> so<00:02:17.390> one

camera<00:02:22.730> race<00:02:23.410> let's<00:02:24.410> do<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.950> one<00:02:25.160> more<00:02:25.250> time

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
camera race let's do it one more time

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.280 
camera race let's do it one more time
one<00:02:26.150> dude<00:02:26.390> where<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.840> go<00:02:28.600> again<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.750> ASM<00:02:30.080> else

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
one dude where you go again the ASM else

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.070 
one dude where you go again the ASM else
quicker<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:31.000> yeah<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.270> a<00:02:32.360> quick<00:02:32.450> test<00:02:32.750> here

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
quicker so yeah just a quick test here

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.710 
quicker so yeah just a quick test here
between<00:02:33.950> these<00:02:34.250> devices<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:35.270> can<00:02:35.300> see<00:02:35.600> this

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
between these devices you can see this

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.100 
between these devices you can see this
in<00:02:35.870> averaging<00:02:36.170> 6<00:02:36.410> 15<00:02:36.770> is<00:02:36.920> really<00:02:37.310> good<00:02:38.239> if<00:02:38.720> it

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
in averaging 6 15 is really good if it

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.840 
in averaging 6 15 is really good if it
comes<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.709> real<00:02:39.920> life<00:02:39.950> performance<00:02:40.700> is

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
comes to real life performance is

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.840 
comes to real life performance is
compared<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.480> scene<00:02:41.660> are<00:02:41.750> making<00:02:42.020> 801

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
compared to the scene are making 801

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.710 
compared to the scene are making 801
really<00:02:43.850> having<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.480> great<00:02:46.000> almost<00:02:47.000> equal<00:02:47.450> speed

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
really having a great almost equal speed

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.690 
really having a great almost equal speed
