00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.219
 now from lisbon wall jersey in 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.739

 always like that, of course, there we see 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.410

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.460
 face of lodz carved in the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.559
 rock place saint in igls so that is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 already placed the sand either 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.040
 in the left or in the right hole 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.610
 and now let's have a look 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.610
 happens 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:20.700
 that was probably the wrong hole now 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:24.509
 cries the lodge no and I know 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:30.090
 somehow something is coming to us because we 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:33.960
 I 'm sure you're going to die right now no 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.360
 and that takes boring ps yet 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.530
 At half way I just a so judith 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.510

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.350
 christina plaumann then I'll show you 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.950
 Hopefully the reward will be up in you 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.640
 one second then so i am again 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.440
 and of course we take the sand again 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.130
 Attac and now I place in my 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.680
 right hole 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.200
 sorry for the leg that is just at the beginning 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.590
 so if the mabb is cycling now 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:16.270
 I'll put the sand once 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:18.970
 look what happens then age right 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.060
 really much coal respectively 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.950
 of course with coal but just diamond 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.209
 gold and iron are really rich 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.630
 match did not roll 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.630
 yes, and you asked now I had to 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.470
 I'm laughing all the time you ask 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.660
 you determined now 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.690
 how should that go now and the 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:45.940
 team poker table yes one calls that 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.380
 theme money alternatively redstone and there 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.730
 I will certainly be a third 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.930
 tutorials on a gate to alternative 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.300
 redstone and there are hardly any 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.650
 possibilities how to do that in the 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.110
 minecraft pocket edition 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.760
 can build mechanisms that he just go 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.950
 bring if I can run the sand four 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.769
 and we are burnt by lava or 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.600
 or that I just these whole icons 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.660
 if I get the sand in the right lot 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.549
 Throw in there is certainly still one 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.950
 tutorial from me on it you can 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.150
 ever look forward 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.709

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.269
 mode and of course checked out 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.590
 Angry this mechanism works 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.420
 I'm quite logical 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.160
 Do not show it now because that should be so 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.500
 a secret stay until the redstone 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.530

 So as toilet 14 tutorial there are 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.850
 no redstone in the Maltese though 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.880
 as a team ration, so to speak 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.760
