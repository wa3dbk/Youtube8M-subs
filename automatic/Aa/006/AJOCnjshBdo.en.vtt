00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.819
 unboxing it's been a while since we took 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.010
 one but we have come one and with one of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.400
 the great games this summer that do not 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.830
 is another one 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.610
 the last of us at first was just going 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.960
 to buy the game xxi without more but I 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.960
 they warned that two services had arrived 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.140
 with joel the protagonist 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.300
 and for little more than good money your 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.480
 seventy euros because I said no one three 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.180
 for ox and I bought it so now 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.490
 let's start with the unboxing to see 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.990
 what do you think so far 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:42.020
 Well, let's start with the 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:44.370
 unboxing ok we start with the box 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.670
 of cardboard 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.070
 pretty 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.579
 we are going to open from here with the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.579
 scissors 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.360
 what we find is the first time 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.900
 I talk to so 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.019
 there will be that bone I will see so fast 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.700
 how are you worth 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.700
 the joel edition comes with a sleeve 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.700
 cloth 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:24.790
 it reminds me a little 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.790
 the unboxing we did of the far cry 3 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.909
 it's a philosophy a bit like seeing 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.509
 because we have here well 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.509
 let's start with this same thing what is 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:45.020
 with its compartments appears the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.020
 exclusive poster of this edition 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.690
 good as you can appreciate is I'm from 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.760
 black and white paper is a paper 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.750
 heavy coarse weight does not have 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.390
 Shine is pretty pretty cool is 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.520
 a little about but good at least it seems 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.109
 which is original to see let's continue 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.109
 to see what we are 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.080
 well these are the vinyl for him 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.790
 for the command for the controller I'm not 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.550
 very fan of putting these things but good 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.580
 by keeping it africa da always comes 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.580
 all right 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.270
 We continue to see what else comes here 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.810
 we have already known art book 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.130
 or from here to stab a bandit 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.130
 who is attacking joel 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.580
 is made by dark ozz wood helmets 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.900
 with me a pretty comic editor 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.900
 important and we have the art 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.820
 well we went through the following thing that 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.140
 they are stickers of naughty dog that of the 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.540
 game developer 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:22.690
 I will not use it but good and a small 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.710
 that is a small comic 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.710
 that the truth 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.290
 the drawing our normal looks like 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.790
 small the lyngby surviving in this 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:41.370
 post-apocalyptic world full of 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.370
 bandits and of infected by fungi 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.800
 those were not after having to take 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.030
 a look with more calm 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.420
 and now it's coming 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:58.359
 the game 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.359
 also carefully remove the plastic 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.950
 I resist resisting register yourself in 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:24.550
 addiction 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:26.110
 today we have here the cardboard the 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.820
 same image 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.820
 the poster that was shown before 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:40.529
 are two poles that cardboard 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.529
 comes with the times 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.360
 in the game 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.250
 the instructions as they come bring us 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.400
 to accustomed lately enough 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.500
 normalita and to get radio from 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.599
 television that at the moment I do not know very well 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.320
 what they bring but I will not look a little more 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.980
 ahead 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.980
 we open 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.949
 and here comes 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.590
 here the king 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.660
 king 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:31.460
 but that this is all I do not know what's left 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.620
 to me that he brought a 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.310
 a band on the soundtrack of the 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.310
 games 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.530
 well then this is 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.780
 it's up to here in the unboxing 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.220
 it's pretty well quite complete by 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.100
 for 70 euros that has cost me 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.200
 seemed a 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.600
 a pretty good pack but good what 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.600
 really it matters is the game coming 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.580
 inside that I calculate that this week 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.130
 Well, it's going to disappear because I'm going to 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.320
 play intensive hours with the game this 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.780
 has been all for the moment if it has 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.070
 liked to like to share it 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.780
