good<00:00:38.310> I<00:00:38.340> think<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:39.120> audience<00:00:39.540> can<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:40.020> quite

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
good I think the audience can be quite

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.840 
good I think the audience can be quite
timid<00:00:40.530> at<00:00:40.770> first<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:41.310> you<00:00:41.579> know<00:00:41.670> there's

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
timid at first because you know there's

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.240 
timid at first because you know there's
obviously<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.360> lot<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.630> beautiful<00:00:43.590> girls<00:00:43.950> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
obviously a lot of beautiful girls and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.340 
obviously a lot of beautiful girls and
guys<00:00:44.430> walking<00:00:45.000> around<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.630> next<00:00:45.810> to<00:00:45.990> nothing

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
guys walking around and next to nothing

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.710 
guys walking around and next to nothing
and<00:00:46.560> sort<00:00:47.220> of<00:00:47.280> big<00:00:47.490> hats<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.060> quite<00:00:48.270> scary

sort<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.460> uniforms<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.730> think<00:00:51.000> once<00:00:51.150> they

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
sort of uniforms but I think once they

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.450 
sort of uniforms but I think once they
warm<00:00:51.540> to<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:52.170> start<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.800> open<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
warm to that they start to open up and

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.350 
warm to that they start to open up and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
actually because the dance is literally

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.310 
actually because the dance is literally
like<00:01:05.240> the<00:01:06.240> time<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.020> change

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
like the time they have to change

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.410 
like the time they have to change
between<00:01:07.770> sets<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.549> pretty<00:01:08.819> pretty

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
between sets it's pretty pretty

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.510 
between sets it's pretty pretty
impressive<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:11.069> only<00:01:11.249> that<00:01:11.399> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
impressive and not only that the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.919 
impressive and not only that the
routines<00:01:11.880> they're<00:01:12.119> doing<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.719> they're

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
routines they're doing and so they're

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.989 
routines they're doing and so they're
they're<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> ones<00:01:13.350> who<00:01:13.499> I<00:01:13.530> think<00:01:13.909> take<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:14.999 
they're the ones who I think take the

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:16.910 
they're the ones who I think take the
most<00:01:15.149> impact<00:01:15.569> on<00:01:15.749> that<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:15.990> their<00:01:16.139> body<00:01:16.319> so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
most impact on that on their body so

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.379 
most impact on that on their body so
just<00:01:17.219> to<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.460> record<00:01:17.700> straight<00:01:17.729> I'm<00:01:18.210> sure

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:18.389 
just to get the record straight I'm sure

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:21.109 
just to get the record straight I'm sure
we've<00:01:18.539> got<00:01:18.719> a<00:01:18.990> lot<00:01:19.319> of<00:01:19.350> female<00:01:19.770> viewers<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.030> you
