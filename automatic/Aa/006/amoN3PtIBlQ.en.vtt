you<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> long<00:02:04.020> time<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.909> are<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.570> new

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
you for a long time you are in new

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.380 
you for a long time you are in new
territory<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:09.739> anything<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.890> happen<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.459> mean

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
territory and anything can happen I mean

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.270 
territory and anything can happen I mean
nobody<00:02:13.390> does<00:02:13.630> experiments<00:02:14.560> where<00:02:14.710> snake

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
nobody does experiments where snake

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.340 
nobody does experiments where snake
bites<00:02:15.520> down<00:02:15.730> on<00:02:15.790> somebody<00:02:16.180> for<00:02:16.480> 30<00:02:16.720> seconds<00:02:17.200> or

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
bites down on somebody for 30 seconds or

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.340 
bites down on somebody for 30 seconds or
more<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.580> this<00:02:19.120> snake<00:02:19.300> could<00:02:19.480> be<00:02:19.840> deadly<00:02:20.110> as

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
more so this snake could be deadly as

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.550 
more so this snake could be deadly as

well you never really know so that's an

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.950 
well you never really know so that's an
argument<00:02:23.710> for<00:02:24.160> not<00:02:24.280> picking<00:02:24.460> up<00:02:24.760> any<00:02:25.030> snake

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
argument for not picking up any snake

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.170 
argument for not picking up any snake
you<00:02:26.080> really<00:02:26.320> don't<00:02:26.470> need<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.650> pick<00:02:26.890> up<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.370> how

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
you really don't need to pick up and how

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.520 
you really don't need to pick up and how
often<00:02:28.510> do<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:28.630> really<00:02:28.900> need<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.140> pick<00:02:29.290> up<00:02:29.440> a

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
often do you really need to pick up a

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:38.040 
often do you really need to pick up a
snake<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:36.430> these<00:02:36.550> are<00:02:36.610> long<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.330> slender<00:02:37.690> look

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
snake so these are long and slender look

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.560 
snake so these are long and slender look
at<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.230> body<00:02:38.470> type<00:02:39.000> really<00:02:40.000> long<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.390> slender

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
at the body type really long and slender

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.680 
at the body type really long and slender
it<00:02:40.780> has<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.050> same<00:02:41.350> kind<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.740> body<00:02:41.920> as<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.160> as<00:02:42.910> the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
it has the same kind of body as a as the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.450 
it has the same kind of body as a as the
golden<00:02:44.080> tree<00:02:44.230> snake<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.870> also<00:02:47.800> well<00:02:48.250> it's

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
golden tree snake and also well it's

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.420 
golden tree snake and also well it's
even<00:02:48.760> longer<00:02:48.880> than<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.330> laotian<00:02:49.810> wolf<00:02:50.050> snake

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
even longer than the laotian wolf snake

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.830 
even longer than the laotian wolf snake
I'd<00:02:51.430> say<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.790> looks<00:02:51.820> mostly<00:02:52.210> like<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.540> golden

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
I'd say it looks mostly like the golden

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.890 
I'd say it looks mostly like the golden
tree<00:02:53.020> snake<00:02:53.320> as<00:02:53.530> far<00:02:53.770> as<00:02:53.800> body<00:02:54.280> shape<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:55.780> can

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
tree snake as far as body shape you can

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.870 
tree snake as far as body shape you can
see<00:02:56.080> light<00:02:56.440> light<00:02:56.860> banding<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.610> side

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
see light light banding on the side

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.290 
see light light banding on the side
white<00:02:58.270> banding<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:58.960> don't<00:02:59.140> look<00:02:59.260> at<00:02:59.380> them<00:03:00.300> was

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
white banding I don't look at them was

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.080 
white banding I don't look at them was
like<00:03:01.450> all<00:03:01.630> right<00:03:01.660> how<00:03:01.840> do<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:01.990> get<00:03:02.080> out<00:03:02.880> how<00:03:03.880> do<00:03:03.940> I

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
like all right how do I get out how do I

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:13.830 
like all right how do I get out how do I
get<00:03:04.240> out<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.540> here<00:03:12.060> anyway<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.120> he<00:03:13.360> was<00:03:13.510> in<00:03:13.690> the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
get out of here anyway so he was in the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.430 
get out of here anyway so he was in the
arm<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.940> was<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.239> like<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.570> rafter<00:03:16.930> area<00:03:17.230> of

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
arm it was in like the rafter area of

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.240 
arm it was in like the rafter area of
the<00:03:17.739> of<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.280> top<00:03:18.489> of<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.730> bamboo<00:03:19.090> hut<00:03:20.250> Elliot

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
the of the top of a bamboo hut Elliot

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.340 
the of the top of a bamboo hut Elliot
found<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.610> frog<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.030> tree<00:03:22.450> frog<00:03:22.660> down<00:03:22.989> below

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
found a frog a tree frog down below

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.990 
found a frog a tree frog down below
which<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:23.860> could<00:03:23.950> have<00:03:24.070> been<00:03:24.160> after<00:03:24.310> probably

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
which it could have been after probably

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.930 
which it could have been after probably
was<00:03:25.450> because<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.810> probably<00:03:25.959> smelled<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.650> and

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
was because it probably smelled it and

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.490 
was because it probably smelled it and
he<00:03:27.940> also<00:03:28.090> found<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.660> um<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:29.140> big<00:03:29.380> tokay<00:03:29.739> gecko<00:03:30.100> so

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
he also found a um a big tokay gecko so

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.100 
he also found a um a big tokay gecko so
this<00:03:32.500> snake<00:03:32.739> is<00:03:32.920> slightly<00:03:33.520> keeled<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.870> can

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
this snake is slightly keeled so it can

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.550 
this snake is slightly keeled so it can
climb<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.940> because<00:03:37.239> it's<00:03:37.390> so<00:03:37.600> thin<00:03:38.050> and<00:03:38.080> long

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
climb and because it's so thin and long

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.320 
climb and because it's so thin and long
I<00:03:38.830> think<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.340> could<00:03:39.430> probably<00:03:39.670> climb<00:03:40.090> pretty

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
I think it could probably climb pretty

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.660 
I think it could probably climb pretty
well<00:03:43.140> anyway<00:03:44.140> great<00:03:44.410> snake<00:03:44.709> is<00:03:44.980> tired<00:03:45.519> a

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
well anyway great snake is tired a

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.220 
well anyway great snake is tired a
little<00:03:45.790> bit<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.269> guess<00:03:46.750> I'm<00:03:46.870> going<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.050> switch

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
little bit I guess I'm going to switch

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.560 
little bit I guess I'm going to switch
to<00:03:47.260> UM<00:03:47.650> still<00:03:48.430> photos<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:48.880> get<00:03:48.940> some<00:03:49.150> some

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
to UM still photos and get some some

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.650 
to UM still photos and get some some
photos<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.140> then<00:03:50.260> we'll<00:03:51.040> let<00:03:51.130> him<00:03:51.280> go<00:03:51.400> up

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
photos and then we'll let him go up

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.970 
photos and then we'll let him go up
somewhere<00:03:52.660> close<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:52.930> where<00:03:53.260> he<00:03:53.350> was<00:03:53.530> or<00:03:53.560> maybe

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
somewhere close to where he was or maybe

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.090 
somewhere close to where he was or maybe
by<00:03:54.160> another<00:03:54.430> bungalow<00:03:54.880> here<00:03:55.090> I<00:03:58.920> don't<00:03:59.920> think

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
by another bungalow here I don't think

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.729 
by another bungalow here I don't think
he<00:04:00.220> hasn't<00:04:00.400> struck<00:04:00.880> yet<00:04:01.120> right<00:04:01.500> yeah<00:04:02.500> no

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
he hasn't struck yet right yeah no

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.720 
he hasn't struck yet right yeah no
strikes<00:04:03.160> yet<00:04:05.100> not<00:04:06.100> like<00:04:06.280> we<00:04:06.430> gave<00:04:06.580> him
