00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and you're going to put it so that the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.350 
and you're going to put it so that the
seam<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> fabric<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.979> facing<00:01:20.640> down

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
seam of the fabric is facing down

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.630 
seam of the fabric is facing down
because<00:01:22.020> when<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.320> wrap<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.830> around<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
because when you wrap it around you

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.399 
because when you wrap it around you
don't<00:01:23.790> want<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> seam<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.600> be<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> outside

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
don't want the seam to be on the outside

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.460 
don't want the seam to be on the outside
so<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.400> take<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.960> wrap<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.409> around

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
so now you take it and wrap it around

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.730 
so now you take it and wrap it around
just<00:01:29.479> like<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.900> you<00:01:33.900> want<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.200> hold<00:01:34.439> it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
just like that and you want to hold it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.039 
just like that and you want to hold it
so<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.250> two<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.720> part

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
so you have one two and now this part

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.280 
so you have one two and now this part
here<00:01:37.259> that's<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.590> fourth<00:01:37.890> panel<00:01:38.720> it<00:01:39.720> leaves<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
here that's the fourth panel it leaves a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.990 
here that's the fourth panel it leaves a
little<00:01:40.409> space<00:01:40.860> where<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.490> take<00:01:41.759> that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
little space where you can take that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.850 
little space where you can take that
piece<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.659> fabric<00:01:42.810> run<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> through<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.680> we're

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
piece of fabric run it through so we're

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.300 
piece of fabric run it through so we're
going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.509> like<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:46.040> we're<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> run

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
going to go like this we're going to run

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.929 
going to go like this we're going to run
it<00:01:47.610> from<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.149> side<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.079> side<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.939> as

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
it from this side to this side and as

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.399 
it from this side to this side and as
