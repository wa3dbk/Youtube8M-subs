00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
like special moves stuff like that so

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.959 
like special moves stuff like that so
it's<00:00:53.190> actually<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:53.699> simple<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.539> fun<00:00:55.969> and

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it's actually really simple and fun and

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.810 
it's actually really simple and fun and
obviously<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> characters<00:00:57.930> are<00:00:57.960> all<00:00:58.820> changed

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
obviously the characters are all changed

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.670 
obviously the characters are all changed
to<00:00:59.969> represent<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.629> actors<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> film<00:01:01.199> yeah

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
to represent the actors in the film yeah

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.579 
to represent the actors in the film yeah
they<00:01:01.890> actually<00:01:02.280> thought<00:01:03.270> they<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:04.439> took

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
they actually thought they have we took

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.170 
they actually thought they have we took
the<00:01:04.830> pictures<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.400> actors<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.000> then<00:01:06.090> we

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
the pictures of the actors and then we

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.940 
the pictures of the actors and then we
digitize<00:01:06.630> them<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.140> put<00:01:07.409> them<00:01:07.439> into<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> game

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
digitize them and put them into the game

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.890 
digitize them and put them into the game
so<00:01:08.159> they<00:01:08.369> would<00:01:08.520> match<00:01:08.820> with<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> actual

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
so they would match with the actual

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.960 
so they would match with the actual
movie

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.310

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
so even in the arcade mode there's some

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.730 
so even in the arcade mode there's some

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
games we've seen allowed kind of the

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.469 
games we've seen allowed kind of the
crazy<00:02:08.310> flying<00:02:08.700> around<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.210> really

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
crazy flying around and really

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.450 
crazy flying around and really
over-the-top<00:02:09.780> action<00:02:10.320> does<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.310> all

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
over-the-top action does this have all

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.640 
over-the-top action does this have all
that<00:02:11.610> no<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:12.480> actually<00:02:12.810> more<00:02:13.050> down<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.590> earth

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that no it's actually more down to earth

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.729 
that no it's actually more down to earth
it's<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.190> little<00:02:14.400> bit<00:02:14.550> more<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.660> guess<00:02:16.080> realistic

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
it's a little bit more I guess realistic

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.830 
it's a little bit more I guess realistic
would<00:02:16.860> be<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.070> word<00:02:17.220> but<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.420> don't<00:02:18.570> you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
would be the word but you don't you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.510 
would be the word but you don't you
can't<00:02:19.050> really<00:02:19.260> fly<00:02:19.410> up<00:02:19.680> into<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.950> air<00:02:19.980> and

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
can't really fly up into the air and

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.030 
can't really fly up into the air and
hang<00:02:20.820> out<00:02:20.970> there<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.570> like<00:02:22.140> make<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.860> entire

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040

little<00:02:44.140> bit<00:02:44.260> more<00:02:44.470> realistic<00:02:44.770> as<00:02:45.400> goku<00:02:45.700> have

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
little bit more realistic as goku have

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.270 
little bit more realistic as goku have
any<00:02:46.270> of<00:02:46.330> his<00:02:46.450> signature<00:02:46.900> attacks<00:02:47.230> oh<00:02:47.590> yeah<00:02:48.130> he

just like in the movie he has to kind of

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.810 
just like in the movie he has to kind of
learn<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.680> he<00:02:59.920> doesn't<00:03:00.070> start<00:03:00.400> off<00:03:00.520> with<00:03:00.700> it

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
learn it so he doesn't start off with it

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.430 
learn it so he doesn't start off with it
in<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:00.970> beginning<00:03:01.060> when<00:03:01.959> you're<00:03:02.110> starting<00:03:02.320> to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
in the beginning when you're starting to

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:12.460 
in the beginning when you're starting to
play<00:03:02.590> through<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.830> story

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.710 

we<00:03:13.040> have<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.220> command<00:03:13.550> man<00:03:13.700> but<00:03:14.030> she<00:03:14.510> dodged

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
we have the command man but she dodged

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.970 
we have the command man but she dodged
my<00:03:14.960> command<00:03:15.290> man<00:03:17.080> so<00:03:18.080> those<00:03:18.260> texts<00:03:18.620> seem<00:03:18.740> to<00:03:18.770> be

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
my command man so those texts seem to be

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.760 
my command man so those texts seem to be
a<00:03:19.250> little<00:03:19.430> bit<00:03:19.640> more<00:03:19.820> like<00:03:20.600> super<00:03:21.230> moves<00:03:21.440> in<00:03:21.650> a

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
a little bit more like super moves in a

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.800 
a little bit more like super moves in a
traditional<00:03:22.430> fighter<00:03:22.610> yeah<00:03:23.120> they're<00:03:23.630> the

traditional fighter yeah they're the
they're<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:25.130> special<00:03:25.640> moves<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.030> can

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
they're the special moves that you can

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.560 
they're the special moves that you can
activate<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.750> use<00:03:26.810> against<00:03:27.260> your<00:03:27.470> opponent

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
activate and use against your opponent

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.850 
activate and use against your opponent

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
have to charge up and then you could do

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.180 
have to charge up and then you could do
it<00:03:35.990> one<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:36.410> then<00:03:36.530> you<00:03:36.620> have<00:03:36.710> to<00:03:36.800> charge<00:03:37.040> up

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
it one so then you have to charge up

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.100 
it one so then you have to charge up
again<00:03:37.460> and<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:37.880> we<00:03:38.120> have<00:03:38.240> a<00:03:38.270> meter<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.810> actually

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
again and so we have a meter to actually

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.260 
again and so we have a meter to actually
kind<00:03:39.290> of<00:03:39.320> curtail<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.310> whole<00:03:40.490> making

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
kind of curtail the whole making

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.420 
kind of curtail the whole making
everything<00:03:41.570> explode<00:03:42.080> with<00:03:42.320> tons<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.100> tons<00:03:43.250> of
