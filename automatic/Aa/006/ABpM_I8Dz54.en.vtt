look really cool it's gonna extend out

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.460 
look really cool it's gonna extend out
long<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.969> has<00:00:15.089> lots<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.480> different<00:00:15.630> locking

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
long it has lots of different locking

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.189 
long it has lots of different locking
options<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.550> it's<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:18.480> generally<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> really

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
options and it's just generally a really

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.620 
options and it's just generally a really
nice<00:00:19.470> tripod<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.189> use<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.029> guess<00:00:21.210> I'll<00:00:21.359> start

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
nice tripod to use so I guess I'll start

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.019 
nice tripod to use so I guess I'll start
down<00:00:21.869> here<00:00:21.930> down<00:00:22.470> low<00:00:22.500> at<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> bottom<00:00:23.220> right

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
down here down low at the bottom right

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.570 
down here down low at the bottom right
here<00:00:24.240> our<00:00:24.539> little<00:00:25.140> four<00:00:25.560> different<00:00:26.189> locking

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
here our little four different locking

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.670 
here our little four different locking
technique<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.630> lock<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.500> can

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
technique so you can lock it up you can

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.339 
technique so you can lock it up you can
move<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.189> way<00:00:29.400> out<00:00:29.640> if<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:31.080> unlock

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
move it all the way out if I unlock

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.959 
move it all the way out if I unlock
those<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:32.040> see<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.309> goes<00:00:32.460> out<00:00:32.669> that

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
those as you can see it goes out that

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.870 
those as you can see it goes out that
far<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.960> pretty<00:00:34.079> far<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.489> then<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.700> can

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
far it's pretty far and then you can

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.000 
far it's pretty far and then you can
always<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.420> push<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.870> back<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.290> right<00:00:37.770> here

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
always just push it back in right here

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010 
always just push it back in right here
on<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.280> side<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> little<00:00:38.969> soft<00:00:39.239> cushion<00:00:39.809> on

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
on this side is a little soft cushion on

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.420 
on this side is a little soft cushion on
both<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.440> these<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:40.860> carry<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.340> around

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
both of these so you can carry it around

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.760 
both of these so you can carry it around
like<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:42.719> feels<00:00:43.110> really<00:00:43.320> good<00:00:43.469> in

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
like that it just feels really good in

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.069 
like that it just feels really good in
your<00:00:43.890> hands<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:45.270> they<00:00:45.510> also<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.960> these

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
your hands and they also have these

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.840 
your hands and they also have these
little<00:00:46.320> locks<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.219> side<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.700> can

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
little locks on this side so you can

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.299 
little locks on this side so you can
also<00:00:48.050> just<00:00:49.050> lock<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.289> up<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.770> always

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
also just lock it up so it's always

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.310 
also just lock it up so it's always
locked<00:00:50.640> at<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.969> position<00:00:51.210> or<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.140> could

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
locked at this position or you could

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.709 
locked at this position or you could
push<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.789> then<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.360> means<00:00:54.570> that

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
push that up and then that means that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.660 
push that up and then that means that
this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:55.469> able<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.710> go<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:56.129> far

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
this is going to be able to go as far

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.360 
this is going to be able to go as far
forward<00:00:57.390> or<00:00:57.480> backwards<00:00:58.199> as<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.500> want<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:58.980> you

will be the same up top here you have a
lot<00:01:12.390> more<00:01:12.420> locking<00:01:13.290> option<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.310> see

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
lot more locking option as you can see

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.980 
lot more locking option as you can see
this<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:15.180> hand<00:01:15.360> thing<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.869> could

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.359 
this is a little hand thing so you could
put<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.229> around<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.470> wrist<00:01:16.650> carry<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.159> like

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
move this the one thing I didn't notice

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.820

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
is I don't have any

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.560 
is I don't have any
and<00:01:53.920> handle<00:01:54.370> so<00:01:54.520> it's<00:01:54.670> not<00:01:54.790> very<00:01:55.030> good<00:01:55.150> for<00:01:55.480> you

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
and handle so it's not very good for you

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.930 
and handle so it's not very good for you
know<00:01:55.690> videoing<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:57.010> don't<00:01:57.160> have<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.280> handle<00:01:57.760> to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
know videoing you don't have a handle to

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.290 
know videoing you don't have a handle to
hold<00:01:58.090> on<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:59.440> pan<00:01:59.890> and<00:02:00.250> tilt<00:02:00.640> around<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.270> I

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
hold on to and pan and tilt around so I

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.270 
hold on to and pan and tilt around so I
recommend<00:02:01.900> buying<00:02:02.080> something<00:02:02.500> else<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:03.040> go<00:02:03.160> on

sturdy right there I can push it all the
way<00:02:15.610> down<00:02:15.640> like<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.210> I<00:02:16.450> can<00:02:16.870> move<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.320> camera

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
way down like that I can move the camera

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.310 
way down like that I can move the camera
around<00:02:17.950> like<00:02:18.490> this<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.270> 360<00:02:19.780> kind<00:02:20.230> of

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
around like this and a 360 kind of

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.610 
around like this and a 360 kind of
motion<00:02:20.710> on<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.010> little<00:02:21.340> pivot<00:02:21.730> bar<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:23.020> can

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
motion on this little pivot bar I can

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.530 
motion on this little pivot bar I can
then<00:02:23.800> tighten<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.700> all<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.910> way<00:02:25.030> up<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.240> it

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
then tighten it all the way up so it

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.410 
then tighten it all the way up so it
doesn't<00:02:25.840> move<00:02:25.990> at<00:02:26.320> all<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:27.130> can<00:02:27.730> do<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.360> I

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
doesn't move at all I can do this so I

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.180 
doesn't move at all I can do this so I
can<00:02:28.450> take<00:02:28.750> off<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:29.020> release<00:02:29.500> plate<00:02:29.830> put<00:02:30.100> it

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
can take off the release plate put it

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.080 
can take off the release plate put it
anywhere<00:02:30.460> else

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
anywhere else

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.420 
anywhere else
put<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:31.660> back<00:02:31.810> there's<00:02:32.470> also<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.950> other<00:02:33.160> type

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
put it back there's also this other type

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.670 
put it back there's also this other type
of<00:02:33.459> motion<00:02:33.910> which<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.270> just<00:02:34.540> turning<00:02:34.840> actual

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
of motion which is just turning actual

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.920 
of motion which is just turning actual
camera<00:02:36.040> 360<00:02:36.760> around<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:37.270> have<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.600> pivot

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
camera 360 around so you have the pivot

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.630 
camera 360 around so you have the pivot
head<00:02:38.080> like<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.320> and<00:02:38.740> then<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.370> turn<00:02:39.580> the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
head like that and then you can turn the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.690 
head like that and then you can turn the
whole<00:02:39.910> thing<00:02:39.970> around<00:02:40.209> 360<00:02:40.930> degrees<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:42.130> that's

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
whole thing around 360 degrees so that's

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.130 
whole thing around 360 degrees so that's
really<00:02:43.030> cool<00:02:43.300> just<00:02:43.480> tons<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:44.020> different

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
really cool just tons of different

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.770 
really cool just tons of different
options<00:02:44.850> there's<00:02:45.850> two<00:02:46.120> little<00:02:46.300> nuts<00:02:46.600> right

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
options there's two little nuts right

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.860 
options there's two little nuts right
here<00:02:47.020> they<00:02:47.170> can<00:02:47.380> do<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:48.060> tighten<00:02:49.060> up<00:02:49.209> these

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
here they can do to tighten up these

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.170 
here they can do to tighten up these
actual<00:02:50.350> things<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.800> can<00:02:50.950> make<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.250> break<00:02:51.940> they

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
actual things you can make it break they

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.240 
actual things you can make it break they
were<00:02:52.240> exactly<00:02:52.780> there<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.680> can<00:02:53.830> turn<00:02:54.010> this

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
were exactly there and you can turn this

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.190 
were exactly there and you can turn this
and<00:02:54.610> turn<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.240> it's<00:02:55.360> nice<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.570> tight<00:02:55.930> on

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
and turn that so it's nice and tight on

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.250 
and turn that so it's nice and tight on
tighter<00:02:56.950> than<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:58.959> going<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.140> go

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
tighter than that and it's going to go

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.380 
tighter than that and it's going to go
up<00:02:59.380> another<00:02:59.800> section<00:03:00.580> so<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:00.970> have<00:03:01.060> tons<00:03:01.239> of

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
up another section so you have tons of
