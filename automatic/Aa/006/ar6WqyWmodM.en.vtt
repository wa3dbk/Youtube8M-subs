really<00:01:03.129> contact<00:01:03.699> we<00:01:04.179> can<00:01:04.390> compress<00:01:04.989> it<00:01:05.170> down

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
really contact we can compress it down

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.279 
really contact we can compress it down
and<00:01:05.649> it<00:01:06.310> fits<00:01:07.119> an<00:01:07.210> appalling<00:01:07.509> on<00:01:07.840> let's<00:01:08.110> go

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
and it fits an appalling on let's go

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.310 
and it fits an appalling on let's go
small<00:01:08.560> so<00:01:09.429> that's<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.670> first<00:01:09.850> one<00:01:10.289> second<00:01:11.289> one
