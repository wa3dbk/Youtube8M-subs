00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
we're going to get a look at about

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.389 
we're going to get a look at about
tablets<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.420> gauge<00:00:43.200> step<00:00:43.530> /<00:00:43.739> has<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.040> course<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
tablets the gauge step / has of course a

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.360 
tablets the gauge step / has of course a
10.1<00:00:45.000> screen<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.809> degree<00:00:46.739> playbook<00:00:47.219> has<00:00:47.340> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
10.1 screen the degree playbook has a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.580 
10.1 screen the degree playbook has a
7-inch<00:00:47.820> screen<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.140> matter<00:00:49.350> they

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
7-inch screen so in that matter they

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.610 
7-inch screen so in that matter they
differ<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.190> little<00:00:50.399> bit<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:51.270> probably<00:00:51.840> where

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
differ a little bit but probably where

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.979 
differ a little bit but probably where
we<00:00:52.770> will<00:00:52.949> convert<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.969> into<00:00:54.180> 10<00:00:54.539> inch<00:00:54.750> version

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
we will convert it into 10 inch version

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.500 
we will convert it into 10 inch version

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
have to wait for it so if we first look

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.340 
have to wait for it so if we first look
at<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> UI<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:01.350> said<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.870> galaxy<00:01:04.170> tab

that<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.570> bought<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.990> year<00:01:13.260> ago<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.710> there's<00:01:14.490> also

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that I bought a year ago so there's also

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.399 
that I bought a year ago so there's also
the<00:01:14.880> first<00:01:15.119> tablet<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.630> actually<00:01:15.869> cut<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the first tablet that actually cut the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.499 
the first tablet that actually cut the
software<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.030> look<00:01:18.180> at<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
software so if you look at the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.289 
software so if you look at the
smoothness<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.140> both<00:01:19.740> softwares<00:01:20.310> would<00:01:21.180> you

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
smoothness of both softwares would you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.640 
smoothness of both softwares would you
show<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> little<00:01:21.720> bit<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.320> they<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.310> see<00:01:23.630> that

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
show a little bit here they can see that

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.289 
show a little bit here they can see that
the<00:01:25.650> blackberry<00:01:26.040> playbook<00:01:26.310> as<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> nice

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the blackberry playbook as a nice

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.810 
the blackberry playbook as a nice
animation<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.590> also<00:01:28.770> runs<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.340> little<00:01:29.610> bit

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
animation but it also runs a little bit

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.719 
animation but it also runs a little bit
more<00:01:29.939> smooth<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.229> more<00:01:31.520> natural<00:01:32.520> if

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
more smooth it's just more natural if

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.270 
more smooth it's just more natural if
you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.970> say<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> iPad<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:35.159> we

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you can say just like the iPad so if we

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.679 
you can say just like the iPad so if we
go<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.610> into<00:01:36.090> settings<00:01:37.130> let's<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.689> settings

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
go to into settings let's see settings

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.030 
go to into settings let's see settings
here<00:01:40.670> then<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.530> well<00:01:43.530> they<00:01:43.799> run

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
here then you can see that well they run

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.880 
here then you can see that well they run
actually<00:01:44.549> both<00:01:44.970> pretty<00:01:45.659> smooth<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.259> from<00:01:46.710> now

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
actually both pretty smooth but from now

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.889 
actually both pretty smooth but from now
and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:49.909> PlayBook<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.119> faster<00:01:51.720> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and then the PlayBook is faster and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.170 
and then the PlayBook is faster and
that's<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.500> better<00:01:52.710> interface<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.610> runs

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
that's a better interface it just runs

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.200 
that's a better interface it just runs
more<00:01:54.540> yeah<00:01:55.020> well<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.219> say<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.030> can

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
more yeah well if you can say so you can

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.170 
more yeah well if you can say so you can
see<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.840> pop<00:01:58.079> up<00:01:58.790> it's<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.850> little<00:02:00.090> bit

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
see here with a pop up it's a little bit

experience the Android is a bit slower

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:52.360 
experience the Android is a bit slower
it's<00:05:50.900> because<00:05:51.199> of<00:05:51.349> Android<00:05:51.830> Honeycomb<00:05:51.919> the

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
it's because of Android Honeycomb the

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.159 
it's because of Android Honeycomb the
spectrum<00:05:52.759> that<00:05:52.789> are<00:05:53.210> really<00:05:53.419> good<00:05:53.629> bill<00:05:53.900> code

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
spectrum that are really good bill code

is<00:05:54.349> also<00:05:54.620> really<00:05:54.740> good<00:05:54.860> but<00:05:55.520> the<00:05:55.759> android<00:05:56.509> 3.1

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
is also really good but the android 3.1

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.769 
is also really good but the android 3.1
isn't<00:05:57.440> that<00:05:57.529> good<00:05:57.680> still<00:05:58.069> as<00:05:58.279> iOS<00:05:58.909> or<00:05:59.180> q<00:05:59.539> onyx

00:05:59.769 --> 00:05:59.779
