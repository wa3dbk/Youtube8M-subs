00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.160 

it<00:03:58.420> can<00:03:58.570> take<00:03:58.750> a<00:03:58.780> while<00:04:00.180> but<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.600> this<00:04:01.990> whole

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
it can take a while but the this whole

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:11.720 
it can take a while but the this whole
pan<00:04:02.440> is<00:04:02.620> moving

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.500 

let's<00:04:12.730> going<00:04:13.000> back<00:04:13.210> out<00:04:14.910> when<00:04:15.910> this<00:04:16.060> when<00:04:16.390> this

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
let's going back out when this when this

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.350 
let's going back out when this when this
bird<00:04:16.810> hits<00:04:17.110> it<00:04:17.320> here<00:04:17.680> it's<00:04:17.920> going<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.360> start

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 
bird hits it here it's going to start

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:43.560 
bird hits it here it's going to start
pushing<00:04:19.780> it<00:04:19.900> out<00:04:20.080> I<00:04:20.110> think

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:58.290 

there's<00:04:44.570> everybody<00:04:45.760> hands<00:04:46.760> gliding

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.140 

actually<00:04:59.139> the<00:04:59.229> ice<00:04:59.379> might<00:04:59.740> pull<00:05:00.039> that<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:04.000> ice

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
actually the ice might pull that the ice

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:18.950 
actually the ice might pull that the ice
is<00:05:04.389> pulling<00:05:04.750> that<00:05:04.900> cable<00:05:05.349> now

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:38.999 

there<00:05:19.620> goes<00:05:19.889> start<00:05:20.280> moving<00:05:20.580> again<00:05:21.860> downstream

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:40.920 

there<00:05:39.639> it<00:05:39.729> goes<00:05:39.939> it's<00:05:40.270> tightening<00:05:40.689> up<00:05:40.809> the

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
there it goes it's tightening up the

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.780 
there it goes it's tightening up the
cable<00:05:42.659> there's<00:05:43.659> the<00:05:43.900> cable

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.170 

I'd<00:05:47.790> get<00:05:48.060> back<00:05:48.300> nothing<00:05:48.960> on<00:05:49.139> that

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
I'd get back nothing on that

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.530 
I'd get back nothing on that
there<00:05:51.180> it<00:05:51.270> goes<00:05:53.330> there<00:05:54.330> goes<00:05:54.389> the<00:05:54.750> cable

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
there it goes there goes the cable

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:05.150 
there it goes there goes the cable
winding<00:05:57.540> up<00:05:57.720> winding<00:05:58.320> up<00:05:59.210> there<00:06:00.210> she<00:06:00.600> is

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:52.189 

Sam<00:06:06.160> run

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:54.689 

or<00:06:52.650> 24

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:54.699 
or 24

00:06:54.699 --> 00:07:05.820 
or 24
last<00:06:55.210> the<00:06:55.479> standard<00:06:56.020> time

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.830 

Oh
