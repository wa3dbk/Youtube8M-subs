00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.509 
think they should be happy because their
bodies<00:03:25.410> are<00:03:25.440> looking<00:03:25.739> much<00:03:25.950> better<00:03:26.160> with<00:03:26.400> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
morphed bodies than the original bodies

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.690 
morphed bodies than the original bodies
so<00:03:28.350> they<00:03:28.380> should<00:03:28.769> be<00:03:28.799> really<00:03:29.100> cool<00:03:29.250> about<00:03:29.519> it

so they should be really cool about it

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.030 
so they should be really cool about it
and<00:03:29.850> they<00:03:29.970> shouldn't<00:03:30.239> complain<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:31.040> enjoy
