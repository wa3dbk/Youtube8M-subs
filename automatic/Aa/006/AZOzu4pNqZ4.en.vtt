00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.850 
first pack are the first pack I did I
think<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> got<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.899> stormtrooper<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.439> clone

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
think I got the stormtrooper and clone

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.499 
think I got the stormtrooper and clone
trooper<00:01:44.189> there<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.030> that's<00:01:45.149> why<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.299> couldn't

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
trooper there so that's why I couldn't

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.789 
trooper there so that's why I couldn't
find<00:01:45.720> because<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.259> never<00:01:46.320> flip<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.740> thing

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
find because I never flip this thing

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.080 
find because I never flip this thing
over<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> see<00:01:47.490> all<00:01:47.579> these<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> back

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.180 
is looks like a Boba Fett very nice and
also<00:02:27.140> somebody<00:02:27.320> realized<00:02:27.770> from<00:02:27.890> watching

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
also somebody realized from watching

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.250 
also somebody realized from watching
other<00:02:28.370> videos<00:02:28.460> actually<00:02:29.120> now<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.930> know<00:02:30.050> they

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
other videos actually now I know they

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.840 
other videos actually now I know they
all<00:02:30.380> have<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.740> little<00:02:31.130> hole<00:02:31.460> on<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.640> bottom

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
all have the little hole on the bottom

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.580 
all have the little hole on the bottom
like<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.000> for<00:02:32.720> pencil<00:02:32.990> toppers<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.350> stuff

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
like that for pencil toppers and stuff

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.710 
like that for pencil toppers and stuff
but<00:02:34.520> I<00:02:34.550> didn't<00:02:34.880> know<00:02:34.940> us<00:02:35.060> though<00:02:35.240> is<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.510> you

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
but I didn't know us though is that you

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.320 
but I didn't know us though is that you
can<00:02:35.840> actually<00:02:35.960> use<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:38.030> can<00:02:38.180> have

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
can actually use that and you can have

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.050 
can actually use that and you can have
to<00:02:38.450> attach<00:02:38.690> them<00:02:38.960> to<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.230> pod<00:02:39.440> like<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.250> so

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
to attach them to the pod like so so

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.690 
to attach them to the pod like so so
that's<00:02:41.180> kind<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.450> neat<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.890> can't<00:02:43.310> tap<00:02:43.520> them

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
that's kind of neat you can't tap them

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.650 
that's kind of neat you can't tap them
on<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.790> inside<00:02:44.150> though<00:02:44.300> what<00:02:44.420> you're<00:02:44.510> making

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
on the inside though what you're making

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.870 
on the inside though what you're making
more<00:02:44.900> sense<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.200> me<00:02:45.350> just<00:02:45.560> because<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:46.640> kind<00:02:46.850> of

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
more sense to me just because it kind of

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.460 
more sense to me just because it kind of
lets<00:02:47.090> out<00:02:47.210> you<00:02:47.300> can<00:02:47.450> spin<00:02:47.780> them<00:02:47.870> when<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.320> have

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
lets out you can spin them when you have

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.680 
lets out you can spin them when you have
on<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.710> side<00:02:48.950> cuz<00:02:49.460> that<00:02:50.060> just<00:02:50.270> makes<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.570> very

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
on the side cuz that just makes it very

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.290 
on the side cuz that just makes it very
oblong<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.380> they<00:02:52.160> can't<00:02:52.430> stand<00:02:52.700> up<00:02:52.850> like<00:02:53.060> that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
oblong and they can't stand up like that

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.260 
oblong and they can't stand up like that
so<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.590> guess<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.640> only<00:02:55.760> reason<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.060> do<00:02:56.240> that

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
so I guess the only reason you do that

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.180 
so I guess the only reason you do that
is<00:02:56.450> because<00:02:56.750> if<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.380> take<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.680> off<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:57.830> can

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
is because if you take it off you can

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.340 
is because if you take it off you can
kinda<00:02:58.700> use<00:02:58.790> as<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.030> just<00:02:59.209> displaced<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.110> for

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
kinda use as this just displaced and for

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.190 
kinda use as this just displaced and for
them<00:03:00.470> so<00:03:01.130> although<00:03:02.120> on<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.300> other<00:03:02.510> end<00:03:02.870> it's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
them so although on the other end it's

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.100 
them so although on the other end it's
smaller<00:03:03.680> which<00:03:04.280> oh<00:03:04.520> I<00:03:05.060> guess<00:03:05.690> actually<00:03:05.840> works

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
smaller which oh I guess actually works

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.570 
smaller which oh I guess actually works
for<00:03:06.140> there<00:03:06.320> ones<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:07.250> that's<00:03:07.370> probably

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
for there ones so that's probably

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.910 
for there ones so that's probably
purpose<00:03:07.940> then<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.330> it<00:03:09.110> actually<00:03:09.380> says<00:03:09.590> Star

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
purpose then and it actually says Star

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.810 
purpose then and it actually says Star
Wars<00:03:10.130> right<00:03:10.340> on<00:03:10.490> it

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
Wars right on it

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.610 
Wars right on it
so<00:03:11.330> you<00:03:11.420> can<00:03:11.540> actually<00:03:11.630> use<00:03:11.840> those<00:03:11.990> first<00:03:12.440> and

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
so you can actually use those first and

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.280 
so you can actually use those first and
then<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:13.040> did<00:03:13.580> not<00:03:13.700> realize<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:15.080> in<00:03:15.170> that

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
then I did not realize that so in that

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.290 
then I did not realize that so in that
case<00:03:15.530> when<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.310> actually<00:03:16.520> sell<00:03:16.820> these<00:03:16.940> singles

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
case when I actually sell these singles

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.120 
case when I actually sell these singles
I'll<00:03:17.480> probably<00:03:17.720> include<00:03:18.140> one<00:03:18.470> half<00:03:18.709> of<00:03:18.920> the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
I'll probably include one half of the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.130 
I'll probably include one half of the
pod<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.610> go<00:03:19.760> with<00:03:19.940> each<00:03:20.060> one<00:03:20.300> so<00:03:20.989> that<00:03:21.110> you

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
pod to go with each one so that you

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.890 
pod to go with each one so that you
actually<00:03:21.590> get<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.489> stand<00:03:22.850> now<00:03:23.570> this<00:03:23.690> is<00:03:23.810> our

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
actually get a stand now this is our

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.180 
actually get a stand now this is our
first<00:03:24.320> pack<00:03:24.470> though<00:03:24.680> they<00:03:24.860> had<00:03:24.950> different

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
first pack though they had different

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.610 
first pack though they had different
they<00:03:25.970> both<00:03:26.150> have<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.360> larger<00:03:26.720> holes<00:03:26.900> which

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
they both have the larger holes which

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.350 
they both have the larger holes which
means<00:03:27.860> only<00:03:28.340> one<00:03:28.700> of<00:03:28.790> them<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.000> gonna<00:03:29.120> really

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
means only one of them is gonna really

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.229 
means only one of them is gonna really
work<00:03:29.630> so<00:03:30.250> I'll<00:03:31.250> try<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.550> match<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:31.790> up<00:03:32.030> for<00:03:32.180> you

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
work so I'll try to match it up for you

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.780 
work so I'll try to match it up for you
guys<00:03:32.269> going<00:03:32.750> forward<00:03:33.140> or<00:03:33.560> if<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.310> saw<00:03:34.610> these

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
guys going forward or if I saw these

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.020 
guys going forward or if I saw these
individually<00:03:35.660> like<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:36.290> guys<00:03:36.410> get<00:03:36.680> a

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
individually like that so you guys get a

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.400 
individually like that so you guys get a
half<00:03:38.030> of<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.209> pod<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.600> works<00:03:38.930> with<00:03:39.200> the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
half of a pod that works with the

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.770 
half of a pod that works with the
corresponding<00:03:40.070> figure<00:03:40.250> but<00:03:40.610> no<00:03:41.300> guarantees

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
corresponding figure but no guarantees

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.449 
corresponding figure but no guarantees
on<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:42.170> since<00:03:42.500> they<00:03:42.680> apparently<00:03:42.860> don't<00:03:43.280> give

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
on that since they apparently don't give

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.140 
on that since they apparently don't give
you<00:03:43.580> one<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:43.820> each<00:03:43.970> size<00:03:44.239> per<00:03:44.570> pack<00:03:45.670> so<00:03:46.670> moving

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
you one of each size per pack so moving

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.120 
you one of each size per pack so moving
it<00:03:47.239> along<00:03:47.330> here<00:03:47.690> okay<00:03:48.350> I'm<00:03:48.470> doing<00:03:48.560> four<00:03:48.890> packs

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
it along here okay I'm doing four packs

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.979 
it along here okay I'm doing four packs
in<00:03:49.340> this<00:03:49.430> video<00:03:49.670> P<00:03:50.060> about<00:03:50.239> five<00:03:50.480> minutes<00:03:50.840> then

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
in this video P about five minutes then

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.590 
in this video P about five minutes then
probably<00:03:51.519> so<00:03:52.519> here's<00:03:52.700> our<00:03:52.820> pod<00:03:53.060> we'll<00:03:53.300> open

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
probably so here's our pod we'll open

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.630 
probably so here's our pod we'll open
that<00:03:53.810> up<00:03:53.959> right<00:03:54.110> away<00:03:54.230> for<00:03:54.800> displaced<00:03:55.340> and

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
that up right away for displaced and

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.600 
that up right away for displaced and
purposes<00:03:56.110> and<00:03:57.110> we've<00:03:57.320> got<00:03:57.830> it's<00:03:58.459> like<00:03:58.580> a

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
purposes and we've got it's like a

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.060 
purposes and we've got it's like a
different<00:03:58.880> Jango<00:03:59.540> Fett<00:03:59.810> that<00:04:00.709> one's<00:04:00.890> got<00:04:01.040> the

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
different Jango Fett that one's got the

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.530 
different Jango Fett that one's got the
bigger<00:04:01.430> hole<00:04:01.640> as<00:04:01.820> well<00:04:03.010> and<00:04:04.010> our<00:04:04.519> other<00:04:04.940> figure

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
bigger hole as well and our other figure

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.370 
bigger hole as well and our other figure
for<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:05.810> pack<00:04:06.050> is<00:04:06.769> that<00:04:07.010> another<00:04:07.310> Chewbacca

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
for this pack is that another Chewbacca

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.440 
for this pack is that another Chewbacca
which<00:04:09.380> also<00:04:09.650> has<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:09.890> bigger<00:04:10.130> hole<00:04:10.340> still<00:04:10.670> not

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
which also has the bigger hole still not

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.270 
which also has the bigger hole still not
sure<00:04:11.630> what<00:04:11.989> percentage<00:04:12.680> of<00:04:12.769> them<00:04:12.920> have<00:04:12.950> the

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
sure what percentage of them have the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.039 
sure what percentage of them have the
bigger<00:04:13.430> holes<00:04:13.580> versus<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.239> smaller<00:04:14.570> holes<00:04:14.840> to

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
bigger holes versus the smaller holes to

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.560 
bigger holes versus the smaller holes to
attach<00:04:15.140> there<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.459> maybe<00:04:16.609> yeah<00:04:16.910> I'll<00:04:17.390> put<00:04:17.540> a

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
attach there so maybe yeah I'll put a

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.449 
attach there so maybe yeah I'll put a
bunch<00:04:17.810> of<00:04:17.930> them<00:04:18.080> maybe<00:04:18.620> about<00:04:18.890> half<00:04:19.190> and<00:04:19.430> half

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
bunch of them maybe about half and half

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.370 
bunch of them maybe about half and half
work<00:04:20.060> out<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.600> then<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:20.780> can<00:04:20.930> actually<00:04:21.049> match

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
work out and then you can actually match

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.050 
work out and then you can actually match
them<00:04:21.560> up<00:04:21.620> right<00:04:21.859> so<00:04:22.550> you<00:04:22.610> know<00:04:22.700> I'll<00:04:22.760> get<00:04:22.880> some

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
them up right so you know I'll get some

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.520 
them up right so you know I'll get some
tax<00:04:23.240> they<00:04:23.419> have<00:04:23.450> two<00:04:23.810> figures<00:04:24.169> with<00:04:24.380> the

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
tax they have two figures with the

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.070 
tax they have two figures with the
smaller<00:04:24.800> hole<00:04:25.160> on<00:04:25.820> the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
smaller hole on the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.990 
smaller hole on the
but<00:04:27.180> we'll<00:04:28.180> see<00:04:28.419> all<00:04:28.750> in<00:04:28.990> due<00:04:29.080> time<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.530> suppose

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
but we'll see all in due time I suppose

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.640 
but we'll see all in due time I suppose
