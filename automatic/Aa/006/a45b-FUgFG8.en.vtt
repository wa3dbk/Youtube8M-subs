hey guys this is Cara bonanni from Obi
scrub<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.380> I'm<00:00:10.590> here<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.889> talk<00:00:11.010> about<00:00:11.190> some<00:00:11.490> of

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
scrub and I'm here to talk about some of

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.339 
scrub and I'm here to talk about some of
the<00:00:11.730> tips<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.090> tricks<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.599> galaxy<00:00:12.990> s5

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
the tips and tricks of the galaxy s5

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.310 
the tips and tricks of the galaxy s5
which<00:00:13.889> are<00:00:14.040> lesser<00:00:14.429> known<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:15.030> most<00:00:15.360> people<00:00:15.809> so

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
which are lesser known to most people so

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.180 
which are lesser known to most people so
let's<00:00:16.500> get<00:00:16.590> on<00:00:16.740> with<00:00:16.770> it

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
let's get on with it

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.310 
let's get on with it
so<00:00:18.000> people<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.420> been<00:00:18.480> going<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.230> on

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
so people have been going on and on

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.689 
so people have been going on and on
about<00:00:19.350> ultra<00:00:19.859> power<00:00:20.070> saving<00:00:20.189> mode<00:00:20.670> which

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
about ultra power saving mode which

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.460 
about ultra power saving mode which
basically<00:00:21.180> puts<00:00:21.480> everything<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.080> black<00:00:22.289> and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
basically puts everything to black and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.460 
basically puts everything to black and
white<00:00:22.500> with<00:00:22.769> limited<00:00:23.340> access<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:24.330> apps<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:25.350> we

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
white with limited access to apps but we

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.720 
white with limited access to apps but we
keep<00:00:25.650> forgetting<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.099> there<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.400> still<00:00:26.609> a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
keep forgetting that there is still a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.120 
keep forgetting that there is still a
power<00:00:26.939> saving<00:00:27.480> mode<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.439> has<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.830> really

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
power saving mode and it has a really

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.759 
power saving mode and it has a really
nice<00:00:29.460> feature<00:00:29.849> built<00:00:30.300> into<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.929> that's

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
nice feature built into it and that's

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.430 
nice feature built into it and that's
grayscale<00:00:32.579> mode<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.329> basically<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.989> just<00:00:34.020> puts

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
grayscale mode so basically it just puts

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.750 
grayscale mode so basically it just puts
your<00:00:34.559> phone<00:00:34.800> into<00:00:35.040> black<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.250> white<00:00:35.430> mode

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
your phone into black and white mode

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.090 
your phone into black and white mode
saving<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> lot<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.780> battery<00:00:37.140> but<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.829> still

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
saving you a lot of battery but it still

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.340 
saving you a lot of battery but it still
gives<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.460> access<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.149> all<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.600> apps

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
gives you access to all the apps

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.139 
gives you access to all the apps
unlike<00:00:40.680> powers<00:00:41.100> ultra<00:00:41.430> power<00:00:41.579> saving<00:00:41.730> mode

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
unlike powers ultra power saving mode

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.420 
unlike powers ultra power saving mode
where<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.899> only<00:00:43.140> get<00:00:43.350> access<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.950> very<00:00:44.309> very

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
where you only get access to very very

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.479 
where you only get access to very very
limited<00:00:45.030> apps<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:46.530> second<00:00:46.860> tip<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.039> about<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
limited apps the second tip is about the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.610 
limited apps the second tip is about the
fingerprint<00:00:48.180> scanner<00:00:48.360> now<00:00:49.170> when<00:00:49.469> you're

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
fingerprint scanner now when you're

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.410 
fingerprint scanner now when you're
setting<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.010> up<00:00:50.129> ensure<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:51.030> setting

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
setting it up ensure that you're setting

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.959 
setting it up ensure that you're setting
it<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> same<00:00:52.140> way<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.469> want<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.430> swipe<00:00:53.699> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it up the same way you want to swipe it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.000 
it up the same way you want to swipe it
it<00:00:54.360> really<00:00:54.899> makes<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.230> easy<00:00:55.469> because<00:00:55.680> you're

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
it really makes it easy because you're

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.410 
it really makes it easy because you're
probably<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> unlock<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.090> using<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
probably going to unlock it using a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.479 
probably going to unlock it using a
single<00:00:57.690> hand<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.500> easier<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.190> do<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.460> in

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
single hand and it's easier to do it in

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.160 
single hand and it's easier to do it in
a<00:00:59.699> tilted<00:01:00.090> fashion<00:01:00.539> than<00:01:00.750> keeping<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
a tilted fashion than keeping it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.900 
a tilted fashion than keeping it
straight<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.770> then<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.370> know<00:01:02.460> placing<00:01:02.820> your

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
straight and then you know placing your

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.780 
straight and then you know placing your
finger<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> center<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:05.040> native<00:01:05.369> keyboard

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
finger in the center the native keyboard

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.130 
finger in the center the native keyboard
as<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> stock<00:01:06.180> keyboard<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.689> comes<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
as a stock keyboard that comes with the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.890 
as a stock keyboard that comes with the
s5<00:01:07.470> has<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.680> really<00:01:08.040> neat<00:01:08.250> trick<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.640> its<00:01:08.729> sleeve

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
s5 has a really neat trick up its sleeve

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.649 
s5 has a really neat trick up its sleeve
just<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.710> tap<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.280> hold<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.790> numbers

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
just you know tap and hold the numbers

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.670 
just you know tap and hold the numbers
so<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> could<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.560> or<00:01:13.770> two<00:01:14.400> or<00:01:14.970> three

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
so it could be one or two or three

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.350 
so it could be one or two or three

anything and you can have customized
messages<00:01:19.610> pre-loaded<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.729> shortcuts<00:01:21.240> onto

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
messages pre-loaded as shortcuts onto

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.140 
messages pre-loaded as shortcuts onto
these<00:01:21.900> numbers<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.030> know

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
these numbers so it really you know

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.550 
these numbers so it really you know
there's<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.750> couple<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.049> messages<00:01:25.200> that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
there's just a couple of messages that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.340 
there's just a couple of messages that
you're<00:01:25.680> always<00:01:26.130> typing<00:01:27.020> regularly<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you're always typing regularly so it

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
until number 9 and 0 of course as well

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.109 
until number 9 and 0 of course as well
the<00:01:43.110> other<00:01:43.290> thing<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.649> comes<00:01:44.070> with<00:01:44.909> the
