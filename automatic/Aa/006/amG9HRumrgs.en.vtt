00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
 let's see how they are going to make you dance 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:17.070
 well I guess there will be no part 3 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.610
 nothing lie here I leave a part of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.610
 episode 3 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.439
 do not 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:45.400
 the pain 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:49.750
 that your horns hurt that my body does not 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:55.650
 was not be silly 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.650
 I remember it went oh god 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.850
 it's going to be very good 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.840
 at some point in 2014 that is what 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.909
 was 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.619
 You see the martyr constants he says- 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.000
 yesterday the dishes and good guys this was 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.740
 a small part of the building three 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.810
 of the adventures of my little parody 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.429
 the adventures of pepe made by feels 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.259
 life so no guys have already left the 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:22.960
 first part of episode 3 only 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.209
 I have a small problem with this in the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.100
 wall in part 3 comes out a small 

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:28.719
 musical number in which I do not have the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.819
 instrumental the instrumental I do not know in 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.890
 where is it and I think it's a song that 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.390
 met office live so the guys 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.759
 send a small message to pills live 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.189
 that if I could do two things one is 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.429
 that you could give me permission to do it 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.709
 the dubbing of a third of the 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.360
 adventures of the ping and that could be 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:48.880
 think the instrumental I do not know if I want 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.380
 guys but well then I ask you too 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.179
 your support just like I did with the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.549
 great facebook song that they can 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.079
 I do not know a little help asking him 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.729
 by sending a message a comment on 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.319
 any of your videos that you can 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.789
 lend instrumental since I want 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.939
 fold the series for you many 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.469
 they love it and it could be the 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.479
 song like that without having to lend him this 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.299
 but it would sound very ugly the audio and the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.349
 I really like to bring you 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:14.180
 quality I like to have the videos of 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.010
 quality and then do this little 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.750
 small dubbing for these videos that I 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.430
 they love it so much so one guys 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.189
 I would greatly appreciate your support if you can go 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.659
 the channel it is not something one way 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.489
 contact you after you can 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.409
 ask or something like a hashtag 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.650
 lends the audio to dishwasher something like that 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.639
 but in English since he speaks English 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.560
 Well, let's see if we can get that 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.389
 it seems the instrumental of that song and 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.680
 since I can do the video guys 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.489
 because I really want to make the video 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.739
 for you 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.480
 so now I do not entertain those from there 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.120
 more we were distracted whatever it is guys 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.560
 so well let's hope it can be 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.329
 do something about it but guys 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.579
 good if you do not leave me in the third part 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.500
 Well, I'll let you know, we hope so 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.239
 guys so for my part only my 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.769
