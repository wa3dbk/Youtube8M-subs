the<00:02:51.799> game<00:02:51.829> though<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.340> think<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.819> lot<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.030> these

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
the game though I think a lot of these

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.130 
the game though I think a lot of these
people<00:02:53.269> are<00:02:53.450> just<00:02:53.480> BOTS<00:02:53.780> for<00:02:53.989> other

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
people are just BOTS for other

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.839 
people are just BOTS for other
characters<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.980> population<00:02:55.579> is<00:02:55.640> probably

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
characters so the population is probably

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:56.800 
characters so the population is probably
like<00:02:55.970> half<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:56.450> number

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
like half that number

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.390 
like half that number
and<00:02:57.019> really<00:02:57.230> what<00:02:57.380> made<00:02:57.590> this<00:02:57.739> game<00:02:57.920> so<00:02:58.220> great

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
and really what made this game so great

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.650 
and really what made this game so great
in<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:58.640> olden<00:02:58.940> days<00:02:58.970> was<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.329> people<00:02:59.569> you
