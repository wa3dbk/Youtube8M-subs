in that rock to and if there's none in
there<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.580> want<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.790> head<00:01:24.060> down<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
there you want to head down here and

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.020 
there you want to head down here and
then<00:01:25.350> check<00:01:25.619> out<00:01:25.770> down<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.549> top<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.970> these

then check out down on on top of these

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.969 
then check out down on on top of these
crates<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.600> stuff<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.080> there's<00:01:28.770> none

crates and stuff like that there's none
in<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.240> want<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.450> go<00:01:30.630> over<00:01:31.320> here

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
in here then you want to go over here

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.480 
in here then you want to go over here
and<00:01:32.270> then<00:01:33.270> sometimes<00:01:33.560> will<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:34.860> rate<00:01:35.280> in

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and then sometimes will be one rate in

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.130 
and then sometimes will be one rate in
this<00:01:35.610> corner<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.060> year<00:01:36.299> or<00:01:36.450> they'll<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:36.990> one

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
this corner a year or they'll be one

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.590 
this corner a year or they'll be one
right<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.710> or<00:01:38.490> there<00:01:39.090> could<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.240> some

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
right there and there's not usually you

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.120 
right there and there's not usually you
find<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.030> lot<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.390> them<00:01:42.509> over<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.710> where<00:01:44.040> I'm

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
find a lot of them over here where I'm

find a lot of them over here where I'm
going<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> show<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.490> next<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.240> then<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.720> want

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
going to show you next but then you want

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.289 
going to show you next but then you want
to<00:01:45.930> head<00:01:46.200> down<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.270> then<00:01:48.270> sometimes

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
to head down here and then sometimes

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.969 
to head down here and then sometimes
they'll<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:48.960> top<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.229> these<00:01:49.380> crates<00:01:49.740> again

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
they'll be on top of these crates again

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.410 
they'll be on top of these crates again
or<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.490> corners<00:01:50.880> or<00:01:51.030> stuff<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.360> that

there's none in here yet because usually

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.819 
there's none in here yet because usually
a<00:01:53.880> lot<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.390> them<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.659> I've<00:01:54.840> seen<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.409> spawn

a lot of them that I've seen the spawn

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.959 
a lot of them that I've seen the spawn
over<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.460> other<00:01:56.610> purpose

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
over here in this other purpose

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.130 
over here in this other purpose
sometimes<00:01:57.149> will<00:01:57.479> spawn<00:01:57.689> over<00:01:57.869> here<00:01:57.990> like<00:01:58.110> a

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
sometimes will spawn over here like a

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.870 
sometimes will spawn over here like a
Fed<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> couple<00:01:58.649> right<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:58.799> one<00:01:59.430> right<00:01:59.640> there

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
Fed a couple right here one right there

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.030 
Fed a couple right here one right there
some<00:02:00.450> down<00:02:00.630> there<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.020> stuff<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.770> but

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
some down there and stuff like that but

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.440 
some down there and stuff like that but
most<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.430> them<00:02:02.520> spawn<00:02:02.909> over<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.299> area

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
most of them spawn over in this area

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.270 
most of them spawn over in this area
right<00:02:03.780> here<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.500> want<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.799> get<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.040> your

right here so you want to get on your

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.920 
right here so you want to get on your
bike<00:02:05.490> or<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:05.969> run<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.600> you

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
bike or you can just run here and you

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
bike or you can just run here and you
want<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.140> go<00:02:07.320> over<00:02:07.439> here<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.680> there's<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
want to go over here and there's a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.279 
want to go over here and there's a
little<00:02:08.039> k<00:02:08.310> right<00:02:08.520> here<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.539> then<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.110> want<00:02:10.170> to

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
little k right here and then you want to

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.440 
little k right here and then you want to
go<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.800> usually<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.270> that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
go in it and usually this one that

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.790 
go in it and usually this one that
spawns<00:02:12.750> right<00:02:13.050> here<00:02:13.290> but

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
spawns right here but

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.380 
spawns right here but
I<00:02:13.830> think<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.310> got<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:14.730> over<00:02:14.850> there<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.240> not

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
I think I got that one over there is not

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.630 
I think I got that one over there is not
going<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.570> be<00:02:15.660> one<00:02:15.810> over<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.470> cave<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:16.950> so

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
going to be one over in this cave and so

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.760 
going to be one over in this cave and so
all<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.850> other<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.120> actually<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.170> here's<00:02:19.560> one

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
all the other is actually so here's one

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.020 
all the other is actually so here's one
another<00:02:20.010> one<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.490> where<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.670> lot<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.850> them

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
another one this is where a lot of them

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.550 
another one this is where a lot of them
spawn<00:02:21.330> as<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.570> guys<00:02:21.660> can<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:21.960> got<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.290> relic

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
spawn as you guys can see I got to relic

iron<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.040> gun<00:02:23.250> then<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.640> probably<00:02:23.910> don't<00:02:24.120> need

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
iron in a gun then I probably don't need

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.000 
iron in a gun then I probably don't need
but<00:02:24.870> then<00:02:24.990> we're<00:02:25.110> gonna<00:02:25.200> hop<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.500> here<00:02:25.800> and

sometimes will spawn up here and
sometimes<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.840> won't<00:02:27.990> usually<00:02:28.680> only<00:02:28.950> get<00:02:29.160> to

crate<00:03:11.610> stew<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.090> Mars<00:03:12.300> I've<00:03:12.570> got<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.840> couple<00:03:13.140> of

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
crate stew in Mars I've got a couple of

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.780 
crate stew in Mars I've got a couple of
them<00:03:13.470> they're<00:03:13.620> rare<00:03:13.920> though<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.640> don't

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
them they're rare though so you don't

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.430 
them they're rare though so you don't
get<00:03:14.880> mms<00:03:15.030> often<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.020> get<00:03:16.140> them<00:03:16.260> every

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
get mms often but you get them every

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.229 
get mms often but you get them every
once<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:16.800> while<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.340> also<00:03:17.520> need<00:03:17.790> those<00:03:17.940> but

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
once in a while so I also need those but

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.210 
once in a while so I also need those but
I<00:03:18.300> would<00:03:18.420> really<00:03:18.959> need<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.350> relic<00:03:19.739> iron<00:03:19.980> and

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
I would really need a relic iron and

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.520 
I would really need a relic iron and
that's<00:03:20.520> what<00:03:20.640> I'm<00:03:20.700> going<00:03:20.910> for<00:03:21.000> right<00:03:21.300> now<00:03:21.530> so

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
that's what I'm going for right now so

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.960 
that's what I'm going for right now so
let's<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.830> they<00:03:23.010> probably<00:03:23.220> be<00:03:23.400> easiest<00:03:23.820> to

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
let's just they probably be easiest to

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.970 
let's just they probably be easiest to
weight<00:03:24.180> fastest<00:03:24.780> way<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.380> get<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.560> bunch<00:03:25.830> of

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
weight fastest way to get a bunch of

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.560 
weight fastest way to get a bunch of
relic<00:03:26.310> iron<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.700> stuff<00:03:26.940> like<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.120> for<00:03:27.450> you

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
relic iron and stuff like that for you

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.890 

all<00:03:38.700> right<00:03:38.909> now<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.090> mean<00:03:39.299> I'm<00:03:39.359> gonna<00:03:39.510> hop<00:03:39.689> on<00:03:39.870> my

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
all right now I mean I'm gonna hop on my

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.750 
all right now I mean I'm gonna hop on my
bike<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.499> then<00:03:41.189> you<00:03:41.280> can<00:03:41.400> just<00:03:41.489> keep<00:03:41.609> your

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
bike and then you can just keep your

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.520 
bike and then you can just keep your
doing<00:03:41.999> this<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.239> doing<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.599> as<00:03:42.810> much<00:03:43.379> as<00:03:43.409> you

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
doing this in doing this as much as you

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.440 
doing this in doing this as much as you
want<00:03:43.739> just<00:03:43.829> keep<00:03:44.099> swapping<00:03:44.340> servers<00:03:44.909> usually

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
want just keep swapping servers usually

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.709 
want just keep swapping servers usually
this<00:03:45.599> round<00:03:45.870> two<00:03:46.109> or<00:03:46.170> three<00:03:46.530> lucre<00:03:47.569> in<00:03:48.569> this

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:48.719 
this round two or three lucre in this

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.660 
this round two or three lucre in this
area<00:03:48.989> but<00:03:49.439> it's<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.620> fastest<00:03:49.980> way<00:03:50.129> because<00:03:50.459> I

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
area but it's a fastest way because I

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.520 
area but it's a fastest way because I
really<00:03:50.999> don't<00:03:51.150> know<00:03:51.209> any<00:03:51.480> other<00:03:51.540> like<00:03:51.959> routes

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
really don't know any other like routes

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.899 
really don't know any other like routes
you<00:03:52.739> can<00:03:52.799> take<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:53.280> mean<00:03:53.310> there's<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.670> bunch<00:03:53.849> of

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
you can take I mean there's a bunch of

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.550 
you can take I mean there's a bunch of
them<00:03:54.000> spread<00:03:54.420> out<00:03:54.510> all<00:03:54.689> across<00:03:54.719> map<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.349> but

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
them spread out all across map it but

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.349 
them spread out all across map it but
this<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:55.739> like<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.459> main<00:03:56.790> one<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.239> want

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
this is like the main one that you want

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.059 
this is like the main one that you want
to<00:03:57.450> go<00:03:57.599> to<00:03:57.659> so<00:03:58.019> let's<00:03:58.170> check<00:03:58.439> down<00:03:58.590> here<00:03:58.620> again

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
to go to so let's check down here again

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.379 
to go to so let's check down here again
nothing<00:04:00.060> here<00:04:00.299> let's<00:04:00.629> check<00:04:00.719> up<00:04:01.200> top<00:04:02.389> nothing

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
nothing here let's check up top nothing

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.270 
nothing here let's check up top nothing
up<00:04:03.510> top<00:04:03.689> and<00:04:03.989> then<00:04:04.230> nothing<00:04:04.739> over<00:04:04.829> there<00:04:05.040> art

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
up top and then nothing over there art

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.509 
up top and then nothing over there art
we're<00:04:05.819> going<00:04:05.939> to<00:04:06.000> check<00:04:06.269> down<00:04:06.480> here<00:04:07.519> once

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
we're going to check down here once

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.890 
we're going to check down here once
again<00:04:08.609> not<00:04:08.849> a<00:04:08.879> lot<00:04:08.939> of<00:04:09.150> them<00:04:09.209> spawn<00:04:09.629> in<00:04:09.750> here

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
again not a lot of them spawn in here

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.149 
again not a lot of them spawn in here
sometimes<00:04:10.290> you'll<00:04:10.469> get<00:04:10.560> lucky<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.010> they'll
