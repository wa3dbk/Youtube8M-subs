of got pulled off
normally<00:02:58.890> when<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.070> Mantis<00:02:59.520> is<00:02:59.640> alive<00:03:00.060> even<00:03:00.420> if

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
normally when a Mantis is alive even if

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.550 
normally when a Mantis is alive even if
they<00:03:01.020> have<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.470> thing<00:03:01.739> right<00:03:01.950> there

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
they have that thing right there

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.590 
they have that thing right there
they<00:03:04.560> occasionally<00:03:04.890> will<00:03:05.459> lose<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.209> that

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
they occasionally will lose it and that

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
they won't die from losing it

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.340 
they won't die from losing it
however<00:03:08.970> they<00:03:09.180> may<00:03:09.330> have<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.570> little<00:03:09.870> bit<00:03:10.080> of

however they may have a little bit of
problem<00:03:10.770> climbing<00:03:11.310> however<00:03:11.700> they<00:03:11.820> could<00:03:11.970> also

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
problem climbing however they could also

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.660 
problem climbing however they could also
just<00:03:12.420> use<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.930> claws<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.709> help<00:03:14.040> grip<00:03:14.489> on

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
just use the claws to help grip on

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.780 
just use the claws to help grip on
things<00:03:15.080> so<00:03:16.080> what<00:03:16.350> happens<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.250> strikes

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
things so what happens is it strikes

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.900 
things so what happens is it strikes
forward<00:03:19.070> focus<00:03:20.070> here<00:03:20.250> all<00:03:20.550> right<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.850> it

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
forward focus here all right and it

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.300 
forward focus here all right and it
strikes<00:03:21.180> forward<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.200> grabs<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:23.010> prey

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
strikes forward and it grabs the prey

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.250 
strikes forward and it grabs the prey
between<00:03:24.230> these<00:03:25.230> rows<00:03:25.830> of<00:03:26.250> spines<00:03:26.840> in<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.989> four

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
between these rows of spines in the four

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.310 
between these rows of spines in the four
limbs<00:03:29.000> there<00:03:30.000> are<00:03:30.090> some<00:03:30.330> right<00:03:30.540> here<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:31.080> some

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
limbs there are some right here and some

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.090 
limbs there are some right here and some
right<00:03:31.530> there<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:32.510> that<00:03:33.510> will<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.840> grasp<00:03:34.620> the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
right there and that will just grasp the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.300 
right there and that will just grasp the
prey<00:03:35.400> were<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.390> hard<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:36.959> sometimes<00:03:37.620> spines

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
prey were so hard that sometimes spines

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.199 
prey were so hard that sometimes spines
pierce<00:03:38.790> into<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:40.680> usually<00:03:41.190> kills<00:03:41.790> or

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
pierce into it and that usually kills or

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.320 
pierce into it and that usually kills or
at<00:03:42.810> least<00:03:43.110> injures<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.890> prey<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:45.030> stops

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
at least injures the prey and it stops

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.250 
at least injures the prey and it stops
it<00:03:45.510> from<00:03:45.540> escaping

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
it from escaping

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.699 
it from escaping
and<00:03:47.269> that's<00:03:48.269> how<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.570> claws<00:03:48.959> usually<00:03:49.500> work

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
and that's how the claws usually work

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.800 
and that's how the claws usually work
and<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.070> little<00:03:50.459> Tarsus<00:03:51.239> thing<00:03:51.450> over<00:03:51.780> here

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
and this little Tarsus thing over here

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.070 
and this little Tarsus thing over here
usually<00:03:52.140> just<00:03:52.530> folds<00:03:52.890> back<00:03:53.100> along<00:03:53.519> here<00:03:54.080> to

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
usually just folds back along here to

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.220 
usually just folds back along here to
avoid<00:03:55.500> getting<00:03:55.860> kicked<00:03:56.819> off<00:03:57.060> or<00:03:57.360> get<00:03:57.600> bitten

avoid getting kicked off or get bitten

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.300 
avoid getting kicked off or get bitten
off<00:03:58.410> or<00:03:58.740> chewed<00:03:58.980> off<00:03:59.160> by<00:03:59.190> the

although females like her she never flew

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.700 
although females like her she never flew
because<00:05:54.060> she's<00:05:55.060> so<00:05:55.270> heavy<00:05:55.600> her<00:05:55.870> abdomen<00:05:56.380> is<00:05:56.530> so

those are the wings of course and yeah
that's<00:06:29.080> a<00:06:29.440> about<00:06:29.980> how<00:06:30.310> a<00:06:31.200> Chinese<00:06:32.200> Mantid

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
that's a about how a Chinese Mantid

that's a about how a Chinese Mantid
looks<00:06:33.130> like<00:06:33.340> or<00:06:33.760> at<00:06:34.060> least<00:06:34.210> agree<00:06:34.480> are<00:06:34.810> not

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
looks like or at least agree are not

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.270 
looks like or at least agree are not
green<00:06:35.410> brown<00:06:35.740> color<00:06:36.070> form<00:06:36.430> is<00:06:37.110> so<00:06:38.110> they<00:06:39.100> all

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
green brown color form is so they all

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.790 
green brown color form is so they all
laid<00:06:39.580> eggs<00:06:39.820> they<00:06:40.420> had<00:06:40.570> a<00:06:40.600> pretty<00:06:40.870> nice<00:06:41.320> fun

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
laid eggs they had a pretty nice fun

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.560 
laid eggs they had a pretty nice fun
time<00:06:41.830> with<00:06:42.340> me

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 
time with me

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.280 
time with me
Sheri<00:06:44.290> and<00:06:44.850> Matilda<00:06:45.850> and<00:06:46.090> fearful<00:06:46.990> they<00:06:47.170> all

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
Sheri and Matilda and fearful they all

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.530 
Sheri and Matilda and fearful they all
had<00:06:47.500> a<00:06:47.530> really<00:06:47.890> good<00:06:48.070> time<00:06:48.310> although<00:06:48.730> in<00:06:49.300> the

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
had a really good time although in the

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.860 
had a really good time although in the
end<00:06:49.690> they<00:06:50.440> all<00:06:50.560> died<00:06:50.800> of<00:06:51.010> course<00:06:51.330> but<00:06:52.330> they

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
end they all died of course but they

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.300 
end they all died of course but they
were<00:06:52.930> not<00:06:53.590> as<00:06:53.830> unlucky<00:06:54.280> as<00:06:54.460> the<00:06:54.790> male's<00:06:55.120> that<00:06:55.450> I

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
were not as unlucky as the male's that I

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.200 
were not as unlucky as the male's that I
mated<00:06:57.310> with<00:06:57.340> them<00:06:57.970> all<00:06:58.360> the<00:06:58.630> male's<00:06:58.870> got<00:06:59.170> eaten

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.210 
mated with them all the male's got eaten

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.580 
mated with them all the male's got eaten
so<00:07:01.210> I<00:07:01.570> guess<00:07:02.140> it's<00:07:02.410> a<00:07:02.500> pretty<00:07:02.740> good<00:07:03.420> excuse<00:07:04.420> for

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
so I guess it's a pretty good excuse for

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.650 
so I guess it's a pretty good excuse for
cannibalism<00:07:06.090> eat<00:07:07.090> the<00:07:07.300> guys<00:07:07.510> all<00:07:07.990> right

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 
cannibalism eat the guys all right

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.700 
cannibalism eat the guys all right
that's<00:07:10.660> all<00:07:10.810> I<00:07:10.840> really<00:07:11.200> have<00:07:11.350> for<00:07:11.770> now<00:07:11.950> so<00:07:12.430> um

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
that's all I really have for now so um

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.270 
that's all I really have for now so um
not<00:07:14.710> too<00:07:14.860> bad<00:07:15.070> eh

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 
not too bad eh

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.500 
not too bad eh
Wow<00:07:16.110> it<00:07:17.110> was<00:07:17.350> a<00:07:17.380> little<00:07:17.770> bit<00:07:18.010> bad<00:07:18.970> it<00:07:19.300> was<00:07:19.480> a

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:19.510 
Wow it was a little bit bad it was a

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.800 
Wow it was a little bit bad it was a
little<00:07:20.020> bit<00:07:20.400> sad<00:07:21.400> and<00:07:21.790> everything<00:07:21.910> but<00:07:22.510> I

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:22.810 
little bit sad and everything but I

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.250 
little bit sad and everything but I
guess<00:07:23.170> it's<00:07:23.470> not<00:07:23.740> too<00:07:23.800> bad<00:07:24.670> I<00:07:25.210> was<00:07:25.690> expecting
