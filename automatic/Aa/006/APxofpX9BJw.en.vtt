 as a list of friends or can be 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.470
 be that we can already put together a 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.970
 patrol before you can not put together a 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.340
 patrol with many years but it was 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.230
 Random good is also the mode of 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.330
 challenge that is where your weapon is a 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.949

 maintenance sorry in the the 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.310
 update now the calibration of 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.060
 rifles increase of the year and all kinds of 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.240
 rifles specifically to damage damage to 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.510
 long range and other elements 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.640
 will greatly reduce what is screens or 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.770
 black since that screen is a black the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.050
 he really has me fucked up he has me like 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.670
 very much rage the truth that rubbing 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.280
 normally the possibility of 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.540
 disappearance of the crosshairs the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.300
 that really happened to me a lot when 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.070
 started a game they were already going to 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.970
 measure and the weapon was incomplete or 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.040
 it would be a bit weird 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.130
 a firing icon is added to the head 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.870
 in good low notifications 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.990
 fix in a problem this is this 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.780
 text team win lose from the 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.540
 flap appeared a very weird sign 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.980
 there or on top of each other the boredom 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.050
 to see is going to water a little everything that is 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.120
 the game to see what else I can 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.430
 talk here arrange to see build a 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.820
 lens problem some players 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.350
 they made use of the exploit or good everything 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.590
 what he did maybe in glee all those 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.930
 things 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.870

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.260
 fv code field of view that change the 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.260
 Option menu

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.549
 can do when writing files or droid in 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.349
 the chat window that for the users 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:28.800

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.720
 front line 90 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.210

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.150
 configuration to run at the point of 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.000
 dead of hosting and good 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.680

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.240
 after this update the truth 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.160
