00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
the points that are equidistant from

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.530 
the points that are equidistant from
both<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.859> x<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.160> y<00:00:05.279> axis<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.240> points

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
both the x and y axis and the points

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.810 
both the x and y axis and the points
that<00:00:06.600> are<00:00:06.750> 5<00:00:06.960> units<00:00:06.990> from<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.680> origin<00:00:07.919> labeled

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
that are 5 units from the origin labeled

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.759 
that are 5 units from the origin labeled
and<00:00:08.940> X<00:00:09.090> all<00:00:09.360> points<00:00:09.900> that<00:00:10.019> satisfy<00:00:10.050> both

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
and X all points that satisfy both

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.620 
and X all points that satisfy both
conditions<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.059> first<00:00:12.300> thing<00:00:12.360> I'm<00:00:12.509> going

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
conditions so the first thing I'm going

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.900 
conditions so the first thing I'm going
to<00:00:12.690> do<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:12.929> I'm<00:00:13.080> going<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.559> graph<00:00:13.830> out<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.370> axis

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
to do is I'm going to graph out the axis

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.130 
to do is I'm going to graph out the axis
the<00:00:15.150> x<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.480> y<00:00:15.570> axis<00:00:18.500> so<00:00:19.500> there<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.770> my<00:00:20.039> y-axis

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
the x and y axis so there is my y-axis

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.589 
the x and y axis so there is my y-axis
and<00:00:22.699> here's<00:00:23.699> my<00:00:23.910> x-axis<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:26.269> i'm<00:00:27.269> just<00:00:27.480> going

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and here's my x-axis and i'm just going

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.689 
and here's my x-axis and i'm just going
to<00:00:27.840> label<00:00:28.170> both<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.740> those<00:00:28.859> there's<00:00:29.250> my<00:00:29.519> why

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
to label both of those there's my why

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.020 
to label both of those there's my why
there's<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.260> X<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.800> then<00:00:32.489> I'm<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.880> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
there's the X and then I'm going to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.020 
there's the X and then I'm going to
highlight<00:00:33.450> some<00:00:34.230> things<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.489> word

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
highlight some things in this word

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.600 
highlight some things in this word
problem<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:37.829> first<00:00:38.100> highlight<00:00:38.460> that

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
problem here the first highlight that

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.819 
problem here the first highlight that
I'm<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.090> do<00:00:39.410> is<00:00:40.410> where<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.680> says

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
I'm going to do is where it says

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.240 
I'm going to do is where it says
equidistant<00:00:41.610> from<00:00:41.640> both<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.120> X<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.510> Y<00:00:42.660> axis

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
equidistant from both the X and Y axis

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.799 
equidistant from both the X and Y axis
now<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> locus<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.539> two

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
now this is going to be the locus of two

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.290 
now this is going to be the locus of two
intersecting<00:00:46.530> lines<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:47.039> y-axis<00:00:47.309> intersects

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
intersecting lines my y-axis intersects

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.619 
intersecting lines my y-axis intersects
my<00:00:48.480> x-axis<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.289> locus<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.629> two

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
my x-axis and the locus of two

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
my x-axis and the locus of two
intersecting<00:00:52.199> lines<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.219> angle<00:00:53.610> bisector

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
intersecting lines is the angle bisector

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.910 
intersecting lines is the angle bisector
of<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:56.340> angle<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.000> two<00:00:57.149> lines<00:00:57.360> form<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:58.649> let

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
of the angle the two lines form now let

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.209 
of the angle the two lines form now let
me<00:00:58.949> show<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.219> what<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.760> mean<00:01:00.859> it<00:01:01.859> needs<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.129> be

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
me show you what I mean it needs to be

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.650 
me show you what I mean it needs to be
equal<00:01:02.520> distance<00:01:02.910> from<00:01:02.940> both<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> X<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.539> Y

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.570 

here<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.540> point<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.010> equal<00:01:11.310> distance

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
here is the point that is equal distance

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.760 
here is the point that is equal distance
from<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> X<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.090> Y<00:01:12.180> axis<00:01:12.409> because<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.590> one

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
from the X and Y axis because it's one

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.050 
from the X and Y axis because it's one
away<00:01:13.950> from<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> lion<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.549> away<00:01:14.700> from<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.939> ex

away from the lion one away from the ex

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.960 
away from the lion one away from the ex
and<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.960> could<00:01:16.170> go<00:01:16.320> up<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> diagonal<00:01:17.369> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and I could go up at a diagonal and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.050 
and I could go up at a diagonal and
every<00:01:18.630> point<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.080> i<00:01:19.200> put<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.220> will<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
every point that i put here will be a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.030 
every point that i put here will be a
point<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.600> equal<00:01:21.930> distance<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.920> it's

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
point that's equal distance here it's

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.700 
point that's equal distance here it's
two<00:01:23.310> away<00:01:23.580> from<00:01:23.939> each<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.330> axis<00:01:24.720> here<00:01:25.530> it's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
two away from each of the axis here it's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.070 
two away from each of the axis here it's
three<00:01:25.979> away<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.939> forth<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.990> also

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
three away so on so forth and I can also

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.130 
three away so on so forth and I can also
go<00:01:28.439> down<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:28.950> direction<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:32.689> can<00:01:33.689> also<00:01:33.840> go

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
go down in this direction I can also go

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.380 
go down in this direction I can also go
into<00:01:34.350> quadrant<00:01:34.860> two<00:01:35.009> here<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.210> same

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
into quadrant two here and do the same

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.490 
into quadrant two here and do the same
thing<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:38.400> what's<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.030> happen<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.930> am

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
thing and what's going to happen is I am

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.240 
thing and what's going to happen is I am
going<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.659> two<00:01:42.659> lines<00:01:44.119> here<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:46.250> what

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
going to have two lines here and what

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.350 
going to have two lines here and what
they<00:01:47.430> do<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.700> they<00:01:48.320> bisect<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.530> angle<00:01:49.560> formed

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
they do is they bisect the angle formed

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.899 
they do is they bisect the angle formed
by<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.420> XY<00:01:52.020> axis<00:01:52.439> which<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.280> 90-degree

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
by the XY axis which is a 90-degree

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.120 
by the XY axis which is a 90-degree
angle<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> there's<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:57.619> line<00:01:58.619> down<00:01:58.920> there

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
angle so there's that line down there

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.679 
angle so there's that line down there
and<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.659> once<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.810> get<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.170> line<00:02:01.469> down<00:02:01.799> here

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
and then once I get this line down here

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.380 
and then once I get this line down here
we<00:02:03.689> are<00:02:04.020> representing<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.579> locus<00:02:06.119> that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
we are representing the locus that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.570 
we are representing the locus that
satisfies<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.680> condition<00:02:07.740> right<00:02:08.399> here

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
satisfies this condition right here

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.420 
satisfies this condition right here
equidistant<00:02:09.030> from<00:02:09.390> both<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.840> X<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.170> Y<00:02:10.289> axis

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
equidistant from both the X and Y axis

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.430 
equidistant from both the X and Y axis
now<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.489> tell<00:02:11.700> my<00:02:11.849> students<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.360> use<00:02:12.599> dot

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
now I tell my students to use dot

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440 
now I tell my students to use dot
lines<00:02:13.560> when<00:02:13.680> they<00:02:13.710> draw<00:02:13.920> their<00:02:13.980> locus<00:02:14.450> because

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
lines when they draw their locus because

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.290 
lines when they draw their locus because
that<00:02:15.720> will<00:02:15.810> help<00:02:15.960> you<00:02:16.140> not<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.740> mix<00:02:17.430> your<00:02:17.760> locus

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
that will help you not to mix your locus

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.290 
that will help you not to mix your locus
up<00:02:18.510> with<00:02:18.780> say<00:02:19.350> solid<00:02:20.130> lines<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.610> are<00:02:20.730> may

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
up with say solid lines that are may

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.570 
up with say solid lines that are may
represent<00:02:21.540> axes<00:02:22.260> or<00:02:22.440> other<00:02:22.920> lines<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.550> your

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
represent axes or other lines in your

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.060 
represent axes or other lines in your
problem<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.260> next<00:02:25.290> thing<00:02:25.590> I'm<00:02:25.800> going<00:02:25.830> to

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
problem so the next thing I'm going to

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.210 
problem so the next thing I'm going to
highlight<00:02:26.190> here<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:27.440> where<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.530> says<00:02:28.830> the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
highlight here is where it says the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.760 
highlight here is where it says the
points<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:30.330> are<00:02:30.510> 5<00:02:30.750> units<00:02:30.780> from<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.440> origin

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
points that are 5 units from the origin

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.370 
points that are 5 units from the origin
so<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.550> next<00:02:32.850> locus<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:34.110> need<00:02:34.290> to

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
so this is the next locus that I need to

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.470 
so this is the next locus that I need to
do<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:35.160> locusts<00:02:35.520> from<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.820> single<00:02:36.210> point

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
do and the locusts from a single point

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.020 
do and the locusts from a single point
forms<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.530> circle<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:38.550> I'm<00:02:38.610> going<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.790> need<00:02:38.910> my

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
forms a circle so I'm going to need my

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.550 
forms a circle so I'm going to need my
compass<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:42.860> I'm<00:02:43.860> going<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.840> draw<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.900> locus

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
compass and I'm going to draw the locus

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.700 
compass and I'm going to draw the locus
here<00:02:47.070> using<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.120> solid<00:02:48.660> blue<00:02:48.990> line<00:02:49.020> i'm<00:02:49.560> going

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
here using a solid blue line i'm going

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.560 
here using a solid blue line i'm going
to<00:02:49.770> use<00:02:49.890> bluing<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:50.670> we<00:02:50.790> can<00:02:51.000> tell<00:02:51.210> that<00:02:51.450> this

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
to use bluing so we can tell that this

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.980 
to use bluing so we can tell that this
is<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.870> locus<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:53.330> i'm<00:02:54.330> going<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.810> put<00:02:54.960> my

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
is the locus and i'm going to put my

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.780 
is the locus and i'm going to put my
needle<00:02:55.290> at<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.800> origin<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.190> then<00:02:56.670> i'm<00:02:56.760> just

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
needle at the origin and then i'm just

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.210 
needle at the origin and then i'm just
going<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.060> open<00:02:57.150> up<00:02:57.600> my<00:02:57.750> compass<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:59.070> it

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
going to open up my compass so that it

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.400 
going to open up my compass so that it
will<00:02:59.280> be<00:02:59.340> five<00:02:59.760> units<00:03:00.300> away<00:03:00.810> from<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.320> origin

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
will be five units away from the origin

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.130 
will be five units away from the origin
so<00:03:02.340> be<00:03:02.640> right<00:03:02.850> there<00:03:03.060> at<00:03:03.120> one<00:03:03.270> two<00:03:03.510> three<00:03:03.930> four

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
so be right there at one two three four

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.570 
so be right there at one two three four
five<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.650> then<00:03:05.430> I'll<00:03:05.670> just<00:03:05.910> draw<00:03:06.180> my<00:03:06.210> circle

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.650 

around<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:14.280> once<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.820> have<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.180> circle

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
around and once I have the circle

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.160 
around and once I have the circle
complete<00:03:16.880> this<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:18.090> going<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.420> represent<00:03:18.600> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
complete this is going to represent the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.510 
complete this is going to represent the
locus<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.800> satisfies<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:21.180> condition

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
locus that satisfies this condition

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.680 
locus that satisfies this condition
points<00:03:23.520> that<00:03:23.640> are<00:03:23.730> 5<00:03:23.910> units<00:03:23.940> from<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.390> origin

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
points that are 5 units from the origin

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.430 
points that are 5 units from the origin
now<00:03:25.500> we<00:03:25.560> need<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.040> label<00:03:26.220> all<00:03:27.290> points<00:03:28.290> that

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
now we need to label all points that

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.630 
now we need to label all points that
satisfy<00:03:28.470> both<00:03:29.040> these<00:03:29.250> conditions<00:03:29.790> with<00:03:30.390> an<00:03:30.900> X

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
satisfy both these conditions with an X

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.400 
satisfy both these conditions with an X
and<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:33.450> I'm<00:03:33.510> going<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.690> use<00:03:33.780> my<00:03:33.810> red<00:03:34.080> marker

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
and so I'm going to use my red marker

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.150 
and so I'm going to use my red marker
for<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:36.420> we're<00:03:36.690> these<00:03:36.840> tu<00:03:37.230> lo<00:03:37.950> sai

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
for that and so we're these tu lo sai

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.479 
for that and so we're these tu lo sai
intersect<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.540> circle<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:40.080> these<00:03:40.560> two

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
intersect the circle and these two

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.020 
intersect the circle and these two
straight<00:03:41.730> lines<00:03:41.880> are<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:44.370> conditions<00:03:44.580> that

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
straight lines are the conditions that

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.860 
straight lines are the conditions that
satisfy<00:03:45.900> both<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.730> conditions<00:03:48.180> asked<00:03:48.720> of

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
satisfy both of the conditions asked of

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.420 
satisfy both of the conditions asked of
me<00:03:49.580> so<00:03:50.580> there's<00:03:50.970> your<00:03:51.150> problem
