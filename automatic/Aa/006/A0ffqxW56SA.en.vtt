00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.139
 One is Christian and again 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.360
 Now I have the comparison for you 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.710
 between the thriller set that is here 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.350
 in my left hand is about 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.970
 three quarters of a year old and on the right 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.480
 side of the just presented sony 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.880
 xperia z1 the new flagship of the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.779
 Japanese companies are joining me 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.310
 That's what the first hands-on said 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.679
 Inspired by something bigger 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.750
 that you see here for example so it 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.210
 at the height it has gained something 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.899
 also in the width it is so 12 mm 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.370
 wider than the previous model 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.670
 in thickness is now evident 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.309
 nothing happens but the z1 it is something 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.750
 thicker than the xperia set of 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.730
 You have to say that handling is called 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.489
 that's almost not there both 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.590
 Devices are good in the hand of course 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.970
 you notice the weight in the z1 that is 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.230
 something is heavier 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.050
 Everything has remained the same at the display 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.330
 So 5 inches full HD display 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.510
 Here is a new technology installed 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.110
 Sony says that here is the best 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.880
 display currently in mobile devices 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.730
 is used and we look 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.150
 simply times the viewing angle in both 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.310
 devices and put the displays in the 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.250
 comparison with the over 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.320
 to regulate vitality to a maximum and 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.780
 that's the whole thing 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.910
 I'll give you something to each other whether there 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.410
 what threatens at the angles but 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.270
 in my opinion, you can not see any 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.830
 big differences so that's both 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.680
 also relatively good from the side 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.900
 readable while the z1 is said to be 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.509
 that the colors look a bit pale 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.850
 At the moment this is going really well 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.000
 this device being the normal cells 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.659
 Of course, it is also very fluid 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.060
 Accordingly, I would say it is 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.590
 we are upgrading the xperia set 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.970
 currently this device still has the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.640
 maybe should stay with it 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.990
 and yes I think that was it for now 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.990
 to see many thanks for making fine
