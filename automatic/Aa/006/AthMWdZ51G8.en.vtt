that right now it may be the best
rivalry<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.869> would<00:00:19.109> disagree<00:00:19.260> with<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.770> I

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
rivalry I would disagree with that I

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.460 
rivalry I would disagree with that I
think<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.520> there<00:00:21.210> are<00:00:21.240> other<00:00:21.510> more<00:00:21.810> historic

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
think that there are other more historic

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.960 
think that there are other more historic
established<00:00:23.100> rivalries<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.609> are<00:00:23.820> still

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
established rivalries that are still

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.150 
established rivalries that are still
going<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> be<00:00:24.210> better<00:00:24.470> ravens<00:00:25.470> steelers<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.920> lot

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
going to be better ravens steelers a lot

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.990 
going to be better ravens steelers a lot
of<00:00:26.250> people<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.670> tell<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.880> that's

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
of people are going to tell you that's

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.599 
of people are going to tell you that's
maybe<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> best<00:00:27.869> one<00:00:28.170> it's<00:00:28.740> still<00:00:29.010> relatively

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
maybe the best one it's still relatively

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.400 
maybe the best one it's still relatively
new<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> good<00:00:30.480> news<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.720> for<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.109> Seahawks

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
new so the good news is for the Seahawks

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.200 
new so the good news is for the Seahawks
and<00:00:31.590> 49ers<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.550> not<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.969> take<00:00:33.180> that

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and 49ers it's not going to take that

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.030 
and 49ers it's not going to take that
long<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.989> there<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:34.739> if<00:00:34.829> both<00:00:35.010> teams

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
long to get there I think if both teams

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.880 
long to get there I think if both teams
can<00:00:35.460> maintain<00:00:35.640> some<00:00:36.090> degree<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.360> quality

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
can maintain some degree of quality

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.720 
can maintain some degree of quality
competitiveness<00:00:37.890> over<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> next<00:00:38.399> five<00:00:38.579> years

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
competitiveness over the next five years

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.430 
competitiveness over the next five years
it<00:00:39.000> will<00:00:39.180> be<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> best<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.870> league<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:40.350> of

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
it will be the best in the league one of

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.049 
it will be the best in the league one of
the<00:00:40.530> things<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.800> goes<00:00:41.070> into<00:00:41.309> Baltimore<00:00:41.940> in

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the things that goes into Baltimore in

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.760 
the things that goes into Baltimore in
Pittsburgh's<00:00:42.480> rivalry<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.440> these<00:00:43.559> are

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
Pittsburgh's rivalry is that these are

a<00:01:06.720> little<00:01:06.840> different<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.439> bit

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
a little different a little bit

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.140 
a little different a little bit

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
playing a similar kind of game two I

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.880 
playing a similar kind of game two I
think<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.810> may<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> thing<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:22.770> end

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
think that that may be the thing we end

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.800 
think that that may be the thing we end
