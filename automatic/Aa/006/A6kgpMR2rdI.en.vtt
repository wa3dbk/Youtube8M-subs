understand<00:00:56.550> how<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> collection<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.540> pipes

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
understand how can a collection of pipes

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.869 
understand how can a collection of pipes
make<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.010> many<00:00:59.129> different<00:00:59.339> kinds<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.699> sounds

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
make so many different kinds of sounds

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.759 
make so many different kinds of sounds
well<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.690> depends<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.110> shape<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.589> pipe

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
well it depends on the shape of the pipe

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.130 
well it depends on the shape of the pipe
if<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.369> a<00:01:02.460> long<00:01:02.610> thin<00:01:02.970> pipe<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.449> produces<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
if it's a long thin pipe that produces a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.460 
if it's a long thin pipe that produces a
very<00:01:04.290> stringy<00:01:04.680> sound<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> violin<00:01:05.940> a

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
very stringy sound like a violin a

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.140 
very stringy sound like a violin a
fatter<00:01:07.470> rounder<00:01:07.950> pipe<00:01:08.159> might<00:01:08.729> produce<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
fatter rounder pipe might produce a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.330 
fatter rounder pipe might produce a
flute<00:01:09.330> tone<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.960> some<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> trumpet<00:01:11.159> pipes

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
flute tone and some of the trumpet pipes

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.190 
flute tone and some of the trumpet pipes
are<00:01:11.490> actually<00:01:11.729> shaped<00:01:11.940> like<00:01:12.030> trumpets<00:01:12.570> well

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
are actually shaped like trumpets well

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.359 
are actually shaped like trumpets well
actually<00:01:13.350> I'm<00:01:13.680> getting<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> feeling<00:01:14.100> out

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
actually I'm getting the feeling out

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.550 
actually I'm getting the feeling out
this<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.729> must<00:01:15.360> be<00:01:15.510> rather<00:01:15.780> big<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.409> tell

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
this it must be rather big can you tell

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.649 
this it must be rather big can you tell
us<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.950> how<00:01:17.070> big<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.460> theater<00:01:18.030> pipe<00:01:18.240> organ<00:01:18.540> is

incredible<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:36.630> what<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.590> main<00:01:37.800> use<00:01:38.160> for

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
incredible now what was the main use for

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.830 
incredible now what was the main use for
this<00:01:38.550> I<00:01:38.760> mean<00:01:38.910> with<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.390> many<00:01:39.480> instruments

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
this I mean with so many instruments

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.240 
this I mean with so many instruments
that<00:01:40.050> it<00:01:40.170> could<00:01:40.290> imitate<00:01:40.680> why<00:01:40.830> what<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
that it could imitate why what was the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.770 
that it could imitate why what was the
purpose<00:01:41.430> behind<00:01:41.640> well<00:01:42.300> back<00:01:42.480> in<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.690> early

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
purpose behind well back in the early

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.110 
purpose behind well back in the early
1920s<00:01:43.230> when<00:01:44.130> these<00:01:44.310> instruments<00:01:44.670> were<00:01:44.880> built

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
1920s when these instruments were built

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.060 
1920s when these instruments were built
they<00:01:45.540> were<00:01:45.600> used<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:46.050> accompany<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.740> silent

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
they were used to accompany the silent

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.770 
they were used to accompany the silent
movies<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.520> old<00:01:47.730> movie<00:01:47.940> theaters<00:01:48.270> right

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
movies in the old movie theaters right

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.160 
movies in the old movie theaters right
and<00:01:49.040> at<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.220> time<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.970> was<00:01:51.330> pretty<00:01:51.870> expensive

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and at that time it was pretty expensive

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.600 
and at that time it was pretty expensive
for<00:01:52.440> most<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> theaters<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.310> hire<00:01:53.580> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
for most of the theaters to hire a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.190 
for most of the theaters to hire a
full-size<00:01:54.090> orchestra<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.659> play<00:01:54.690> for<00:01:54.900> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
full-size orchestra to play for the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.740 
full-size orchestra to play for the
soundtrack<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.400> movies<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.480> they<00:01:57.720> found

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
soundtrack for the movies so they found
