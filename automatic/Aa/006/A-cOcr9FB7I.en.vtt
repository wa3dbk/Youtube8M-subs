00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
on the conservative alternative so do

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.960

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
bona fide conservative and maybe that's

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.030 
bona fide conservative and maybe that's
going<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.810> propel<00:03:01.200> him<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.650> front<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:01.950> the
