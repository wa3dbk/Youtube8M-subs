in<00:04:03.099> comparison<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.299> Death<00:04:04.480> Adder<00:04:04.630> along

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
in comparison to the Death Adder along

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.960 
in comparison to the Death Adder along
top<00:04:05.380> however<00:04:06.130> even<00:04:06.489> though<00:04:06.549> it's<00:04:06.700> a<00:04:06.790> very

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
top however even though it's a very

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.020 
top however even though it's a very
smooth<00:04:07.239> material<00:04:07.389> it<00:04:08.079> it<00:04:09.010> definitely<00:04:09.280> is

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
smooth material it it definitely is

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.420 
smooth material it it definitely is
nonstick<00:04:10.840> I<00:04:11.019> I<00:04:11.230> do<00:04:11.349> agree<00:04:11.799> with<00:04:11.859> that<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.250> just

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
nonstick I I do agree with that it just

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.400 
nonstick I I do agree with that it just
feels<00:04:12.639> really<00:04:13.120> good<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.359> the<00:04:13.930> same<00:04:14.139> goes<00:04:14.380> for

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
feels really good and the same goes for

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.490 
feels really good and the same goes for
the<00:04:14.650> side<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.519> doesn't<00:04:15.910> have<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.450> rubber<00:04:17.139> grip

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
the side it doesn't have the rubber grip

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.479 
the side it doesn't have the rubber grip
that<00:04:18.039> you<00:04:18.489> get<00:04:18.700> on<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:19.150> 2013<00:04:20.109> but<00:04:20.799> definitely

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
that you get on the 2013 but definitely

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.089 
that you get on the 2013 but definitely
it's<00:04:21.789> still<00:04:22.180> nonstick<00:04:23.080> material<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:23.979> is

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
it's still nonstick material so that is

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.040 
it's still nonstick material so that is
going<00:04:24.219> to<00:04:24.280> be<00:04:24.370> really<00:04:24.729> nice<00:04:24.909> and<00:04:25.150> it's<00:04:25.900> got<00:04:26.020> a

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
going to be really nice and it's got a

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.320 
going to be really nice and it's got a
really

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
really

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.480 
really
looking<00:04:28.169> to<00:04:28.409> tone<00:04:28.740> design<00:04:29.159> I<00:04:29.189> think<00:04:29.250> that

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
looking to tone design I think that

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.210 
looking to tone design I think that
looks<00:04:29.669> really<00:04:30.090> good<00:04:30.560> you<00:04:31.560> know<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.650> like<00:04:31.979> the

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
looks really good you know I like the

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.059 
looks really good you know I like the
the<00:04:32.789> kind<00:04:33.030> of<00:04:33.090> just<00:04:33.659> look<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.379> the<00:04:34.530> feel<00:04:34.560> of<00:04:34.800> it

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
the kind of just look and the feel of it

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.330 
the kind of just look and the feel of it
really<00:04:35.780> very<00:04:36.780> nice<00:04:37.050> looking<00:04:37.439> Mouse<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.919> bit

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
really very nice looking Mouse a bit

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.240 
really very nice looking Mouse a bit
more<00:04:38.580> shiny<00:04:38.939> than<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.509> Death<00:04:39.900> Adder<00:04:40.110> 2013<00:04:41.069> you

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
more shiny than the Death Adder 2013 you

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.760 
more shiny than the Death Adder 2013 you
can<00:04:41.400> see<00:04:41.639> you<00:04:42.569> know<00:04:42.659> the<00:04:42.990> third<00:04:43.169> is<00:04:43.319> a<00:04:43.349> bit<00:04:43.650> more

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
can see you know the third is a bit more

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.179 
can see you know the third is a bit more
matte<00:04:44.069> um<00:04:44.400> all<00:04:45.300> over<00:04:45.659> really<00:04:45.810> but<00:04:46.560> this<00:04:46.889> I

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:47.189 
matte um all over really but this I

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:50.059 
matte um all over really but this I
think<00:04:47.219> is<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.669> very<00:04:48.539> stylish<00:04:49.169> little<00:04:49.560> Mouse<00:04:49.830> and

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
think is a very stylish little Mouse and

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.890 
think is a very stylish little Mouse and
being<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:50.759> Black<00:04:50.969> Edition<00:04:51.150> it<00:04:51.509> won't<00:04:51.689> have

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
being the Black Edition it won't have

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.159 
being the Black Edition it won't have
any<00:04:52.050> lighting<00:04:52.740> like<00:04:53.729> the<00:04:53.759> 2013<00:04:54.569> edition<00:04:54.780> does

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
any lighting like the 2013 edition does

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.020 
any lighting like the 2013 edition does
but<00:04:55.740> then<00:04:55.860> again<00:04:55.979> you<00:04:56.400> know<00:04:56.430> you'd<00:04:56.789> know<00:04:57.000> that

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
but then again you know you'd know that

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.089 
but then again you know you'd know that
if<00:04:57.419> you<00:04:57.539> were<00:04:57.689> buying<00:04:57.990> it<00:04:58.259> so<00:04:58.469> you<00:04:59.009> know

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
if you were buying it so you know

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.909 
if you were buying it so you know
overall<00:04:59.639> pretty<00:05:00.509> much<00:05:00.750> same<00:05:01.259> in<00:05:01.530> terms<00:05:01.680> of

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
overall pretty much same in terms of

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.409 
overall pretty much same in terms of
feel<00:05:02.280> I<00:05:02.580> would<00:05:02.639> say<00:05:03.919> it<00:05:04.919> mean<00:05:05.129> is<00:05:05.310> it<00:05:05.969> when<00:05:06.389> I

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
feel I would say it mean is it when I

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:07.999 
feel I would say it mean is it when I
say<00:05:06.629> in<00:05:06.780> terms<00:05:06.900> of<00:05:07.050> feel<00:05:07.229> I<00:05:07.259> mean<00:05:07.500> in<00:05:07.620> terms<00:05:07.830> of

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
say in terms of feel I mean in terms of

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.459 
say in terms of feel I mean in terms of
the<00:05:08.099> shape<00:05:08.340> the<00:05:08.639> actual<00:05:09.030> feel<00:05:09.330> is<00:05:09.629> quite

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:10.469 
the shape the actual feel is quite

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:14.330 
the shape the actual feel is quite
different<00:05:11.030> between<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.270> two<00:05:12.300> I'm<00:05:13.159> not<00:05:14.159> sure

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
different between the two I'm not sure

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.129 
different between the two I'm not sure
which<00:05:14.550> I<00:05:14.759> would<00:05:15.000> prefer<00:05:15.030> but<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:15.780> definitely

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
which I would prefer but I definitely

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.769 
which I would prefer but I definitely
think<00:05:16.590> they're<00:05:16.710> both<00:05:16.969> usable<00:05:17.969> and<00:05:18.240> I<00:05:18.330> love<00:05:18.599> the

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:18.779 
think they're both usable and I love the

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:21.469 
think they're both usable and I love the
nonstick<00:05:19.580> aspect<00:05:20.580> that<00:05:20.789> even<00:05:21.150> though<00:05:21.240> it's<00:05:21.419> a

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
nonstick aspect that even though it's a

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.029 
nonstick aspect that even though it's a
quite<00:05:21.690> smooth<00:05:22.050> whereas<00:05:22.409> this<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.560> actually<00:05:23.009> a

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
quite smooth whereas this is actually a

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.149 
quite smooth whereas this is actually a
bit<00:05:23.340> more<00:05:23.449> rougher<00:05:24.449> feeling<00:05:24.900> though<00:05:25.349> it's<00:05:25.680> not

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
bit more rougher feeling though it's not

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.050 
bit more rougher feeling though it's not
rough<00:05:26.669> in<00:05:27.199> relative<00:05:28.199> terms<00:05:28.500> obviously<00:05:29.009> so<00:05:29.430> you

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
rough in relative terms obviously so you

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.249 
rough in relative terms obviously so you
know<00:05:30.180> that<00:05:30.479> was<00:05:30.569> it<00:05:30.689> there's<00:05:30.900> a<00:05:30.960> very<00:05:31.139> quick
