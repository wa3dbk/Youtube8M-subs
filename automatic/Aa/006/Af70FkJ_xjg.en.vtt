 here in a new video today is an evening 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.869
 where I have nothing particularly from 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.910

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.850
 so I wanted to show you a little one 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:27.570

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.039
 your headphones then go well 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.690

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.759

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.210
 my computer but oh well these are 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.950
 details 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.390

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.940
 upgrade your headphones for me 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.250
 example I have this pair of headphones here that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.340
 they are gt and sports 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.670

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.800
 just let me severin so much to ok 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.250
 now you are much more combi so vi 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.430
 i make a round ok 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.050
 Seriously now I will let you hear 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.420
 just how you normally feel 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.450
 attached to the cable that is normally yes 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.789
 hear your headphones for how 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.840
 normally attached maximum volume here 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:12.929
 the volume below is waiting for this one 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.369
 it is at most you see just because it is there 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:18.779
 the light is at maximum and if I like the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.329
 phone more or less at this distance 

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:27.889
 what you will feel this feel 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.889
 something to look at nearby 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.440
 practically nothing is heard and is at the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.229
 maximum 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.670
 now guys with this little gesture now 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.930
 let's find out the music ok 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.610
 let's amaze the music for a moment 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.800
 let's put in the part where it's going to 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.440
 pumping ok you now is simply 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.399
 by making a move you have by chance 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.909
 home those of these houses one e 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.040
 a place 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.899
 one is a 2 simply this you have 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.460
 never noticed that then basically that 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.630
 small audio attack 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.670
 here exactly we will go to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.039
 use this I don't know why but 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.920
 these speakers amplify the fixed 1 hour 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.769
 let's go get our jack yes 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.000
 it would be the audio that the other is of 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.340
 we hold the microphone 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.300
 if you hear casino excuse me but there is the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.519
 boeing 747 then partly however notice 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.750
 however, the cables are wired or sucked 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.510
 maximum 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.489
 we take it this audio cable 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.489
 insert quads ahead like this 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.680
 we turn on the crates we don't put it at 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.230
 maximum we put it a little less almost at 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.829
 maximum do a little more than three quarters then 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.360
 wait ok when this is attacked 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.820
 we 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.040
 oh well if the sign you have to connect the 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.160
 cases obviously connected to the cash desks at 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.880
 computer I connected them up front 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.200
 this one here then we go to play the games here 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.180
 it is at its best 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.470
 indeed wait then it's all at the most 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.920
 let's play and hear the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.920
 difference 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.590
 obviously feel and also a nice 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.319
 increase of yours in case of times 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.329
 with your tastes he sees more strength then 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.750
 all at best as the first is 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.750
 evident 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.159
 the quality is definitely felt more 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.349
 I do not take responsibility if in 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.879
 in case you burn the headphones I of 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.739
 in fact, even just with this 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.230
 method I tend to slightly lower the 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.870
 volume ii on the spreaker squa 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.329
 exactly where the control is 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.010
 struggling to lower slightly so 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.840
 to avoid that maybe they fuck off 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.359
 however, there is a good headphone 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.700
 increase given that I am not much 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.439
 good as headphones for the fact of audio 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.230
 with this method you will make it go 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.989
 great and no kids from this 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.750
 little cock tutorial and you have 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.079
 learned something else from the locals e 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.079
 from music 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.340
 ok it's all goodbye to everyone
