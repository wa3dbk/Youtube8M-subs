00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.420
 book 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.830
 Water is a matter of course and abundant in our society 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.820
 Use the element 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.200
 For daily hygiene spent due to bad weather 60 liters of water per 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.239
 Day 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.079
 but not all of this disappears in the outflow about five percent of the water 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.079
 try other ways 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.269
 I'm not a hot shower 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.890
 quite frankly such a cool water kiss in the morning so this book writes 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.830
 when I flip for the iPad 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.960
 Where I heard it is supposed to give people the showers in the morning especially 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.780
 like long and hot, the bathroom is changing fast every day 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.820
 in a steam room 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.370
 it likes 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.460
 but this is exactly where the love of viewers starts today's topic 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.200
 Seals bandage and soil 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.440
 what do seals have to do with water vapor? 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.330
 Look 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.580
 this is half a liter of water he can be quite impressed in specifications 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.760
 Form of water vapor 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.550
 disappear in the walls and ceiling of the bath 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.790
 how it can be despite tiled walls I've prepared something 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.960
 we need a small aquarium 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.600
 a piece of perforated metal 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.730
 Thiesen glue 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.070
 and of course the grout 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.990
 The perforated plate is professionally sealed and for Phuket 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.710
 the whole represents the construction of a nasty area 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.160
 we see a partner bank occurs 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.960
 putting options will make choices and I'll trim the edge with silicone 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.680
 what's on it 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.680
 wait 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.619
 hard to believe, but true 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.289
 in our experimental setup is over five liters over a liter of water within five days 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.259
 trickles down through it at the top 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.980
 our professional once must be partial 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.239
 What happened here? 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.010
 the MSI is an extreme little situation as in the swimming pool extremely because we are standing 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.650
 Water and steam I probably had that for much longer 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.329
 lasted five days 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.339
 In any case, what does he intend to do, such as to be longer and to mount the wall 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:37.339
 the weak spot are the joints and these Nikon waterproofing Passion over 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.139
 the joints and thus the seals 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.840
 Constantine will bring in the walls with a damp extreme beginning 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:43.939
 mold 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.449
 it comes to massive structural damage 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:50.169
 to avoid as possible that means consequently can not call dense 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.639
 state building they unfold therefore 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.759
 The system could be useful to install 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.959
 very interesting and thus for getting to know 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.680
 Finally, they show documents at the Bandfactory has not made dense 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.409
 because what had prepared for her he was 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.679
 Coop with 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:08.869
 please do not laugh, of course, primarily to build the surcharges but 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.929
 Unfortunately, it was only enough for the o2 plug 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:14.989
 not always but immediately relatively young is already there 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.939
 but neither with him nor with Chelsea but again push 13 but who good 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.939
 we are not proud of any digital natives 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:24.590
 maintains that 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.109
 They are perfectly adequate for our purposes 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.649
 absolutely good 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:32.389
 if this is now the real 2 stick what would have to do to perfect it 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.339
 seal 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:36.339
 we assume that the low and high amount 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:42.619
 Next, as the next percent, need a value of such our close-coat 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:47.269
 to assume the role of year the grammage collected visitors 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.009
 I'll just put it here 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.389
 as base material 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:52.660
 or wait 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.060
 When the building is supposed to set off then beautiful set of discovered 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.409
 registered what I notice it smells ever carried out 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.819
 it's so funny free 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.989
 nice blue 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.409
 why blue 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:10.869
 percent 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:13.069
 blue the advantage 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.759
 that can see right away and where I have not occupied job yet 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.289
 like here or musicians again about it more 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.699
 Polt and the robbers one strokes that now everything will be perfect the whole will 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.150
 applied in three bearings 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.909
 in between always jam-packed 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.909
 in between, only three voices are affected and that is how to comply 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:36.519
 and here on the edges there are still 17% of the 17% 

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:38.729
 turn, is a complete system 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.020
 and just this 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.139
 becomes 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.430
 that surfaces 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.289
 Inserted sealing wall when to do it after the wievielten painting 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.289
 after the first coat of paint 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.259
 so had to show before that is of course only verbally show 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.499
 This remains decided to delete it 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:05.499
 in the first operation it also introduces successors, there are also special ones 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:07.499
 for this the ceiling 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:10.389
 that looks different from who else belongs to the whole system 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.279
 the stuck 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:15.669
 «To lead» that older system completely 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:18.189
 is sealed 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.629
 and rarely cuffs I forget a year forget 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.710
 Feeder has every shower, of course, too 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.249
 water supply 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:29.869
 said sum by provisions I am not a warm shower I make mine 

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:31.130
 still packing 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.130
 So where did a speaker come from 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.430
 Kreutzer 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.409
 and imagine 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:42.700
 so now 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.889
 that our water connection 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.889
 over dispute is now a water connection comes naturally 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.029
 It is estimated that he was very heavy with the driver 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:57.479
 there it falls relatives room the first 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.039
 unfortunately included 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.260
 already before cancer and again deleted 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.950
 and of course, I've also painted over nail polish 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.189
 makes very nice Murray 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:09.279
 Brunner was it's sort of my mistake the band is tight 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.819
 after the third painting it takes twelve hours 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.080
 to cure by then I can then 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.889
 with tile adhesive 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.389
 around 4 0 percent 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:22.629
 during construction 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:26.139
 optimized high quality surfaces and if that means they were all there for the 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.449
 Take Switzerland out 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.930
 Canada has taken its time 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.469
 actor 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:33.800
 thank you for the blue finger in the game 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.370
 and the extensive information 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.480
 Of course we both hope that he will answer many questions from Evita 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:39.650
 Could bring tray 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.300
 If you need more information then just have a look 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.720
 Internets and data from - construction products points goes or they call the experts 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.449
 the Knauf Hotline 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:52.009
 under 01805 3 1 9 and 2 0 0 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.889
 that which of us two is perhaps unclear
