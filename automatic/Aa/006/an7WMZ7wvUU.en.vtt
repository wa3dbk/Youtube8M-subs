should<00:02:14.640> be<00:02:14.700> right<00:02:15.150> at<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.390> edge<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.900> half

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
should be right at the edge of the half

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.810 
should be right at the edge of the half
foam<00:02:16.290> roller<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.920> heel<00:02:17.100> should<00:02:17.310> always<00:02:17.580> touch

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
foam roller the heel should always touch

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.870 
foam roller the heel should always touch
it's<00:02:18.780> just<00:02:19.020> going<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.470> go<00:02:19.590> down<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.550> up<00:02:20.640> at<00:02:20.790> a

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
it's just going to go down it up at a

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.430 
it's just going to go down it up at a
comfortable<00:02:21.209> pace<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.810> does<00:02:21.930> not<00:02:22.080> have<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.410> be

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
comfortable pace it does not have to be

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.920 
comfortable pace it does not have to be
fast<00:02:22.770> oh<00:02:23.480> we're<00:02:24.480> going<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.690> add<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> little

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
fast oh we're going to add a little

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.680 
fast oh we're going to add a little
variation<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.560> change<00:02:25.800> center<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.160> gravity<00:02:26.690> so

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
variation to change center of gravity so

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.790 
variation to change center of gravity so
now<00:02:27.810> she's<00:02:27.989> going<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.170> come<00:02:28.320> up<00:02:28.470> she's<00:02:28.709> gonna

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
now she's going to come up she's gonna

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.310 
now she's going to come up she's gonna
swing<00:02:29.070> arms<00:02:29.340> up<00:02:29.520> down<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.420> up<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.780> down<00:02:30.870> and

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
swing arms up down and up and down and

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.070 
swing arms up down and up and down and
then<00:02:31.489> tap<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.520> heels

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.340 

lots<00:02:36.710> of<00:02:36.860> variations<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.460> this<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:39.140> kind<00:02:39.320> of

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
lots of variations of this the kind of

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.690 
lots of variations of this the kind of
our<00:02:39.530> movement<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.010> going<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.250> change<00:02:40.400> center

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
our movement is going to change center

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.420 
our movement is going to change center
for<00:02:40.850> grabbing<00:02:41.150> make<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.570> more<00:02:41.690> challenging

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
for grabbing make it more challenging

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:50.860 
for grabbing make it more challenging
and<00:02:43.430> now<00:02:43.550> we're<00:02:43.640> going<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.820> do<00:02:43.910> squats<00:02:49.870> alright

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
and now we're going to do squats alright

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.390 
and now we're going to do squats alright
that's<00:02:51.020> going<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.320> happen<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.100> real<00:02:52.370> life

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
that's going to happen this is real life

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.360 
that's going to happen this is real life
here<00:02:52.880> okay<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:55.600> don't<00:02:56.600> think<00:02:56.780> there's<00:02:57.370> she's

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
here okay I don't think there's she's

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.190 
here okay I don't think there's she's
switching<00:02:58.670> between<00:02:58.970> regular<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.750> goofy

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
switching between regular and goofy

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.250 
switching between regular and goofy
footed<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:02.150> don't<00:03:02.330> have<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.630> do<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.780> the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
footed you don't have to do that the

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.320 
footed you don't have to do that the
primary<00:03:03.530> movement<00:03:04.070> is<00:03:04.220> in<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.850> hip<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.150> knees

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
primary movement is in the hip and knees

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.870 
primary movement is in the hip and knees
and<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:06.470> have<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.740> instability<00:03:07.430> of<00:03:07.460> the<00:03:07.640> half

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
and you have the instability of the half

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.150 
and you have the instability of the half
foam<00:03:08.120> roller<00:03:08.360> this<00:03:09.170> half<00:03:09.380> foam<00:03:09.650> rollers<00:03:09.950> been

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
foam roller this half foam rollers been

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.120 
foam roller this half foam rollers been
actually<00:03:10.580> used<00:03:10.850> quite<00:03:11.330> a<00:03:11.390> bit<00:03:11.890> so<00:03:12.890> it<00:03:12.950> makes

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
actually used quite a bit so it makes

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.010 
actually used quite a bit so it makes
things<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.490> little<00:03:13.580> bit<00:03:13.760> easier<00:03:13.910> it's<00:03:14.810> really

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
things a little bit easier it's really

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.630 
things a little bit easier it's really
mushy<00:03:15.320> when<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.680> buy<00:03:15.830> your<00:03:15.980> foam<00:03:16.190> roller<00:03:16.459> for

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
mushy when you buy your foam roller for

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.540 
mushy when you buy your foam roller for
the<00:03:16.700> first<00:03:16.940> time<00:03:18.100> it's<00:03:19.100> gonna<00:03:19.190> be<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.370> lot<00:03:19.490> more

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
the first time it's gonna be a lot more

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.130 
the first time it's gonna be a lot more
difficult<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.360> stabilize<00:03:22.390> okay<00:03:23.390> that's<00:03:23.959> the

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
difficult to stabilize okay that's the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.470 
difficult to stabilize okay that's the
end<00:03:24.170> of<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.590> balancing<00:03:25.490> circuit<00:03:25.880> it's<00:03:26.330> for

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
end of the balancing circuit it's for

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.470 
end of the balancing circuit it's for
joining<00:03:26.780> us<00:03:30.070> do<00:03:31.070> good<00:03:31.190> time<00:03:31.430> hey<00:03:31.940> I'll

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
joining us do good time hey I'll

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.709 
joining us do good time hey I'll
happened<00:03:32.840> there<00:03:32.959> I<00:03:33.140> didn't<00:03:33.380> hear<00:03:33.440> anything
