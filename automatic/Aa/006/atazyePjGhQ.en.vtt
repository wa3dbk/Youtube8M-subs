00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.000
 hello dear pastor and group leader 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.490
 small 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.740
 It is a joy to greet want 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.209
 thank you for your dedication and 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.190
 ministry that the interviewees 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.650
 English pride the news 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.660
 if he is approaching, walk by 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.720
 multiplication of small groups 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.650
 throughout South America on the 9th of 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.450
 August 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.119
 and on this occasion we would like to 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.400
 multiplication of hope since each 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.469
 new small group that is born brings 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.230
 I get hope in Christ to 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.420
 different places and different people 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.699
 we need to multiply through 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.559
 small groups because we want to improve 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.949
 the relationship of church members if the 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.350
 shepherd the flock of god discover the 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.559
 talents and train new leaders who 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.949
 help the church grow 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.979
 integrated 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.440
 So how do you multiply successfully? 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.339
 there at least three simple ways 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.010
 first place 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.799
 We need to ask the Lord in 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.190
 mateus chapter seat verse 7 is 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:09.070
 written request and if God uses gives us 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.049
 this growth being we ask you for 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.140
 We will introduce you to this 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.030
 supplication he will celebrate in attending 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.320
 as I said after a 1st in chat 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.329
 corinthians 36 growing god washed 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.000
 this is a spiritual matter and we should 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.020
 clamor to heaven for this emission on 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.119
 second place 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.820
 we need said skip a leading mistake 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.880
 you are reproducing the extra liberalism 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.789
 in a new persona it is as if we are 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.060
 passing the baton on the bet for a new 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.939
 corridor to achieve new groups 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.600
 small if there are no new leaders 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.369
 for this reason we need and 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.380
 each pastor needs 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.570
 multiply their influence on their 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.179
 coordinators and supervisors 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.219
 the insÃºa prototype of leaders by another 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.729
 side each small group leader 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:03.729
 need to invest your life as a mentor 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.310
 forming a new leader as auxiliary 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.979
 more free we prepare more groups 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.460
 we tend consolidated third 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.410
 place 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.020
 we need to practice and evangelism 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.540
 relate it to lahm's evangelism 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.909
 when Jesus healed there 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.140
 miracles and in the life of the people he 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:25.599
 starts fetus hunting for studios and how much 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.359
 they how great things for you 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.439
 site with you this or evangelism 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.629
 related 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.230
 each in testifying and announcing 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.329
 to the circle of friends who neither jesus 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.849
 if a small group of being grow 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.909
 you need to advertise and betray your 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.579
 relatives and friends to see and 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.079
 listen to the wonders of Mr. Mingas 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.840
 like simple 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.269
 if we ask you to follow the 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.010
 example he said jumping a new leader and 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.919
 practice more relevant realism 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.079
 relate it he Lord give us the grace 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:02.590
 to have a large multiplication of 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:05.680
 small groups energy August 9 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.970
 participate in this multiplying movement 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.889
