00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.870
 hello remove very good friends from habitat 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.170
 point is if I look and I have point is let 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.400
 to see this time high stools 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.580
 stools that are spent in the kitchen in 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.080
 the bar or in the bar or in places 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.950
 commercial 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.670
 is a multifunction stool that comes from 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.280
 iron cylindrical tubular tube and in the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.860
 part of the seat is PVC remember 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.810
 the references previously seen in case 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.660
 call us to place us 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.090
 quickly on the stool that that is 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.480
 in the product still has completely 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.790
 Factory assembled 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.160
 you do not have to do anything comes to folding 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.940
 remember that when this is all there is 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.180
 folded because it practically takes up nothing 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.120
 of the place 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.210
 You can hang it on a wall with a 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.950
 screw or can be hung with two 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.710
 irons 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.800
 and putting several amounts 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.710
 you see the individual piece so that 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.380
 you can buy 1 2 and 3 but if you buy 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.600
 lots of 6 come out with a little bit of 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.040
 discount because in the factory box 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.600
 comes from 6 then there would be no 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.920
 touch them anything directly we would send 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.220
 the box and clear less handling and 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.220
 less money 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.570
 let's look a little bit at the measurements 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.640
 because with the close-ups that we have 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.240
 done and the have no assembly this video 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.240
 It is very simple 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.730
 The total height of the stool has 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.810
 96 centimeters seat height 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.060
 It has about 72 centimeters and to put 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.989
 what would come to be the foot has a few 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:03.200
 25 or 26 centimeters the diameter of the 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:07.160
 seat are 30 centimeters 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.240
 and we always have to think that I have 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.590
 one meter 80 high 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:19.599
 I am a large medium person 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.599
 and how perfectly that po in the chair 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.930
 we could take the white one and 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.950
 I have a black shirt 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.950
 to make it look 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.620
 as one would be left with the stool the 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.720
 really the truth that they are quite 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.160
 comfortable 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.660
 the round seat 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.220
 inspires confidence as saying good 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.770
 this should not be very comfortable but the 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.650
 true that the truth that is part 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.170
 pretty comfortable 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.540
 he has a good reception in what comes to 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.980
 do here 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.720
 the back 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.950
 well I think there is not much more to 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.709
 explain 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.250
 I hope it serves you hopefully 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:18.109

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.109
