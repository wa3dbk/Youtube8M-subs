with this for about a year I'm cool with

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.789 
with this for about a year I'm cool with
it<00:03:34.720> feels<00:03:35.720> kind<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:35.930> weird<00:03:36.049> having<00:03:36.349> metal<00:03:36.709> up

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
it feels kind of weird having metal up

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.610 
it feels kind of weird having metal up
against<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:37.549> inside<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.849> my<00:03:38.000> lip<00:03:38.120> here<00:03:38.359> but

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
against the inside of my lip here but

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.900 
against the inside of my lip here but
that's<00:03:39.620> what<00:03:39.739> my<00:03:39.859> wax<00:03:40.069> for<00:03:40.310> right<00:03:40.579> so<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:40.819> guess

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910
