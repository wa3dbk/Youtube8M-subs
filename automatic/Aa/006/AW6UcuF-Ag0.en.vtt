00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.609
 for me, according to a survey, have 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.250
 two-thirds of Germans are not afraid 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.180
 before nsa the german fear before 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.070
 Horse meat in the lasagna or for it 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.720
 that the stasi should come back the 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.710
 ever left a government 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.680
 be involved 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.540
 Stasi because you have to be afraid that were 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.909
 the evil devil in the godless 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.070
 communist system but the old ones 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.989
 stasi buddy the seated today the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.370
 would kartei boxes virus and whining 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.210
 the possibility of today at that time 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.199
 we are still there 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.789
 but we do not live in it 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.739
 godless communism know that 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.420
 christian occident and there they know 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.360
 people up there are always one of them 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.220
 Everything writes and he does not read 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.759
 Our emails left our thoughts 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.649
 but it is the good the kids are in 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.619
 Christian evening grow up with that 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.000
 once a year, nikolaus comes to know 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.590
 thereby large book stands here and there 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.910
 everything in it what we did in the year 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:29.050
 the nikolaus willi mareike says the e 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.050
 mail would not have played better 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.750
 nsa means nikolaus for the Germans 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.750
 sees everything 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.900
 if you were not mad at the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.790
 nikolaus he will not be afraid if you 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.439
 evil was there you will be punished for it 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.540
 the nikolaus the servant rupprecht thereby 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.310
 that's the one with the tail in the 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.590
 Netherlands is called the servant rupprecht 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.229
 because he is traditionally more colorful 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:09.880
 wait beat the black peter 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:11.709
 in the usa he is called obama the obama 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.440
 promised before his first election 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.510
 he would close guantanamo he has 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.489
 not done so even now where the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.060
 in october in the usa to do everything 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.060
 had 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.239
 the tourist attraction guantanamo remained 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.709
 opened but the obama does not bring any 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.180
 new trapped ones more that's it 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.650
 great the obama does not do any 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.720
 people are trapped now 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.390
 run directly on site overshoot in 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.360
 their respective countries 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.830
 because the barack obama of these old real 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.530
 rupprechter has a route that is 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.720
 remote-controlled 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.980
 this is a drone love joystick 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.110
 Controlled, the experts sit at the 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.209
 Joystick and pick up terrorists moves 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.620
 dr 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.950
 this saves on transport costs 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.180
 Guantanamo and feeding in a cage 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.980
 and is an official program is yes 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.660
 nothing secret is the obama speech 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.040
 death list set up officially 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.080
 there are the names of the people 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.299
 it by the crm over the world 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.920
 heap can shoot without charge without 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.480
 justification possibility or 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.580
 defense not just a short process 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.250
 and if they stand by then then 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.540
 you have a collateral damage yes what 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.049
 they still handle so bad they can 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.980
 see the list 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.980
 Now imagine it 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.520
 go to times before the assad in Syria 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.230
 would set up such a death list 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.360
 meanwhile work off the 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.970
 world public except that is allowed 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.020
 the not as yet no 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.020
 Nobel Peace Prize he gets to and 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.700
 the information that the obama needs 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.700
 for his terrorist euthanasia program 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.849
 this information provides the information 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:07.250
 nsa and if one at the nsa mist 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.650
 make or deny a command then 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.879
 he has to punish him for three weeks 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.959
 private mobile phone from Angela Merkel wirh and 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.150
 when she's been there for three weeks 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.160
 to listen to private calls from the merkel 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.109
 they never had to refuse one again 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.109
 command that 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.860
 that's all well-known me 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.199
 my what is the more ridiculous the please 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.569
 Presentation of the obama did not know 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.160
 that a super feel the merkel listen 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.630
 or the presentation of our 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.650
 constitutional protection did not know 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.460
 that Americans listens to the merkel 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.930
 you just can not admit that 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.930
 Obama can not be that 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.690
 they have never known in james 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.099
 bond movie seen 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.410
 that's the name of the bond 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.789
 you the information how it does not matter 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.550
 but if they get caught we have to 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.050
 deny they knew each other, that's how it works 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.770
 in espionage we are not 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.960
 stupid 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.650
 One also speaks of the central 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.750
 However, intelligence agency at the 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.289
 German secret agent never did that 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.250
 to connect word intelligence 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.539
 nevertheless are not so stupid that are the 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.039
 positions himself is, of course, have the 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.419
 what should we do? 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.039
 the constitutional protection merkel go and 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.930
 surely tell chancellor 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.699
 we know for years that the amis iab 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.349
 Listen, we meet once a month to 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.520
 coffee cake with the colleagues and 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:30.520
 laugh and limp over the recordings 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.920
 and of course the merkel had to 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.810
 Do as if you had no idea about anything 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.670
 the merkel would not be so synonymous 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.200
 I'm sure I knew that 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.570
 my secret knew that the 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.790
 americans are listening to me what do you mean 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.930

 Do not drain constitutional protection 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.980
 can despite the end is affÃ¤re the know 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.990
 because they have been listening to me for so long 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.250
 a lot about me that I only know one thing 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.040

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.390
 what they really know what they are 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.740

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.660
