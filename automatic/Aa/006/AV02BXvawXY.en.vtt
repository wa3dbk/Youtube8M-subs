00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:10.349
 hey hey hey hey people here and we 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.990
 get in place four 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.009
 the ten days in the helmet a crash challenge 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.009
 have fun 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.740
 place four goes to mais courtesy 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.519
 So first I hope I have now 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.469
 properly pronounced my name 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.269
 he looked a bit hard for me 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.210
 that's why I want to break out 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.460
 I'm sorry for the hit 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.640
 it comes here in terms of our space is 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.159
 Otherwise, minecraft challenge I can 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.830
 only recommend to everyone 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.580
 download this map down and see 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.130
 even what kind of work there is in it 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.680
 this user has made more of it 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.020
 as only and to deliver his building 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.710
 he has in his text file he has 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.470
 actually with actually others 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.509
 programs he still has text files 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.429
 added the one story too 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.100
 this one for this entire monstrosity 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.440
 you can say the whole one 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.360
 story to tell story 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.380
 a metal kite factory if I am 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.330
 Do not be fooled and according to my confi 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.850
 cup you unfortunately not read but 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.709
 I trust the good start and that 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.399
 I do not think they can do that to me 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:56.220
 bullshit 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.649
 if you look at the map he has 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.110
 everywhere in the map has the notes 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.599
 leave behind or sign where it says 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.580
 which note you should read this 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:10.860
 history in connection with this 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.050
 Thus , education should sweep away here as well 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.700
 These are now in ours 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.019
 you can see this factory now 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.300
 now you should read note 2 stand up 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.800
 today supposedly invites you to do it 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.739
 he still has that before I know unfortunately 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.879
 I would not link it as soon as that 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.920
 the case would be 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.629
 but I give no guarantee now 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.000
 he said he himself is still on it 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.550
 undecided but you can see here now 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.140
 like this factory tells this more 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.930
 here are the head just 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.340
 straight legs 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.220
 it is again a wealth of ideas 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.380
 existing of it amazing and that 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.030
 the awesome is even fulfilled 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.810
 It goes as far as an entire 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.520
 history to build a structure that 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.430
 that's why he needs a lot 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.330
 is also relatively late with his new one 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.590
 came in and there was also there 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.160
 the expectations were high with us 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.600
 those relatively late submissions 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.000
 Of course it was logical how later the 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.680
 Submit the higher are ours 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.230
 Expectation of the consignment but here 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.270
 We were not disappointed here 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.590
 we still see times as a 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.720
 research lab with the names of warts 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.260
 looks cool sometimes as I think 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.150
 or even as this spiral with the rad 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.610
 downward 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.460
 the lodgings also pretty lovingly 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.790
 I have to say that there will be 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.880
 history also continues to tell and 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.520
 it's interesting how much you look 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.640
 to think about a story 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.350
 to tell these buildings and that 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.090
 make it look good, too 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.830
 For example, when we came to 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.480
 example found that this metal 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.630
 kites really a great 3d art 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.210
 But work has not got it now 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.520
 with the class of the contending doctor 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.690
 set because he really has 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.080
 built more drum than just dispute doctor 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.270
 but we have this 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.340
 this connection this connection 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.620
 from total picture a complete 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.019
 coherent overall picture included 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.400
 little gadgets in an alpine panorama 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:27.150
 and really the creativity has for it 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.670
 worried that this is our place a lot 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.930
 Already as I said the 3 d doctor and 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.020
 the factor that makes you a story 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.170
 to have thought that has us real 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.660
 virtually kicked your ass and you 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.680
 you have to look that looks really 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.790
 hammer out what this looks like 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.960
 I 'm fine as I said I can 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.060
 recommend to everyone 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.140
 Invite your mother and in the 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.930
 description you will find the download 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:56.050
 link skin is you in your minecraft 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.690
 field and just follow it 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.590
 the whole story does it with the 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.730
 notes should be really worthwhile and we 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.190
 even get a thank you for that 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.540
 have played 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.870
 It looks really cool 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.330
 well deserved place four for 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.790
