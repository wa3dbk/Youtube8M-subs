00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.920 
this is this drain here we're going to
do<00:00:24.779> what<00:00:24.990> I'm<00:00:25.199> going<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.380> do<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.930> yeah

do what I'm going to do this is a yeah
I'm<00:00:28.230> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> cut<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.740> off<00:00:29.390> and<00:00:30.390> even<00:00:30.689> here

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
I'm going to cut this off and even here

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.959 
I'm going to cut this off and even here
this<00:00:31.080> has<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> little<00:00:31.579> this<00:00:32.579> thing<00:00:32.790> right<00:00:32.940> here

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
this has a little this thing right here

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.209 
this has a little this thing right here
so<00:00:33.960> not<00:00:34.260> want<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.559> side<00:00:34.739> that's<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.309> that's

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
so not want to side that's like a that's

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.860 
so not want to side that's like a that's
a<00:00:39.170> port<00:00:40.170> there<00:00:40.410> too<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:41.300> guess<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.510> will<00:00:42.660> goes

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
a port there too I guess that will goes

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.720 
a port there too I guess that will goes
through<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> helps<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.309> show<00:00:44.520> where

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
through here and it helps you show where

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.380 
through here and it helps you show where
the<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.629> level<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.770> I'm<00:00:46.860> gonna<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.390> if

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
the the level is so I'm gonna have to if

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.119 
the the level is so I'm gonna have to if
I<00:00:48.570> cut<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.870> more<00:00:49.079> fill<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.530> holes<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.010> you

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
I cut that more fill in holes and you

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.650 
I cut that more fill in holes and you
know<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.370> gonna<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> drain<00:00:51.329> hole<00:00:51.570> in

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
know you're gonna have the drain hole in

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.090 
know you're gonna have the drain hole in
the<00:00:51.719> bottom<00:00:52.110> go<00:00:53.100> ahead<00:00:54.260> and<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:56.390> once<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:58.100> cut

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the bottom go ahead and then once we cut

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.430 
the bottom go ahead and then once we cut
them<00:00:59.250> all<00:00:59.430> off<00:00:59.460> when<00:00:59.969> only<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.420> probably<00:01:01.289> one

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
them all off when only one probably one

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.979 
them all off when only one probably one
on<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> end<00:01:02.359> then<00:01:03.359> we're<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.660> connect

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
on the end then we're going to connect

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.840 
on the end then we're going to connect
them<00:01:04.700> you<00:01:05.700> know<00:01:05.820> put<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.390> put<00:01:07.049> ports<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.850> in

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
them you know put the put ports in in

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.750 
them you know put the put ports in in
each<00:01:09.119> chamber<00:01:09.540> set<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> little<00:01:11.159> fill<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
each chamber set it a little fill up and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.630 
each chamber set it a little fill up and
stuff<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.590> but<00:01:13.590> got<00:01:14.430> something

is<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.740> cast<00:01:41.009> iron<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.579> put<00:01:41.700> that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
is a it's a cast iron I just put that

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.310 
is a it's a cast iron I just put that
there<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.060> show<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.780> different<00:01:43.110> kind<00:01:43.259> of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
there to show you the different kind of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.010 
there to show you the different kind of
bases<00:01:43.680> they<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:44.090> but<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.210> one<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.600> has

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
bases they have but this one here has

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.060 
bases they have but this one here has
the<00:01:46.530> oil<00:01:47.130> fill<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.600> spring-loaded<00:01:48.930> I

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.990 

think<00:01:53.070> you're<00:01:53.189> supposed<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.490> hang<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
think you're supposed to hang it on the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.050 
think you're supposed to hang it on the
side<00:01:54.270> there<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.340> fill<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.610> now

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
side there like that and fill it up now

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.600 
side there like that and fill it up now
when<00:01:57.180> you're<00:01:57.299> done<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:58.799> flip<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.219> up<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.520> it

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
when you're done you flip it up and it

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.330 
when you're done you flip it up and it
pops<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.299> place<00:02:00.590> I'm<00:02:01.590> assuming<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.070> one<00:02:02.280> of

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
pops in place I'm assuming this one of

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.910 
pops in place I'm assuming this one of
the<00:02:02.399> earlier<00:02:02.729> ones<00:02:02.850> cuz<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.149> looks<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:03.479> a

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
the earlier ones cuz this looks like a

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.719 
the earlier ones cuz this looks like a
newer<00:02:04.920> modification<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.369> cast

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
newer modification and this is a cast

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.940 
newer modification and this is a cast
iron

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
iron

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.310 
iron
I'm<00:02:10.430> not<00:02:10.610> going<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.850> use<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.210> but<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:12.170> one

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
I'm not going to use this but that one

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.040 
I'm not going to use this but that one
that<00:02:12.560> one<00:02:12.680> just<00:02:12.800> has<00:02:12.920> one<00:02:12.950> chamber<00:02:13.310> too

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
that one just has one chamber too

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.390 
that one just has one chamber too
so<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.260> must<00:02:15.590> been<00:02:15.740> told<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:16.040> tell<00:02:16.250> it's

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
so that must been told you tell it's

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.610 
so that must been told you tell it's
older<00:02:16.670> because<00:02:16.790> they<00:02:17.030> use<00:02:17.390> cast<00:02:17.660> iron<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.140> all

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
older because they use cast iron and all

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.970 
older because they use cast iron and all
this<00:02:18.830> newer<00:02:19.040> crap<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.550> use<00:02:19.700> aluminum<00:02:20.450> so

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.990 
what I was thinking well cut that off
and<00:03:36.019> I<00:03:36.860> was<00:03:37.010> thinking<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.430> putting<00:03:37.760> like<00:03:37.970> a

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
and I was thinking of putting like a

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.380 
and I was thinking of putting like a
filler<00:03:39.160> just<00:03:40.160> a<00:03:40.340> street<00:03:40.700> elbow<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.150> know<00:03:41.239> this

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
filler just a street elbow you know this

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.930 
filler just a street elbow you know this
isn't<00:03:41.570> a<00:03:41.660> street<00:03:41.870> l<00:03:41.989> Buster's<00:03:42.320> regular<00:03:42.620> but<00:03:43.549> an

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
isn't a street l Buster's regular but an

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.170 
isn't a street l Buster's regular but an
elbow<00:03:44.299> here<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:44.570> use<00:03:44.900> that<00:03:45.049> as<00:03:45.200> a<00:03:45.290> filler<00:03:45.530> and

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
elbow here and use that as a filler and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.830 
elbow here and use that as a filler and
then<00:03:47.180> put<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.690> drain<00:03:47.930> in<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.170> bottom<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:50.750> he

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
then put a drain in the bottom and he

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.060 
then put a drain in the bottom and he
sort<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.110> liked<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:51.290> idea<00:03:51.530> but<00:03:51.799> he<00:03:51.890> came<00:03:52.010> up

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
sort of liked that idea but he came up

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.800 
sort of liked that idea but he came up
with<00:03:52.280> even<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.519> better<00:03:52.670> idea<00:03:52.790> he<00:03:53.540> liked<00:03:53.720> the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.340 
idea of cutting off and cleaning it up
make<00:03:55.459> it<00:03:55.489> look<00:03:55.670> good<00:03:55.850> he<00:03:56.810> came<00:03:57.019> up<00:03:57.170> with<00:03:57.200> an

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
make it look good he came up with an

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.280 
make it look good he came up with an
idea<00:03:57.470> of<00:03:58.570> actually<00:03:59.570> putting<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.840> hole<00:04:00.049> in<00:04:00.230> a

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
idea of actually putting a hole in a

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.420 
idea of actually putting a hole in a
block<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:02.750> dipstick<00:04:03.110> and<00:04:03.470> filling<00:04:04.370> it

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
block and a dipstick and filling it

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.650 
block and a dipstick and filling it
there<00:04:04.640> so<00:04:04.820> that<00:04:04.940> would<00:04:05.000> be<00:04:05.120> that<00:04:05.390> would<00:04:05.450> clean

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
there so that would be that would clean

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.660 
there so that would be that would clean
everything<00:04:05.930> up<00:04:06.019> even<00:04:06.290> more<00:04:06.440> so<00:04:07.430> I<00:04:07.459> like<00:04:07.640> that

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
everything up even more so I like that

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.090 
everything up even more so I like that
idea<00:04:07.880> so<00:04:08.209> I<00:04:08.239> think<00:04:08.450> we're<00:04:08.540> gonna<00:04:08.630> go<00:04:08.840> with<00:04:08.930> that

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
idea so I think we're gonna go with that

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.190 
idea so I think we're gonna go with that
and<00:04:10.100> I'm<00:04:10.760> gonna<00:04:11.030> wind<00:04:11.209> up<00:04:11.360> cutting<00:04:11.810> this<00:04:11.959> last

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
and I'm gonna wind up cutting this last

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.819 
and I'm gonna wind up cutting this last
one<00:04:12.410> off

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
one off

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.150 
one off
before<00:04:13.820> we<00:04:13.910> do<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.150> all<00:04:14.269> so<00:04:14.510> let's<00:04:15.380> uh<00:04:15.470> let's

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
that would've been the easiest thing to

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.339 
that would've been the easiest thing to
do<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:20.270> hardest<00:04:20.599> part<00:04:20.870> is<00:04:20.930> setting<00:04:21.200> it<00:04:21.289> up
