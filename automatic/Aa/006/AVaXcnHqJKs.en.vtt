00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
apart from the guy there we have a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
apart from the guy there we have a
secondary<00:00:57.989> guard<00:00:58.289> here<00:00:58.559> when<00:00:58.770> we're<00:00:58.920> actually

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
secondary guard here when we're actually

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.279 
secondary guard here when we're actually
using<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.850> hedge<00:01:00.030> coder<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.809> actually<00:01:01.170> made<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
using the hedge coder we actually made a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.439 
using the hedge coder we actually made a
mistake<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:01.980> dropped<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:02.730> onto<00:01:03.329> my

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.240 
prolonged abuse okay
so<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.140> move<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.530> Porter<00:01:37.860> along<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
so if we move just Porter along the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
so if we move just Porter along the
machine<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.110> normal

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
machine here we can see here for normal

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.469 
machine here we can see here for normal
operation<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.430> handle<00:01:41.759> angling<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:42.360> is

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
operation the handle angling here is

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.420 
operation the handle angling here is
absolutely<00:01:42.659> perfect<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.890> would<00:01:44.040> say<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.399> we

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
absolutely perfect but would say if we

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.240 
absolutely perfect but would say if we
were<00:01:44.670> actually<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.649> if<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.770> were<00:01:46.860> talking<00:01:47.040> a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
were actually and if we were talking a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.249 
were actually and if we were talking a
hedge<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.759> if<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:47.939> wanted<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.240> walk<00:01:48.420> at<00:01:49.110> an

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
hedge but if we wanted a walk at an

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.080 
hedge but if we wanted a walk at an
angle<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.829> we're<00:01:50.009> walking<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> side<00:01:50.759> here

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
angle and we're walking on the side here

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.179 
angle and we're walking on the side here
ideal<00:01:51.750> here<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.439> pull<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.799> lever<00:01:53.040> here

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
ideal here is to pull this lever here

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.370 
ideal here is to pull this lever here
and<00:01:53.549> now<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.329> handle<00:01:54.720> here<00:01:54.869> or<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.229> can

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and now we have a handle here or we can

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.590 
and now we have a handle here or we can
walk<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.009> now<00:01:56.579> another<00:01:56.939> setting<00:01:57.420> on

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
walk like this now another setting on

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.090 
walk like this now another setting on
which<00:01:58.079> I'm<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.500> demonstrate<00:01:58.920> in

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
which I'm just going to demonstrate in

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.889 
which I'm just going to demonstrate in
the<00:01:59.159> static<00:01:59.430> position<00:01:59.790> here<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.689> pull

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the static position here is if we pull

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.740 
the static position here is if we pull
this<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.320> rotate<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> back<00:02:02.149> it<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.420> get<00:02:03.600> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
this and rotate it back it can get it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.200 
this and rotate it back it can get it
for<00:02:04.020> five<00:02:04.290> degrees<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.520> ideal<00:02:05.820> reason

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
for five degrees and the ideal reason

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.540 
for five degrees and the ideal reason
that<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.420> might<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.689> ideal

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
that this might be ideal

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.100 
that this might be ideal
in<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:07.640> car<00:02:07.880> of<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.090> hedge<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.660> might<00:02:08.840> be<00:02:08.960> nice

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
in a car of the hedge it might be nice

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.840 
in a car of the hedge it might be nice
to<00:02:09.140> have<00:02:09.320> the<00:02:09.500> handle<00:02:09.800> shaped<00:02:10.010> like<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.370> that

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
to have the handle shaped like that that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.510 
to have the handle shaped like that that
works<00:02:11.090> quite<00:02:11.270> well<00:02:11.300> now<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:12.350> terms<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.950> what

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
works quite well now in terms of what

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.100 
works quite well now in terms of what
type<00:02:13.640> of<00:02:13.700> petrol<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.180> takes<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.630> takes<00:02:14.810> two

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
type of petrol it takes it takes two

we have a choke here and also we have a

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
priming pump here now it's the first

up<00:02:49.580> with<00:02:49.760> petrol<00:02:50.090> what<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.630> have<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.870> do<00:02:50.990> is

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
up with petrol what you have to do is

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.560 
up with petrol what you have to do is
maybe<00:02:51.290> pump<00:02:51.590> this<00:02:51.770> about<00:02:52.010> six<00:02:52.220> times<00:02:52.490> just<00:02:53.420> to

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
maybe pump this about six times just to

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.240 
maybe pump this about six times just to
feed<00:02:53.780> petrol<00:02:54.200> into<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.590> carburetor

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
feed petrol into the carburetor

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.060 
feed petrol into the carburetor
in<00:02:55.910> normal<00:02:56.330> operation<00:02:56.390> would<00:02:57.050> say<00:02:57.260> if<00:02:57.920> you're

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
in normal operation would say if you're

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.620 
in normal operation would say if you're
starting<00:02:58.310> from<00:02:58.400> cold<00:02:58.730> maybe<00:02:59.030> pump<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.450> three

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
starting from cold maybe pump it three

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.480 
starting from cold maybe pump it three
times<00:02:59.930> but<00:03:00.470> if<00:03:00.590> you've<00:03:00.710> already<00:03:00.830> just<00:03:01.220> used

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
times but if you've already just used

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.220 
times but if you've already just used
machine<00:03:01.850> in<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.150> recent<00:03:02.450> past<00:03:02.570> you<00:03:03.020> won't

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
machine in the recent past you won't

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.990 
machine in the recent past you won't
need<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.440> pump<00:03:03.680> this<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.100> indeed<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:04.670> may<00:03:04.820> not

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
need to pump this and indeed you may not

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.590 
need to pump this and indeed you may not
even<00:03:05.270> need<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.600> use<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.380> choke<00:03:06.740> Amish<00:03:07.600> and

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
even need to use the the choke Amish and

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.300 
even need to use the the choke Amish and
there's<00:03:09.170> an<00:03:09.290> on/off<00:03:09.590> switch<00:03:09.620> near<00:03:10.100> when

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
there's an on/off switch near when

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.590 
there's an on/off switch near when
you're<00:03:10.400> going<00:03:10.490> to<00:03:10.550> demonstrate<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:11.060> here<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:11.570> I

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
you're going to demonstrate it here so I

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.350 
you're going to demonstrate it here so I
push<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.020> forward<00:03:12.440> it's<00:03:12.590> am<00:03:13.220> stop<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.180> if<00:03:14.270> I

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
push it forward it's am stop and if I

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.640 
push it forward it's am stop and if I
pull<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.630> back<00:03:14.660> it's<00:03:14.989> in<00:03:15.110> it's<00:03:15.380> in<00:03:15.530> the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
pull it back it's in it's in the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.170 
pull it back it's in it's in the
standard<00:03:15.950> position<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.820> what<00:03:16.910> I'm<00:03:17.000> going<00:03:17.120> to

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
standard position so what I'm going to

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.090 
standard position so what I'm going to
do<00:03:17.300> here<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.660> just<00:03:17.840> very<00:03:18.050> quickly<00:03:18.320> I<00:03:18.620> could

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
do here is just very quickly I could

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.699 
do here is just very quickly I could
push<00:03:19.790> over<00:03:20.090> this<00:03:20.239> choke<00:03:20.540> here<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.020> start<00:03:21.530> it

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
push over this choke here and start it

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.160 
push over this choke here and start it
and<00:03:21.920> so<00:03:22.580> am<00:03:22.970> well<00:03:23.510> probably<00:03:23.720> going<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.020> do<00:03:24.080> in

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
and so am well probably going to do in

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.510 
and so am well probably going to do in
this<00:03:24.260> situation<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.770> not<00:03:24.950> use<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.340> choke

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
this situation is not use the choke

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.729 
this situation is not use the choke
because<00:03:25.760> we've<00:03:26.060> used<00:03:26.270> it<00:03:26.390> recently<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:27.020> what

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
because we've used it recently and what

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:28.900 
because we've used it recently and what
I'm<00:03:27.830> going<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.040> do<00:03:28.160> is<00:03:28.370> I'm<00:03:28.550> just<00:03:28.580> going<00:03:28.820> to
