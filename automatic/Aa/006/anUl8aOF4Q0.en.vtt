00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
think about it when theater was

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.679 
think about it when theater was
introduced<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.700> black<00:01:29.939> ops<00:01:30.180> that's<00:01:30.420> when

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
introduced in black ops that's when

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.330 
introduced in black ops that's when
people<00:01:30.840> started<00:01:31.350> complaining<00:01:31.680> about<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.070> bunch

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
people started complaining about a bunch

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.490 
people started complaining about a bunch
more<00:01:32.549> lag<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.119> before<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.020> equation

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
more lag and before that the equation

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.289 
more lag and before that the equation
was<00:01:34.770> totally<00:01:35.159> fine<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.549> that's<00:01:35.850> why<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.090> used

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
was totally fine and that's why you used

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.469 
was totally fine and that's why you used
assassin<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.290> search<00:01:37.850> bar<00:01:38.850> Pete<00:01:39.030> sensing

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
assassin and search bar Pete sensing

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.749 
assassin and search bar Pete sensing
motherfuckers<00:01:40.110> anyway<00:01:40.770> back<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.579> whole

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
motherfuckers anyway back to my whole

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.850 
motherfuckers anyway back to my whole
thing<00:01:42.000> pretty<00:01:42.689> much<00:01:42.810> theater<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.530> one

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
thing pretty much theater is the one

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.499 
thing pretty much theater is the one
thing<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:44.250> added<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> equation<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
thing they added to the equation that

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.450 
thing they added to the equation that
caused<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.869> lot<00:01:45.990> more<00:01:46.020> lag<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:47.100> there's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
caused a lot more lag because there's

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.249 
caused a lot more lag because there's
always<00:01:47.640> data<00:01:47.970> being<00:01:48.240> recorded<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
always data being recorded and this and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.480 
always data being recorded and this and
that<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.590> really<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.100> does<00:01:50.250> mess

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
that and I really think it does mess

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.460 
that and I really think it does mess
things<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.899> even<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.290> off

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
things up and you can even have it off

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.230 
things up and you can even have it off
in<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.740> game<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.340> what<00:01:53.549> she<00:01:53.759> knows<00:01:53.909> all<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
in this game and what she knows all the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.730 
in this game and what she knows all the
more<00:01:54.390> reason<00:01:54.540> why<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:55.170> why<00:01:55.320> would<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.590> give

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
more reason why like why would they give

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.740 
more reason why like why would they give
you<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> option<00:01:56.100> unless<00:01:56.549> somehow<00:01:57.090> benefited

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.550 
you even with theater off it's still
kind<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.119> laggy<00:02:00.329> because<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.290> know<00:02:01.380> other

kind of laggy because you know other

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.080 
kind of laggy because you know other
people<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:02.700> recording

specialist<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.600> best<00:02:54.780> in<00:02:54.990> search<00:02:55.200> but

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
specialist the best in search but

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.110 
specialist the best in search but
overall<00:02:56.280> for<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.490> maps<00:02:56.670> in<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:56.910> game

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
overall for the maps in this game

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.550 
overall for the maps in this game
search-and-destroy<00:02:57.570> in<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:57.990> game<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.320> very

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
search-and-destroy in this game is very

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.140 
search-and-destroy in this game is very
awkward<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:59.310> lot<00:02:59.460> of<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.640> time<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.850> feel<00:03:00.090> like

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
awkward a lot of the time I feel like

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.880 
awkward a lot of the time I feel like
some<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.600> bomb<00:03:00.780> places<00:03:01.140> are<00:03:01.440> just<00:03:01.650> kind<00:03:01.830> of

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
some of the bomb places are just kind of

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.130 
some of the bomb places are just kind of
out<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.190> blue<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.850> when<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.870> know<00:03:03.960> one

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
out of the blue and when you know one

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.780 
out of the blue and when you know one
sides<00:03:04.380> on<00:03:04.590> offense<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.280> should<00:03:05.520> be<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.760> other

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
sides on offense it should be the other

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.430 
sides on offense it should be the other
way<00:03:05.940> around<00:03:06.300> where<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.840> offense<00:03:07.290> and

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
way around where like offense and

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.690 
way around where like offense and
defense<00:03:07.740> should<00:03:07.920> be<00:03:07.980> flip<00:03:08.280> fought<00:03:08.490> for

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
defense should be flip fought for

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.640 
defense should be flip fought for
certain<00:03:08.940> maps<00:03:09.090> like<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.570> think<00:03:09.840> bill<00:03:09.990> in

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
certain maps like I think bill in

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.440 
certain maps like I think bill in
general<00:03:11.220> could<00:03:11.370> benefit<00:03:11.730> from<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:11.970> and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
general could benefit from that and

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.030 
general could benefit from that and
there's<00:03:12.960> just<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.200> lot<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.410> little<00:03:13.560> things<00:03:13.890> like

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
there's just a lot of little things like

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.370 
there's just a lot of little things like
that<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.490> my<00:03:14.760> theory<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.750> map<00:03:15.930> soul<00:03:16.200> and

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
that and my theory is the map soul and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.920 
that and my theory is the map soul and
this<00:03:16.470> game<00:03:16.650> really<00:03:16.890> suck<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.400> because<00:03:18.180> back<00:03:18.780> in

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
this game really suck is because back in

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.530 
this game really suck is because back in
2009<00:03:19.470> or<00:03:19.739> whatever<00:03:19.980> when<00:03:20.220> Vince<00:03:20.850> Zampella<00:03:20.940> and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
2009 or whatever when Vince Zampella and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.390 
2009 or whatever when Vince Zampella and
the<00:03:21.600> other<00:03:21.720> Infinity<00:03:22.290> Ward<00:03:22.470> had<00:03:22.620> dude<00:03:22.860> when

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
the other Infinity Ward had dude when

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.760 
the other Infinity Ward had dude when
they<00:03:23.640> got<00:03:23.820> fired<00:03:24.180> then<00:03:24.570> like<00:03:24.780> 4050<00:03:25.290> people

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
they got fired then like 4050 people

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.560 
they got fired then like 4050 people
left<00:03:25.980> Infinity<00:03:26.489> Ward<00:03:26.700> those<00:03:26.970> forty<00:03:27.360> or<00:03:27.480> fifty

left Infinity Ward those forty or fifty
people<00:03:27.900> were<00:03:28.170> probably<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.739> multiplayer<00:03:29.250> map

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
people were probably the multiplayer map

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.460 
people were probably the multiplayer map
designer<00:03:29.910> people<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.570> then<00:03:31.230> we<00:03:31.350> had

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
designer people and then we had

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.229 
designer people and then we had
sledgehammer<00:03:32.040> games<00:03:32.160> go<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.760> make<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.030> maps

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
sledgehammer games go and make the maps

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.580 
sledgehammer games go and make the maps
and<00:03:33.480> honestly<00:03:33.810> they<00:03:34.080> don't<00:03:34.170> feel<00:03:34.410> like
