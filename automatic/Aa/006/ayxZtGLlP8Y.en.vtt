00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.280
 welcome to online training 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.650
 fester 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.629
 the placement of metallic elements in 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.240
 slabs can cause problems of 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.710
 moisture and water leaks due to 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.230
 bad grip of the system 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.689
 impervious to metal surface 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.930
 the recommended solution to prevent 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.910
 this type of problem is the system 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.090
 prefabricated waterproofing fester 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.699
 mit with polyester reinforcement membrane and 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.089
 modified with styrene butadiene sbs 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.010
 Styrene remember to check the list of 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:43.250
 tools and safety equipment a 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.270
 use attach this module 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.270
 step 1 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.690
 remove the waterproof systems 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.769
 existing in the metal parts and 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.769
 clean the surface well 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.350
 in case the plate is found 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.420
 oxidized remove the oxide by means of 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.100
 sandpaper or steel brushes and clean with 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.100
 a cloth moistened in solvent 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.600
 in case you have new equipment without 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.000
 Coatings only clean with a 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.220
 rag moistened the solvent if the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.410
 sheet presents coatings remove 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.210
 the ones with a sandpaper until arriving at the steel and 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.210
 Remove dust with a dampened cloth 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.119
 Step 2 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.040
 apply a layer of primary and 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.930
 first to 5 meter performance 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.930
 square per liters and let dry 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.219
 reinforces the critical points as 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.439
 vertices between the mine and floor or between the 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:48.750
 mine and the mine with a piece of fester 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.750
 my smooth psss 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.410
 metal water downpipes should 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.410
 be treated as critical points 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.480
 in case there is a goose neck 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.719
 metallic these must be reinforced 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.780
 making a cut of fester mit psss 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:31.239
 smooth in the form of segments proceed to place 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.829
 the cutout in the metallic tube melting 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.829
 and settling correctly 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.140
 step 3 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.459
 present and align the section to be placed 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.950
 hot with a special torch for 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.870
 prefabricated the lower face of a 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.000
 section of the mantle to melt the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.819
 transparent film that has integrated 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.989
 and press it lightly to effect 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.989
 that loose by vulcanization 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.260
 repeat this operation as you 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.260
 they are placing the following sections 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.170
 I left behind the 10 centimeter weight 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.050
 the sides and 10 centimeters at the end of 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.570
 Each section adheres by vulcanization the 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.580
 section back the pair by pressing the layer 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.320
 lower so that it spits 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.910
 approximately one centimeter of 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.910
 asphaltic material by its edge 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.390
 once the application of the 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.030
 fester can put me in use 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.000
 immediately the performance of the 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.790
 product is 8.9 square meters per 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.790
 roll your problem is solved 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.500
 esther mit psss can also be 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:32.920
 used to give solution in homes with 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.920
 slab monolithic prefabricated roof 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.310
 parking lots with bearing layers 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.570
 and planters 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.319
 of races that will receive stone finishes 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.319
 foundations 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.319
 Jacuzzis 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.650
 swimming pools / flats 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.580
 when applying the waterproofing solution 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:03.449
 prefabricated fester my psss will get the 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.340
 following advantages uniform thickness is 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.470
 the prefabricated waterproofing in its 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.780
 gender of greatest guarantee and durability 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.180
 in the market because of its great flexibility 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.020
 allows you to adapt to movements 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.280
 structural elements without losing their grip 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.919
 resistant to thermal movements 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.949
 structural resistant to conditions 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:27.000
 underground or in permanent contact with 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:28.770
 fast water high application 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.389
 performance in square meters per 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.680
 man hours does not contain solvents 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.050
 we hope that the fester training 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.030
 has been of your use if you want 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.340

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.570
 foundation to the roof fester 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.570
 we protect what you build
