00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.950
 Russia and Cuba 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.440
 so now let 's do the hair 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.840
 I divided my hair into two half hours 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.730
 on and well today i want to screw 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.470
 hair with such a curling 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.860
 remington it's big enough 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.410
 diameter and it's easier for me to twist my hair and 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.070
 when I divide them into 2 by 2 half 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:54.730
 that was a hundred crappy skills that's me 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.190
 so much more convenient this curling 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.470
 gives a very beautiful natural such 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.390
 large curls 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.880
 so let's get started 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.280
 one side of the hair I look gum 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.430
 so that it does not interfere always when I twist 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.070
 hair i start with bottom strands then all 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.400
 I take the hair here this vidos give up 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:20.980
 extra hair so that they do not bother me and 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.960
 attack any kind of crab like I 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.420
 I will not use as usual that we 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.880
 leave the hair clamp them with 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:31.300
 here it is now there is no clamp i won't 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:35.040
 I like to use twist more 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.040
 hair like this 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:44.049
 curling hair on top 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:47.439
 slightly twisting and holding a few 

00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:50.679
 seconds probably seconds 15 and then hellish 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:54.639
 you see see it turns out large 

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:56.799
 such a natural curl a little bit 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.419
 curled hair how do i 

00:05:56.799 --> 00:06:00.419
 I'll do with all the hair 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.990
 I also like when I let go of the voice from 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.780
 the flesh 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.470
 hold them so they fixed 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:23.310
 the form is thus cooled and then 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.310
 a few seconds later I let go 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.700
 when I get to 5 which is 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:33.390
 near the face I am in the opposite direction 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:36.880
 twisting like that 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:40.480
 hair was clogged from the face then it 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.150
 It looks better and more convenient Well 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.910
 one side done screwed up now 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:49.820
 I turn from the other hundred from this side 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:51.870
 do absolutely the same thing I 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:59.550
 take a garden 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:59.550
 downstairs excess hair pin up 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:21.419
 then all the hair rolled now I'm good 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:27.789
 fingers 

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:29.819
 very neatly lengthen it 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:34.779
 neat and still enough 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:37.689
 natural waves are obtained like this 

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:40.930
 Here I have a very styling and 

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:42.819

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:50.229
 quickly wound very naturally 

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:52.360
