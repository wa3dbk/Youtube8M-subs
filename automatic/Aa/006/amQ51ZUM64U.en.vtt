timbres<00:00:48.000> from<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.440> a-frame<00:00:49.440> we're<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.769> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
timbres from the a-frame we're going to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.619 
timbres from the a-frame we're going to
go<00:00:51.079> resting<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.500> one<00:00:52.890> point<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:56.510> we<00:00:57.510> go

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
go resting on just one point now we go

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.299 
go resting on just one point now we go
to<00:00:57.690> build<00:00:57.930> an<00:00:58.050> a-frame<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.559> support<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.219> we

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
to build an a-frame to support it so we

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:12.560 
to build an a-frame to support it so we
can<00:00:59.460> make<00:00:59.579> those<00:00:59.760> last<00:00:59.969> cuts

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:23.609 

I'm<00:01:19.860> gonna<00:01:21.840> well<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:22.930> think<00:01:23.020> we<00:01:23.290> can<00:01:23.409> trust

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
I'm gonna well I think we can trust

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.550 

the<00:01:48.789> idea<00:01:49.090> is<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.450> put<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:50.020> board<00:01:50.320> on<00:01:50.470> the

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
the idea is to put this board on the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.370 
the idea is to put this board on the
ground<00:01:50.830> we<00:01:51.729> got<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.910> couple<00:01:52.179> of<00:01:52.360> four<00:01:52.960> by<00:01:53.140> eights

and<00:01:54.820> we're<00:01:55.000> going<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.149> put<00:01:55.390> them<00:01:55.509> on<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:56.050> base

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
and we're going to put them on the base

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:57.770 
and we're going to put them on the base
we<00:01:56.560> got<00:01:56.679> to<00:01:56.770> cut<00:01:56.920> them<00:01:57.039> to<00:01:57.250> match<00:01:57.429> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
we got to cut them to match the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.270 
we got to cut them to match the

foundation here and put them up in the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.669 
foundation here and put them up in the
notch<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.789> tree<00:02:01.289> nail<00:02:02.289> them<00:02:02.500> together

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
notch and the tree nail them together

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.910 
notch and the tree nail them together
with<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.159> sideboard<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.300> then<00:02:04.710> pressure<00:02:05.710> this
