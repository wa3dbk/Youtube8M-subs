wasn't real compact small and tight this
was<00:01:50.490> more<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:51.180> little<00:01:51.780> bit<00:01:51.990> open<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.950> doctors

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
was more a little bit open like doctors

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.429 
was more a little bit open like doctors
are<00:01:53.490> cradling<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.060> ball<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.479> stuff<00:01:54.659> they're

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
are cradling the ball and stuff they're

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.280 
are cradling the ball and stuff they're
similar<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.759> think<00:01:57.090> doc<00:01:57.509> had<00:01:57.750> more<00:01:58.020> power

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
similar but I think doc had more power

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.270 
similar but I think doc had more power
in<00:01:58.439> events<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.070> think<00:01:59.850> Vince<00:02:00.540> had

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.910 

I<00:02:04.310> think<00:02:05.030> her<00:02:05.299> localized<00:02:05.869> Vince<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.619> better

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
I think her localized Vince is better

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.790 
I think her localized Vince is better
than<00:02:07.159> dr.<00:02:07.490> J<00:02:07.700> going<00:02:08.509> upward<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.259> think<00:02:09.530> Vince

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
than dr. J going upward I think Vince

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.080 
than dr. J going upward I think Vince
gets<00:02:10.160> up<00:02:10.429> higher

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
gets up higher

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.619 
gets up higher
I<00:02:11.120> think<00:02:11.450> doc<00:02:11.720> hangs<00:02:12.140> longer<00:02:12.830> then<00:02:13.280> days

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
I think doc hangs longer then days

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.990 
I think doc hangs longer then days
that's<00:02:14.629> how<00:02:14.690> I<00:02:15.019> think<00:02:15.080> doc<00:02:15.470> can<00:02:16.129> hang<00:02:16.459> in<00:02:16.910> the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
that's how I think doc can hang in the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.330 
that's how I think doc can hang in the
air<00:02:17.030> but<00:02:17.360> any<00:02:17.629> time<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.260> think<00:02:18.560> far<00:02:19.099> is<00:02:19.220> a

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
air but any time I think far is a

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.940 
air but any time I think far is a
vertical<00:02:19.819> leap<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.269> think<00:02:20.569> Vince<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.319> better<00:02:21.620> I

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
vertical leap I think Vince is better I

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.250 
vertical leap I think Vince is better I
think<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.640> can<00:02:22.940> get<00:02:23.120> up<00:02:23.390> higher<00:02:23.690> over<00:02:23.870> the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
think this can get up higher over the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.009 
think this can get up higher over the
rim<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.280> think<00:02:25.549> doc<00:02:25.849> can<00:02:26.180> jump<00:02:26.780> farther

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
rim and I think doc can jump farther

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.809 
rim and I think doc can jump farther
from<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.560> ramp<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:27.950> dunk<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.400> ball<00:02:28.549> better

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
from the ramp to dunk the ball better

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.059 
from the ramp to dunk the ball better
thanks<00:02:29.390> they're<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.110> similar<00:02:30.500> when<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.890> look
