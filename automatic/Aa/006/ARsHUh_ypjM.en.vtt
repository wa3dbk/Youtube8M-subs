close to the stuff crank it down and

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.039 
close to the stuff crank it down and
pause<00:01:30.189> it<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.759> they've<00:01:30.939> hit<00:01:31.240> it<00:01:31.420> that<00:01:31.630> rod<00:01:31.810> has

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
I like the 661 ratio and I'm throwing a

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.940 
I like the 661 ratio and I'm throwing a
square<00:01:43.389> bill<00:01:43.599> because<00:01:43.899> I<00:01:44.049> can<00:01:44.289> speed<00:01:44.679> it<00:01:44.709> up

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
square bill because I can speed it up

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.279 
square bill because I can speed it up
and<00:01:45.249> I<00:01:45.609> can<00:01:45.789> also<00:01:45.969> slow<00:01:46.419> it<00:01:46.599> down<00:01:46.630> it's<00:01:47.020> kind<00:01:47.200> of

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
and I can also slow it down it's kind of

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.679 
and I can also slow it down it's kind of
that<00:01:47.439> happy<00:01:48.009> medium<00:01:48.369> in<00:01:48.520> between<00:01:48.549> but<00:01:49.450> this

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
that happy medium in between but this

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.019
