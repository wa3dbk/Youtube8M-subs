is how I got this idea of the recipe I
got<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.560> recipe<00:01:35.740> off<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.130> BBC<00:01:36.850> internet<00:01:39.510> it's

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
got the recipe off the BBC internet it's

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.200 
got the recipe off the BBC internet it's
easy<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:41.080> look<00:01:41.200> at<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:41.619> just<00:01:41.830> google<00:01:42.159> it<00:01:42.310> look

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
easy to look at you just google it look

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.149 
easy to look at you just google it look
up<00:01:43.360> British<00:01:43.810> pancakes<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.680> there<00:01:44.860> it<00:01:44.979> goes

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
up British pancakes and there it goes

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.270 
up British pancakes and there it goes
but<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.570> hard<00:01:46.780> part<00:01:46.840> is<00:01:47.260> knowing<00:01:47.619> the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
but the hard part is knowing the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.280 
but the hard part is knowing the
consistency<00:01:49.000> is<00:01:49.150> kind<00:01:49.479> of<00:01:49.570> like<00:01:49.689> really<00:01:50.140> a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
consistency is kind of like really a

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.080 
consistency is kind of like really a
crepe<00:01:50.680> but<00:01:51.040> it's<00:01:51.220> thicker<00:01:51.549> than<00:01:51.790> a<00:01:51.880> crepe

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
crepe but it's thicker than a crepe

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.940 
crepe but it's thicker than a crepe
that's<00:01:52.330> probably<00:01:52.659> more<00:01:52.869> like<00:01:53.080> two<00:01:53.770> or<00:01:53.920> three

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
that's probably more like two or three

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.340 
that's probably more like two or three
crepes<00:01:54.610> put<00:01:55.000> together<00:01:55.299> but<00:01:55.630> it's<00:01:55.780> not<00:01:55.990> like<00:01:56.229> an

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
crepes put together but it's not like an

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.320 
crepes put together but it's not like an
American<00:01:56.799> pancake<00:01:57.250> which<00:01:57.460> is<00:01:57.640> usually<00:01:58.030> thick

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
American pancake which is usually thick

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.749 
American pancake which is usually thick
but<00:01:59.170> these<00:01:59.320> are<00:01:59.470> really<00:01:59.619> nice<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.400> once

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
but these are really nice and once

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.789 
but these are really nice and once
they're<00:02:01.000> done<00:02:01.240> I'll<00:02:01.630> show<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.049> how<00:02:02.350> we<00:02:02.409> wrap

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
need a lot of butter this is the

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.050 
need a lot of butter this is the
fattening<00:02:32.019> part<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.380> these<00:02:32.560> but<00:02:32.890> it's<00:02:33.550> not<00:02:33.760> so

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
fattening part of these but it's not so

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.059 
fattening part of these but it's not so
bad<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:38.200> then<00:02:38.500> i<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:40.180> my<00:02:40.269> mixture<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.140> it's

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
bad and then i have my mixture and it's

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.350 
bad and then i have my mixture and it's
going<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.280> look<00:02:42.519> thin<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.760> depends<00:02:46.060> on<00:02:46.180> how

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
going to look thin and it depends on how

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.289 
going to look thin and it depends on how
big<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:46.720> want<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.100> from<00:02:48.100> here<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.400> kind<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.880> try

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
big you want it from here I kind of try

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.210 
big you want it from here I kind of try
and<00:02:49.360> coax<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.900> because<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.440> pan<00:02:50.709> is<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.920> little

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
and coax it because this pan is a little

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.030 
and coax it because this pan is a little
tilted<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:52.420> know<00:02:52.569> how<00:02:52.720> we<00:02:52.780> do<00:02:53.080> we<00:02:53.319> work<00:02:53.830> with

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
tilted you know how we do we work with

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.570 
tilted you know how we do we work with
what<00:02:54.190> we<00:02:54.310> got<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.810> make<00:02:56.019> sure<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.709> stays<00:02:57.069> but

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
what we got and make sure it stays but

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.640 
what we got and make sure it stays but
you<00:02:57.970> know<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.299> lines<00:02:58.510> start<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.140> put<00:02:59.380> pretty

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
you know the lines start to put pretty

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.710 
you know the lines start to put pretty
quickly<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.880> make<00:03:01.030> sure<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.330> batter<00:03:01.510> is

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
quickly and I make sure the batter is

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.289 
quickly and I make sure the batter is
even<00:03:02.140> on<00:03:02.739> all<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.280> size<00:03:05.549> now<00:03:06.549> this<00:03:06.670> pan<00:03:06.940> gets<00:03:07.209> a

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
even on all the size now this pan gets a

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.910 
even on all the size now this pan gets a
little<00:03:07.450> tilted<00:03:07.900> after<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.290> while<00:03:08.470> doing<00:03:08.739> it

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
little tilted after a while doing it
