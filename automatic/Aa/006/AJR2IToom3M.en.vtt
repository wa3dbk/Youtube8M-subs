 hands his tanker rivals 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:40.430
 I did not imagine at all that they had 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.430
 could make a drawing as perfection 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.830
 hello welcome to the small studio 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.360
 Creation 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.020
 you have an idea a little bit for 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.930
 your car of your dreams makes you a 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.420
 little drawing and after we leave ok 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.720
 well right now i'm expecting 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.500
 especially a lot of imagination 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.660
 with pretty new ideas is enough 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.119
 quite liberated from the technical constraints 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.869
 today that are taxed in the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.320
 world of the automotive industry l eepad 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.320
 engine 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.640
 she could be hyper tonic 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.710
 she can also go in the water again 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.660
 ideas me I wanted can not either 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.660
 we start with freedom 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:59.260
 we can add we played like that oh 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.260
 we do not have the money 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.200
 so children did you do you 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.360
 have drawn the car of your dreams 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.040
 it's a rocket car a bit like a 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.840
 car subject boat because I did 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.880
 in Sarajevo to these lines she actually 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.600
 bottles and cans this is a 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.460
 really dynamic car this one is going 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.410
 super fast so you can go far and 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.910
 in the sky and in the water in fact one 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.010
 can go anywhere with okay but 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.310
 mamba hamas then this one we want 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.140
 lemaitre like that he will serve us 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.150
 model what all your concept it is 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.750
 super we will try to give him a 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.590
 shape even more what goes fast what ok 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.940
 like a flame like a rocket 3160 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.620
 so it really has to be 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.480
 super aerodynamic 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.430
 when the car and ride it has to be that 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.780
 the students are tidied up so he goes 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.970
 have to find where we can get them 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:11.550
 tidy up in the car when she rolls 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.920
 and that 's okay so here is going 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.040
 need a system to get in 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.670
 the wings so when there is too much 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.900
 age ball bottles and she walks 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.100
 so we can go where you 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.750
 jams 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.320
 well that's okay so we're going 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.380
 try to draw the heathland under here 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.730
 then we'll do the little cockpit here 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.010
 so that's where there will be another 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.450
 sir the little guy so he goes 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.730
 drive with a helmet to go to 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.849
 3600 km time 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.019
 it will be protected exactly so during 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.489
 this time in your head you go 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.920
 think about the name of the car 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.530
 you have time and then a little bit to his 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:04:07.900
 color and all that so we believe 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:04:08.769
 to give birth ah well yes we thought about 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.290
 name of the car 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.910
 she's called the choppy buddy and 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.489
 why did you choose the word the 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.579
 caravan bascou want it to be between 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.579
 11 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.520
 we 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:57.370
 that is to say I tried to be or more 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.020
 faithful anyway from their concept of 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.180
 base it was the car that was 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.580
 transformable who had a fuselage 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.229
 really airplane before automobiles 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.330
 were dream automobiles and 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.770
 that was it today about 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.569
 I was pretty proud of what he did 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.889
 it is especially that I was super happy 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:13.810
 he had a wonderful day 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.100
 it's exceptional when she counted 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.420
 seven years and 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.670
 when we live a day we 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.920
 request to draw a car it's a 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.410
 super project what the progression between 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.810
 the initial project very free very 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.160
 drawn up to the prototype 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.650
 that we have the impression to see in the 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.200
 insert from chez renault ago 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.660
 a real link from a little child's drawing 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.420
 we can make something of his 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:42.160
 breasts not believe it should come out in 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:44.410
 six advantages at a time suits them 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.650
 he found that she was Belgian and 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.500
 the more it sees that it evolves and me 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.700
 I would like too much exists like this if she 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.680
 is in second 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.310
 and well it will make a new car 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.310
 studio
