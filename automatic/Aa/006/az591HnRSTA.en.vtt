uh<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:49.229> reason<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.530> got<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.770> inglot<00:01:50.159> one<00:01:50.369> is

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
uh the reason I got the inglot one is

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.249 
uh the reason I got the inglot one is
because<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:51.210> was<00:01:51.329> kind<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.840> cheaper<00:01:52.110> than<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
because it was kind of cheaper than the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.039 
because it was kind of cheaper than the
mac<00:01:52.439> one<00:01:52.680> but<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.149> Mac<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.869> more
