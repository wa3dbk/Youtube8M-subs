right into a rapid growth touch

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.050 
right into a rapid growth touch
turbulent<00:01:30.240> yeah<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.219> turn<00:01:32.549> three

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
turbulent yeah so this is turn three

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.120 
turbulent yeah so this is turn three
right<00:01:33.270> now<00:01:33.500> yes<00:01:34.500> yep<00:01:34.979> turn<00:01:35.189> three<00:01:37.009> let's<00:01:38.009> see

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
right now yes yep turn three let's see

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.459 
right now yes yep turn three let's see
so<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.399> he<00:01:38.460> had<00:01:38.609> birds<00:01:38.969> and<00:01:39.090> turn<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:40.259> turn

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
so if he had birds and turn one in turn

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.580 
so if he had birds and turn one in turn
to<00:01:40.740> he<00:01:40.920> essentially<00:01:41.310> has<00:01:42.259> like<00:01:43.259> how<00:01:43.350> did<00:01:43.500> you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
to he essentially has like how did you

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.219 
to he essentially has like how did you
get<00:01:43.740> turn<00:01:43.979> 3<00:01:44.369> Titan<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.929> to<00:01:46.049> play

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.349 
get turn 3 Titan is you have to play
simulacrum<00:01:46.829> one<00:01:47.039> I<00:01:47.250> think<00:01:47.789> it's<00:01:47.880> turned<00:01:48.090> four

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
simulacrum one I think it's turned four

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.239 
simulacrum one I think it's turned four
time<00:01:48.570> or<00:01:48.689> turn<00:01:48.810> 4<00:01:49.049> 20<00:01:49.320> okay<00:01:49.649> yeah<00:01:49.799> sir<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.070> for

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
time or turn 4 20 okay yeah sir and for

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:52.130 
time or turn 4 20 okay yeah sir and for
I<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.969> might<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.179> like<00:01:51.299> birds<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.049> then

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
I think might be like birds and then

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.969 
I think might be like birds and then
need<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> rapid<00:01:52.829> growth<00:01:53.039> or<00:01:54.289> your<00:01:55.289> sons<00:01:56.450> yeah

is<00:04:23.210> there<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.360> colonel<00:04:23.690> tighten<00:04:23.990> in<00:04:24.080> this<00:04:24.110> list

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
is there a colonel tighten in this list

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.130 
is there a colonel tighten in this list
there's<00:04:25.130> two<00:04:25.310> main<00:04:25.490> board<00:04:25.700> two<00:04:26.210> that's<00:04:26.930> it<00:04:27.080> and

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
there's two main board two that's it and

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.680 
there's two main board two that's it and
then<00:04:27.950> how<00:04:28.070> many<00:04:28.130> Prime<00:04:28.430> Evils<00:04:28.580> are<00:04:28.910> there<00:04:29.060> four

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
then how many Prime Evils are there four

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.490 
then how many Prime Evils are there four
main<00:04:29.900> but<00:04:30.349> he's

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
main but he's

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.640 
main but he's
well<00:04:30.830> now<00:04:30.980> okay<00:04:34.330> so<00:04:35.330> his<00:04:35.660> guess<00:04:36.230> he's<00:04:36.410> going

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
well now okay so his guess he's going

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.110 
well now okay so his guess he's going
for<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:36.860> less<00:04:37.130> straightforward<00:04:37.670> approach

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
for a less straightforward approach

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.160 
for a less straightforward approach
because<00:04:38.540> that's<00:04:38.690> what<00:04:38.780> I<00:04:38.810> feel<00:04:38.930> like<00:04:38.990> that

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
because that's what I feel like that

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.510 
because that's what I feel like that
world's<00:04:39.440> deck<00:04:39.590> was<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:39.920> was<00:04:40.040> like<00:04:40.190> I'm<00:04:40.370> just

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
world's deck was it was like I'm just

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.740 
world's deck was it was like I'm just
going<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:40.790> play<00:04:40.970> as<00:04:41.090> many<00:04:41.210> Titans<00:04:41.630> as<00:04:41.720> I

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
going to play as many Titans as I

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.780 
going to play as many Titans as I
possibly<00:04:41.960> can<00:04:42.380> because<00:04:43.010> like<00:04:43.370> that's<00:04:43.460> all<00:04:43.670> it

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
possibly can because like that's all it

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.580 
possibly can because like that's all it
did<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.360> then<00:04:44.480> it<00:04:44.600> you<00:04:44.930> know<00:04:45.050> how<00:04:45.200> two<00:04:45.260> sinks

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
did and then it you know how two sinks

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.380 
did and then it you know how two sinks
month<00:04:45.800> but<00:04:46.490> I<00:04:46.520> guess<00:04:46.550> his<00:04:46.790> deck<00:04:46.970> has<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.180> little

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
month but I guess his deck has a little

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.770 
month but I guess his deck has a little
bit<00:04:47.600> more<00:04:47.840> diversity<00:04:48.830> in<00:04:48.920> it<00:04:49.160> yeah<00:04:49.850> nor

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
bit more diversity in it yeah nor

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.330 
bit more diversity in it yeah nor
infinite<00:04:51.140> there's<00:04:51.320> a<00:04:51.380> lot<00:04:51.500> of<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.770> gross<00:04:52.130> so

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
infinite there's a lot of a gross so

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.820 
infinite there's a lot of a gross so
he's<00:04:52.460> playing<00:04:52.700> more<00:04:52.850> of<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:53.320> you<00:04:54.320> know<00:04:54.380> clear

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
he's playing more of a you know clear

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.580 
he's playing more of a you know clear
the<00:04:54.950> board<00:04:55.130> make<00:04:55.370> way<00:04:55.520> for<00:04:55.580> my<00:04:55.790> Titans<00:04:56.590> that

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
the board make way for my Titans that

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
the board make way for my Titans that
sort<00:04:57.800> of<00:04:57.830> thing<00:04:57.890> that's<00:04:58.130> why<00:04:58.220> there's<00:04:58.370> four

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
sort of thing that's why there's four

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.000 
sort of thing that's why there's four
blasts<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.510> three<00:04:59.960> main<00:05:00.110> ports<00:05:00.440> like<00:05:00.590> storms

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
blasts the three main ports like storms

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.150 
blasts the three main ports like storms
definitely<00:05:01.880> helps<00:05:02.710> looks<00:05:03.710> like<00:05:03.830> he's<00:05:04.070> doing

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
definitely helps looks like he's doing
