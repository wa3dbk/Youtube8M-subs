00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.020
 Hello everyone today I want to introduce you 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.910
 with my assistant who will now 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.550
 try on all hair decoration 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.439
 which I will actually do is 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.200
 mannequin head designed to 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.540
 novice hairdressers so they can 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.390
 train to do different hairstyles I 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.670
 certainly not a hairdresser and took and for that 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.890
 so that you can be shown like that 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.230
 or another hairpin looks on the head 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.019
 if you decide on my master classes 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.970
 make any hairpin i think you 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.710
 you will not mind firstly to see 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.930
 how it looks from the side 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.730
 and secondly, since this head 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.510
 same size as an adult 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.210
 human 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.520
 you can decide on the size 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.860
 hairpins that is seeing a hairpin on 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.350
 dummy you immediately solve them want you 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.710
 exactly the same or slightly less or 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.969
 a little more generally understandable for what 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.220
 goals I took it 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.509
 Now who cares let's unpack 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.509
 and take a closer look at it 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.670
 I want to start with the fact that it is very comfortable here 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.540
 packaging she goes on here such 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.760
 rivet 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.980
 so if you know what is near 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.420
 time you will not use 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.550
 dummy you can hide it in 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.640
 packaging so that it does not once again 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.590
 gathering dust at the bottom of the dummy there is such 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.070
 here's a hole so that you can 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.350
 was put on a tripod set state 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.750
 so I bought it outside 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.670
 separately and the cost of such a tripod 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.040
 somewhere around 10 euros 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 it consists of such parts and 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.229
 He's going to, in principle, very simple 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.890
 the main part which is fixed on 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.890
 table edge 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.750
 then comes here is the iron 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.979
 ring now if you have a mannequin with 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.470
 short hair 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.560
 then you can deliver and this one 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.400
 head holder itself and fasten it 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.400
 wheels 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.989
 exactly this option was shown on 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.269
 picture but as you can see for my 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:36.349
 dummy this option does not fit so 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.700
 like her hair is long so in 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.829
 The set was such 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.750
 additional item you need 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:46.540
 insert between upper and lower 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.540
 details for the tripod to be higher 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.120
 on this assembly of our tripod 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.550
 ends on top now set 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.160
 dummy still wanna draw your attention 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.230
 that they rotate very easily by 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.870
 circle this way you can 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.200
 turn your head in the direction that 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.200
 you need 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.480
 now let's talk a little about the very 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.790
 dummy on the packaging was written her 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.510
 Name I do not know how it is correct 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.819
 pronounced Julia or Julia but for us 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.660
 somehow closer first option so we 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.580
 We will call her Julia 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.950
 her hair is one hundred percent natural 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.260
 so you need to take care of them exactly 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.780
 as well as your own about it was 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.440
 said in the instruction manual for training 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.420
 heads 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.489
 who are interested in more detailed 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.000
 I will leave the information about this instruction 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.000
 at the end of the video 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:25.030
 hair length 55-60 cm 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.610
 density 260,290 hairs per square 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.800
 centimeter and hairs are not 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.800
 glued and as you can see trichet you 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.630
 also on the dummy was indicated that it 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.630
 completely handmade 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.080
 on this all I hope you enjoyed this 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.449
