00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.690
 the mobile home specialist of your mobile 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.240
 also sets it on the new profile 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.940
 his mobile aims structure concept 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.970
 a construction construction from sandwich 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.800
 plates with gfk outside as inside over 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.650
 invisible aluminum profiles become 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.480
 high-strength gfk moldings glued what 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.270
 by screwing the turn saves and 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.220
 thus to an optimally sealed 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.619
 body leads this out of the 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.750
 aviation technology borrowed procedures 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.069
 confirmed despite lightweight construction by high 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.749
 torsional rigidity based on this 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:41.210
 proven quality construction 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:43.940
 construction became mobile in the new one 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.550
 profile rs in the interior an absolute 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.649
 wanted hidden design highlight in 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.260
 area of ​​a semi-integrated set 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.859
 yes we have it with our profile too 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.440
 rather called for the first time one 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.290
 design develops the bed with us 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.450
 could integrate into the roof 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.580
 a construction of the bed from the inside 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.100
 and not possible from the outside 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.720
 Perceptible make the lift bed hidden 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.090
 in the new extraordinary roof 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.190
 cassette speaks for detail work and 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.780
 the great know-how of the motorhome 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.690
 specialists from the Rheinhessen 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.220
 the functionality of the 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.479
 of course in the foreground we 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.250
 have a clear advantage 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.830
 worked out many products 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.750
 have comparable constructions 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.470
 Beds are clearly visible in the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.560
 inner space 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.930
 we reduce the height of the cabinets 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.850
 are thereby limited in their volume 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.290
 we have all this with this one 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.150
 Construction changed by the full 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.619
 standing height the bed disappears in the roof 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.800
 that's the trick we have here 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.300
 but have realized how works 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.270
 this new system 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.460
 we are here before the prepared ones 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.340
 Roofs of this roof cassette you see 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.900
 Now here 's the wall height 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.759
 roof height we reach here 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.920
 this building room is now disappearing 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.700
 the bed and in the outdoor area they see 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.380
 this inward escaping line 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.780
 aesthetically excellent is one with it 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.960
 just does not have the impression there 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.850
 to have a huge, tall vehicle 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.340
 the proven your mobile structure 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.900
 concept combines the advantages 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.760
 body strength with best 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.540
 long-term quality and an attractive 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.540
 design
