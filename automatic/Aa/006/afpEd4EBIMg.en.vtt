00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.939
 then 14th class I will explain the difference between the rhythms 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.650
 binary and ternary rhythms 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.950
 resume our 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.509
 small models of small gray nirvana 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.749
 I want so it's a piece of castres time 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.749
 - bnp k 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.130
 last act 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.130
 in this type 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.449
 we go first to the place 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.669
 play the mast piece in a binary way for its first day that the 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.009
 blacks only over time 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.259
 I am a guy no sense so dull 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.090
 it's cool as soon as we play 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.870
 recreation guide of the underpinnings 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.550
 we will see if these minerals dull and then if I add that a close between 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.550
 it's scary 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.830
 there I play jean r circle the note that I add the little one and that I do 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.410
 she is rigorously between them 1 and 2 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.990
 now these players play ternary that's what it actually does 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.240
 agreement 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.670
 then the little note that I add the leave actually it is really 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.420
 especially if you compare them around them 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.549
 but the rise in fact here you come back to two-thirds-one-third so two-thirds 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.090
 after the time and one-third before the play time for these facts if 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.340
 break down that rhythm you're going to see that I'm between two layers 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.340
 to do among the Muslims 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.049
 I'm going to choose another direction that I'm doing I'm happy 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.109
 after two ap and three eyi 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.830
 point var 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.580
 beyond that the dad and the baby are really attracted a third and add 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.930
 I am lawless 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.930
 business that 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:17.229
 much more useful he noted and we have our ternary rhythm okay 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.799
 so now practice getting from one to another so in 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.799
 binary his daughter 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.619
 as for marseille 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.119
 layton that is now i'm going to switch from one to the other 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.489
 to do this 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.169
 the latter 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:46.199
 the mayor 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:57.029
 know 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.239
 when we have more than ever the rhythm ternary press we call it the rhythm 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:02.909
 ternary 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.369
 e undecomposed circus normally 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.149
 the ternary rhythm that is completely breaking down 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:12.149
 to tell you what I was doing about europe 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.840
 three surveys revealed that composers all summer wishing 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.009
 every 3h 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.009
 and in fact it is cross that is between them between time 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.919
 two existing 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.939
 that's it that ternary rhythm rodrigo rosemont decompose 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.939
 while his bar 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.469
 it's a rhythm that is caught is not broken down 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.599
 you understood well do you train the other hall place at the end of the 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.719
 course
