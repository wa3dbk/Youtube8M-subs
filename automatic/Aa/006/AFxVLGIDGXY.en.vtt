00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
now some mainboard such as this one have

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.350 
now some mainboard such as this one have
the<00:00:30.900> two<00:00:31.199> settings<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:31.650> OC<00:00:31.890> switch<00:00:32.149> you<00:00:33.149> see

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the two settings for OC switch you see

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.170 
the two settings for OC switch you see
there<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:34.050> has<00:00:34.309> this<00:00:35.309> one<00:00:35.910> at<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.149> bottom

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
there that it has this one at the bottom

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.380 
there that it has this one at the bottom
is<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:37.190> essentially<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.309> modest<00:00:38.670> one<00:00:38.760> at<00:00:38.910> 4.0

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
is the essentially a modest one at 4.0

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.900 
is the essentially a modest one at 4.0
gigahertz<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> second<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.370> supposed

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
gigahertz and the second one is supposed

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.799 
gigahertz and the second one is supposed
to<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.059> something<00:00:42.090> better

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
to see something better

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.930 
to see something better
more<00:00:43.290> than<00:00:43.410> 4.0<00:00:43.890> units<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.670> want<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> do

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
more than 4.0 units so if you want to do

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.850 
more than 4.0 units so if you want to do
that<00:00:45.059> let's<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.629> let's<00:00:46.379> spread<00:00:46.680> upwards

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
that let's do that let's spread upwards

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.020 
that let's do that let's spread upwards
and<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:47.579> power<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.539> my<00:00:48.870> power<00:00:49.200> supply<00:00:50.030> you

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
and then power on my power supply you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.000 
and then power on my power supply you
can<00:00:51.180> see<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.780> enabled<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.860> see

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
can see that it is enabled you can see

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.459 
can see that it is enabled you can see

you might want to go there and set it to
hardware<00:01:14.100> mode<00:01:14.280> first<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.270> before

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
hardware mode first see here so before

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.880 
hardware mode first see here so before
you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.750> use<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> OSHA<00:01:16.350> genie<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:16.770> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
you can use the OSHA genie here and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.859 
you can use the OSHA genie here and
about<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.159> or<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.060> use<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> UEFI<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
about it or you can just use the UEFI to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.660 
about it or you can just use the UEFI to
trigger<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.490> power<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:22.670> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
trigger it and then we power it on and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.109 
trigger it and then we power it on and
then<00:01:23.939> put<00:01:24.619> camera<00:01:25.619> here<00:01:25.830> screen<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.880> show

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
then put camera here screen is to show

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.590 
then put camera here screen is to show
just<00:01:27.299> how<00:01:27.390> fast<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.020> works<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:29.299> by<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> time

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
just how fast it works and by the time

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.560 
just how fast it works and by the time
we<00:01:30.810> reach<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.439> windows<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:33.210> overclock

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
we reach the windows that the overclock

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.410 
we reach the windows that the overclock
was<00:01:33.750> already<00:01:33.960> achieved<00:01:34.320> by<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.670> genie

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
was already achieved by the genie

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.460 
was already achieved by the genie
software<00:01:38.150> now<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.299> an<00:01:39.390> SSD<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.200> what

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
software now I have an SSD here so what

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.370 
software now I have an SSD here so what
you're<00:01:40.650> seeing<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.040> essentially<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.079> as<00:01:43.079> fast

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
you're seeing is essentially the as fast

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.210 
you're seeing is essentially the as fast
food<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.430> can<00:01:45.710> without<00:01:46.710> were<00:01:47.009> that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
food as it can without were that

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.980 
food as it can without were that

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.149 

and<00:04:19.180> pretty<00:04:20.109> much<00:04:20.229> it<00:04:20.439> didn't<00:04:20.709> crush<00:04:20.949> yet

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
and pretty much it didn't crush yet

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.980 
and pretty much it didn't crush yet
crash<00:04:21.609> yet<00:04:21.849> so<00:04:22.090> I'm<00:04:22.360> just<00:04:22.599> really<00:04:22.780> let<00:04:22.900> it

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
crash yet so I'm just really let it

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.350 
crash yet so I'm just really let it
finish<00:04:23.139> all<00:04:23.409> the<00:04:23.500> way<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.740> end<00:04:23.889> and<00:04:24.360> that

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
finish all the way to the end and that

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.580 
finish all the way to the end and that
is<00:04:25.389> very<00:04:26.080> much<00:04:26.229> it<00:04:26.439> for<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:28.080> GPU<00:04:29.080> of<00:04:29.289> a<00:04:29.409> clock

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
is very much it for the GPU of a clock

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.499 
is very much it for the GPU of a clock
card<00:04:29.800> let<00:04:30.069> me<00:04:30.159> check<00:04:30.400> if<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.729> overclockers<00:04:31.389> you

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
card let me check if it overclockers you

P<00:04:31.659> at<00:04:31.780> all<00:04:31.930> from<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.680> default<00:04:33.069> raise<00:04:33.610> show<00:04:33.909> and

P at all from the default raise show and

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.559 
P at all from the default raise show and
I<00:04:34.870> think<00:04:35.169> that's<00:04:35.289> pretty<00:04:35.469> much<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.680> standard

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
I think that's pretty much the standard

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.240 
I think that's pretty much the standard
frequency<00:04:37.569> for<00:04:37.719> that<00:04:37.840> but<00:04:38.469> for<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.740> DF<00:04:39.039> paper

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
frequency for that but for the DF paper

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.029 
frequency for that but for the DF paper
so<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:39.430> definitely<00:04:39.520> just<00:04:39.879> it<00:04:40.090> read<00:04:40.360> the

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
so you definitely just it read the

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.700 
so you definitely just it read the
overclock<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:43.090> see<00:04:43.270> if<00:04:43.389> oh<00:04:43.569> and<00:04:44.289> added<00:04:44.590> any

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
overclock and see if oh and added any

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.959 
overclock and see if oh and added any

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.839

we<00:05:00.219> can<00:05:00.340> very<00:05:00.550> wise<00:05:00.699> it<00:05:00.849> can<00:05:01.360> have<00:05:01.479> a<00:05:01.509> different

cpuid<00:05:10.419> is<00:05:10.629> reporting<00:05:12.659> and<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:14.740> temperatures

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
cpuid is reporting and the temperatures

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.369 
cpuid is reporting and the temperatures
here<00:05:15.840> 54<00:05:16.840> degrees<00:05:17.080> Celsius<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:19.199> Aida<00:05:20.199> is

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:20.379 
here 54 degrees Celsius and Aida is

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:21.779 
here 54 degrees Celsius and Aida is
actually<00:05:20.680> reporting<00:05:21.069> a<00:05:21.129> higher<00:05:21.279> temperature

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
actually reporting a higher temperature

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.740 
actually reporting a higher temperature
than<00:05:22.090> then<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:23.289> msi<00:05:23.710> i<00:05:24.520> reminder<00:05:25.360> but<00:05:25.509> for<00:05:25.690> the

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
than then the msi i reminder but for the

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.140 
than then the msi i reminder but for the
most<00:05:25.900> part<00:05:26.110> it's<00:05:26.469> that's<00:05:26.650> still<00:05:26.949> far<00:05:27.400> from<00:05:27.699> the

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
most part it's that's still far from the

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.570 
most part it's that's still far from the
maximum<00:05:28.900> so<00:05:29.379> we<00:05:29.710> are<00:05:29.800> perfectly<00:05:30.159> flying<00:05:30.430> to

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
maximum so we are perfectly flying to

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.399 
maximum so we are perfectly flying to
see<00:05:30.729> it's<00:05:30.969> completely<00:05:31.210> stable<00:05:31.719> at<00:05:32.020> this<00:05:32.169> point

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
see it's completely stable at this point

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.740 
see it's completely stable at this point
and<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:33.039> can<00:05:33.340> try<00:05:33.699> your<00:05:33.819> different<00:05:34.120> programs

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
and you can try your different programs

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.790 
and you can try your different programs
of<00:05:34.870> course<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.169> can<00:05:35.259> test<00:05:35.469> it<00:05:35.589> out<00:05:35.650> for

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
of course you can test it out for

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.240 
of course you can test it out for
yourself

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250

but<00:05:36.729> for<00:05:37.089> the<00:05:37.150> most<00:05:37.270> part<00:05:37.360> does<00:05:37.659> it's<00:05:37.839> pretty

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
but for the most part does it's pretty

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.920 
but for the most part does it's pretty
much<00:05:38.229> it<00:05:38.409> this<00:05:38.620> is<00:05:38.710> a<00:05:38.800> quick<00:05:39.159> overview<00:05:39.310> of

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
the OC Genie and how fast it is and how

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.070 
the OC Genie and how fast it is and how
easy<00:05:45.639> it<00:05:45.759> is<00:05:45.819> but<00:05:46.000> anyone<00:05:46.389> can<00:05:46.539> do<00:05:46.629> it<00:05:46.750> pretty

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
easy it is but anyone can do it pretty

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.450 
easy it is but anyone can do it pretty
