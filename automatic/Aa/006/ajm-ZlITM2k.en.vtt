00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.690 
think it's going to be an additional
asset<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.720> this<00:04:15.840> weapon<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.470> it's<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:16.890> use

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.420 
asset to this weapon and it's this use
perfect<00:04:18.540> balance<00:04:18.870> this<00:04:19.530> upgrade<00:04:19.829> because

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
perfect balance this upgrade because

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.580 
perfect balance this upgrade because
that's<00:04:20.910> going<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.270> make<00:04:21.419> your<00:04:21.630> rico<00:04:22.140> drop

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
that's going to make your rico drop

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.890 
that's going to make your rico drop
significantly<00:04:23.120> which<00:04:24.120> will<00:04:24.330> allow<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.690> to

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
significantly which will allow you to

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.620 
significantly which will allow you to
get

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
get

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.840 
get
in<00:04:25.690> shots<00:04:25.960> back<00:04:26.380> to<00:04:26.410> back<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:27.160> back<00:04:27.190> which

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
in shots back to back to back which

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.570 
in shots back to back to back which
would<00:04:28.030> then<00:04:28.180> bring<00:04:28.540> in<00:04:29.340> incorporated<00:04:30.340> with

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
would then bring in incorporated with

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.970 
would then bring in incorporated with
this<00:04:30.790> perk<00:04:31.060> will<00:04:31.570> be<00:04:31.750> white<00:04:32.230> nail<00:04:32.530> so<00:04:32.770> if<00:04:32.860> you

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
this perk will be white nail so if you

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.000 
this perk will be white nail so if you
guys<00:04:33.130> get<00:04:33.280> three<00:04:33.550> position<00:04:33.970> kills<00:04:34.180> with<00:04:35.010> the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
guys get three position kills with the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.980 
guys get three position kills with the
high<00:04:36.310> recoil<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:37.030> then<00:04:37.300> get<00:04:37.510> with<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.750> three

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
high recoil and then get with the three

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.390 
high recoil and then get with the three
recall<00:04:38.410> obviously<00:04:38.920> you're<00:04:39.070> going<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.310> get

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
recall obviously you're going to get

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.550 
recall obviously you're going to get
more<00:04:39.640> precision<00:04:39.970> shots<00:04:40.300> with<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.720> low<00:04:41.020> recall

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
more precision shots with the low recall

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.580 
more precision shots with the low recall
so<00:04:42.010> definitely<00:04:42.580> i'd<00:04:43.060> say<00:04:43.510> use<00:04:43.960> perfect

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
so definitely i'd say use perfect

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.550 
so definitely i'd say use perfect
