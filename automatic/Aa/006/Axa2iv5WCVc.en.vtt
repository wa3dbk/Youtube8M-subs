 only that they give an idea but never 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.500
 concrete 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.330

 and it has crossed the mind some of the 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.950
 things that do the first thing that I'm going 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.930
 to ask 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.320

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.120
 from 180 to 220 pesos per kilo of meat 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.760

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.410
 meat and you get me a utility of 120 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.080
