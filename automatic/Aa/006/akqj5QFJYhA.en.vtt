00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.660
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.480
 Good people, the review is going to be there today. 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.740
 this figure here is the spider man 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.109
 from the alex spreading series and this 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.779
 personal spider man classics series is 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.170
 a series a little old, right? 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 I think it's a series there of 2008 and 2009 and 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.359
 Hi, meeting me in 2013. 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.230
 this figure here with the hand cart 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.390
 I found a lot of it, this was an old 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.430
 because it only had this figure that in the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.230
 store but if I had others I would 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.160
 I would buy to be able to do 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.219
 red for you but ultimately it is the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.660
 my campaign he is called bené 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.840
 a rocket man spider he came with a 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.010
 certain armor that we can put 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.030
 the pieces here on the legs and back 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.449
 Spider man 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.890
 I 'll show it to you and something else that 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.770
 I have to comment 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.830
 is that this spider man is the same 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.170
 series of that poison and that 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.659
 carnage I've already done a review I'm going 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.810
 Pick it up here to show you 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.340
 the character here card 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.530
 and look at the venom and the carnage 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.780
 two characters I've done here and the goal 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.750
 saw him is who wants to check it goes 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.310

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.740
 Carnide that you will find but okay 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.700
 Oh, look, this is the card of the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.890
 Spiderman is really big and here. 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.799
 are the other characters or other 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.509
 figures of the series and in the case here we 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.799
 we have the super heroes who are the man 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.850
 iron spider 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:00.119
 the spider man with the symbiont was born the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.740
 poison little dose of poison and here 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.090
 we have another man model 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.599
 here it is here we have the super villains 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:16.750
 which in this case are a poison and the 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:19.120
 carnage and green is sick I remember 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.180
 until that image here of the spider man 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.519
 that you watch until the announcement appears 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.959
 in the cards of the spider man 3 hand 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.860
 It was very nostalgic that from here and there 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.190
 up 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.810
 we have the image of the spider man inep 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.090
 rocketman the one with the armor and it is 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.640
 so it will get spider man if the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.660
 people put the pieces that came 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:51.630

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:55.269
 of the Spider-Man there soon of the Spider- Man 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.769
 and this is the cnet spider man 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:02.019
 it was manufactured by Hasbro at the time 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.160
 was the time when Hasbro started to 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:09.010
 make marvel figures and here in the front 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.400
 the card we have the pieces of the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.859
 armor that the wolf is again zinho 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.430
 of the spider man and here the name of the figure 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:21.790
 which came in the case a spider man is in 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.700
 above we have an image of man 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:30.820
 spider loose in the web and here again the 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:34.569
 The name of the figure on this page is me. 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:39.609
 remove the pieces here from the armor and I 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:42.430
 I'll be back to personal beauty teen gang 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.730
 here the pieces of armor and I 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.220
 and I took them a longer set up here 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.010
 spider man then the spider man goes 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.430
 to be basically like this here with 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.970
 the armor will turn him here for you 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.850
 see how well detailed this part 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.239
 this wing I think the wing or whatever 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.190
 that's but anyway it's going to stay this way it looks 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.910
 only 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.949
 and I really enjoyed the pieces here 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.480
 spider man's leg I thought they 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:19.340
 They look really good on him. 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.889
 is a perfect customer and now I go 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.190
 take them out here to show you the 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:30.330
 articulations of the doll né 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.290
 good the spider man he is articulated here 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:38.250
 in the arms 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:44.240
 articulated in the elbows too 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:49.620
 articulated in the thorax rotate 360 ​​° 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:55.260
 articulated in the legs also articulated 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:05:00.449
 on the knees and on the head head as well 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.800
 turn 360 grams it's now personal I'll go 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:06.440
 show you 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:09.660
 the pieces that came in are pieces of armor 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.850
 starting here by the wing, right by that 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.780
 stop that I called wing I do not know 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.479
 if a wing 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.510
 but then it looks only very well detailed 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.720
 I liked these stops here the front 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.880
 I do not think it's cool, I think it's the 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:32.520
 missiles that are here I do not know well 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:36.990
 but it seems to be a few months, right? 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.500
 and here is the place where we hold the 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:43.740
 spider man back right 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.150
 Another thing that came is this part of the 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.139
 leg right 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.820
 they are equal're only changes a left 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.389
 or to the right you know 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.570
 and they have these little girls, it's kind of 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:59.789
 it's legs I think spider legs 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:04.440
 I think I 'm here, it symbolizes the 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:07.080
 spider legs and they are not 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.710
 detailed on the inside are only detailed 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:15.570
 on the outside and this is why these are the 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:17.250
 little pieces of amateur and it was there 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.699
