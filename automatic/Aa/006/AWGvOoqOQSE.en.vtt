00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.540 

so<00:02:18.280> they<00:02:18.400> are<00:02:18.580> actually<00:02:19.030> useful<00:02:19.450> go<00:02:20.140> up<00:02:20.200> here

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.310 

the<00:02:24.360> volume<00:02:24.870> knob<00:02:25.050> actually<00:02:25.380> works<00:02:27.320> it

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
the volume knob actually works it

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.290 
the volume knob actually works it
doesn't<00:02:28.650> just<00:02:28.800> shut<00:02:29.040> off

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
doesn't just shut off

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.260 
doesn't just shut off
and<00:02:30.750> then<00:02:30.990> on<00:02:31.350> like<00:02:32.010> most<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.490> today's<00:02:32.730> garbage

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
and then on like most of today's garbage

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.290 
and then on like most of today's garbage
guitars<00:02:34.400> everything<00:02:35.400> about<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.700> cool<00:02:36.000> if

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
guitars everything about is cool if

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.590 
guitars everything about is cool if
you're<00:02:36.390> not<00:02:36.570> into<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.920> v-neck<00:02:38.240> phone<00:02:39.240> rang<00:02:39.480> it

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
you're not into a v-neck phone rang it

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:50.480 
you're not into a v-neck phone rang it
again<00:02:43.760> so<00:02:45.530> what<00:02:46.530> we<00:02:46.650> have<00:02:46.830> here<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:50.250> back

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
again so what we have here is the back

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.180 
again so what we have here is the back
of<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> neck<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.390> hard<00:02:52.080> hard<00:02:52.560> V<00:02:52.830> you're<00:02:53.040> not

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
of the neck is a hard hard V you're not

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.190 
of the neck is a hard hard V you're not
going<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.430> get<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.610> see<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:53.970> probably<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:55.020> this

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
going to get to see it probably in this

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.840 
going to get to see it probably in this
lighting<00:02:55.680> but<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.400> like<00:02:56.520> you're<00:02:56.700> playing

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
lighting but it's like you're playing

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.560 
lighting but it's like you're playing
the<00:02:57.240> edge<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:58.520> table<00:02:59.520> I<00:02:59.880> mean<00:03:00.180> it's<00:03:00.300> that

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
the edge of a table I mean it's that

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.830 
the edge of a table I mean it's that
heart<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.410> V<00:03:01.620> it's<00:03:01.800> not<00:03:01.950> even<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.280> soft<00:03:02.580> V<00:03:02.910> okay

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
heart of a V it's not even a soft V okay

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.310 
heart of a V it's not even a soft V okay
so<00:03:04.440> it's<00:03:04.680> really<00:03:04.860> got<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.520> good<00:03:05.850> V<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
so it's really got a good V to it the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.460 
so it's really got a good V to it the
headstock<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:08.040> kind<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.430> funky<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.600> gets

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
headstock is kind of funky in that gets

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.920 
headstock is kind of funky in that gets
a<00:03:10.590> very<00:03:10.770> short<00:03:11.100> Explorer<00:03:11.670> type<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.570> thing<00:03:12.750> try

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
a very short Explorer type of thing try

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.990 
a very short Explorer type of thing try
to<00:03:12.990> get<00:03:13.200> all<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.350> glare<00:03:13.680> off<00:03:13.980> here<00:03:14.280> but<00:03:14.820> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
to get all the glare off here but the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.630 
to get all the glare off here but the
keys<00:03:15.330> are<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:16.020> close<00:03:16.350> together<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:17.550> you

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
keys are so close together that you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.480 
keys are so close together that you
cannot<00:03:18.030> use<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.780> string<00:03:19.140> winder<00:03:19.380> on<00:03:19.740> them<00:03:19.860> but

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
cannot use a string winder on them but

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.120 
cannot use a string winder on them but
at<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.210> same<00:03:21.360> time<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:22.590> strings<00:03:23.580> go<00:03:23.880> more<00:03:24.120> to

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
at the same time the strings go more to

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.090 
at the same time the strings go more to
directly<00:03:26.130> pass<00:03:26.400> through<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.880> nut<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:29.070> the

directly pass through the nut to the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.010 
directly pass through the nut to the
tuners<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:30.240> that<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.480> don't<00:03:30.660> get<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:30.960> much

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
tuners so that you don't get so much

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.140 
tuners so that you don't get so much
binding<00:03:31.680> like<00:03:31.860> on<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.100> real<00:03:32.370> Explorer<00:03:32.850> or

binding like on a real Explorer or

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.840 
binding like on a real Explorer or
something<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:34.200> there's<00:03:34.440> not<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:34.830> much<00:03:34.980> you

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
something so there's not so much you

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.460 
something so there's not so much you
know<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.180> can't<00:03:36.690> kink<00:03:36.959> every<00:03:37.170> time<00:03:37.350> you're

takes that some of that everything it

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.670 
takes that some of that everything it
also<00:03:42.240> means<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.750> cool<00:03:42.959> guitar<00:03:43.080> it's<00:03:43.530> not
