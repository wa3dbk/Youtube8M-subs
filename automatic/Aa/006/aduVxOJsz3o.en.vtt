we knew that we were always going to

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.079 
we knew that we were always going to
need<00:01:02.090> a<00:01:02.149> large<00:01:02.660> manufacturing<00:01:03.530> partner<00:01:04.070> as<00:01:04.309> we

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
need a large manufacturing partner as we

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.280 
need a large manufacturing partner as we
knew<00:01:05.270> that<00:01:05.300> it<00:01:05.509> was<00:01:05.660> going<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.840> be<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:05.990> high

volume low margin business and that's

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.510 
volume low margin business and that's
why<00:01:08.689> we<00:01:08.869> teamed<00:01:09.080> up<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.350> same<00:01:09.560> man<00:01:09.830> we<00:01:10.280> have

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
why we teamed up the same man we have

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.660 
why we teamed up the same man we have
developed<00:01:11.150> and<00:01:12.110> evolved<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:12.590> product<00:01:13.010> using
