really happy to be teaching how to apply

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.389 
really happy to be teaching how to apply
this<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.789> longer<00:00:30.119> distance<00:00:30.510> running<00:00:31.399> anything

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
this to longer distance running anything

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.580 
this to longer distance running anything
longer<00:00:32.640> than<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.969> 5k<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.690> particular<00:00:34.110> class

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
longer than a 5k this particular class

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.620 
longer than a 5k this particular class
was<00:00:34.890> for<00:00:35.130> half<00:00:35.280> marathon<00:00:35.850> marathon<00:00:36.090> people

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
was for half marathon marathon people

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.139 
was for half marathon marathon people
but<00:00:36.780> there<00:00:36.930> are<00:00:37.280> quite<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.340> few<00:00:38.489> people<00:00:38.790> half

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
but there are quite a few people half

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.200 
but there are quite a few people half
the<00:00:39.360> class<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.780> never<00:00:39.960> run<00:00:40.170> either<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.640> so

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the class have never run either and so

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.270 
the class have never run either and so
these<00:00:43.050> people<00:00:43.110> were<00:00:43.500> really<00:00:43.680> interested<00:00:44.190> in

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
these people were really interested in

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.369 
these people were really interested in
how<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.610> take<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.120> technique<00:00:45.660> further<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
how do I take this technique further and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.350 
how do I take this technique further and
how<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.770> take<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.219> deeper<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.210> whole

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
how do I take it deeper and the whole

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.750 
how do I take it deeper and the whole
idea<00:00:48.539> behind<00:00:49.129> taking<00:00:50.129> any<00:00:50.670> practice<00:00:51.420> -

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
idea behind taking any practice -

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.340 
idea behind taking any practice -
especially<00:00:53.760> running<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.300> longer<00:00:54.719> distances

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
especially running to longer distances

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.099 
especially running to longer distances
is<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.160> fact<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.879> automatically<00:00:57.539> trains

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
is the fact that it automatically trains

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.889 
is the fact that it automatically trains
you<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.620> deeper<00:00:59.010> you<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.300> work<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.690> lot

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
you to get deeper you have to work a lot

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.860 
you to get deeper you have to work a lot
more<00:01:01.140> closely<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:01.739> what<00:01:01.980> your<00:01:02.129> technique<00:01:02.370> is

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
more closely with what your technique is

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.230 
more closely with what your technique is
what<00:01:03.870> situations<00:01:04.530> you're<00:01:04.680> gonna<00:01:04.769> run<00:01:05.040> into

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
what situations you're gonna run into

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.840 
what situations you're gonna run into
how<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.270> handle<00:01:06.630> those<00:01:06.810> emotionally

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
how to handle those emotionally

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.300 
how to handle those emotionally
physically<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.119> mentally<00:01:10.040> nobody<00:01:11.040> starts

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
physically and mentally nobody starts

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.789 
physically and mentally nobody starts
running<00:01:11.580> long<00:01:11.729> distance<00:01:12.150> right<00:01:12.360> away<00:01:12.799> but

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
running long distance right away but

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.770 
running long distance right away but
they<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.010> start<00:01:14.490> running<00:01:14.820> shorter<00:01:15.210> distances

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
they do start running shorter distances

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.429 
they do start running shorter distances
better<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.060> this<00:01:18.060> whole<00:01:18.270> thing<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.570> around<00:01:19.020> in

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
better and this whole thing is around in

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.260 
better and this whole thing is around in
the<00:01:19.740> moment<00:01:20.100> practice<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.820> good<00:01:20.970> B<00:01:21.090> all<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the moment practice for good B all the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.330 
the moment practice for good B all the
situations<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.380> could<00:01:22.500> pop<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:22.770> possibly

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
situations that could pop up possibly

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.550 
situations that could pop up possibly
happen<00:01:23.790> when<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.450> do<00:01:24.630> get<00:01:24.840> into<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.170> big<00:01:25.439> event

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
happen when you do get into a big event

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.490 
happen when you do get into a big event
and<00:01:26.750> practicing<00:01:27.750> them<00:01:27.930> ahead<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.200> time<00:01:28.320> so

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and practicing them ahead of time so

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.910 
and practicing them ahead of time so
that<00:01:28.860> when<00:01:29.009> you're<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.460> event<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:30.619> all<00:01:31.619> of

that when you're in the event if all of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.330 
that when you're in the event if all of
that<00:01:32.070> practice<00:01:32.579> kind<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.939> adds<00:01:33.180> up<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:34.189> being<00:01:35.189> a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that practice kind of adds up to being a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.490 
that practice kind of adds up to being a
very<00:01:35.729> skillful<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.280> present<00:01:39.500> long-distance
