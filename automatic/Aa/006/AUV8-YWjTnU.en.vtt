gonna do is go ahead and fold our squash

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.309 
gonna do is go ahead and fold our squash
book<00:00:04.020> so<00:00:04.980> we<00:00:05.130> can<00:00:05.220> get<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.460> effect<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:06.060> the

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
book so we can get the effect of the

gives the accordion look ok I'll go

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.140 
gives the accordion look ok I'll go
ahead<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.450> right<00:00:12.690> now<00:00:13.700> now<00:00:14.700> you're

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
ahead and do that right now now you're

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.320 
ahead and do that right now now you're
going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.920> you<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.010> three<00:00:17.730> sections<00:00:18.150> of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
going to have you have three sections of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.200 
going to have you have three sections of
squares<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:19.400> two<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.580> end<00:00:20.820> are<00:00:21.029> going<00:00:21.060> to

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
squares the two on the end are going to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.990 
squares the two on the end are going to
go<00:00:21.330> inward<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.080> what<00:00:22.260> we're<00:00:22.380> gonna<00:00:22.500> do<00:00:23.000> just

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
go inward so what we're gonna do just

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.580 
go inward so what we're gonna do just
fold<00:00:24.269> those<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.750> way<00:00:27.140> hold<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.230> one<00:00:28.410> this

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
fold those this way hold this one this

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.130 
fold those this way hold this one this
way<00:00:28.769> again<00:00:32.030> so<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.210> way<00:00:33.360> when<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:33.690> fold<00:00:33.960> it

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
way again so that way when we fold it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
way again so that way when we fold it
they<00:00:34.649> go<00:00:34.800> down<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.780> our<00:00:36.899> next<00:00:37.110> step<00:00:37.469> go

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
they go down so in our next step go

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:49.959 
they go down so in our next step go
ahead<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.520> fold<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.879> right<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.149> half

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.720 

okay<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:50.999> got<00:00:51.269> those<00:00:52.219> and<00:00:53.219> I'm<00:00:53.339> gonna<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.640> ahead

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
okay I got those and I'm gonna go ahead

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.610 
okay I got those and I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:00:53.850> take<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.329> middle<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.350> I'm<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:55.559> to

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and take the middle and I'm going to

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.060 
and take the middle and I'm going to
fold<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.949> inward<00:00:56.579> together<00:00:57.769> so<00:00:58.769> it<00:00:58.829> has<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
fold it inward together so it has a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.749 
fold it inward together so it has a
outward<00:00:59.940> crease<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.430> gonna<00:01:05.549> look<00:01:05.700> like

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
outward crease so it's gonna look like

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:17.450 
outward crease so it's gonna look like
that<00:01:08.119> I<00:01:09.119> got<00:01:10.110> those<00:01:10.380> bends<00:01:11.390> all<00:01:12.390> right

and<00:01:32.259> a<00:01:32.290> lot<00:01:32.409> of<00:01:32.500> folding<00:01:34.229> almost<00:01:35.229> like<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.619> that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
and a lot of folding almost like to that

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.139 
and a lot of folding almost like to that
you're<00:01:35.950> going<00:01:36.039> to<00:01:36.130> be<00:01:36.220> folding<00:01:36.580> each<00:01:36.759> one<00:01:37.030> in

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
you're going to be folding each one in

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.330 
you're going to be folding each one in
half<00:01:37.330> each<00:01:37.659> of<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:37.930> individual<00:01:38.649> squares<00:01:38.890> in

fullness<00:01:52.720> right<00:01:53.050> can<00:01:53.530> I<00:01:53.560> have<00:01:53.649> these<00:01:53.920> coming

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
fullness right can I have these coming

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.200 
fullness right can I have these coming
in<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.810> don't<00:01:55.960> want<00:01:56.200> any<00:01:56.640> solid<00:01:57.640> squaring<00:01:58.030> in

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
in you don't want any solid squaring in

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.899 
in you don't want any solid squaring in
so<00:01:59.369> pull<00:02:00.369> that<00:02:00.399> in<00:02:00.850> pull<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.390> two<00:02:02.380> ends<00:02:02.830> in<00:02:02.979> on

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
so pull that in pull the two ends in on

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.449 
so pull that in pull the two ends in on
the<00:02:04.000> back<00:02:04.209> side<00:02:04.259> down<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:06.039> you<00:02:06.100> have<00:02:06.159> your

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
the back side down so you have your

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.900 
the back side down so you have your
square<00:02:06.850> base<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.830> then<00:02:09.160> let's<00:02:09.519> go<00:02:09.640> ahead<00:02:09.700> and

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
square base and then let's go ahead and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.259 
square base and then let's go ahead and
do<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.030> with<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.390> opposite<00:02:10.810> end<00:02:12.060> they<00:02:13.060> have

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
do that with the opposite end they have

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.330 
do that with the opposite end they have
these<00:02:13.540> folds<00:02:14.519> so<00:02:15.519> there's<00:02:15.970> those<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:18.220> then

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
these folds so there's those and then

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.569 
these folds so there's those and then
these<00:02:18.880> are<00:02:19.060> supposed<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.480> go<00:02:19.630> outward<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:20.579> get

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
these are supposed to go outward I get

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:27.349 
these are supposed to go outward I get
them<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.850> go<00:02:22.060> there<00:02:22.450> we<00:02:22.989> go<00:02:24.030> pull<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.060> down

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
them to go there we go pull that down

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.750 
them to go there we go pull that down
