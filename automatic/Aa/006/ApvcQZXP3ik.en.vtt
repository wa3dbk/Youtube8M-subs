00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.520
 hello guys welcome one more time at 

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:06.680
 my books I simon looks a lot to be with 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.850
 you once again on this occasion they 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.499
 I bring a video that I had already 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.150
 promised that is an explanation about 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:12.950
 what are certain terms that are used 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.469
 a lot in the books 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.180
 good with the big two bears like today m / m 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:21.530
 and main mailbox rap pop and this already miami 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.360
 then I will explain us who are 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.280
 these four things in case you 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.720
 have seen and do not understand very well what 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.340
 wave because the truth is that there is no 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.020
 explanation how good I was 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.119
 looking at the beginning because we wanted 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.579
 that was to see the difference between inm and 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.020
 books and I did not find any then 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.360
 I said good is going to be a video where 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.040
 really explains what these things are and 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.200
 what is the difference between one and another and 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.660
 so let's go booting with 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.220
 this let's start first with hold 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.750
 hall h 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.270
 and how do you see them leave because 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.829
 wants to say something that a quantity of 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.540
 something you bought can be a 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.610
 amount of makeup of books of 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.079
 movie and what you want and good you 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.239
 start using a lot on youtube 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.010
 to show just when you bought or you 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.620
 gave a thing then you made a 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.360
 hall about makeup and you said good 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.360
 they gave away three lipsticks 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.460
 it's a mascara or things and a hall of clothes and 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.440
 you show the new clothes you had and things 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.810
 like that and obviously with the book 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.190
 tuber was started the book hall that good 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.110
 is to show the books that you 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.660
 they bought what they gave you during a 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.090
 certain time is almost always done 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.340
 about a month or the January book hall 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.020
 February of March which would not be 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.320
 it's timeless it 's like that 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.270
 -well timeless atemporal timeless you 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.160
 You could do it as long as you want 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.620
 of a week all you have to 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.990
 books in the week or in six months or in 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.060
 one year of it is free and the each 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.920
 the person chooses but the most widespread 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.020
 it's been lately that it's once the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.140
 month to go that they gave you during that month 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.240
 and well all this also sometimes 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.000
 do with a boxing videos that I do not know 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.800
 if you have seen them that is when you receive 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.390
 closed packages for example with the 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.270
 books not that you sent to buy in 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.910
 amazon or in book depository or something like that or 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.090
 that there is even a friend friend send you 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.649
 things and then you decide that just 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.080
 when the video ceases you will open that 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.580
 package because many times you do not know about 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.210
 where it is known that then as 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.620
 funny 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.960
 open it at that moment and see that the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.050
 book I requested to reach everyone and so on 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.030
 three times in boxing videos that is like 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.910
 is that I do not know how to translate a box but 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.000
 It would be like opening videos when you open a 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.940
 gift or something like that we could translate it and 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.630
 well basically those are the hawks and 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.120
 book house but all this came up good 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.700
 the bucholz and he and mms emerged from 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.850
 of a girl named ale that her 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.040
 blog is called pop culture yonki that she 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.960
 was the one that started with the inm she saw 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.540
 the halls liked it decided to pass it to 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.410
 the books and for the books put inm 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.660
 made in my mailbox that is in my mailbox the 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.190
 translation that is like saying things 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.170
 that came to you right to your mailbox 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.210
 emails I do not know what you got during 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.070
 that time and what she did was 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.800
 start doing by in your written blog 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.290
 then she uploaded photos or images like that 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.370
 of what he had received and then from 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.800
 of that you can make recommendations 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.110
 of books and say and if it can happen to you 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.570
 as your expectations and that you as 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.830
 user you could comment on jesse 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.690
 very good freedom if you're not going to like it 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.520
 I do not know what I recommend you read this 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.320
 another and good I started all this with the 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.550
 read in 2008 we went through as 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.230
 November 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.720
 a few months later around April of 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.000
 2009 also started with christie's 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.890
 story schering and like that with christie 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.960
 fa when it was became the boom and all 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.750
 people started doing these things of the inm 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.600
 wing mail and my mailbox ay you can not go 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.030
 it's a good tour the joke is that 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.070
 that 's how all this started and good 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.080
 before I tell them they made blogs like 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.730
 which would grab him if there was a 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.100
 picture in the picture what outside of the 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.510
 books that they had acquired or after 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.490
 little by little they begin to do the 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.340
 blogs that was when I kind of like that 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.170
 he also acquired a lot in strength 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.000
 here on youtube that all future 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.800
 they started doing it and I tell them it 's something 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.300
 I opened it very free, you can do it if 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.680
 decide once a week once a week 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.810
 month once a year there is no 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.210
 problem you decide the times if not 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.070
 you want to do it in five months there's no 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.720
 no problem either then do 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.630
 jokes that when they raise it if they put 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.580
 which is an inm or a book hall so that the 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.109
 people know what they're going to talk about 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.060
 that video because it's kind of like 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.950
 hashtag with a tag that all the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.130
 people already know how with the book tags that 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.330
 it's a game with the vowels you know 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.910
 which is when someone is going to teach you 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.410
 his books and good too fair 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.960
 can promote the much all the 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.490
 there are videos so they can promote 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.620
 on twitter or on facebook and that's because 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.210
 with the hashtags there is already a lot 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:47.830
 then you can put email box 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:50.350
 s and already put do not imagine bale box of 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.520
 February and they put the link of their video already 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.110
 people will know what they are 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.610
 speaking already the people that you like in 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.820
 those videos because you go in 20 and there's no 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.990
 no problem and good on the other side 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.810
 we have the graf 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.060
 that here I leave you written with good 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.150
 I put up as written out by the 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.060
 truth that 's more like since you read 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.130
 all the books they had shown or 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.890
 not all because the truth is that and look 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.480
 part of this arose because when you 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.010
 like books you generally buy 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.810
 more books than you reach to dumb 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.250
 you often want to show everything 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.530
 what you bought even if you did not 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.630
 read and for that came out in my mind box 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.340
 which is how you form and buy all this 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.620
 although only the end at the end is not 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.720
 angry and handsome is just like to say 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.310
 I already read these books during this week 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.980
 this half of this year what you 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.840
 want time and say law this month 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.670
 let's say these five books are going to 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.620
 comment on which banias is like a mini 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.260
 review of those books and upload them 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.940
 also this as a video I have not 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.620
 seen so much in blogs but I guess that 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.120
 there must also be blogs and then 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.390
 basically that's what they are being 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.430
 bocholt ym / m in my mailbox and handsome 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.449
 I hope it helped them a little bit 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.520
 this is like 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.409
 and terminology that is used a lot with 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.969
 the book you see if he wanted to spend 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.680
 the ones to you in case they are just arriving 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:05.960
 to this world know what it was about 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.580
 because sometimes when you're new you say and 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.979
 because people use all those 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.020
 book tax terms also for those who 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.969
 do not know the book tags is when 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.319
 labels to a person or you go in a 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:17.300
 video that you did that is like a 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:19.309
 kind of challenges that is also in the 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.349
 avalanche books that are the challenges or 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:23.180
 challenges because these are like games where 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:24.889
 you have to show if this amount of 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.169
 books that meet certain 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.360
 requirements for example books with 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.279
 blue red green covers and others to 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.139
 Sometimes there is a time limit sometimes not 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:34.460
 then good is fun all 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.409
 this and I wanted to become the 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.639
 new processes around here I always give them 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:39.169
 the question of what is the 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.550
 difference between one thing or another now 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.379
 you can already know 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.150
 good guys this was all for now them 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:45.650
 I send a huge kiss and I hope it 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.930
 subscribe to the channel they will not forget 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.930
 and see you soon in another video bye
