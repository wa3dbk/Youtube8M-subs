00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.410
 finally adjust my lane to the mountain 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.770
 this is the guide bar 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:28.900
 90 degrees and non-removable here here did 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:36.430
 specially summoned to one 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:39.580
 level with a table governed by these 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.420
 bolted because these guides 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:59.320
 removable 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:01:07.720
 at 90 degrees from 40 c shot here still under 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:12.330
 45 make template removed later 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.640
 template has a relative disk set 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.310
 I didnâ€™t weld here because 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:26.740
 corner dropped decided on a bolt and 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:27.790
 guide that fits exactly here 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.060
 that's it 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:37.830
 Thing at first thought only with her but 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:41.400
 apparently she decided to make a personal right 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.400
 let it remain 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.940
 now while in work I will not show 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.940
 principle 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.690
 everything 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:10.630
 once moved the workpiece to allow 1 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.930
 cut off the front all 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.049
 learned to say of course dumbbell a little bit 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.049
 kind of spoil 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.620
 there is a spring she did not bother 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:56.180
 just hooked up and all these here 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:04.400
 holes it's just still in the process 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:04.400
 inventions hinge is also pure heels 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.500
 tightened the nuts 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.880
 dell 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.880
 the handle is very comfortable enough 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.830
 So 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:34.370
 the work experienced are working great 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:37.310
 only thing to initially when 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.260
 the cut was smooth because when 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.030
 new drive 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.209
 any new drive it even when manually 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.900
 walks when cutting a little bit 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:56.569
 work out on the square set 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:59.080
 and the cut will be practically me and all that i am 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.080
 wanted to tell 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:16.580
 assembled actually on by 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.580
 put it a lot of space does not take 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:26.090
 the only thing you need every time 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:29.960
 Disk skin rearrange here and stick with 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.590
 it is all such more or less complexity 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:41.240
 steel is going very fast 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:42.430
 regulated slats all-all with this 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.800
 Now 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:50.600
 if soon everything is ok 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:55.160
 I'll show you how I want to work now 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:59.889
 making shelves square tube will 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.889
 cut okay
