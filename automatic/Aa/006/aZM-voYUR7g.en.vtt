00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.200 
serving container in days right yeah 90
serving<00:00:17.349> container<00:00:17.680> and<00:00:18.099> there's<00:00:18.730> a<00:00:18.789> bunch<00:00:19.060> of

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
serving container and there's a bunch of

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.450 
serving container and there's a bunch of
flavors<00:00:19.390> well<00:00:19.960> yeah<00:00:20.589> there's<00:00:20.829> like<00:00:20.919> an<00:00:21.070> apple

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
flavors well yeah there's like an apple

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.309 
flavors well yeah there's like an apple
and<00:00:21.699> orange<00:00:22.529> watermelon<00:00:23.529> grape<00:00:24.119> punch<00:00:25.319> yeah

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:26.319 
and orange watermelon grape punch yeah

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:28.109 
and orange watermelon grape punch yeah
for<00:00:26.589> punch<00:00:26.829> the<00:00:27.310> most<00:00:27.519> popular<00:00:27.849> I<00:00:27.880> think<00:00:28.029> is

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
for punch the most popular I think is

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.029 
for punch the most popular I think is
that<00:00:28.150> watermelon<00:00:28.839> that<00:00:29.499> we've<00:00:29.679> seen<00:00:30.009> I

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
that watermelon that we've seen I

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.660 
that watermelon that we've seen I
haven't<00:00:30.519> tried<00:00:30.759> it<00:00:30.819> myself<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:33.280> reviews

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
haven't tried it myself but the reviews

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.430 
haven't tried it myself but the reviews
on<00:00:33.820> flavors<00:00:34.329> is<00:00:34.480> that<00:00:34.660> they<00:00:34.840> all<00:00:34.960> generally

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
on flavors is that they all generally

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.720 
on flavors is that they all generally
taste<00:00:35.649> pretty<00:00:35.890> good<00:00:35.980> but<00:00:36.340> I<00:00:36.370> think<00:00:36.460> the

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
taste pretty good but I think the

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.180 
taste pretty good but I think the
watermelon<00:00:37.239> so<00:00:37.690> however<00:00:37.870> this<00:00:38.530> is<00:00:38.680> probably

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
watermelon so however this is probably

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.680 
watermelon so however this is probably
the<00:00:39.340> most<00:00:39.460> popular<00:00:39.730> branched<00:00:40.510> chain<00:00:40.660> amino

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
the most popular branched chain amino

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.349 
the most popular branched chain amino
acid<00:00:41.230> supplement<00:00:41.679> out<00:00:41.739> there<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:43.210> that

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
acid supplement out there what that

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:44.970 
acid supplement out there what that
means<00:00:43.570> it's<00:00:43.780> gonna<00:00:43.899> contain<00:00:44.320> three<00:00:44.710> amino

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
means it's gonna contain three amino

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.490 
means it's gonna contain three amino
acids<00:00:45.489> amino<00:00:46.149> acids<00:00:46.629> specifically<00:00:47.019> leucine

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
acids amino acids specifically leucine

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.950 
acids amino acids specifically leucine
isoleucine<00:00:47.980> and<00:00:48.489> valine<00:00:48.699> some<00:00:49.390> of<00:00:49.510> them<00:00:49.660> also

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
isoleucine and valine some of them also

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.590 
isoleucine and valine some of them also
include<00:00:50.320> glutamine<00:00:50.820> like<00:00:51.820> this<00:00:52.030> one<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.510> I

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
include glutamine like this one and I

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.060 
include glutamine like this one and I
believe<00:00:52.870> also<00:00:53.050> ice<00:00:53.410> from<00:00:53.769> extreme

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
believe also ice from extreme

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.489 
believe also ice from extreme
formulation<00:00:54.609> identify<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:54.999> next<00:00:55.300> one<00:00:56.109> as<00:00:56.320> far

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:56.499 
formulation identify the next one as far

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:57.869 
formulation identify the next one as far
as<00:00:56.649> what's<00:00:56.829> popular<00:00:57.039> and<00:00:57.249> then<00:00:57.429> this<00:00:57.550> one<00:00:57.699> also

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
as what's popular and then this one also

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.279 
as what's popular and then this one also
contains<00:00:58.359> two<00:00:58.539> trillion<00:00:58.749> malate

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
contains two trillion malate

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.709 
contains two trillion malate
well<00:00:59.679> let's<00:00:59.859> run<00:01:00.100> real<00:01:00.370> quick<00:01:00.480> through<00:01:01.480> some

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
well let's run real quick through some

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.470 
well let's run real quick through some
of<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.870> effects<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:03.699> could<00:01:03.850> expect<00:01:04.239> from<00:01:04.330> a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
of the effects you could expect from a

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.840 
of the effects you could expect from a
BCAA<00:01:04.960> step<00:01:05.350> one<00:01:05.590> so<00:01:05.800> one<00:01:06.310> if<00:01:06.430> you<00:01:06.490> want<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.670> run

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
BCAA step one so one if you want to run

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.730 
BCAA step one so one if you want to run
through<00:01:07.120> each<00:01:07.150> one<00:01:07.510> of<00:01:07.630> them<00:01:07.780> yeah<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.200> BCAAs

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
through each one of them yeah the BCAAs

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.730 
through each one of them yeah the BCAAs
are<00:01:09.010> the<00:01:09.130> leucine<00:01:09.520> isoleucine<00:01:09.910> and<00:01:10.360> valine

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
are the leucine isoleucine and valine

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.160 
are the leucine isoleucine and valine
what<00:01:11.740> they're<00:01:11.860> useful<00:01:12.040> for<00:01:12.250> is<00:01:13.170> generally

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
what they're useful for is generally

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.510 
what they're useful for is generally
keeping<00:01:14.440> your<00:01:14.560> money<00:01:14.680> from<00:01:14.890> going<00:01:15.070> catabolic

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
keeping your money from going catabolic

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.010 
keeping your money from going catabolic
or<00:01:15.880> using<00:01:16.480> muscle<00:01:16.870> mass<00:01:17.080> as<00:01:17.260> an<00:01:17.380> energy<00:01:17.740> source

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
or using muscle mass as an energy source

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.660 
or using muscle mass as an energy source
more<00:01:20.020> they're<00:01:20.440> beneficial<00:01:20.920> of<00:01:21.130> taking<00:01:21.460> on<00:01:21.550> an

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
more they're beneficial of taking on an

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.980 
more they're beneficial of taking on an
empty<00:01:21.850> stomach<00:01:22.090> if<00:01:22.390> you<00:01:22.480> don't<00:01:22.630> want<00:01:22.780> anything

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
empty stomach if you don't want anything

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.570 
empty stomach if you don't want anything
competing<00:01:23.620> for<00:01:23.830> absorption<00:01:24.160> for<00:01:24.430> them

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
competing for absorption for them

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.760 
competing for absorption for them
because<00:01:24.730> they<00:01:25.060> are<00:01:25.320> essentially<00:01:26.320> free<00:01:26.560> form

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
because they are essentially free form

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.200 
because they are essentially free form
aminos<00:01:27.130> they're<00:01:27.280> not<00:01:27.400> bad<00:01:27.550> yeah<00:01:27.700> they're<00:01:28.000> free

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
aminos they're not bad yeah they're free

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.640 
aminos they're not bad yeah they're free
forms<00:01:28.600> so<00:01:28.780> they're<00:01:28.930> not<00:01:29.050> going<00:01:29.230> to<00:01:29.500> be<00:01:29.620> a

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
forms so they're not going to be a

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.980 
forms so they're not going to be a
stable<00:01:30.040> and<00:01:30.340> solution<00:01:30.760> so<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.300> competitive

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
stable and solution so a competitive

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.810 
stable and solution so a competitive
environment<00:01:32.110> would<00:01:32.560> be<00:01:32.620> not<00:01:33.490> an<00:01:33.640> empty

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
environment would be not an empty

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.230 
environment would be not an empty
stomach

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
stomach

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.940 
stomach

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
you know other protein peptides peptides

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.730 
you know other protein peptides peptides
will<00:01:36.880> tend<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.330> out-compete<00:01:37.660> free<00:01:38.260> form<00:01:38.500> amino

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740

will tend to out-compete free form amino
acids<00:01:39.190> for<00:01:39.310> exhort<00:01:39.580> you<00:01:39.730> know<00:01:39.850> there<00:01:40.030> are<00:01:40.150> some

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
acids for exhort you know there are some

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.790 
acids for exhort you know there are some
who'll<00:01:40.540> trying<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:40.960> bait<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.170> on<00:01:41.350> that<00:01:41.560> but

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
who'll trying to bait you on that but

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.520 
who'll trying to bait you on that but
you<00:01:42.010> know<00:01:42.850> most<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.270> research<00:01:43.600> pretty

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
you know most of the research pretty

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.930 
you know most of the research pretty
much<00:01:44.710> confirms<00:01:45.100> that<00:01:45.250> that's<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.580> case<00:01:45.730> so

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
much confirms that that's the case so

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.460 
much confirms that that's the case so
it's<00:01:46.360> gonna<00:01:46.480> take<00:01:46.690> it<00:01:46.840> it's<00:01:46.960> best<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.230> take<00:01:47.410> it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
it's gonna take it it's best to take it

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.590 
it's gonna take it it's best to take it
maybe<00:01:47.710> in<00:01:47.920> between<00:01:48.040> meals<00:01:48.550> or<00:01:48.940> you<00:01:49.480> know

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
maybe in between meals or you know

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.240 
maybe in between meals or you know
pre-workout<00:01:50.230> or<00:01:50.440> an<00:01:50.530> uneasy<00:01:50.770> stomach<00:01:51.100> that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
pre-workout or an uneasy stomach that

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.680 
pre-workout or an uneasy stomach that
seems<00:01:51.580> to<00:01:51.700> be<00:01:51.730> one<00:01:51.940> most<00:01:52.120> people<00:01:52.240> do<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.540> and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
seems to be one most people do it and

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.330 
seems to be one most people do it and
like<00:01:53.080> Len<00:01:53.320> says<00:01:53.560> it's<00:01:53.800> been<00:01:53.950> shown<00:01:54.100> to

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
like Len says it's been shown to

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.310 
like Len says it's been shown to
increase<00:01:54.700> rates<00:01:55.240> of<00:01:55.420> protein<00:01:55.750> synthesis

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
increase rates of protein synthesis

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.340 
increase rates of protein synthesis
decreased<00:01:57.310> protein<00:01:57.760> degradation<00:01:58.230> we<00:01:59.230> should

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
decreased protein degradation we should

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
decreased protein degradation we should
probably<00:01:59.440> cover<00:01:59.740> you<00:01:59.920> want<00:01:59.980> to<00:02:00.070> go<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:00.280> the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
probably cover you want to go to the

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.800 
probably cover you want to go to the
mechanism<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:00.970> action<00:02:01.150> kind<00:02:01.420> of<00:02:01.480> how<00:02:01.570> it<00:02:01.660> does

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
mechanism of action kind of how it does

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.200 
mechanism of action kind of how it does
that<00:02:02.020> by<00:02:02.410> activating<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.340> mTOR<00:02:03.700> pathway<00:02:03.730> yeah

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
that by activating the mTOR pathway yeah

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.000 
that by activating the mTOR pathway yeah
it<00:02:04.360> activates<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.840> mTOR<00:02:05.170> pathway<00:02:05.230> which

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
it activates the mTOR pathway which

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.249 
it activates the mTOR pathway which
essentially<00:02:06.880> keeps<00:02:07.120> your<00:02:07.270> body

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
essentially keeps your body

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.559 
essentially keeps your body
in<00:02:08.319> an<00:02:08.470> anabolic<00:02:08.800> state<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.729> stimulated<00:02:10.269> tells

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
in an anabolic state it stimulated tells

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.220 
in an anabolic state it stimulated tells
your<00:02:10.690> body<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:10.989> create<00:02:11.230> proteins<00:02:11.890> or<00:02:12.430> build

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
your body to create proteins or build

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.080 
your body to create proteins or build
the<00:02:14.230> cells<00:02:14.470> sense<00:02:14.799> a<00:02:14.950> higher<00:02:15.159> level<00:02:15.489> of<00:02:15.700> ATP

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
the cells sense a higher level of ATP

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.180 
the cells sense a higher level of ATP
which<00:02:16.540> activates<00:02:17.319> this<00:02:17.470> pathway<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:18.099> then

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
which activates this pathway and then

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.380 
which activates this pathway and then
the<00:02:18.280> opposite<00:02:18.670> happens<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.060> gets<00:02:19.209> blocked

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
the opposite happens it gets blocked

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.509 
the opposite happens it gets blocked
actually<00:02:19.810> when<00:02:19.930> ATP<00:02:20.200> levels<00:02:20.319> are<00:02:20.709> decreasing

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
actually when ATP levels are decreasing

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.809 
actually when ATP levels are decreasing
so<00:02:21.879> you<00:02:22.750> know<00:02:22.870> it's<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.769> protein<00:02:24.220> synthesis

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
so you know it's a protein synthesis

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.830 
so you know it's a protein synthesis
regulator<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.569> what<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.900> amatory<00:02:26.230> yeah<00:02:27.840> so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
regulator is what the amatory yeah so

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.420 
regulator is what the amatory yeah so
the<00:02:29.140> benefit<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.769> though<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:29.980> if<00:02:30.280> you're

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
the benefit of that though is if you're

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.100 
the benefit of that though is if you're
working<00:02:30.610> out<00:02:30.819> you<00:02:31.030> don't<00:02:31.239> want<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.480> be<00:02:31.569> using

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
working out you don't want to be using

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.869 
working out you don't want to be using
muscle<00:02:32.440> mass<00:02:32.590> or<00:02:32.739> protein<00:02:33.250> for<00:02:33.489> energy<00:02:33.610> or

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
muscle mass or protein for energy or

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.970 
muscle mass or protein for energy or
breaking<00:02:34.390> down<00:02:34.629> that<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.590> want<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:35.860> give

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
breaking down that you you want to give

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.720 
breaking down that you you want to give
in<00:02:36.069> to<00:02:36.129> be<00:02:36.220> in<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.340> state<00:02:36.519> where<00:02:36.579> you're

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
in to be in a state where you're

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.009 
in to be in a state where you're
building<00:02:36.879> so<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:37.390> that's<00:02:37.780> where<00:02:37.930> the

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
building so that that's where the

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.229 
building so that that's where the
benefit<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.769> these<00:02:39.190> three<00:02:39.700> branched<00:02:40.150> chain

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
benefit of of these three branched chain

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.420 
benefit of of these three branched chain
amino<00:02:40.269> acids<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.840> come<00:02:41.019> in<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:42.069> next<00:02:42.310> would<00:02:42.400> be

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
amino acids to come in the next would be

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.270 
amino acids to come in the next would be
glutamine<00:02:43.019> you'll<00:02:44.019> see<00:02:44.230> glutamine<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:45.099> been

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
glutamine you'll see glutamine it's been

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.410 
glutamine you'll see glutamine it's been
popular<00:02:45.700> for<00:02:45.730> years<00:02:46.239> as<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:47.290> recovery<00:02:47.980> agent

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
popular for years as a recovery agent

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.729 
popular for years as a recovery agent
helping<00:02:49.420> recover<00:02:49.660> it's<00:02:49.810> also<00:02:49.930> beneficial<00:02:50.590> to

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
helping recover it's also beneficial to

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.190 
helping recover it's also beneficial to
your<00:02:50.920> digestive<00:02:51.220> tract<00:02:51.819> now<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:52.750> here<00:02:53.019> there's

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
your digestive tract now in here there's

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.530 
your digestive tract now in here there's
two<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.530> half<00:02:53.650> grams<00:02:54.069> I<00:02:54.459> know<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.299> lot<00:02:55.510> of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
two and a half grams I know a lot of

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.660 
two and a half grams I know a lot of
studies<00:02:55.870> on<00:02:55.989> glutamine<00:02:56.379> show<00:02:56.859> really<00:02:57.340> really

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
studies on glutamine show really really

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.759 
studies on glutamine show really really
high<00:02:57.879> doses<00:02:58.480> before<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.049> get<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.530> point

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
high doses before you get to that point

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.180 
high doses before you get to that point
of<00:03:00.569> recovery<00:03:01.569> or<00:03:01.840> or<00:03:02.140> enhancing<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:02.980> even

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
of recovery or or enhancing it and even

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.860 
of recovery or or enhancing it and even
that<00:03:03.370> it's<00:03:03.609> become<00:03:04.030> kind<00:03:04.299> of<00:03:04.450> clear<00:03:04.690> that

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
that it's become kind of clear that

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.960 
that it's become kind of clear that
that's<00:03:04.959> not<00:03:05.109> even<00:03:05.459> effective<00:03:06.459> I<00:03:06.579> believe<00:03:06.849> that

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
that's not even effective I believe that

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.630 
that's not even effective I believe that
yeah<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.959> International<00:03:08.799> Society<00:03:09.160> Sports

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
yeah the International Society Sports

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.640 
yeah the International Society Sports
Nutrition<00:03:09.790> has<00:03:10.209> it<00:03:10.359> as<00:03:10.650> seemingly

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
Nutrition has it as seemingly

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.140 
Nutrition has it as seemingly
ineffective<00:03:12.190> at<00:03:12.310> this<00:03:12.430> point<00:03:12.669> so<00:03:12.880> like<00:03:13.060> you

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
ineffective at this point so like you

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.430 
ineffective at this point so like you
said<00:03:13.329> those<00:03:13.480> stomach<00:03:13.870> because<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.319> stomach

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
said those stomach because the stomach

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.589 
said those stomach because the stomach
lining<00:03:14.889> is<00:03:15.099> primarily<00:03:15.639> glue<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.239> me<00:03:16.359> amino

lining is primarily glue to me amino
acid<00:03:16.930> glutamine<00:03:17.319> and<00:03:17.530> you're<00:03:17.650> replacing<00:03:17.980> it

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
acid glutamine and you're replacing it

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.949 
acid glutamine and you're replacing it
constantly<00:03:18.819> as<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> human<00:03:19.209> being<00:03:19.419> to<00:03:19.660> make<00:03:19.690> up

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
constantly as a human being to make up

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.659 
constantly as a human being to make up
for<00:03:20.139> the<00:03:20.200> highly<00:03:20.530> acidic<00:03:20.769> environments<00:03:21.489> so

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
for the highly acidic environments so

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.569 
for the highly acidic environments so
yeah<00:03:22.090> you'll<00:03:22.450> see<00:03:22.480> most<00:03:22.900> product<00:03:23.889> or<00:03:24.069> like

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
yeah you'll see most product or like

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.890 
yeah you'll see most product or like
let's<00:03:24.880> say<00:03:25.000> there's<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.239> comprehensive

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
let's say there's a comprehensive

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.360 
let's say there's a comprehensive
product<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.349> your<00:03:26.410> digestive<00:03:26.889> tract<00:03:27.099> a<00:03:27.130> lot

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
product for your digestive tract a lot

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.009 
product for your digestive tract a lot
of<00:03:27.459> them<00:03:27.549> will<00:03:27.730> include<00:03:28.060> glutamine<00:03:28.630> because

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
of them will include glutamine because

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.750 
of them will include glutamine because
of<00:03:29.169> that<00:03:29.290> reason<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.829> lot<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.340> lining<00:03:30.549> of

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
of that reason a lot of the lining of

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.610 
of that reason a lot of the lining of
your<00:03:30.790> intestines<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.480> colon<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:32.049> glutamine

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
your intestines and colon is glutamine

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.670 
your intestines and colon is glutamine
so<00:03:33.359> this<00:03:34.359> two<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.780> half<00:03:34.900> grams<00:03:35.139> is<00:03:35.319> probably

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
so this two and a half grams is probably

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.319 
so this two and a half grams is probably
just<00:03:35.829> gonna<00:03:35.919> get<00:03:36.160> taken<00:03:36.519> up<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:36.790> remained

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
just gonna get taken up and remained

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.020 
just gonna get taken up and remained
there<00:03:37.950> doesn't<00:03:38.950> need<00:03:39.040> for<00:03:39.430> digest<00:03:39.760> yeah<00:03:39.880> some

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
there doesn't need for digest yeah some

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.699 
there doesn't need for digest yeah some
of<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.239> effects<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:40.930> you'd<00:03:41.139> read<00:03:41.349> in<00:03:41.620> the

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
of the effects that you'd read in the

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.289 
of the effects that you'd read in the
magazines<00:03:41.859> that<00:03:42.250> say<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:42.489> know<00:03:42.730> late<00:03:42.910> 90s

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
magazines that say you know late 90s

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.849 
magazines that say you know late 90s
early<00:03:43.359> 2000<00:03:44.049> so<00:03:44.169> it<00:03:44.380> turned<00:03:44.620> out<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.769> be

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
early 2000 so it turned out to be

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.580 
early 2000 so it turned out to be
hyperbole<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:45.639> yeah<00:03:45.940> we'll<00:03:46.480> we'll<00:03:46.870> wait<00:03:47.500> and

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
hyperbole so yeah we'll we'll wait and

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.379 
hyperbole so yeah we'll we'll wait and
find<00:03:47.799> out<00:03:47.980> but<00:03:48.010> that's<00:03:48.430> that's<00:03:48.910> kind<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.239> where

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
find out but that's that's kind of where

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:50.430 
find out but that's that's kind of where
that's<00:03:49.480> at<00:03:49.690> right<00:03:49.870> now<00:03:50.019> in<00:03:50.139> terms<00:03:50.230> of

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
that's at right now in terms of

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.740 
that's at right now in terms of
glutamine<00:03:50.799> moving<00:03:51.730> on<00:03:51.849> to<00:03:52.060> citrulline<00:03:52.569> malate

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
glutamine moving on to citrulline malate

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.289 
glutamine moving on to citrulline malate
yeah<00:03:53.590> basically<00:03:54.190> citrulline<00:03:54.879> malate<00:03:55.000> can

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
yeah basically citrulline malate can

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.759 
yeah basically citrulline malate can
increase<00:03:55.599> the<00:03:55.720> amount<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:56.049> arginine<00:03:56.440> in<00:03:56.680> the

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
increase the amount of arginine in the

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.400 
increase the amount of arginine in the
body<00:03:56.950> weight<00:03:57.879> and<00:03:58.120> it's<00:03:58.239> also<00:03:58.419> a<00:03:58.629> an<00:03:59.019> arginine

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
body weight and it's also a an arginine

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.629 
body weight and it's also a an arginine
inhibitor

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
inhibitor

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.360 
inhibitor
what<00:04:01.389> that<00:04:01.540> would<00:04:01.690> mean<00:04:01.720> is<00:04:02.019> that<00:04:02.069> it<00:04:03.069> can<00:04:03.250> help

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
what that would mean is that it can help

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.009 
what that would mean is that it can help
with<00:04:03.549> pumps<00:04:03.849> are<00:04:03.970> increasing<00:04:04.359> nitric<00:04:04.480> oxide

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.189 
with pumps are increasing nitric oxide
levels<00:04:05.049> in<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.620> body<00:04:05.739> I<00:04:06.660> I've<00:04:07.660> seen<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:08.049> used

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
levels in the body I I've seen it used

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.439 
levels in the body I I've seen it used
for<00:04:08.400> increasing<00:04:09.400> endurance<00:04:09.669> it<00:04:10.030> also<00:04:10.150> can

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
for increasing endurance it also can

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.400 
for increasing endurance it also can
lower<00:04:10.720> lack<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.169> gas<00:04:11.379> alone

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
lower lack the gas alone

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.740 
lower lack the gas alone

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
acid build up as you're working out

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.490

throughout the workout as far as an

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.670 
throughout the workout as far as an
artemis<00:04:18.920> inhibitor<00:04:19.519> as<00:04:20.420> your<00:04:20.600> body<00:04:20.900> produces

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
artemis inhibitor as your body produces

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.340 
artemis inhibitor as your body produces
nitric<00:04:22.220> oxide<00:04:22.580> or<00:04:22.790> uses<00:04:23.450> arginine<00:04:24.020> in<00:04:24.230> the

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
nitric oxide or uses arginine in the

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.520 
nitric oxide or uses arginine in the
production<00:04:24.680> of<00:04:24.920> our<00:04:25.120> nitric<00:04:26.120> oxide<00:04:26.450> your<00:04:27.290> body

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
production of our nitric oxide your body

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.170 
production of our nitric oxide your body
combat<00:04:28.010> set<00:04:28.430> with<00:04:28.610> an<00:04:28.730> enzyme<00:04:29.030> called

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
combat set with an enzyme called

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.120 
combat set with an enzyme called
arginine<00:04:29.690> which<00:04:29.900> will<00:04:30.140> help<00:04:30.260> which<00:04:30.710> actually

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
arginine which will help which actually

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.340 
arginine which will help which actually
can<00:04:31.430> decrease<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.270> from<00:04:32.420> having<00:04:32.600> or<00:04:32.840> decrease

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
can decrease it from having or decrease

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.320 
can decrease it from having or decrease
your<00:04:33.410> nitric<00:04:33.800> oxide<00:04:34.100> production<00:04:34.400> yeah

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
your nitric oxide production yeah

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.090 
your nitric oxide production yeah
because<00:04:35.540> in<00:04:36.230> some<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.740> arjun<00:04:37.010> is

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
because in some of the arjun is

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.230 
because in some of the arjun is
inhibited<00:04:37.490> has<00:04:37.640> been<00:04:37.730> thought<00:04:37.880> that<00:04:38.090> there

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
inhibited has been thought that there

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.970 
inhibited has been thought that there
there's<00:04:38.570> some<00:04:38.750> negative<00:04:39.110> effects<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.560> that<00:04:39.710> to

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
there's some negative effects to that to

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.130 
there's some negative effects to that to
that<00:04:40.010> you're<00:04:40.340> seeing<00:04:40.580> some<00:04:40.760> people<00:04:40.910> say<00:04:41.240> you

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
that you're seeing some people say you

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.950 
that you're seeing some people say you
know<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.350> main<00:04:42.560> thought<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:42.920> that<00:04:43.220> if<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.960> you

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
know the main thought is that if you you

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.020 
know the main thought is that if you you
know<00:04:45.050> decrease<00:04:45.650> if<00:04:45.920> you're<00:04:46.160> inhibiting<00:04:46.670> RJ's

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
know decrease if you're inhibiting RJ's

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.950 
know decrease if you're inhibiting RJ's
like<00:04:47.210> you<00:04:47.270> said<00:04:47.450> you're<00:04:47.600> gonna<00:04:47.690> increase

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
like you said you're gonna increase

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.360 
like you said you're gonna increase
nitric<00:04:48.320> oxide<00:04:48.650> levels<00:04:48.680> but<00:04:49.070> there<00:04:49.190> might<00:04:49.340> be

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
nitric oxide levels but there might be

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.430 
nitric oxide levels but there might be
some<00:04:49.610> negative<00:04:49.760> effects<00:04:50.180> and<00:04:50.420> urea<00:04:50.900> content

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
some negative effects and urea content

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.380 
some negative effects and urea content
because<00:04:51.710> it<00:04:51.830> all<00:04:51.920> helps<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:52.700> actually<00:04:53.150> slows

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
because it all helps it actually slows

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.560 
because it all helps it actually slows
the<00:04:53.630> production<00:04:54.140> of<00:04:54.230> urea<00:04:54.610> so<00:04:55.610> that's<00:04:56.270> another

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
the production of urea so that's another

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.630 
the production of urea so that's another
thought<00:04:56.900> you<00:04:57.530> know<00:04:57.620> most<00:04:57.950> of<00:04:58.040> the<00:04:58.130> research<00:04:58.490> in

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
thought you know most of the research in

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.340 
thought you know most of the research in
this<00:04:58.730> area<00:04:59.000> that<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.570> I<00:04:59.600> have<00:04:59.810> seen<00:05:00.050> has<00:05:00.200> been

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
this area that that I have seen has been

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.320 
this area that that I have seen has been
on<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:01.100> effects<00:05:01.400> on<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.640> penile<00:05:02.000> tissue

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
on the effects on the penile tissue

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.330 
on the effects on the penile tissue
actually<00:05:02.630> thinking<00:05:03.140> or<00:05:03.290> veiling<00:05:03.680> is<00:05:03.860> another

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
actually thinking or veiling is another

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.280 
actually thinking or veiling is another
one<00:05:04.550> that's<00:05:04.700> a<00:05:04.880> Arjun<00:05:05.480> ace<00:05:05.600> inhibitor<00:05:06.080> and

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
one that's a Arjun ace inhibitor and

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.070 
one that's a Arjun ace inhibitor and
just<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.400> fact<00:05:08.000> is<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.540> study<00:05:08.780> that<00:05:08.840> we've

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
just the fact is the study that we've

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.290 
just the fact is the study that we've
seen<00:05:09.440> have<00:05:10.220> shown<00:05:10.400> that<00:05:10.520> to<00:05:10.670> be<00:05:10.790> ineffective

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
seen have shown that to be ineffective

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.480 
seen have shown that to be ineffective
at<00:05:11.600> this<00:05:11.720> point<00:05:11.990> so<00:05:12.260> you<00:05:12.530> know<00:05:13.220> there's<00:05:13.430> no

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
at this point so you know there's no

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.880 
at this point so you know there's no
magic<00:05:14.090> supplements<00:05:15.050> so<00:05:15.170> far<00:05:15.380> that<00:05:15.530> we've<00:05:15.650> seen

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
magic supplements so far that we've seen

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.560 
magic supplements so far that we've seen
as<00:05:16.070> far<00:05:16.250> as<00:05:16.340> increasing<00:05:16.790> nitric<00:05:16.880> oxide<00:05:17.450> levels

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
as far as increasing nitric oxide levels

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.770 
as far as increasing nitric oxide levels
so<00:05:17.960> know<00:05:18.380> your<00:05:18.860> body's<00:05:19.330> always<00:05:20.330> has<00:05:20.570> its

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
so know your body's always has its

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.080 
so know your body's always has its
mechanisms<00:05:21.380> to<00:05:21.560> remain<00:05:21.860> at<00:05:22.430> a<00:05:22.460> homeostasis

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
mechanisms to remain at a homeostasis

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.130 
mechanisms to remain at a homeostasis
level<00:05:23.630> or<00:05:23.930> remain<00:05:24.610> balanced<00:05:25.610> so<00:05:25.930> it<00:05:26.930> does

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
level or remain balanced so it does

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.330 
level or remain balanced so it does
generally<00:05:27.560> start<00:05:27.800> to<00:05:27.890> fight<00:05:28.100> these<00:05:28.280> things

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
generally start to fight these things

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.159 
generally start to fight these things
now<00:05:28.850> you're<00:05:29.120> gonna<00:05:29.270> find<00:05:29.510> that<00:05:29.750> there's<00:05:29.990> a

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
now you're gonna find that there's a

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.860 
now you're gonna find that there's a
study<00:05:30.590> if<00:05:30.740> you<00:05:30.770> go<00:05:30.950> look<00:05:31.190> I'm<00:05:32.060> spending

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
study if you go look I'm spending

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.480 
study if you go look I'm spending
specifically<00:05:33.440> that<00:05:33.950> was<00:05:34.100> funded<00:05:34.460> by

specifically that was funded by
saivation<00:05:35.000> and<00:05:35.480> the<00:05:36.260> study<00:05:36.530> would<00:05:36.740> have<00:05:36.890> you

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
saivation and the study would have you

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.370 
saivation and the study would have you
believe<00:05:37.190> that<00:05:37.630> BCAAs<00:05:38.630> are<00:05:38.810> superior<00:05:39.169> to

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
believe that BCAAs are superior to

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.500 
believe that BCAAs are superior to
carbohydrates<00:05:40.280> which<00:05:40.520> you<00:05:40.820> know<00:05:40.940> probably

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
carbohydrates which you know probably

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.720 
carbohydrates which you know probably
are<00:05:41.660> but<00:05:42.620> depending<00:05:42.919> on<00:05:42.980> what<00:05:43.040> the<00:05:43.190> uses<00:05:43.310> for

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
are but depending on what the uses for

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
of all this published study is just an

you<00:05:54.530> have<00:05:54.620> to<00:05:54.770> take<00:05:54.919> that<00:05:55.070> with<00:05:55.190> a<00:05:55.250> grain<00:05:55.340> of

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
you have to take that with a grain of

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.870 
you have to take that with a grain of

what<00:05:56.240> we<00:05:56.390> do<00:05:56.630> know<00:05:56.810> from<00:05:57.050> other<00:05:57.260> research<00:05:57.350> is

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
what we do know from other research is

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.250 
what we do know from other research is
that<00:05:58.210> like<00:05:59.210> we<00:05:59.330> discussed<00:05:59.630> it'll<00:05:59.990> increase

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
that like we discussed it'll increase

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.840 
that like we discussed it'll increase
the<00:06:00.530> rate<00:06:00.650> of<00:06:00.770> protein<00:06:00.890> synthesis<00:06:01.550> it'll

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
the rate of protein synthesis it'll

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.909 
the rate of protein synthesis it'll
decrease<00:06:02.030> protein<00:06:02.690> degradation<00:06:02.870> again<00:06:03.740> by

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
decrease protein degradation again by

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.800 
decrease protein degradation again by
activating<00:06:04.310> that<00:06:04.370> mTOR<00:06:04.669> pathway<00:06:04.730> now<00:06:05.330> another

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
activating that mTOR pathway now another

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.180 
activating that mTOR pathway now another
way<00:06:05.960> to<00:06:06.020> do<00:06:06.169> that<00:06:06.320> is<00:06:06.560> if<00:06:06.710> you're<00:06:06.860> eating<00:06:06.950> a<00:06:07.070> lot

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
way to do that is if you're eating a lot

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.820 
way to do that is if you're eating a lot
of<00:06:07.310> carbohydrates<00:06:07.640> you<00:06:08.630> know<00:06:08.720> your<00:06:09.230> calendars

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
of carbohydrates you know your calendars

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.040 
of carbohydrates you know your calendars
are<00:06:09.919> full<00:06:10.040> you're<00:06:10.190> not<00:06:10.310> going<00:06:10.490> to<00:06:10.550> have<00:06:10.760> that

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
are full you're not going to have that

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.740 
are full you're not going to have that
concern<00:06:11.409> of<00:06:12.150> breaking<00:06:13.150> down<00:06:13.300> muscle<00:06:13.539> tissue

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
concern of breaking down muscle tissue

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.540 
concern of breaking down muscle tissue
that's<00:06:14.259> not<00:06:14.440> that's<00:06:14.770> not<00:06:14.919> a<00:06:15.009> concern<00:06:15.370> because

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
that's not that's not a concern because

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.550 
that's not that's not a concern because
your<00:06:15.819> body<00:06:15.970> is<00:06:16.060> going<00:06:16.300> to<00:06:16.569> have<00:06:17.199> plenty<00:06:17.409> of

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
your body is going to have plenty of

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.659 
your body is going to have plenty of
calories<00:06:17.949> you<00:06:18.039> know<00:06:18.129> your<00:06:18.220> vies<00:06:18.310> haven't

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
calories you know your vies haven't

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.339

turned<00:06:18.789> to<00:06:19.000> protein<00:06:19.569> degradation<00:06:19.750> if<00:06:20.199> your

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
turned to protein degradation if your

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.140 
turned to protein degradation if your
blood<00:06:20.500> sugars<00:06:20.770> not<00:06:20.949> yeah<00:06:21.460> if<00:06:21.759> you're<00:06:21.909> if

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
blood sugars not yeah if you're if

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.969 
blood sugars not yeah if you're if
you're<00:06:22.180> a<00:06:22.360> bodybuilder<00:06:22.780> or<00:06:23.139> an<00:06:23.440> athlete

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
you're a bodybuilder or an athlete

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.469 
you're a bodybuilder or an athlete
you're<00:06:24.129> generally<00:06:24.460> going<00:06:24.490> to<00:06:24.639> be<00:06:24.699> taking<00:06:25.090> in<00:06:25.240> a

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
you're generally going to be taking in a

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.809 
you're generally going to be taking in a
meal<00:06:25.810> every<00:06:26.199> you<00:06:26.650> know<00:06:26.740> two<00:06:27.129> three<00:06:27.460> four<00:06:27.639> hours

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819 
meal every you know two three four hours

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:29.790 
meal every you know two three four hours
so<00:06:28.210> and<00:06:28.449> in<00:06:28.780> those<00:06:28.930> meals<00:06:29.229> that's<00:06:29.440> generally<00:06:29.740> a

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
so and in those meals that's generally a

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.499 
so and in those meals that's generally a
lot<00:06:29.889> of<00:06:30.009> protein<00:06:30.400> so<00:06:30.639> you're<00:06:31.000> getting<00:06:31.360> in

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509 
lot of protein so you're getting in

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.180 
lot of protein so you're getting in
enough<00:06:31.810> of<00:06:31.960> these<00:06:32.110> amino<00:06:32.470> acids<00:06:32.860> throughout

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
enough of these amino acids throughout

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.290 
enough of these amino acids throughout
that<00:06:33.340> yeah<00:06:33.520> and<00:06:33.699> if<00:06:33.759> you're<00:06:33.849> on<00:06:33.940> a<00:06:34.000> low-calorie

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
that yeah and if you're on a low-calorie

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.909 
that yeah and if you're on a low-calorie
diet<00:06:34.690> I<00:06:34.840> think<00:06:34.990> that's<00:06:35.199> where<00:06:35.409> this<00:06:35.500> product

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
diet I think that's where this product

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.320 
diet I think that's where this product
can<00:06:36.129> shine<00:06:36.340> for<00:06:36.550> you<00:06:36.669> you<00:06:36.819> know<00:06:36.909> leading<00:06:37.120> up<00:06:37.300> to

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
can shine for you you know leading up to

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.909 
can shine for you you know leading up to

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
a workout you want something that's not

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.710 
a workout you want something that's not
gonna<00:06:39.159> you<00:06:39.699> know<00:06:39.729> inhibit<00:06:40.180> your<00:06:40.270> ability<00:06:40.330> to

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
gonna you know inhibit your ability to

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.689 
gonna you know inhibit your ability to
burn<00:06:40.810> body<00:06:40.990> fat<00:06:41.280> and<00:06:42.280> so<00:06:42.400> you<00:06:42.460> don't<00:06:42.520> wanna

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:42.699 
burn body fat and so you don't wanna

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:44.790 
burn body fat and so you don't wanna
suck<00:06:42.909> down<00:06:43.030> a<00:06:43.090> bunch<00:06:43.300> of<00:06:43.330> carbohydrates<00:06:43.800> here

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
suck down a bunch of carbohydrates here

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.430 
suck down a bunch of carbohydrates here
you<00:06:44.889> go<00:06:45.039> you<00:06:45.490> know<00:06:45.610> take<00:06:46.090> your<00:06:46.270> BCAAs<00:06:47.199> they're

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
you go you know take your BCAAs they're

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.869 
you go you know take your BCAAs they're
shown<00:06:47.680> there's<00:06:48.219> nothing<00:06:48.550> wrong<00:06:48.699> with<00:06:48.759> that

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:48.879 
shown there's nothing wrong with that

it'll help you you know reduce your body

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:54.659 
it'll help you you know reduce your body
fat<00:06:50.530> levels<00:06:51.719> so<00:06:52.719> in<00:06:53.319> late<00:06:53.680> fatigue<00:06:54.009> as<00:06:54.190> well<00:06:54.219> so

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
fat levels so in late fatigue as well so

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:56.369 
fat levels so in late fatigue as well so
can<00:06:54.849> help<00:06:55.030> increase<00:06:55.569> performance<00:06:56.229> even

00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:56.379 
can help increase performance even

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:58.200 
can help increase performance even
though<00:06:56.469> you're<00:06:56.680> on<00:06:56.770> hypocaloric<00:06:57.190> diet<00:06:57.550> it'll

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
though you're on hypocaloric diet it'll

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.309 
though you're on hypocaloric diet it'll
help<00:06:58.330> the<00:06:58.479> length<00:06:58.659> of<00:06:58.780> tea<00:06:58.930> because<00:06:59.199> you're

help the length of tea because you're

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:00.689 
help the length of tea because you're
going<00:06:59.440> to<00:06:59.500> give<00:06:59.620> your<00:06:59.710> body<00:06:59.770> another<00:07:00.159> source

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
going to give your body another source

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:02.550 
going to give your body another source
of<00:07:00.819> as<00:07:00.969> you<00:07:01.210> again<00:07:01.449> and<00:07:01.719> then<00:07:01.810> hibbott<00:07:02.289> the

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 
of as you again and then hibbott the

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.800 
of as you again and then hibbott the
degradation<00:07:02.979> of<00:07:03.400> protein<00:07:03.789> I<00:07:03.909> eat<00:07:04.060> muscle<00:07:04.419> as

degradation of protein I eat muscle as

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.119 
degradation of protein I eat muscle as
far<00:07:05.080> as<00:07:05.139> we're<00:07:05.289> concerned<00:07:05.319> with<00:07:05.770> this<00:07:05.889> so

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:06.129 
far as we're concerned with this so

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:09.029 
far as we're concerned with this so
again<00:07:06.849> you'll<00:07:07.030> see<00:07:07.210> that<00:07:07.389> study<00:07:07.690> but<00:07:08.229> you<00:07:08.919> know

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 
again you'll see that study but you know

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:10.770 
again you'll see that study but you know
we<00:07:09.219> read<00:07:09.340> it<00:07:09.460> to<00:07:09.639> you<00:07:10.150> got<00:07:10.270> to<00:07:10.360> go<00:07:10.539> to<00:07:10.629> grain

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:10.780 
we read it to you got to go to grain

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.180 
we read it to you got to go to grain
assault<00:07:11.080> at<00:07:11.229> this<00:07:11.349> point<00:07:11.590> because<00:07:11.740> of<00:07:12.039> that

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:12.190 
assault at this point because of that

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.939 
assault at this point because of that
yeah<00:07:12.699> and<00:07:13.539> we're<00:07:13.690> not<00:07:13.719> down<00:07:14.080> on<00:07:14.110> BCA<00:07:14.620> we're

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:14.949 
yeah and we're not down on BCA we're

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:16.499 
yeah and we're not down on BCA we're
just<00:07:15.099> saying<00:07:15.250> this<00:07:15.400> is<00:07:15.580> what<00:07:15.610> they<00:07:15.940> do<00:07:16.000> and

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:16.509 
just saying this is what they do and

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:18.209 
just saying this is what they do and
this<00:07:16.840> is<00:07:17.020> when<00:07:17.169> their<00:07:17.319> best<00:07:17.529> their<00:07:17.770> best<00:07:18.039> when

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:18.219 
this is when their best their best when

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:19.620 
this is when their best their best when
you're<00:07:18.340> on<00:07:18.430> a<00:07:18.460> high<00:07:18.580> perchloric<00:07:19.060> diet<00:07:19.300> and

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:19.630 
you're on a high perchloric diet and

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.029 
you're on a high perchloric diet and
that's<00:07:20.229> what<00:07:20.319> they<00:07:20.409> do<00:07:20.469> I<00:07:20.620> know<00:07:20.800> there's<00:07:21.009> been

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 
that's what they do I know there's been

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:23.040 
that's what they do I know there's been
a<00:07:21.159> lot<00:07:21.310> of<00:07:21.340> research<00:07:21.669> on<00:07:22.000> leucine<00:07:22.509> especially

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.050 
a lot of research on leucine especially

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.439 
a lot of research on leucine especially
and<00:07:23.169> its<00:07:23.319> effect<00:07:23.680> on<00:07:23.830> the<00:07:23.940> insulin<00:07:24.940> insulin

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:25.449 
and its effect on the insulin insulin

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:27.420 
and its effect on the insulin insulin
yeah<00:07:25.719> they're<00:07:26.349> saying<00:07:26.620> that<00:07:26.830> when<00:07:27.039> you<00:07:27.159> take<00:07:27.370> a

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.430 
yeah they're saying that when you take a

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.890 
yeah they're saying that when you take a
high<00:07:27.669> enough<00:07:27.849> dosage<00:07:28.029> of<00:07:28.270> leucine<00:07:28.659> it<00:07:28.779> can

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:28.900 
high enough dosage of leucine it can

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.110 
high enough dosage of leucine it can
actually<00:07:29.020> cause<00:07:29.349> an<00:07:29.560> insulin<00:07:29.919> spike<00:07:30.039> or<00:07:30.849> cause

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 
actually cause an insulin spike or cause

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.670 
actually cause an insulin spike or cause
your<00:07:31.270> body<00:07:31.419> to<00:07:31.569> release<00:07:31.840> in<00:07:32.020> so<00:07:32.139> much<00:07:32.409> like

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 
your body to release in so much like

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.459 
your body to release in so much like
carbohydrates<00:07:33.370> reduce<00:07:34.120> so<00:07:34.449> there<00:07:35.289> is<00:07:35.440> a

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:35.469 
carbohydrates reduce so there is a

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:37.290 
carbohydrates reduce so there is a
benefit<00:07:35.949> there<00:07:36.130> yeah<00:07:36.580> that's<00:07:36.819> fine<00:07:37.000> and<00:07:37.180> then

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300 
benefit there yeah that's fine and then

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.550 
benefit there yeah that's fine and then
there's<00:07:37.449> another<00:07:37.509> study<00:07:37.900> that's<00:07:38.080> contrarian

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 
there's another study that's contrarian

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.140 
there's another study that's contrarian
to<00:07:38.740> that<00:07:38.889> that<00:07:39.039> basically<00:07:39.310> says<00:07:39.580> that<00:07:39.610> you

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.150 
to that that basically says that you

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.240 
to that that basically says that you
know<00:07:40.270> the<00:07:40.300> BCA's<00:07:41.080> did<00:07:41.349> not<00:07:41.560> increase<00:07:41.949> the

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.250 
know the BCA's did not increase the

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.550 
know the BCA's did not increase the
serum<00:07:42.550> insulin<00:07:42.879> levels<00:07:43.180> so<00:07:43.300> we're<00:07:43.779> really<00:07:44.020> you

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 
serum insulin levels so we're really you

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.749 
serum insulin levels so we're really you
know<00:07:44.680> not<00:07:44.830> sure<00:07:45.009> in<00:07:45.129> that<00:07:45.219> sense<00:07:45.460> but<00:07:45.580> again

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 
know not sure in that sense but again

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:46.950 
know not sure in that sense but again
we've<00:07:45.940> I<00:07:46.180> think<00:07:46.330> we've<00:07:46.449> done<00:07:46.539> a<00:07:46.599> good<00:07:46.719> job<00:07:46.779> of

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 
we've I think we've done a good job of

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.659 
we've I think we've done a good job of
highlighting<00:07:47.139> exactly<00:07:47.800> where<00:07:48.370> these<00:07:48.520> are

00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:48.669 
highlighting exactly where these are

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:49.920 
highlighting exactly where these are
going<00:07:48.789> to<00:07:48.849> shine<00:07:49.090> where<00:07:49.449> they're<00:07:49.539> gonna<00:07:49.599> help

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:49.930 
going to shine where they're gonna help

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.570 
going to shine where they're gonna help
and<00:07:50.139> then<00:07:50.500> on<00:07:50.620> the<00:07:50.710> citrulline<00:07:51.099> front<00:07:51.400> too

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:51.580 
and then on the citrulline front too

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.100 
and then on the citrulline front too
when<00:07:51.759> we<00:07:51.879> talk<00:07:52.029> about<00:07:52.060> our<00:07:52.300> J's<00:07:52.539> numbers<00:07:52.779> we're

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.110 
when we talk about our J's numbers we're

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.510 
when we talk about our J's numbers we're
not<00:07:53.229> closing<00:07:53.440> the<00:07:53.650> book<00:07:53.800> on<00:07:53.949> it<00:07:53.979> we<00:07:54.219> would<00:07:54.400> just

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520 
not closing the book on it we would just

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.369 
not closing the book on it we would just
like<00:07:54.669> to<00:07:54.789> see<00:07:54.940> some<00:07:55.150> more<00:07:55.180> human<00:07:55.990> studies<00:07:56.259> to

00:07:56.369 --> 00:07:56.379 
like to see some more human studies to

00:07:56.379 --> 00:07:58.140 
like to see some more human studies to
see<00:07:56.590> how<00:07:56.800> these<00:07:57.219> are<00:07:57.490> jenay's<00:07:57.759> and<00:07:57.879> coders<00:07:58.029> are

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:58.150 
see how these are jenay's and coders are

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.939 
see how these are jenay's and coders are
gonna<00:07:58.330> help<00:07:58.539> with<00:07:58.690> nitric<00:07:58.990> oxide<00:07:59.349> levels<00:07:59.440> you

00:07:59.939 --> 00:07:59.949 
gonna help with nitric oxide levels you
