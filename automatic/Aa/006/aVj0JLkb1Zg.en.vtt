00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.789 
brilliance it's a partnership I really
don't<00:01:39.329> know<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.570> know<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.590> seems

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
don't know you know like it just seems

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.830 
don't know you know like it just seems
that<00:01:41.189> obviously<00:01:41.549> because<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.150> are<00:01:42.329> getting

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that obviously because we are getting

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.770 
that obviously because we are getting
stronger<00:01:43.200> as<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.460> know<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.909> think<00:01:45.149> more

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
stronger as a you know I think more

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
stronger as a you know I think more
confident<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.740> each<00:01:46.890> other<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.399> know<00:01:47.430> I

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
confident with each other you know I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.580 
confident with each other you know I
know<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.880> sounds<00:01:48.180> silly<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:48.630> we're<00:01:49.350> getting

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
know that sounds silly but we're getting

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.010 
know that sounds silly but we're getting
braver<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.340> what<00:01:50.850> we're<00:01:51.000> saying<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.930> I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
braver is what we're saying and and I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020 
braver is what we're saying and and I
think<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.590> letting<00:01:53.040> me<00:01:53.159> go<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.610> more<00:01:53.790> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
think it's letting me go for more and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.520 
think it's letting me go for more and
more<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.360> more<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:54.930> that's<00:01:55.320> where

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
more and more and I think that's where

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.990 
more and more and I think that's where
the<00:01:55.649> marks<00:01:55.890> keep<00:01:56.100> coming<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> fact<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.880> I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
the marks keep coming the fact that I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.270 
the marks keep coming the fact that I
can<00:01:57.210> get<00:01:57.390> braver<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.869> bit<00:01:58.590> by<00:01:58.740> bit<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.979> get<00:01:59.250> a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
can get braver and bit by bit I get a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.670 
can get braver and bit by bit I get a
bit<00:01:59.460> more<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.469> know<00:02:01.590> obviously

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
bit more and so it's you know obviously

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.980 
bit more and so it's you know obviously
I'm<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.850> lucky<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> horse<00:02:03.869> like
