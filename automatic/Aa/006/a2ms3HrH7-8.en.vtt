00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.810 
real long time - since it stains them so
I'm<00:03:48.390> really<00:03:48.630> excited<00:03:48.870> about<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:50.250> can<00:03:50.700> go

eat<00:03:51.090> like<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.600> billion<00:03:52.020> cheeseburgers<00:03:52.620> or<00:03:53.430> kiss

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
eat like a billion cheeseburgers or kiss

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.210 
eat like a billion cheeseburgers or kiss
a<00:03:54.000> million<00:03:54.330> people<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.020> it'll<00:03:55.710> just<00:03:55.980> stay<00:03:56.190> on

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
a million people and it'll just stay on

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.250 
a million people and it'll just stay on
and<00:03:56.670> that's<00:03:57.240> something<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.570> can<00:03:57.690> get<00:03:57.810> behind<00:03:57.870> -

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
and that's something I can get behind -

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.650 
and that's something I can get behind -
so<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:59.100> has<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.250> really<00:03:59.490> subtle<00:03:59.820> effect<00:04:00.390> but

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
so it has a really subtle effect but

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.440 
so it has a really subtle effect but
it's<00:04:00.810> nice<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:01.440> colorful<00:04:01.950> or<00:04:02.100> like<00:04:02.300> but<00:04:03.300> not

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
it's nice and colorful or like but not

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.810 
it's nice and colorful or like but not
without<00:04:03.870> being<00:04:04.260> overpowering<00:04:04.640> which<00:04:05.640> is

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
without being overpowering which is

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.520 
without being overpowering which is
funny<00:04:06.090> because<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.360> lot<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.570> tints<00:04:07.020> look<00:04:07.320> like

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
funny because a lot of tints look like

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.010 
funny because a lot of tints look like
they'd<00:04:07.770> be<00:04:07.950> really<00:04:08.130> intense<00:04:08.670> but<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.870> can

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
they'd be really intense but you can

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.180 
they'd be really intense but you can
kind<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.350> like<00:04:10.530> decide<00:04:10.860> that<00:04:10.980> for<00:04:11.040> yourself

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
kind of like decide that for yourself

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.130 
kind of like decide that for yourself
based<00:04:11.700> on<00:04:11.820> how<00:04:11.910> much<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.180> put<00:04:12.330> on<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.900> I

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140
