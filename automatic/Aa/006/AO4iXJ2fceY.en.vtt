00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.309
 Hello my name is Alexander and Ronit 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.880
 Today the collections begin 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.800
 devoted about understood 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.320
 or the fact that they are associated with aerodynamics 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.050
 safety meteorology and so on 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.400
 everything will not be 1 quiet the lecture is devoted to 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.330
 tinkoff education 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.330
 so, let's begin 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.349
 to begin, consider the process 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.070
 education technicians but an example 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.890
 liquid for greater clarity we take 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.840
 small vessel 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.880
 with water and add on dyes 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.050
 so that when 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.650
 width 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.490
 how it produces heat this vessel 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:54.190
 I have more temperature contrast and put 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.230
 I suck a larger volume of the desired with water 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.239
 room temperature 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.329
 and watch what happens heated 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.370
 fluid it is lighter and starts 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.560
 no rise 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.930
 it should be noted that we have polycom vessels 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.190
 two holes through one hole will 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.369
 leaving the floor warm 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.110
 warm water and through 2 holes cold 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.580
 water let go inside small 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.850
 fishing lines also occur in vessels 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.479
 on the place understand glass water 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.130
 and cold air is sucked in 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.259
 corresponding areas 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.390
 happens until all moments 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.070
 air milky 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.730
 start cold 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.890
 here we have risen 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.600
 there is a window measure and further happens 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.390
 process over important 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.400
 Well, rather than the processes put on 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.190
 large vessel 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.770
 a small piece of ice that we share 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.219
 falling liquid 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.219
 end down 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.260
 if we look to engage 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.920
 there is 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.920
 our little ones 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.899
 to be 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.090
 so convection occurs 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.619
 a similar process occurs in nature 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.870
 air pro hang on some 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.380
 surface of the earth begins to rise 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.290
 up 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.480
 where entering the cold atmosphere 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.340
 the process of water condensation occurs 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.349
 cools and starts to decline down 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.920
 something similar happens in the mountains 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.560
 process the only difference is that 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.630
 progress is better on those 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.710
 sought to participate which connector tucson 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.350
 different tree for 3 days 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.890
 are better surfaces that 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.930
 more back 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.700
 same air reaches aroma 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.690
 remains the atmosphere and starts 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.460
 drop 30 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.190
 the term education process has 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.140
 several phases at the beginning of digging the plot 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.750
 land starts to heat up faster than 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.850
 ambient when the temperature is heated 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.340
 air reaches a critical point 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.380
 the air comes off the ground and starts 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.690
 climb up walk from cold 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.970
 layers moisture in warm air 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.590
 starts to condense then 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.190
 cumulus clouds appear 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.680
 this is the top of the terme to and the more powerful the battle 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.470
 the term more heated air and 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.740
 rate of rise the higher will be the development 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.420
 heaps vova clouds by evening process 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.390
 thermal activity ceases 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.640
 due to the lack of heating as 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.830
 advancing terme to inside the cloud he 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.740
 fueled by continuing to rise 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.510
 warm air below 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.930
 at the same time the cloud has the shape of a triangle 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.220
 from the top , get in the photo 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.470
 no clear boundaries 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.420
 the clouds which talk about this strong 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.060
 the rise 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.090
 the fact that I will continue to grow sewn 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.190
 active moisture condensation during 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.459
 time flow you realize that there was air 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.510
 excised and the term ends 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.690
 amount of warm air intensity 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.310
 the rise of the lower part of the cloud is reduced in 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.040
 resulting cloud bottom 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.380
 begin to erode at this time under 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.620
 clouds start active descending 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.620
 streams 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.840
 the process of thermal activity he 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.450
 fixated as we 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.120
 warmed up by some of the machine air 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.360
 air rises up is formed 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.010
 clouds but here is the warm air 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.170
 running out of clouds not yet train 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.660
 energizing after which disintegrate 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.110
 cold air falls to the ground and 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.750
 warming up again and the process repeats 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.670
 until warming up is over 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.780
 or grounds before sunset 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:40.240
 process of formation of terms mountain of stones 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.260
 cyclicalities well connected time of day and 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.260
 so for example 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.870
 enters the maid warm up and 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.289
 the leader of the measures across the valley while we see 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.589
 what are you measuring wind 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.589
 anime 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.430
 thermal activity respectively to 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.500
 midday is reached apogee by evening 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.500
 thermal fading begins 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.600
 activity is sunset 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.550
 thermal activity ceases at 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.330
 this moment rocks fast enough 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.040
 cool and reverse process occurs 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.720
 chilled rocks cool the air 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.410
 which adjoins them 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.430
 and the air begins to drain less buildings and 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.289
 at night the wind blows 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.710
 down the valley 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:34.710
 this process is called the mountain breeze 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.740
 accordingly, we have the morning and afternoon wind 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.690
 blowing up the valley 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.190
 the liver is reversed at night 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.190
 blows down to the thread 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:47.239
 it is also important to note that yes and not the wind 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.279
 in no way connected to change it 

00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:50.749
 by the wind on the next video we are good 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.729
 see that the valley wind blows 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:55.069
 perpendicular to the background direction 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:57.019
 the wind at the cut way is very clearly visible 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:59.839
 that a strong wind is blowing down the valley 

00:05:57.019 --> 00:06:01.579
 account that the valley below is already on top 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:04.179
 still inhibition due to 

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:06.799
 imbalance wind direction 

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:08.149
 It is very important to take into account that on the cut 

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:10.039
 flow is always present 

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:12.589
 turbulence it is just like if 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.989
 would we take a pencil between it 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:16.579
 arms and began to bail moving in different 

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:19.659
 direction pencil with us 

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:22.099
 rotates on video we see well that 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:26.860
 flows in different directions 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:26.860
 give just such turbulence 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.000
 by the way if we go back to the picture 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.550
 who considered earlier where we 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.200
 phases are displayed 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.270
 education technicians then we'll see will be on 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.340
 where the middle phase is already good 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.860
 formed upstream and 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.170
 descending flow at the cut of the floods too 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.180
 turbulence is formed this is very 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.310
 it is important to consider the pilot who only 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.800
 that finished processing ascending 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.620
 stream and are going to exit with it on the cut 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.170
 flow has always been turbulence and what 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.630
 the stronger the upstream was the stronger 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:03.450
 there will be turbulence at the flow boundary and 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.510
 the further the downward will be 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.510
 flow 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.669
 Well, that's probably all I'm on today 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.340
 I wanted to tell you 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:15.419
 I hope it was interesting and informative 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.419
 all the best
