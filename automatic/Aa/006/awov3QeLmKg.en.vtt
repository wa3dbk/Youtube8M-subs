00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 why 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.740
 now we are going to make some eggs 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.660
 oven with spinach and paprika if this is 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.660
 a really come from the breakfast of 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.329
 Ten of your food are very good 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.340
 salad appetizer served with me 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.470
 they remain for what they are made to write down 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.320
 the ingredients of this recipe we are going to 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.840
 use a cake and a third of 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.110
 coarsely chopped spinach four 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.950
 eggs two tablespoons of cream salt and 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.960
 pepper to taste 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.820
 and paprika to sprinkle we're also going 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.640
 to need our oven to be 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.990
 set to 180 degrees Celsius the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.670
 same recipe I love because the 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:44.630
 spinach i am your plan has everything 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.850
 iron potassium magnesium calcium all 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.500
 vitamins less obviously because 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.870
 with this comes from the sun but if not yes 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.320
 has vitamin at all times you have 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.030
 you have 'scholarship' of everything we are also going to 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.120
 put some cream to 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.800
 accompany and the cream is going to be like a 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.989
 protein supplement to the protein that the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.699
 we are going to use the egg that separates 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.740
 egg is an excellent source of 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.050
 protein that has everything 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.510
 we need now a lot of people tell me 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.000
 gemma who feels that I get fat I think 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.530
 that the products when they come like this 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.560
 packaged origin have a reason there 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.830
 certain vitamins that need to travel 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.840
 in the fat then the cholesterol that 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.520
 is in the egg yolk is going to be 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.120
 necessary to transport this type of 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.830
 vitamins let's say the classroom here if 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.300
 we do not have it then we go to the best 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.520
 be deficient in these vitamins 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.530
 liposoluble then I recommend them 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.600
 that they are going to eat then I started what 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.760
 full to the best here are two games 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.010
 it may be that they eat only one 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.530
 bud euro clear but always consume 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.600
 the clear now if your problem is of 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.700
 High cholesterol cholesterol is elevated 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.370
 so get your doctor and do not eat 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.560
 the egg yolks but well let's 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.120
 use our our spinach true 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.120
 coppel did I like spinach 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.429
 let's put some spinach 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.439
 plate 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.030
 the spine will remember that it becomes very 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:14.719
 little girl then how are we going 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.269
 bake then try to put enough 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:21.110
 spinach in the on the plate we are going to 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.319
 pepper the spinach 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:29.610
 Do not say they do not tell you 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.100
 to this we are going to incorporate two eggs 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.550
 let's put one 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.820
 and let's put the other 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.500
 in a nice little dish now the 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.840
 Eggs I'm going to explain one thing is 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.170
 convenient very there are many people who 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.660
 keep out of the refrigerator 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.270
 you have to download them even though they come 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.700
 in the shell and one can think that 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.560
 they are going to be conserved because not always and not 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.959
 There are those who work for us who keep it part 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.459
 on top of the refrigerator that then the 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.099
 refrigerator because it is very hot 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.650
 then this heat may be cooking 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.410
 the eggs and also that is soccer 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.550
 creating microorganisms inside the egg 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.770
 and make the egg spoil 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.500
 faster when we have the 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.790
 eggs with frost in the refrigerator 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.130
 we achieve a much more consistency 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.459
 solid in the egg and also a cooking 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.410
 much more effective do we coagulate 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.720
 well the yolk well the clear and everything is 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.750
 prisoner if we are all going to pave 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.860
 our egg we are also going to 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.860
 add a little cream 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.970
 to flavor 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.650
 one teaspoon is enough 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.300
 and we are going to throw paprika 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.580
 so you know a little bit 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.210
 porfa paprika chili all if they want 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.040
 chilitos end bring the hardest 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.660
 find the paprika then if not 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.180
 find factory can be with 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.000
 chilitos and china without ground and chile 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.990
 hear is anticarcinogenic then it's very 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.170
 good to eat chili but sometimes the cure 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.750
 gastritis but when we have those 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.450
 types of problems the best thing is to make a 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.830
 soft diet for at least two days and 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.660
 after starting to ingest 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.910
 soft foods a diet already with 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.130
 chick crumbled vegetables and all the 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.230
 show so that later we can receive 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.990
 much more food 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.240
 Heavy spinach can help a lot 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.610
 remove those pains is blessed a 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.810
 Uric acid product that stays in 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.270
 our body in our blood 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.360
 and to eliminate uric acid for what 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.440
 it's better to eat green vegetables 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.030
 obviously of the best we will be 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.139
 the spinach and the broccoli that are my 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.030
 favorite and apart gives us the strength 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.580
 organic is what popeye says that you 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.520
 the muscles come out and I know it's a 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.200
 physical reality but what happens the 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.300
 reality that happens is in our 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.120
 organism in our cells at the level 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.220
 for molecular psyche because we have the 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.590
 sure to have absolutely all 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.389
 the vitamins all the minerals all 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.930
 the amino acids that are the ones that cut 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.700
 proteins and if we for example 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.250
 we are vegetarians we could trust 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.190
 fully in that in the consumption of 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.620
 spinach we can deposit our 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.020
 tranquility and good and the only thing 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.330
 lack is to put our saucer in the oven 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.100
 let it cook until the egg is made 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.169
 I recommend that you leave the yolk 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.120
 bit raw if they like it better known 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.160
 so leave a little more and then let's go 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.479
 to the oven and join me while watching 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.479
 this information
