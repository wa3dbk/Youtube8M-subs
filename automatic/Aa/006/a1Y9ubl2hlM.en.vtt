00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
have our resource we have our bible we

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.590 
have our resource we have our bible we
have<00:01:43.500> our<00:01:43.679> leadership<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.490> kind<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.759> take<00:01:45.539> us

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
have our leadership to kind of take us

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.529 
have our leadership to kind of take us
through<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.549> when<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.670> comes<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.149> you

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
through that but when it comes to you

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.230 
through that but when it comes to you
know<00:01:48.570> more<00:01:49.490> elemental<00:01:50.490> things<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
know more elemental things like the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.789 
know more elemental things like the
difference<00:01:51.539> between<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.840> pulpit<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.350> electr

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
difference between a pulpit and electr

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.109 
difference between a pulpit and electr
nor<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.219> like<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.490> stuff<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.880> may<00:01:54.060> be

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
nor so like that stuff that we may be

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.270 
nor so like that stuff that we may be
afraid<00:01:54.539> to<00:01:54.570> ask<00:01:54.840> now<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.859> don't<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
afraid to ask now you don't have to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.219 
afraid to ask now you don't have to
because<00:01:56.729> we're<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.479> giving<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.049> and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
because we're just giving it to you and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.230 
because we're just giving it to you and
so<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> think<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.399> works<00:01:59.640> people<00:01:59.880> come<00:02:00.090> into

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
so I think that works people come into

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.370 
so I think that works people come into
the<00:02:00.359> church<00:02:00.390> who<00:02:00.689> are<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> little<00:02:00.869> frayed<00:02:01.320> a

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
the church who are a little frayed a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.929 
the church who are a little frayed a
