him to come back and compete then you
know<00:01:53.180> they<00:01:54.180> should<00:01:54.360> let<00:01:54.509> him<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.840> didn't<00:01:55.829> feel

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
know they should let him I didn't feel

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.200 
know they should let him I didn't feel
it<00:01:56.009> was<00:01:56.130> right<00:01:56.250> when<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> tennis<00:01:56.969> players

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
it was right when the tennis players

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.240 
it was right when the tennis players
came<00:01:57.450> back<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.810> 88<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.409> didn't<00:01:58.890> feel<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.219> was

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
came back in 88 I didn't feel it was

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.620 
came back in 88 I didn't feel it was
right<00:01:59.430> when<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> basketball<00:02:00.119> players<00:02:00.360> came

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
right when the basketball players came

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.399 
right when the basketball players came
back<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:00.960> 92<00:02:01.790> so<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.329> guess<00:02:03.899> that's<00:02:04.020> kind<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
back in 92 so I guess that's kind of the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.230 
back in 92 so I guess that's kind of the
way<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.860> feel<00:02:05.130> about<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.640> figure<00:02:05.909> skaters

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
way I feel about the figure skaters

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.830 
way I feel about the figure skaters

Eldredge and Mark Mitchell have

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.050 
Eldredge and Mark Mitchell have
about<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.129> decision<00:02:12.519> how<00:02:12.579> do<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.760> feel<00:02:12.939> about

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
it they have opportunities to compete

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.130 
it they have opportunities to compete

think it's fair now I think if they're

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.550 
think it's fair now I think if they're
letting<00:02:25.000> everybody<00:02:25.180> back<00:02:25.569> in<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:26.049> be<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.290> one
