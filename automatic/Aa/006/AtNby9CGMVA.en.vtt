00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.570 
as with any camera if you got crappy
light<00:02:14.050> you're<00:02:14.350> going<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.590> have<00:02:14.710> some<00:02:15.010> digital

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
light you're going to have some digital

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.500 
light you're going to have some digital
noise<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:15.970> your<00:02:16.000> in<00:02:16.330> your<00:02:16.360> photos<00:02:17.140> or<00:02:17.350> movies

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
much of a review but it's my thoughts on

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.479 
much of a review but it's my thoughts on
the<00:03:34.209> camera<00:03:34.570> I'm<00:03:35.170> like<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.440> said<00:03:35.709> works<00:03:36.130> really

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
the camera I'm like I said works really

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.440 
the camera I'm like I said works really
well<00:03:37.230> as<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:39.130> could<00:03:39.310> see<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.900> power<00:03:41.170> it<00:03:41.260> on<00:03:41.410> I

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
well as you could see you power it on I

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.890 
well as you could see you power it on I
think<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.480> took<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.720> battery<00:03:44.019> out<00:03:45.209> we<00:03:46.209> take<00:03:46.420> put

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.520 
think I took the battery out we take put
the<00:03:46.989> battery<00:03:47.410> in<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.850> bottom<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.720> snaps<00:03:50.290> in

the battery in the bottom it snaps in

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.990 
the battery in the bottom it snaps in
place<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:52.060> turn<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.390> camera<00:03:52.540> on<00:03:53.730> maybe<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:54.820> got
