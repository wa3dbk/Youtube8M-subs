00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.520
 the ancestor of the modern trumpet was a straight horn that could emit only 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.360
 a few notes in the 15th century learned to bend the horn 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.250
 increasing the length of the instrument and the series of notes that 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.099
 produced 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.490
 the invention of the valve in the mid-19th century finally allowed the 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.489
 trumpet give any note 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.419
 the trumpet is formed by a tube of one and a half meters long 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.900
 three valves allow air to flow through additional tubes that 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.590
 alter the tone of the trumpet 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.920
 the trumpets are made of metal plates often the cake 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.430
 This factory combines different thicknesses in a single instrument to 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.780
 get a particular sound 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.690
 the employees first extend a sheet of tempered brass and mark 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.470
 then cut by the marks with an electric cutter this piece is 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.470
 will become the trumpet pavilion 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.720
 a manually operated press makes a perfect double in the middle 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.800
 then the edges are notched 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.950
 one 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.960
 the pavilion is closed by hammering the notches on the opposite edge 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.920
 they use an unripe leather club because something harder would damage the brass 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.620
 Cast in a brass alloy on the board 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.140
 solidifies into a metal joint that will keep the edges together 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.470
 permanently 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.690
 they slide the pavilion into a comic mandrel and brass hammer until 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.479
 It also has conical shape 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.560
 p 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.830
 p 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.700
 and then the pavilion goes another mandril mounted in a tournament 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.550
 is pressed in brass against the mandrel to finish the form 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.909
 then soften the metal edges 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.909
 now the edge of the pavilion is made the ring 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.959
 a brass roller with a notch on the end catches the rim of the bell and 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.709
 what comes up making the hatillo 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.810
 what is called concave roller is used to round the edge 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.810
 irregular 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:32.710
 then place a brass alloy wire in the brick cavity 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.110
 that makes the bell harder and adds weight to the opening to project 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.110
 better the sound 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.929
 the arithium is rolled up further to house the wire 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.719
 now they heat the report and apply acid flux to clean the 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.479
 surface before releasing it 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:01.059
 The silver lead solder ensures that the wire does not rattle to while 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:02.899
 tiger the bell 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:06.929
 After removing the excess flux the bell is placed again 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:09.929
 on the lathe and the excess welding is removed 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.019
 with an abrasive sponge all waste and rejects are removed 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.199
 produced by the scraper after all the residues of the 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.949
 welding that remain in the report 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:27.179
 the whole bell is filled with a mixture of water and soap 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:30.179
 and it cools to 49 degrees below zero 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.519
 one 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.300
 when the water has frozen they put the bell in a folding mold 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:44.849
 the ice provides back pressure and prevents the brass from sinking towards 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:45.909
 inside 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.489
 the ice does not break with the pressure because the soap that contains the water 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.489
 so be malleable 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.609
 after checking the angle with a gauge 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.609
 they let the hood thaw 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.599
 in the assembly department add the small components made of 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.589
 brass and nickel 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:18.319
 the covers of the pistons the pumps with which they connect 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:22.779
 the trumpet tuning pump the mouthpiece fitting tube 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:26.559
 and then salary in the pavilion 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.210
 the pump has to fit loose to move easily 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.919
 but just to avoid air leaks 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:49.619
 the pump has a finger clamp ring to hold the trumpet 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.480
 after polishing and brass face 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.520
 check sound quality 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.930
 this is a company 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.550
 who likes to be heard
