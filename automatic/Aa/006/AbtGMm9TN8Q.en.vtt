two<00:02:04.500> chains

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
two chains

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.500 
two chains
okay<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:05.910> we've<00:02:06.120> got<00:02:06.150> one<00:02:06.690> two<00:02:08.180> there<00:02:09.180> and

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
okay so we've got one two there and

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.020 
okay so we've got one two there and
we're<00:02:10.380> going<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.770> do<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.430> whole<00:02:11.730> sequence

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
we're going to do that whole sequence

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.350 
we're going to do that whole sequence
again<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.780> we'll<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.080> two<00:02:13.850> double<00:02:14.850> crochets

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
again so we'll do two double crochets

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.150 
again so we'll do two double crochets
and<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:17.900> going<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.960> be<00:02:19.050> our<00:02:19.230> repeat<00:02:19.680> here

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
and this is going to be our repeat here

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.600 
and this is going to be our repeat here
by<00:02:20.550> skipping<00:02:21.150> two<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.720> then<00:02:21.840> working<00:02:22.080> this

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
by skipping two and then working this

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.830 
by skipping two and then working this
this<00:02:23.610> pattern<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:29.400> we've<00:02:29.520> got<00:02:29.700> two<00:02:30.090> double

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
this pattern so we've got two double

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:40.460 
this pattern so we've got two double
crochets<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.800> then<00:02:31.860> we'll<00:02:32.400> chain<00:02:32.700> three<00:02:39.470> okay

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
crochets and then we'll chain three okay

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.690 
crochets and then we'll chain three okay
and<00:02:40.590> then<00:02:40.680> we're<00:02:40.770> just<00:02:40.800> going<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.040> slip<00:02:41.430> into

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
and then we're just going to slip into

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.640 
and then we're just going to slip into
that<00:02:43.130> stitch<00:02:44.130> at<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.459> bottom<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.510> do<00:02:46.320> a<00:02:46.350> slip

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
that stitch at the bottom and do a slip

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.240 
that stitch at the bottom and do a slip
stitch<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:47.520> join<00:02:48.140> with<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.290> loop<00:02:49.500> on<00:02:49.739> our<00:02:49.800> hook

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
stitch to join with the loop on our hook

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.430 
stitch to join with the loop on our hook
so<00:02:50.430> we're<00:02:50.580> just<00:02:50.610> going<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.880> skip<00:02:51.270> two<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.870> do

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
so we're just going to skip two and do

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.010 
so we're just going to skip two and do
that<00:02:52.620> sequence<00:02:53.040> all<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.790> way<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.360> end<00:02:54.600> of

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
that sequence all the way to the end of

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.020 
that sequence all the way to the end of
the<00:02:55.410> row<00:02:57.770> so<00:02:58.770> after<00:02:59.070> we<00:02:59.160> turn<00:02:59.400> our<00:02:59.610> work<00:02:59.850> we're

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
the row so after we turn our work we're

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.630 
the row so after we turn our work we're
going<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.270> start<00:03:00.510> row<00:03:01.320> one<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:01.920> we'll<00:03:02.040> begin<00:03:02.280> by

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
going to start row one so we'll begin by

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.640 
going to start row one so we'll begin by
chaining<00:03:03.090> three<00:03:08.540> then<00:03:09.540> we're<00:03:09.720> going<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.050> work

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
chaining three then we're going to work

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.460 
chaining three then we're going to work
our<00:03:11.570> sequence<00:03:12.570> with<00:03:12.750> our<00:03:12.959> two<00:03:13.170> double

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
our sequence with our two double

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.810 
our sequence with our two double
crochets<00:03:13.860> into<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:15.720> three<00:03:16.500> chain<00:03:16.950> space<00:03:17.459> so

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
crochets into the three chain space so

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:31.420 
crochets into the three chain space so
we<00:03:17.940> are<00:03:18.060> going<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.600> do<00:03:19.320> two<00:03:19.709> double<00:03:20.070> crochets

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
and then we're going to chain three and

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.050 
and then we're going to chain three and
then<00:03:38.390> we'll<00:03:38.540> do<00:03:38.659> a<00:03:38.689> slip<00:03:39.019> stitch<00:03:39.170> into<00:03:40.060> the

chain three space okay we're going to

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.479 
chain three space okay we're going to
repeat<00:03:47.390> this<00:03:47.599> sequence<00:03:48.349> all<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.859> way<00:03:49.010> across

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
here okay so that's a little bit

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:04.390 
here okay so that's a little bit
different<00:05:03.590> than<00:05:03.680> what<00:05:03.770> we<00:05:03.860> did<00:05:03.979> in<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:04.220> first

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.339 
different than what we did in the first
row<00:05:04.699> since<00:05:04.909> we're<00:05:05.090> working<00:05:05.120> into<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:06.050> chain

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
row since we're working into the chain

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.040 
row since we're working into the chain
instead<00:05:06.740> of<00:05:06.949> into<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.280> chain<00:05:07.699> space<00:05:07.960> so<00:05:08.960> you

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
instead of into the chain space so you

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.140 
instead of into the chain space so you
can<00:05:09.199> see<00:05:09.440> alright<00:05:10.400> so<00:05:10.520> we're<00:05:10.639> going<00:05:10.729> to<00:05:10.789> repeat
