charging port it's also an LED and a

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.560 
charging port it's also an LED and a
battery<00:02:52.750> light<00:02:53.140> indicator<00:02:53.860> button<00:02:54.420> it's<00:02:55.420> been

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
battery light indicator button it's been

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.050 
battery light indicator button it's been
supplied<00:02:55.930> completely<00:02:56.500> flat<00:02:56.709> though<00:02:56.980> so<00:02:57.459> we're

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
supplied completely flat though so we're

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.390 
supplied completely flat though so we're
not<00:02:58.150> gonna<00:02:58.300> see<00:02:58.570> any<00:02:58.750> anything<00:02:59.590> on<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.100> light

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
not gonna see any anything on the light

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.729 
not gonna see any anything on the light
until<00:03:01.209> I've<00:03:01.360> got<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:01.630> charged<00:03:01.989> up<00:03:04.739> seems

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
until I've got it charged up seems

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.460 
until I've got it charged up seems
nicely<00:03:06.130> made<00:03:06.310> actually<00:03:06.959> substantial<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.200> I

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
nicely made actually substantial and I

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.199 
nicely made actually substantial and I
think<00:03:08.770> it's<00:03:08.890> just<00:03:09.070> over<00:03:09.340> half<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.670> kilogram<00:03:09.910> in

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
think it's just over half a kilogram in

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.110 
think it's just over half a kilogram in
weight<00:03:10.420> so<00:03:10.890> whilst<00:03:11.890> its<00:03:12.100> compact<00:03:12.550> certainly

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
weight so whilst its compact certainly

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.300 
weight so whilst its compact certainly
no<00:03:13.239> light<00:03:16.230> yeah<00:03:17.260> reasonably<00:03:17.800> well<00:03:17.980> balanced

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
no light yeah reasonably well balanced

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.970 
no light yeah reasonably well balanced
oK<00:03:21.300> we've<00:03:21.780> got<00:03:21.930> here<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.319> some<00:03:22.620> safety

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
oK we've got here is some safety

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.580 
oK we've got here is some safety
instructions<00:03:26.569> probably<00:03:27.569> not<00:03:27.810> anything<00:03:28.260> we

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
instructions probably not anything we

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.090 
instructions probably not anything we
need<00:03:28.770> to<00:03:28.950> worry<00:03:29.370> about<00:03:29.459> in<00:03:29.819> particular<00:03:30.209> here

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
need to worry about in particular here

interesting<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.520> speaker<00:03:33.150> itself<00:03:33.540> does

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
interesting that the speaker itself does

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.840 
interesting that the speaker itself does
not<00:03:33.870> come<00:03:34.319> with<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.590> charge<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.220> any<00:03:35.340> kind<00:03:35.670> but

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
not come with a charge of any kind but

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.309 
not come with a charge of any kind but
obviously<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.180> can<00:03:36.300> just<00:03:36.330> use<00:03:36.690> your<00:03:36.720> mobile

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
obviously you can just use your mobile
