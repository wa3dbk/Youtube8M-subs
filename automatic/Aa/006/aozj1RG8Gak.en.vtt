00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.370 

which<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.719> nice<00:01:59.450> can't<00:02:00.450> move<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.750> legs<00:02:00.960> but

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
which is nice can't move the legs but

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.030 
which is nice can't move the legs but
you<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:02.060> none<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.270> pony<00:02:03.829> toys<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.009> can

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
do that I move it around on the wheels

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.270

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.290 
there I guess I can't just move it very
well<00:02:15.610> on<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.880> table<00:02:16.210> but<00:02:16.930> yeah<00:02:17.320> you<00:02:17.980> use<00:02:18.880> move

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
well on the table but yeah you use move

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.230 
well on the table but yeah you use move

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
it along the table on the wheels and the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:33.540 
it along the table on the wheels and the
wings<00:02:22.540> flutter<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:24.150> that's<00:02:25.150> pretty<00:02:25.450> nice<00:02:32.550> okay

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550
