it's the exact same as the rest it's win
the<00:00:26.820> division<00:00:27.050> win<00:00:28.050> title<00:00:28.439> there's<00:00:28.980> also<00:00:29.160> cops

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the division win title there's also cops

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.580

that<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.210> can<00:00:30.390> see<00:00:30.660> there<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.050> think<00:00:31.439> that's

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
that you can see there I think that's

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.709 
that you can see there I think that's
much<00:00:31.949> better<00:00:32.099> because<00:00:32.520> last<00:00:32.820> year<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.570> whole

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
much better because last year the whole

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.780 
much better because last year the whole
league<00:00:33.930> system<00:00:34.290> no<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.160> really<00:00:35.430> knew<00:00:35.610> what

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
league system no one really knew what

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.430 
league system no one really knew what
was<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.840> don't<00:00:37.020> know<00:00:37.110> what<00:00:37.260> league

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
was going on you don't know what league

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.350 
was going on you don't know what league
you're<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.829> or<00:00:38.100> where<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.969> are<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.329> relation

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
you're in or where you are in relation

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.479 
you're in or where you are in relation
to<00:00:39.719> everyone<00:00:39.960> else<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.860> wasn't<00:00:41.219> very<00:00:41.340> well

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
to everyone else it wasn't very well

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.150 
to everyone else it wasn't very well
done<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.239> think<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:43.170> makes<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> lot

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
done and I think this makes it a lot

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.680 
done and I think this makes it a lot
more<00:00:44.219> interesting<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.149> exciting<00:00:45.270> because
