00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
 hello everyone we will not unpack 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.970
 iphone 5s 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.429
 for starters, I would like to compare the box 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.170
 from under iphone 5 they look like this 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.150
 In comparison, before the phone we had 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.580
 mesmerized by the sides and now we have it 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.650
 depicted frontal part and box 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.029
 even on the black version of the smartphone has become 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.210
 white color here is such a box 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.760
 it says iphone 5s apple iphone 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.890
 5s apple behind us is written on 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.219
 How many gigabytes is this smartphone on 64 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.469
 gigabytes in this case and what comes in 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.059
 kit in principle is all let's get it 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.070
 let's open 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.100
 when we open a box of us in front 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.210
 us as usual iphone itself is iphone i 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.800
 color space gray 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.700
 I really like the color combination 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.910
 that is, it is not exactly black aluminum 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.890
 completely black such graphite 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.489
 harbor and it looks very very 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.629
 stylishly so on we have headphones 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.199
 earpods that have not changed the adapter and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.229
 lightning cable nothing more in the box 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.060
 no , we also have such an envelope 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.830
 apple where we have been here before 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.049
 in my opinion there was a paper clip 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.159
 now she is not already on the way 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.880
 ok here is such a brochure iphone 5s 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.280
 and nakleechki it is strange that no boil 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.250
 paper clips to get a sim card 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:36.350
 from the phone is very strange in front of us 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:41.520
 iphone 5s remove the film with ease 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.950
 so they call me important 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.590
 Well, this is how iphone 5s looks 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.329
 almost seemingly impossible 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.759
 that this is the 5th to take take 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.000
 I deliberately took my old broken 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.069
 black what did you understand the difference in color 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.130
 this is the usual iphone 5 repair 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:02.310
 and this is the iphone 5s and you see the differences in 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.319
 the color is actually in general that is well 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.099
 on the phone looks exactly graphite 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:11.760
 better color than you are so black 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:14.370
 concerns scratches already the case is done 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.680
 very good and practically paint not 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.019
 slazit do not like to be and slazit 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.400
 Generally scratches on such a case will be 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.380
 less noticeable than on more black well 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.349
 what is special what is here 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.970
 64-bit apple a7 processor installed 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:35.819
 also fingerprint scanner takachidi 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.730
 so let's turn the phone on 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.549
 here is pre - installed as-7 which 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.819
 can upgrade at home from 7.0.1 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.170
 that fix bugs article 1 on 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.970
 in fact the most important innovation 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.239
 this is exactly tachadi 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.980
 not that not a processor there is not a camera 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.799
 despite the fact that it is also 8 megapixels 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.819
 the way back we have a dual LED 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.120
 flash 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.880
 she usually friend amber well and in 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.940
 the principle is actually very strange 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.120
 that did not make the version of 128 megabytes 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.900
 because 64 is not enough and I wanted 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.549
 would be more like a nuby 16x you bonjour 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.389
 now sync and do more 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.889
 a detailed review in front of us iphone 5s and 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.130
 in order to unlock it you need 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.959
 just press the home button 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.400
 such innovation as a fingerprint scanner 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.730
 fingers are actually very comfortable 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.709
 thing because I used to like 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.650
 would protect your phone from strangers 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:39.269
 individuals but each time entering a password is 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.250
 a bit uncomfortable and such a thing as a scanner 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.069
 fingerprint solves this problem 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.650
 she works very well and most 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.859
 the main thing is that you do not need to spend time on 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.120
 password entry which consisted of numbers and 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.890
 the more so which some people 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.629
 composed of letters and numbers such as complex pairs 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.330
 we just click all 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:04.099
 your phone is unlocked very cool 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:07.069
 very comfortable here and so he looks 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.610
 tachadi it's just like a home button with 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.099
 sapphire crystal 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.440
 there is a scanner under it and this one 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.870
 metal bezel painted color 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.310
 glass 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.600
 below we have a microphone speaker 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.160
 lightning connector and connector for 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.380
 three and a half headphone connections 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.360
 millimeter on top is a button 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.370
 unlock lock 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.580
 we have 8 bits behind us 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.260
 megapixel and isight camera with new 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.860
 Optics from new to aperture double 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.570
 1 amber flash one simple microphone 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.229
 apple iphone inscription now 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.840
 made of a smaller font then 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.360
 there is more thin 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.979
 so well, as usual, the decrease button 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.889
 volume up lock 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.650
 unlocking the sound well and basically everything 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.450
 this is how color space gray looks like 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.860
 very very cool more detailed 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.440
 I'll post a review later 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.139
 Well, so you understand here so it looks like 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.289
 compared to iphone 5 also here 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.729
 installed a new dual-core 64 bit 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.740
 apple a7 processor 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:18.270
 fm7 chip which is responsible for 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.830
 apple fingerprint scanner oh 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.280
 Tachadi apologize for the reservation 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.950
 1 gigabyte ram screen 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.490
 retina 4 inches it has not changed 1136 on 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.500
 640 pixels in general, the screen does not 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.450
 I have not changed in color reproduction in anything 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.400
 front camera also has not changed from 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.090
 12 megapixels site and, in principle, everything 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.580
 more detailed review 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.169
