questions let's just play this game all
right<00:00:53.300> all<00:00:54.300> right<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.500> night<00:00:56.309> levels

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
right all right so in the night levels

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.680 
right all right so in the night levels
you<00:00:58.079> run<00:00:58.289> into<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:59.100> huge<00:00:59.579> problem<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.329> that

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
you run into one huge problem and that

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.750 
you run into one huge problem and that
is<00:01:01.039> Sun<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.750> generated<00:01:04.549> obviously<00:01:05.549> since

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
is Sun is not generated obviously since

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.240 
is Sun is not generated obviously since
it's<00:01:05.939> nighttime

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
it's nighttime

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.469 
it's nighttime
so<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.930> start<00:01:10.170> out<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:11.210> 50/50<00:01:12.210> Sun

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
so you you start out with 50/50 Sun

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.270 
so you you start out with 50/50 Sun
which<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.890> use<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.340> buy<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
which then you can use to buy a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.249 
which then you can use to buy a
sunflower<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.720> that<00:01:18.720> will<00:01:18.900> generate<00:01:19.200> more

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
sunflower and that will generate more

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.660 
sunflower and that will generate more
Sun<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:20.970> buy<00:01:21.060> more<00:01:21.270> sunflowers<00:01:21.840> and
