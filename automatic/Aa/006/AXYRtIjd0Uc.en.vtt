guess<00:00:57.690> at<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.020> point<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.890> should<00:00:59.070> look<00:00:59.190> at

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
guess at this point we should look at

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.430 
guess at this point we should look at
the<00:00:59.489> piano<00:00:59.879> keyboard<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.750> see<00:01:00.960> where<00:01:01.230> these

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the piano keyboard and see where these

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.149 
the piano keyboard and see where these
fingers<00:01:01.829> go<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.930> keyboard<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.619> set<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:04.979> in

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
fingers go the keyboard is set up in

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.100 
fingers go the keyboard is set up in
sets<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.939> two<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.680> three<00:01:07.820> Black<00:01:08.820> Keys

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
sets of two and three Black Keys

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.820 
sets of two and three Black Keys
alternating<00:01:11.720> we'll<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.869> playing<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.290> three<00:01:13.619> of

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
alternating we'll be playing a three of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.330 
alternating we'll be playing a three of
these<00:01:14.030> white<00:01:15.030> keys<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.500> each<00:01:16.500> white<00:01:16.770> key<00:01:17.040> can

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
these white keys and each white key can

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.570 
these white keys and each white key can
be<00:01:17.369> found<00:01:18.500> according<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> its<00:01:19.799> position<00:01:20.130> in

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
be found according to its position in

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.670 
be found according to its position in
the<00:01:21.150> sets<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.780> twos<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.049> three<00:01:22.409> Black<00:01:22.650> Keys

the sets of twos and three Black Keys

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.770 
the sets of twos and three Black Keys
for<00:01:23.220> instance<00:01:24.049> if<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.619> find<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.130> set<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.460> two

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
for instance if you find a set of two

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.020 
for instance if you find a set of two
black<00:01:27.780> keys<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:28.920> melee<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> left

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
black keys and go melee to the left

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.210 
black keys and go melee to the left
you'll<00:01:30.900> find<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.409> C<00:01:33.290> here's<00:01:34.290> another<00:01:34.619> C<00:01:34.920> here's

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
you'll find a C here's another C here's

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.200 
you'll find a C here's another C here's
a<00:01:35.310> set<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.610> two<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:37.409> there's<00:01:38.040> another<00:01:38.430> C<00:01:38.790> there

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
a set of two and there's another C there

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.910 
a set of two and there's another C there
are<00:01:39.240> lots<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.659> C's<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> piano<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:42.920> white

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
are lots of C's on the piano the white

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
are lots of C's on the piano the white
keys<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:44.399> go<00:01:44.549> off<00:01:44.729> abetik<00:01:45.180> ly<00:01:45.329> from<00:01:45.509> left<00:01:45.720> to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
keys then go off abetik ly from left to

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.200 
keys then go off abetik ly from left to
right<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.890> C<00:01:47.220> then<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.880> must<00:01:48.090> be

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
right so if that's a C then that must be

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.310 
right so if that's a C then that must be
a<00:01:48.329> D<00:01:48.799> always<00:01:49.799> between<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.670> set<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.540> two<00:01:51.840> Black

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
a D always between the set of two Black

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.230 
a D always between the set of two Black
Keys<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:53.119> E<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> right

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
Keys and E is here to the right

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.930 
Keys and E is here to the right
set<00:01:57.900> of<00:01:58.020> two<00:01:58.230> here<00:01:59.160> is<00:01:59.340> another<00:01:59.820> e<00:02:00.150> and<00:02:01.760> you<00:02:02.760> can

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
set of two here is another e and you can

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.460 
set of two here is another e and you can
find<00:02:03.240> many<00:02:04.080> more<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.590> them<00:02:04.710> yourself<00:02:06.470> this

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
find many more of them yourself this

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.260 
find many more of them yourself this
piece<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:08.100> will<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:08.490> playing<00:02:08.789> will<00:02:09.179> be
