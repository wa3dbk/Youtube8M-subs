00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
the first mistake that people often make

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.630 
the first mistake that people often make
is<00:00:15.540> putting<00:00:16.320> sunscreen<00:00:16.590> on<00:00:16.859> their<00:00:17.130> hands<00:00:17.490> and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
is putting sunscreen on their hands and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.099 
is putting sunscreen on their hands and
then<00:00:17.970> putting<00:00:18.359> their<00:00:18.510> hands<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> bait

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
then putting their hands in the bait

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.290 
then putting their hands in the bait
well<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.980> never<00:00:20.310> want<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.609> put<00:00:20.760> sunscreen<00:00:20.970> on

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
well you never want to put sunscreen on

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.580 
well you never want to put sunscreen on
your<00:00:21.480> hands<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:21.960> stick<00:00:22.170> your<00:00:22.199> hands<00:00:22.439> in

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the bait well because sunscreens oils

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.349 
the bait well because sunscreens oils
lotions<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.230> fragrances<00:00:25.890> are<00:00:26.130> all<00:00:26.490> toxic<00:00:27.150> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
lotions and fragrances are all toxic to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.240 
lotions and fragrances are all toxic to
fish<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.900> they<00:00:28.470> will<00:00:28.650> kill<00:00:28.859> your<00:00:29.070> bait

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
another mistake I see people often

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.190 
another mistake I see people often
making<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.070> their<00:00:32.640> choice<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:33.030> footwear<00:00:33.270> you

wearing dark soul shoes is going to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.889 
wearing dark soul shoes is going to
cause<00:00:40.440> scuff<00:00:40.829> marks<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.670> boat<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.180> that

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and attach it through the ceramic guide

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.850 
and attach it through the ceramic guide
when<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.150> do<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:18.960> could<00:01:19.110> happen<00:01:19.560> is

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
when you do that what could happen is

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
when you do that what could happen is
the<00:01:20.130> hook<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.460> cause<00:01:20.670> chips<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> inside

the hook can cause chips on the inside

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.440 
the hook can cause chips on the inside
ceramic<00:01:22.590> part<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.250> guide<00:01:23.460> which<00:01:24.270> will

ceramic part of the guide which will

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.660 
ceramic part of the guide which will
cause<00:01:24.689> your<00:01:24.960> line<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.560> fray<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.250> could<00:01:26.430> cause

cause your line to fray and could cause

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.899 
cause your line to fray and could cause

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
you to lose a huge fish and the final

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.850 
you to lose a huge fish and the final
mistake<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.540> often<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:31.140> people<00:01:31.170> making

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
mistake that I often see people making

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.740 
mistake that I often see people making
is<00:01:32.009> allowing<00:01:32.549> too<00:01:32.729> much<00:01:32.939> slack<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.240> their<00:01:33.540> line

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
is allowing too much slack in their line

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.960 
is allowing too much slack in their line
when<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.799> allow<00:01:35.040> too<00:01:35.100> much<00:01:35.490> slack<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.790> your

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
when you allow too much slack in your

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 
when you allow too much slack in your
line<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.750> gives<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> fish<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.799> opportunity

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
line it gives the fish the opportunity

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.480 
line it gives the fish the opportunity
to<00:01:38.490> shake<00:01:38.700> its<00:01:38.909> head<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.420> toss<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.229> hook

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
to shake its head and toss the hook

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.770 
to shake its head and toss the hook
causing<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.729> lose<00:01:41.909> what<00:01:42.270> could<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.570> been

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
causing you to lose what could have been

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.920 
causing you to lose what could have been
a<00:01:42.990> trophy<00:01:43.560> catch<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:45.000> now<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.479> know<00:01:45.659> what

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
