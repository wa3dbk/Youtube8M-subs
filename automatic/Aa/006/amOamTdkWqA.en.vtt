00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.470
 hello girls what are you doing today yamín 16 y 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.960
 welcome to this which is the the fourth 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.970
 chapter of her from my stage in chivas 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.860
 I wanted to apologize and I'm late 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.150
 a lot to upload the videos and excuse me 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.950
 what happens is that he has been working 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.230
 a lot and and I edit the videos in my 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.390
 free time so I have not had 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.880
 many a lot of opportunity to finish 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.470
 finish them this quickly but 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.779
 my problem is primarily the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.700
 internet internet that what not 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.050
 I have in my house because I live in a place 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.430
 where there is no access to them 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.399
 Well, I have to do everything in my 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.379
 work but there it is ok to go 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.120
 presenting more free time and more 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.760
 opportunity for'll try to go 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.160
 coming up from the videos but this is what 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.350
 what is happening now 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.110
 well here we are already changing the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.150
 team formation we had we are 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.140
 playing the other matches with the 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.089
 5 5 2 1 2 training 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.300
 but obviously we give to 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:16.550
 change I like the 442 diamond with 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:19.670
 four defenders with 33 flyers 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.920
 midfield and a hook that would be 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.200
 marked fabian and two points that would be 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.390
 nigris and marquez lugo 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.850
 in which there are many lessons 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.100
 interesting that I would have liked 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.800
 try that the one that I liked the most and 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.430
 is the one we 're going with the one we 're going to 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.400
 to work this season and well there 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.570
 fixing the players of those who 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.550
 let's finish by removing then 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.520
 víctor perales and carlos fierro only 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.290
 grows already sacrificed when they go 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.870
 reinforcements arriving and we will go 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.490
 looking for more players but right now 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.490
 I think it looks good like that 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.000
 because it will help a lot in the field to 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.670
 that is strong with the chatón and hopefully 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.680
 that carlos peña is coming would be very very 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.810
 good the half court 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.690
 marco fabián marked us in that already 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.580
 they always leave us in chivas not to let 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.430
 is staying is making goals is 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.799
 answering then let's leave 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.170
 and good you hope I send it well I think it 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:26.200
 is seeing well we are not going to aa 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.050
 to bring this 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.959
 no forward because we already have 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.440
 there we have them there from nigris to 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.910
 Marquez came to Rafael and take out the closing 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.110
 that is going to stay in the bank and 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.860
 waiting for your chance and here we go 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:48.620
 to bid by Carlos Peña 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.620
 it's the same as if we want to have it 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.950
 was in what three million 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.740
 its set price so it will be followed 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.690
 working to give you a juicy offer 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.850
 for what 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.530
 so they can affect it quickly 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.750
 it's good to see which player washes them and 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.910
 I say, I would add gallardo gallardo no 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.000
 I'm interested I do not want it on the computer 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.240
 I like it does not convince me 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.900
 maybe if I had more money I would leave it 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.730
 there but but no command needed what 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.200
 I will add there to the deal and I offered 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.450
 2.8 million yesterday and the offer for 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.550
 enrique pérez that we had done in the 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.370
 previous chapter often not 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.319
 they rejected 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.879
 the good thing is that if they want to glass if 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.909
 they want Nestor glass they just wanted 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:42.010
 more money and we will give you more 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.370
 money so that we can 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.370
 say no 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.830
 we are going to suck him 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.750
 and already brando and already say yes 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.090
 and that of Carlos but also the 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.870
 will reject 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.870
 apparently they do not want to gallardo 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.810
 well it was difficult but I had to add 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.080
 there 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.350
 and the chapito sanchez 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.480
 it's good it has a future and everything but I do not 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.220
 enter my plans not between my plans 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.250
 so I'll add beyond the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.890
 offer 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.829
 and so there's more chance that no 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.750
 accept us these and good and we 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.480
 They accepted the offer for enrique pérez and 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.450
 only missing the salary 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.510
 we say 20 thousand a week to three 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.310
 years of contract and player 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.520
 important 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.350
 waiting for us to accept enrique and the 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:44.180
 veracruz match is going to simulate 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.729
 to go forward with the reinforcements 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.490
 and says that since selecting reynoso I 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.460
 It seems 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.479
 and 30 we win very well perfect we won 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:58.419
 of fabián de nigris and ponce goal 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.110
 with being putting his goal and everything was 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.790
 well and we won 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.910
 and good to continue the streak to follow the 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.470
 game winning streak 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.210
 here he warns us with our prayers 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:14.479
 Reynoso for every few days 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.479
 I do not think we do not want it in the team 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.640
 and he gave us an offer of 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.520
 separate transfer by gallardón that 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.010
 allow us to adapt let's accept for 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.310
 that he goes around here definitely not 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.830
 going to play 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.030
 and already accepted the offer by Carlos Peña 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.660
 that good 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:38.180
 and that very shameless and he has the salary 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.580
 they ask for a thousand and two thousand a week 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.160
 makes that very cheeky so 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.310
 let's go up there to tempt him more with 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.750
 five thousand four years of contract and by 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.200
 course that player 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.910
 crucial holder the least expected 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.550
 that they accept me then then the offer 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:59.260
 It was by Carlos Peña and fire the first 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.260
 that easier to negotiate 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:07.560
 and we are going to make the rocks and 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.300
 how to accept the mind offer to create 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.360
 habits that we occupy 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.800
 and no longer in the lineup add it 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.479
 we need to think 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.479
 to boxes of squares 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.940
 this first reinforcement 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.039
 well I'm not going the party I expected 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:43.319
 it was more we're not even just going to be 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:46.559
 which party is not worth it 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:49.169
 this was 15 meters of torture for me 

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:51.869
 I'm not going to do the same thing would be a 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:56.039
 crime yes yes I put them the party 

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:58.139
 here I go arrivals but no no no what 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:00.169
 good enough to return the 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:05.139
 road repeat 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:08.139
 the 0 0 says it all says all 00 tie 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:08.139
 bad 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.150
 and he's going to continue to see about the 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.370
 reinforcements to see who here makes them 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.830
 reason before the classic that is the 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.300
 next game and already in here already 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.700
 we accept the offer of enrique enrique 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.790
 perez díaz is with us what can we 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.600
 to accept 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:29.630
 good now is this 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.780
 carlos peña and enrique pérez yes and here 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.850
 Israel and we will do the lo 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.360
 of the offer of the opposite the salary 

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.360
 etc 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.139
 and they are leaving, the 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:45.129
 reinforcements and already we are tying 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:49.539
 they demand an offer for good diego 

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:52.239
 although it is one without players and so good 

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:55.899
 yes but I like his style of play 

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:58.899
 has good touch of the ball is young is 

00:07:55.899 --> 00:08:02.199
 medium quick then you can help us 

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:05.330
 a lot and can grow is 22 years old 

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:07.820
 who gave me the games to work 

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:10.190
 if we manage to bring 

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.050
 and good still the classic do not go away 

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.860
 to miss the next chapter thank you for 

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.860
 see and see you next time
