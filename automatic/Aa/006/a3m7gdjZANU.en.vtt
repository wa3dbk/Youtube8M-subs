00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
questions about that the only thing I

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.870 
questions about that the only thing I
really<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.720> talk<00:00:27.930> about<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:29.310> i'm<00:00:29.640> not

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
really can talk about is that i'm not

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.669 
really can talk about is that i'm not
using<00:00:30.029> select-fire<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:31.109> because<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.590> know

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
using select-fire just because you know

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.959 
using select-fire just because you know
i<00:00:31.710> don't<00:00:31.769> really<00:00:31.949> find<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.430> necessary

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
i don't really find that necessary

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.819 
i don't really find that necessary
because<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.469> shoot<00:00:34.710> it

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
because it's like I can shoot it

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.170 
because it's like I can shoot it
decently<00:00:35.550> fast<00:00:36.230> on<00:00:37.230> my<00:00:37.290> own<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.950> ps3<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
decently fast on my own on ps3 that is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.810 
decently fast on my own on ps3 that is
because<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.750> know<00:00:39.899> our<00:00:40.170> one<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.820> shooting

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
because you know our one is shooting

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.580 
because you know our one is shooting
which<00:00:42.300> makes<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.690> lot<00:00:42.870> easier<00:00:42.930> than<00:00:43.320> you

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
which makes it a lot easier than you

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.139 
which makes it a lot easier than you
know<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> trigger<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.579> back<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.120> my

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149

opinion<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.370> I'm<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.610> another<00:00:47.789> reason<00:00:48.149> I

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
opinion so I'm so another reason I

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.760 
opinion so I'm so another reason I
really<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> ps3<00:00:49.170> controller<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:49.680> I'm

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.040 
anyway so you're not gonna get him but
you<00:03:10.500> know<00:03:10.530> i<00:03:10.920> would<00:03:11.310> say<00:03:11.580> maybe<00:03:12.060> i<00:03:12.239> would<00:03:12.870> say

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
you know i would say maybe i would say

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.720 
you know i would say maybe i would say
like<00:03:13.200> maybe<00:03:13.470> around<00:03:13.709> 100k<00:03:14.489> at<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.850> most<00:03:15.150> and

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
like maybe around 100k at the most and

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.150 
like maybe around 100k at the most and
yeah<00:03:17.730> basically<00:03:17.970> maybe<00:03:18.450> like<00:03:18.660> 150<00:03:19.530> km<00:03:19.860> below<00:03:20.130> i

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
think that's probably the best range or

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.100 
think that's probably the best range or
so<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.280> ask<00:03:23.730> because<00:03:24.150> other<00:03:24.570> than<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.930> i'm

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
so to ask because other than that i'm

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.020 
so to ask because other than that i'm
not<00:03:25.140> really<00:03:25.380> sure<00:03:25.500> people<00:03:25.980> want<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.370> waste

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.660 
commentate it i think the schwantz would
be<00:04:05.250> good<00:04:05.400> for<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.959> personally<00:04:06.959> i<00:04:07.670> still

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
be good for that personally i still

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.210 
be good for that personally i still
gotta<00:04:08.820> ask<00:04:09.000> him<00:04:09.209> if<00:04:09.269> he<00:04:09.390> can<00:04:09.420> do<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.750> but<00:04:10.680> who<00:04:11.190> i

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
gotta ask him if he can do it but who i

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.060 
gotta ask him if he can do it but who i
mean<00:04:11.760> i<00:04:12.000> think<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.840> only<00:04:12.870> reason<00:04:13.290> also<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:14.040> i

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
mean i think the only reason also that i

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.620 
mean i think the only reason also that i
think<00:04:14.250> this<00:04:14.489> would<00:04:14.640> be<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.760> cool<00:04:15.090> thing<00:04:15.120> is

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
think this would be a cool thing is

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.440 
think this would be a cool thing is
because<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:16.530> know<00:04:16.650> competitive<00:04:17.430> it's<00:04:17.760> like

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
because you know competitive it's like

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.170 
because you know competitive it's like
it's<00:04:18.780> always<00:04:19.049> hard<00:04:19.500> point<00:04:19.799> CTF<00:04:20.310> at<00:04:20.459> snd<00:04:20.910> and

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
it's always hard point CTF at snd and

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.140 
it's always hard point CTF at snd and
those<00:04:21.989> are<00:04:22.260> game<00:04:22.650> types<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.280> really<00:04:23.789> pub

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
those are game types that really pub

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.879 
those are game types that really pub
stompers<00:04:24.690> or<00:04:24.960> people<00:04:25.740> on<00:04:25.830> youtube

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
stompers or people on youtube

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.830 
stompers or people on youtube
like<00:04:27.009> commentators<00:04:27.729> and<00:04:27.909> stuff<00:04:28.060> those<00:04:28.659> are

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
like commentators and stuff those are

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.959 
like commentators and stuff those are
game<00:04:29.050> modes<00:04:29.289> that<00:04:29.379> we<00:04:29.499> don't<00:04:29.800> typically<00:04:30.669> play

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969 
game modes that we don't typically play

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.219 
game modes that we don't typically play
of<00:04:31.120> course<00:04:31.360> there's<00:04:31.569> some<00:04:31.719> people<00:04:31.870> i'll<00:04:32.080> play

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
of course there's some people i'll play

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.409 
of course there's some people i'll play
them<00:04:32.409> but<00:04:32.590> for<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.860> most<00:04:33.039> part<00:04:33.189> we<00:04:33.939> don't<00:04:34.150> play

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
them but for the most part we don't play

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.469 
them but for the most part we don't play
them<00:04:34.569> and<00:04:35.249> also<00:04:36.249> for<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.610> exception<00:04:36.999> of<00:04:37.300> like

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
them and also for the exception of like

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.239 
them and also for the exception of like
multi<00:04:37.930> team<00:04:38.139> hardpoint<00:04:38.680> that's<00:04:38.949> like<00:04:39.099> the

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:39.249 
multi team hardpoint that's like the

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:40.920 
multi team hardpoint that's like the
only<00:04:39.279> time<00:04:39.580> people<00:04:39.879> really<00:04:40.360> play<00:04:40.479> hard<00:04:40.659> point

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
only time people really play hard point

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.339 
only time people really play hard point
but<00:04:41.680> i<00:04:42.270> think<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:43.509> would<00:04:43.629> be<00:04:43.749> cool<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.050> have

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
but i think it would be cool to have

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.959 
but i think it would be cool to have
like<00:04:44.550> Kill<00:04:45.550> Confirmed<00:04:46.439> domination<00:04:47.439> and

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:47.969 
like Kill Confirmed domination and

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.100 
like Kill Confirmed domination and
something<00:04:48.969> else<00:04:49.120> I<00:04:49.449> don't<00:04:49.990> know<00:04:50.050> about

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
something else I don't know about

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.070 
something else I don't know about
demolition<00:04:50.759> maybe<00:04:51.759> team<00:04:52.180> deathmatch<00:04:52.689> or

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
demolition maybe team deathmatch or

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.989 
demolition maybe team deathmatch or
something<00:04:53.650> like<00:04:53.770> that<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:54.340> think<00:04:54.610> those<00:04:54.849> would

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:54.999 
something like that I think those would

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.570 
something like that I think those would
be<00:04:55.180> good<00:04:55.229> game<00:04:56.229> modes<00:04:56.439> to<00:04:56.620> play<00:04:56.830> if<00:04:57.279> you<00:04:57.460> guys

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
be good game modes to play if you guys

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.950 
be good game modes to play if you guys
think<00:04:57.610> of<00:04:57.879> any<00:04:58.029> other<00:04:58.210> game<00:04:58.419> modes<00:04:58.599> that<00:04:58.779> you

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
think of any other game modes that you

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.929 
think of any other game modes that you
think<00:04:59.139> would<00:04:59.199> be<00:04:59.349> good<00:04:59.379> for<00:04:59.830> it<00:05:00.009> then<00:05:00.550> leave

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:00.939 
think would be good for it then leave

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.749 
think would be good for it then leave
them<00:05:01.060> down<00:05:01.210> below<00:05:01.270> as<00:05:01.750> well<00:05:02.340> but<00:05:03.340> I<00:05:03.490> definitely

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
them down below as well but I definitely

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.089 
them down below as well but I definitely
I<00:05:04.000> think<00:05:04.150> that<00:05:04.719> definitely<00:05:04.990> domination<00:05:05.949> is

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
I think that definitely domination is

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.649 
I think that definitely domination is
definitely<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:06.610> big<00:05:06.819> one<00:05:07.060> you<00:05:07.180> know<00:05:07.300> pretty

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:07.659 
definitely the big one you know pretty

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:10.080 
definitely the big one you know pretty
much<00:05:07.779> everybody<00:05:08.409> plays<00:05:08.710> domination<00:05:09.460> that's

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
much everybody plays domination that's

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.600 
much everybody plays domination that's
like<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.599> most<00:05:10.870> used<00:05:11.409> my<00:05:12.069> most<00:05:12.279> played<00:05:12.460> game

think that would be awesome to have like

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.119 
think that would be awesome to have like
either<00:05:18.270> teams<00:05:19.270> of<00:05:19.449> six<00:05:19.719> like<00:05:20.110> six<00:05:20.379> on<00:05:20.529> six<00:05:20.830> or

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
it's just there's so much action all the

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.240 
it's just there's so much action all the
time<00:05:36.639> it's<00:05:36.909> like<00:05:37.000> it's<00:05:37.330> so<00:05:37.689> hectic<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.439> the

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
time it's like it's so hectic and the

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.050 
time it's like it's so hectic and the
only<00:05:39.520> bad<00:05:39.729> thing<00:05:40.000> about<00:05:40.029> 99<00:05:40.779> is<00:05:41.050> that<00:05:42.060> the

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
only bad thing about 99 is that the

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.719 
only bad thing about 99 is that the
lobby<00:05:43.360> gets<00:05:43.779> extremely<00:05:44.529> laggy<00:05:44.979> in<00:05:45.310> private

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
lobby gets extremely laggy in private

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.269 
lobby gets extremely laggy in private
match<00:05:45.879> for<00:05:46.750> whatever<00:05:47.050> reason<00:05:47.589> it<00:05:47.800> seems<00:05:48.039> like

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279 
match for whatever reason it seems like

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.969 
match for whatever reason it seems like
private<00:05:48.759> match<00:05:48.909> is<00:05:49.149> a<00:05:49.180> whole<00:05:49.629> lot<00:05:49.899> a<00:05:50.349> whole<00:05:50.620> lot

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
private match is a whole lot a whole lot

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.179 
private match is a whole lot a whole lot
more<00:05:51.389> laggy<00:05:52.389> than<00:05:52.930> public<00:05:53.560> match<00:05:53.919> which

00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:54.189 
more laggy than public match which

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:57.059 
more laggy than public match which
doesn't<00:05:54.490> really<00:05:54.550> make<00:05:54.789> sense<00:05:54.849> to<00:05:55.389> me<00:05:55.569> I<00:05:56.529> don't

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 
doesn't really make sense to me I don't

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.730 
doesn't really make sense to me I don't
know<00:05:57.159> why<00:05:57.370> that<00:05:57.639> is<00:05:57.669> but<00:05:58.169> it's<00:05:59.169> like<00:05:59.439> you<00:05:59.710> just

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
know why that is but it's like you just

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.740 
know why that is but it's like you just
start<00:06:00.310> dropping<00:06:00.759> frames<00:06:01.060> it's<00:06:01.389> like<00:06:01.509> if<00:06:01.659> you

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
start dropping frames it's like if you

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.529 
start dropping frames it's like if you
ever<00:06:01.779> played<00:06:02.199> black<00:06:02.500> ops<00:06:02.710> 1<00:06:02.919> and<00:06:03.490> you<00:06:04.360> know

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
like where napalm would come down and

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 
like you're near named palm or something

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.409 
like you're near named palm or something
the<00:06:08.830> napalm<00:06:09.219> strike<00:06:09.399> then<00:06:09.699> you<00:06:10.029> know<00:06:10.180> how<00:06:10.300> it

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.269 
the napalm strike then you know how it
starts<00:06:10.750> getting<00:06:10.870> like<00:06:11.080> really<00:06:11.110> laggy<00:06:11.889> and<00:06:12.189> you

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:12.279 
starts getting like really laggy and you

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:14.369 
starts getting like really laggy and you
start<00:06:12.550> dropping<00:06:12.939> frames<00:06:13.210> maybe<00:06:13.930> that's<00:06:14.229> just

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379
