once again I'm running a sound cube q
2200<00:00:19.970> at<00:00:20.750> 1<00:00:21.020> ohm<00:00:22.060> -<00:00:23.060> HDS<00:00:23.869> 312<00:00:25.900> and<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.619> trunk

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
2200 at 1 ohm - HDS 312 and the trunk

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.630 
2200 at 1 ohm - HDS 312 and the trunk
which<00:00:28.250> I<00:00:28.430> can<00:00:28.640> show

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640

so let's show you what these twelves can
do<00:01:22.470> still<00:01:23.470> gets<00:01:24.190> quite<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.460> bit<00:01:24.640> of<00:01:24.729> flex<00:01:25.410> so

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
do still gets quite a bit of flex so

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.320 
do still gets quite a bit of flex so
we'll<00:01:26.710> put<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:27.009> on<00:01:28.050> king<00:01:29.050> of<00:01:29.229> bass<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.850> turn

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
we'll put it on king of bass and turn

00:01:31.330 --> 00:05:15.670 
we'll put it on king of bass and turn
this<00:01:31.479> bad<00:01:31.720> boy<00:01:31.990> up

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
see it's definitely still flexing I

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.290 
see it's definitely still flexing I
probably<00:05:37.650> have<00:05:38.010> at<00:05:38.340> least<00:05:38.460> a<00:05:38.670> hundred<00:05:38.820> square

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
probably have at least a hundred square

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.880 
probably have at least a hundred square
feet<00:05:39.630> of<00:05:40.310> sound<00:05:41.310> deadening<00:05:41.640> or<00:05:42.180> sound

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
feet of sound deadening or sound

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.480 
feet of sound deadening or sound
dampening<00:05:43.890> material<00:05:44.540> in<00:05:45.540> here<00:05:46.500> with<00:05:47.340> that

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
dampening material in here with that

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.900 
dampening material in here with that
being<00:05:47.700> a<00:05:48.030> stinger<00:05:48.720> roadkill<00:05:49.290> but<00:05:49.770> like<00:05:50.730> I<00:05:50.850> said

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
being a stinger roadkill but like I said

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.010 
being a stinger roadkill but like I said
I<00:05:51.480> plan<00:05:51.840> on<00:05:51.890> ordering<00:05:52.890> another<00:05:53.540> kit<00:05:54.540> from

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
I plan on ordering another kit from

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.470 
I plan on ordering another kit from
sound<00:05:55.530> cube<00:05:55.920> getting<00:05:56.580> some<00:05:56.760> of<00:05:56.850> their<00:05:56.940> cue<00:05:57.210> mat

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
sound cube getting some of their cue mat

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.660 
sound cube getting some of their cue mat
apparently<00:05:58.320> it's<00:05:58.470> supposed<00:05:58.710> to<00:05:58.800> be<00:05:58.980> the

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
apparently it's supposed to be the

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.710 
apparently it's supposed to be the
thickest<00:06:01.010> there<00:06:02.010> is<00:06:02.190> right<00:06:02.580> now<00:06:02.820> I<00:06:03.060> guess<00:06:03.450> it's

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
thickest there is right now I guess it's

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.110 
thickest there is right now I guess it's
even<00:06:04.050> better<00:06:04.320> than<00:06:04.590> that<00:06:04.650> Dynamat<00:06:05.430> extreme<00:06:05.880> or

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
even better than that Dynamat extreme or

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.250 
even better than that Dynamat extreme or
whatever<00:06:07.770> they<00:06:07.830> they<00:06:08.460> claimed<00:06:08.820> so

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
whatever they they claimed so

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.350 
whatever they they claimed so
anyways<00:06:10.430> still<00:06:11.430> very<00:06:11.820> impressed<00:06:12.300> with<00:06:13.340> the

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
anyways still very impressed with the

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.250 
anyways still very impressed with the
sound<00:06:15.360> cube<00:06:15.690> Q<00:06:16.370> 2200<00:06:17.370> the<00:06:18.270> thing<00:06:18.600> is<00:06:18.930> pushing

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
sound cube Q 2200 the thing is pushing

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.400 
sound cube Q 2200 the thing is pushing
the<00:06:19.530> hell<00:06:19.800> out<00:06:20.280> of<00:06:20.340> those<00:06:20.610> twelve<00:06:21.030> and<00:06:21.840> as<00:06:22.230> you

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
the hell out of those twelve and as you

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.920 
the hell out of those twelve and as you
can<00:06:22.560> see<00:06:22.770> I<00:06:22.800> still<00:06:23.190> haven't<00:06:23.669> got<00:06:24.660> to<00:06:24.810> my

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
can see I still haven't got to my

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.650 
can see I still haven't got to my
battery<00:06:25.320> bank<00:06:25.730> to<00:06:26.730> make<00:06:26.850> that<00:06:27.090> look<00:06:27.330> pretty

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
battery bank to make that look pretty

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.190 
battery bank to make that look pretty
yet<00:06:27.960> so<00:06:28.760> it's<00:06:29.760> always<00:06:30.090> a<00:06:30.120> work<00:06:30.720> in<00:06:30.780> progress

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 
yet so it's always a work in progress

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.400 
yet so it's always a work in progress
but<00:06:32.100> hopefully<00:06:32.910> I'll<00:06:33.660> have<00:06:33.810> it<00:06:33.960> done<00:06:34.110> by<00:06:34.350> this

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410
