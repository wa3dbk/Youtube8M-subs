about<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.720> something<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.439> Apple<00:01:31.799> could

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
about it it's something that Apple could

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560 
about it it's something that Apple could
have<00:01:32.040> implemented<00:01:32.369> themselves<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.240> has<00:01:33.540> a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
have implemented themselves and it has a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.730 
have implemented themselves and it has a
really<00:01:33.869> great<00:01:34.170> total<00:01:34.439> system<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.250> i<00:01:35.280> use<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.700> in

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
really great total system so i use it in

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.050 
really great total system so i use it in
collaboration<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:37.770> NC<00:01:38.220> settings<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:38.880> that

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
collaboration with NC settings but that

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.539 
collaboration with NC settings but that
doesn't<00:01:39.329> mean<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.450> i<00:01:39.630> don't<00:01:40.079> i<00:01:40.650> don't<00:01:41.100> use

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
doesn't mean that i don't i don't use

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.520 
doesn't mean that i don't i don't use
the<00:01:41.670> toggles<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.060> aux<00:01:42.450> oh<00:01:42.689> because<00:01:42.930> there<00:01:43.409> are

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the toggles on aux oh because there are

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.899 
the toggles on aux oh because there are
a<00:01:43.590> few<00:01:43.799> which<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.159> very<00:01:44.310> useful<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
a few which are very useful like the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.730 
a few which are very useful like the
auto<00:01:45.060> rotation<00:01:45.329> lock<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.689> much<00:01:45.840> quicker<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
auto rotation lock is much quicker to

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.530 
auto rotation lock is much quicker to
access<00:01:47.040> an<00:01:47.159> Oscar<00:01:47.490> awk<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.270> quickly

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
access an Oscar awk so you just quickly

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600 
access an Oscar awk so you just quickly
slide<00:01:49.020> along<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.560> that's<00:01:50.009> done<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.340> dusted

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
slide along and that's done and dusted

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.270 
slide along and that's done and dusted
there's<00:01:51.240> also<00:01:51.390> things<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:52.040> airplane<00:01:53.040> mode

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
there's also things like airplane mode

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.679 
there's also things like airplane mode
and<00:01:53.610> Wi-Fi<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.090> stuff<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.570> also

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
and Wi-Fi and stuff like that it also

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.990 
and Wi-Fi and stuff like that it also
has<00:01:54.899> media<00:01:55.290> controls<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.460> great<00:01:56.640> media

also<00:02:54.419> lives<00:02:54.599> just<00:02:54.689> a<00:02:54.840> little<00:02:55.049> bit<00:02:55.169> old<00:02:55.590> and

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
also lives just a little bit old and

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.369 
also lives just a little bit old and
kind<00:02:56.099> of<00:02:56.189> a<00:02:56.250> bit<00:02:56.430> outdated<00:02:56.609> so<00:02:57.480> these<00:02:58.079> two

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
kind of a bit outdated so these two

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.259 
kind of a bit outdated so these two
really<00:02:58.769> do<00:02:59.159> work<00:02:59.280> well<00:02:59.430> together<00:02:59.609> for<00:03:00.090> my

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
really do work well together for my

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.849 
really do work well together for my
current<00:03:00.569> situation<00:03:00.689> there<00:03:01.470> we<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.709> guys

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
current situation there we have it guys

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.890 
current situation there we have it guys
I<00:03:02.099> guess<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.400> pretty<00:03:02.730> much<00:03:03.180> wraps<00:03:03.480> up<00:03:03.720> the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
I guess that pretty much wraps up the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.589 
I guess that pretty much wraps up the
toggles<00:03:04.470> edition<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.669> the<00:03:06.000> creating<00:03:06.450> a

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
toggles edition of the creating a

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.690 
toggles edition of the creating a
perfect<00:03:06.930> jailbroken<00:03:07.530> iPhone<00:03:08.159> if<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.609> have

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
perfect jailbroken iPhone if you have

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
like that that I should use on this

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.610 
like that that I should use on this
jailbroken<00:03:12.269> iPhone<00:03:12.780> definitely<00:03:13.290> drop<00:03:13.470> them
