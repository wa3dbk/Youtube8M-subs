00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:14.280
 Barclays is the largest carbon lobby 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.770
 built up to today has 50 meters 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.080
 and has a mast of 67 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.150
 meters to want it was designed by 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.760
 bell trip my boat built by 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.760
 look at your shipyards and fano and ancona 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.220
 Howard has shown us once again 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.050
 quality of your products already 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.239
 which in the past had surpassed all 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.559
 You record a super fast boat one 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.360
 want the trip well 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.340
 this time innovation does not only include 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.710
 aesthetics of the boat but also what is 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.510
 within it we refer, for example, to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.420
 propulsion caused by hybrid engines 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.640
 electric diesel solution that already 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.800
 had been used by submarines to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.750
 World War II in which it continues 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.879
 will be applied even on the sailing 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.040
 today 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.050
 place where the place has a 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.180
 big house that even without chain 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.940
 striking is very useful because you can 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.300
 enjoy ample spaces just below 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.300
 her 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.650
 I think this boat in thing on this boat 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.290
 there are no rails that normally 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.940
 damage in the aesthetics of the boat here 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.940
 in fact everything is cleaner 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.800
 stone place is a vessel designed and 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.410
 built to sail in any sea 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.720
 but nevertheless we treat always 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.750
 from one to wally the performance and 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.400
 velocity are still one point 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.070
 important 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.350
 The old plan is simple despite its 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.740
 a large sail wrapped around the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.320
 retracts a candle style one code 0 and 1 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.510
 generic 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.280
 This is a boat that declares your 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.800
 intentions to navigate anywhere 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.380
 also thanks to the classification rina is 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.450
 grammy plus attesting that all of this 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.980
 regular standards 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.980
 for non-environmental pollution
