00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.600 
call of duty ghosts
by<00:02:13.500> good<00:02:13.770> i<00:02:13.800> mean<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.190> not<00:02:14.280> as<00:02:14.400> good<00:02:14.490> as

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
by good i mean it's not as good as

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.250 
by good i mean it's not as good as
before<00:02:14.720> but<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:15.870> still<00:02:16.050> definitely

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
before but it's still definitely

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.230 
before but it's still definitely
possible<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.460> my<00:02:17.580> opinion<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:18.030> looks<00:02:18.150> a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
possible and in my opinion it looks a

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.490 
possible and in my opinion it looks a
lot<00:02:18.390> cooler<00:02:18.660> than<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.990> used<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.290> before

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
lot cooler than it used to before

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500 
lot cooler than it used to before
because<00:02:20.370> like<00:02:20.550> when<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.790> zoom<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.180> its<00:02:21.360> got

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
because like when you zoom in its got

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.150 
because like when you zoom in its got
like<00:02:21.600> all<00:02:21.750> blurry<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.500> sides<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:22.860> stuff

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
like all blurry on the sides and stuff

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.040 
like all blurry on the sides and stuff
so<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.640> actually<00:02:24.030> kind<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.330> aphur<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.870> that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
so I actually kind of aphur like that

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.470 
so I actually kind of aphur like that
but<00:02:25.350> um<00:02:25.620> yeah<00:02:26.220> that's<00:02:26.430> my<00:02:26.640> kind<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:26.940> opinion<00:02:27.390> on

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
but um yeah that's my kind of opinion on

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.030 
but um yeah that's my kind of opinion on
sniping<00:02:27.990> it's<00:02:28.140> definitely<00:02:28.530> going<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.680> be<00:02:28.740> back

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
sniping it's definitely going to be back

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.370 
sniping it's definitely going to be back
and<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.790> guns<00:02:30.030> are<00:02:30.240> all<00:02:30.690> right<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.050> guess

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
and the guns are all right I guess

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.620 
and the guns are all right I guess
there's<00:02:31.680> only<00:02:31.800> like<00:02:31.920> one<00:02:32.340> or<00:02:32.370> two<00:02:32.520> guns<00:02:33.480> I've

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
there's only like one or two guns I've

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.240 
there's only like one or two guns I've
actually<00:02:33.750> seen<00:02:34.020> from<00:02:34.170> previous<00:02:34.560> cards<00:02:34.890> in

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
actually seen from previous cards in

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.920 
actually seen from previous cards in
this<00:02:35.550> game<00:02:35.790> they've<00:02:36.000> got<00:02:36.180> like<00:02:36.300> loads<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.750> new

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
perks I think it's like 45 pokes or

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.040 
perks I think it's like 45 pokes or
something<00:02:41.340> which<00:02:41.490> is<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.640> lot<00:02:41.820> of<00:02:41.850> pugs<00:02:42.150> but<00:02:42.870> um

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
something which is a lot of pugs but um

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.330 
something which is a lot of pugs but um
yeah<00:02:43.230> that's<00:02:43.410> quite<00:02:43.590> cool<00:02:43.740> as<00:02:43.890> well<00:02:44.040> but<00:02:44.280> I

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
yeah that's quite cool as well but I

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.060 
yeah that's quite cool as well but I
