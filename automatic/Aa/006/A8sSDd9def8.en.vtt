Hi All, Today we'll see how to build a house!

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.703
Yes you got it, how to build a little house for the Christmas crib....

00:00:18.732 --> 00:00:27.630
La Casetta (the little house)

00:00:30.803 --> 00:00:32.146
This is the skeleton we are going to make and use

00:00:34.547 --> 00:00:37.496
here what you need: glue, paper, scissors and a cutter

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:42.727
All this other stuff is for later, to color and to refine...we'll look at this later

00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:52.718
Let's start by creating the skeleton in this way

00:01:06.498 --> 00:01:23.550
Earlier we cut the shape that you can see I'm using now

00:01:36.406 --> 00:01:44.959
Now that we have the skeleton, we put the roof

00:02:15.576 --> 00:02:18.724
done, it will dry in a couple of minutes

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:34.568
Then, we need to build the roof, like a real roof

00:02:36.374 --> 00:02:44.902
We need to add tiles to the roof...

00:02:47.400 --> 00:03:04.246
Let's start from the bottom

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:14.512
The glue will dry and we'll color on top of the tiles, so no worry

00:03:16.756 --> 00:03:25.622
Then we build another layer...and so on until the roof is full of tiles

00:03:38.643 --> 00:03:43.373
Here you see when all the tiles are on the roof

00:03:45.323 --> 00:03:50.754
Now, we build windows and doors by using a cutter

00:04:25.212 --> 00:04:28.982
We'll also make  a little balcony

00:04:43.734 --> 00:04:53.265
We use some wood to make doors and balcony

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.721
You cut it the way you want the door to be open or closed

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:23.621
Same approach for the balcony

00:05:40.878 --> 00:05:45.122
We now attach it to a base made of wood.

00:05:46.984 --> 00:05:52.249
To refine now we need, colors, cork, moss and anything else you want to use

00:05:59.564 --> 00:06:03.402
You really need to be creative, I'm starting with some cork now...

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.294
Some wood, to make trees...I use beech

00:06:38.717 --> 00:06:43.847
And moss, in different colors

00:06:49.322 --> 00:06:56.932
then the floor....

00:06:58.728 --> 00:07:05.717
and the house is done....

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:34.442
Later we'll see more advanced stuff you can make starting from a little hose, like this...
