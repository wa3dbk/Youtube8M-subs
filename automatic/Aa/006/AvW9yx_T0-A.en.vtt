for us as mountain bikers if you follow
my<00:00:21.420> side<00:00:21.660> all<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.080> know<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.590> think

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
my side all you know that I think

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.220 
my side all you know that I think
strength<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> huge<00:00:23.789> part<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.300> your<00:00:24.810> ability

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
strength is a huge part of your ability

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.470 
strength is a huge part of your ability
to<00:00:25.260> perform<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> trail<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:27.029> lot<00:00:27.449> of

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
to perform on the trail but a lot of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.179 
to perform on the trail but a lot of
riders<00:00:27.720> get<00:00:28.080> turned<00:00:28.349> off<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.920> because

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
riders get turned off to that because

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.349 
riders get turned off to that because
when<00:00:29.369> they<00:00:29.460> think<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.789> strength<00:00:30.119> training

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
when they think of strength training

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.030 
when they think of strength training
they<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.109> these<00:00:31.260> brutally<00:00:31.830> hard

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
they think of these brutally hard

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.979 
they think of these brutally hard
workouts<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.820> usually<00:00:33.210> leave<00:00:33.390> them<00:00:33.420> sore

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
workouts that usually leave them sore

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.500 
workouts that usually leave them sore
and<00:00:34.140> tired<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.829> days<00:00:35.130> afterwards<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.149> they

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
and tired for days afterwards and they

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.000 
and tired for days afterwards and they
can't<00:00:36.750> ride<00:00:36.899> their<00:00:37.079> bike<00:00:37.230> very<00:00:37.500> effectively

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
can't ride their bike very effectively

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.500 
can't ride their bike very effectively
so<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.460> like<00:00:38.579> why<00:00:38.610> would<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.000> want<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.360> do

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
basically doing is using the same weight

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.510 
basically doing is using the same weight
a<00:01:00.449> moderately<00:01:01.079> heavy<00:01:01.320> weight<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.920> you're

and right up against that limit the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.330 
and right up against that limit the
whole<00:02:59.150> time<00:02:59.540> i'm<00:03:00.260> going<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.530> do<00:03:00.650> two<00:03:00.890> reps<00:03:01.190> in

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
whole time i'm going to do two reps in

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.000 
whole time i'm going to do two reps in
my<00:03:01.459> first<00:03:01.730> set<00:03:02.030> which<00:03:02.329> would<00:03:02.450> be<00:03:02.540> pretty<00:03:02.870> easy

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
my first set which would be pretty easy

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.619 
my first set which would be pretty easy
okay<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.459> then<00:03:04.579> i'm<00:03:04.670> going<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:04.849> do<00:03:05.000> three<00:03:05.239> reps

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
okay and then i'm going to do three reps

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.170 
okay and then i'm going to do three reps
in<00:03:05.810> my<00:03:05.959> next<00:03:06.319> set<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.769> then<00:03:07.310> finally<00:03:07.549> my<00:03:07.849> third

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
in my next set and then finally my third

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.509 
in my next set and then finally my third
set<00:03:08.540> i'm<00:03:08.780> going<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.019> do<00:03:09.200> five<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.950> then<00:03:10.400> i

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
set i'm going to do five and then i

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.460 
set i'm going to do five and then i
would<00:03:10.700> drop<00:03:11.030> back<00:03:11.299> down<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.750> i<00:03:11.840> would<00:03:12.019> do<00:03:12.170> two

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
would drop back down and i would do two

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.940 
would drop back down and i would do two
reps<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:13.579> then<00:03:14.209> three<00:03:14.540> reps<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.109> then<00:03:15.620> five

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
reps and then three reps and then five

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.979 
reps and then three reps and then five
reps<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.609> so<00:03:16.819> anyways<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:17.209> can<00:03:17.389> repeat<00:03:17.780> those

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
reps and so anyways you can repeat those

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.009 
reps and so anyways you can repeat those
ladders<00:03:18.370> anywhere<00:03:19.370> from<00:03:19.639> one<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.150> five<00:03:20.720> times

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
ladders anywhere from one to five times

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.920 
ladders anywhere from one to five times
you<00:03:21.410> know<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:21.829> anywhere<00:03:22.639> generally<00:03:23.180> about<00:03:23.269> 3<00:03:23.599> 2

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
you know so anywhere generally about 3 2

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.949 
you know so anywhere generally about 3 2
2<00:03:24.049> 3<00:03:24.079> is<00:03:24.349> a<00:03:24.380> good<00:03:24.650> place<00:03:25.609> to<00:03:25.790> start<00:03:26.090> but<00:03:26.420> the

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
2 3 is a good place to start but the

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.110 
2 3 is a good place to start but the
idea<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.349> so<00:03:28.040> instead<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.370> like<00:03:28.609> doing<00:03:28.819> a<00:03:28.940> bunch

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
idea is so instead of like doing a bunch

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.330 
idea is so instead of like doing a bunch
of<00:03:29.239> sets<00:03:29.480> at<00:03:29.660> your<00:03:29.810> limit<00:03:30.049> you're<00:03:30.709> doing<00:03:31.040> sets

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
of sets at your limit you're doing sets

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.920 
of sets at your limit you're doing sets
that<00:03:31.549> are<00:03:31.579> just<00:03:31.819> below<00:03:32.120> your<00:03:32.150> limit<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.780> a

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
that are just below your limit and a

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.449 
that are just below your limit and a
couple<00:03:33.139> sets<00:03:33.440> that<00:03:33.590> are<00:03:33.650> at<00:03:33.799> your<00:03:33.920> limit<00:03:34.160> and

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
couple sets that are at your limit and

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.220 
couple sets that are at your limit and
so<00:03:34.849> what's<00:03:35.030> that's<00:03:35.180> doing<00:03:35.510> is<00:03:35.630> allowing<00:03:35.900> you

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
so what's that's doing is allowing you

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.379 
so what's that's doing is allowing you
to<00:03:36.440> get<00:03:36.650> strong<00:03:36.980> exposing<00:03:37.669> your<00:03:37.790> body<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.359> the

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
to get strong exposing your body to the

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.780 
to get strong exposing your body to the
load<00:03:38.750> getting<00:03:39.410> practice<00:03:39.980> with<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.310> exercise

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
load getting practice with the exercise

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.819 
load getting practice with the exercise
getting<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.209> lot<00:03:41.450> of<00:03:41.480> good<00:03:41.660> quality<00:03:42.319> reps<00:03:42.590> in

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
getting a lot of good quality reps in

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.800 
getting a lot of good quality reps in
but<00:03:43.400> you're<00:03:43.549> not<00:03:43.579> always<00:03:44.060> right<00:03:44.269> at<00:03:44.660> that

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
but you're not always right at that

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.409 
but you're not always right at that
limit<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:45.530> you<00:03:46.099> know<00:03:46.310> you're<00:03:46.519> not<00:03:46.669> placing<00:03:47.359> a

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
limit and you know you're not placing a

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:48.789 
limit and you know you're not placing a
