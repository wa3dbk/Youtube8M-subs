00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
the exact same way that I do it because

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.490 
the exact same way that I do it because
there's<00:05:53.820> all<00:05:53.970> these<00:05:54.090> little<00:05:54.360> twists<00:05:55.320> and

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
there's all these little twists and

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.110 
there's all these little twists and
turns<00:05:55.710> rhythmically<00:05:56.400> and<00:05:56.669> there's<00:05:56.850> all<00:05:56.970> these

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
turns rhythmically and there's all these

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.969 
turns rhythmically and there's all these
little<00:05:57.260> subtle<00:05:58.260> things<00:05:58.470> that<00:05:58.650> I<00:05:58.710> do<00:05:58.770> with<00:05:58.950> my

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
little subtle things that I do with my

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.090 
little subtle things that I do with my
my<00:05:59.610> hands<00:05:59.850> in<00:06:00.210> terms<00:06:00.389> of<00:06:00.540> muting<00:06:00.990> and<00:06:01.290> and<00:06:01.979> it

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
my hands in terms of muting and and it

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.310 
my hands in terms of muting and and it
seems<00:06:02.340> to<00:06:02.400> me<00:06:02.580> that<00:06:02.790> you<00:06:03.419> never<00:06:03.540> exactly<00:06:03.960> play

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
seems to me that you never exactly play

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.680 
seems to me that you never exactly play
your<00:06:05.160> song<00:06:05.400> is<00:06:05.550> exactly<00:06:05.880> the<00:06:06.030> same<00:06:06.210> way<00:06:06.390> twice

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
your song is exactly the same way twice

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.300 
your song is exactly the same way twice
why<00:06:07.200> in<00:06:07.320> the<00:06:07.410> world<00:06:07.440> would<00:06:07.770> I<00:06:07.860> want<00:06:08.100> to<00:06:08.130> do<00:06:08.280> that

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
why in the world would I want to do that

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.390 
why in the world would I want to do that
although<00:06:09.000> okay
