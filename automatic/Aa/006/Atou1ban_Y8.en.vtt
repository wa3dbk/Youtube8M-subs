00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
his absolute beast i think that he may

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.700 
his absolute beast i think that he may
not<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:52.050> know<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.320> fantasy<00:00:52.680> football

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
not be you know for fantasy football

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.250 
not be you know for fantasy football
watcher<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.699> he<00:00:53.730> may<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:54.090> be

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
watcher so I'm like that he may not be

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.720 
watcher so I'm like that he may not be
the<00:00:55.260> best<00:00:55.289> pick<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.160> year<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.489> think

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the best pick up this year I think

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.819 
the best pick up this year I think
there's<00:00:56.940> better<00:00:57.210> players<00:00:57.559> in<00:00:58.559> better

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
there's better players in better

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.849 
there's better players in better
environments<00:00:59.550> but<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.820> think<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> long<00:01:00.570> run

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
environments but I think in the long run

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.680 
environments but I think in the long run
you<00:01:01.859> know<00:01:01.949> EJ<00:01:02.280> Manuel<00:01:02.699> Sammy<00:01:02.969> Watkins<00:01:03.210> can
