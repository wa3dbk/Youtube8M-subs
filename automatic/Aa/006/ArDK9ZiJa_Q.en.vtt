in<00:00:00.149> this<00:00:00.750> tutorial<00:00:00.989> we'll<00:00:01.800> show<00:00:01.979> you<00:00:02.010> how<00:00:02.220> to

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
in this tutorial we'll show you how to

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.910 
in this tutorial we'll show you how to
add<00:00:02.490> some<00:00:02.520> light<00:00:02.939> sources<00:00:03.270> in<00:00:03.480> our<00:00:03.600> level<00:00:03.929> we

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
add some light sources in our level we

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.650 
add some light sources in our level we
will<00:00:05.009> continue<00:00:05.400> from<00:00:05.580> our<00:00:05.700> previous<00:00:06.089> tutorial

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
will continue from our previous tutorial

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.850 
will continue from our previous tutorial
and<00:00:06.839> use<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.529> one-room<00:00:08.010> map<00:00:08.220> that<00:00:08.429> we<00:00:08.550> created

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
and use a one-room map that we created

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.169 
and use a one-room map that we created
first<00:00:10.860> we'll<00:00:11.040> add<00:00:11.160> two<00:00:11.400> pillars<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:11.880> our<00:00:11.969> level

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
first we'll add two pillars in our level

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.850 
first we'll add two pillars in our level
to<00:00:12.389> demonstrate<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.049> lighting<00:00:13.349> effects<00:00:13.679> in

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
to demonstrate the lighting effects in

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.400 
to demonstrate the lighting effects in
quake<00:00:14.360> we<00:00:15.360> right-click<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.109> add<00:00:16.230> an

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
quake we right-click and add an

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.929 
quake we right-click and add an
eight-sided<00:00:16.859> rectangular<00:00:17.580> prism<00:00:19.760> we<00:00:20.760> can

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
eight-sided rectangular prism we can

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.340 
eight-sided rectangular prism we can
move<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.270> brush<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.720> forward<00:00:22.140> right

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350

section<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.949> our<00:00:23.130> room

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.380 

we<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.279> assign<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.579> different<00:00:29.849> texture<00:00:30.359> to

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
we can assign a different texture to

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.640 
we can assign a different texture to
this<00:00:30.599> pillar<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.349> be<00:00:31.439> better

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
this pillar so it can be better

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.040 
this pillar so it can be better
distinguished<00:00:32.279> from<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.550> room<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:33.690> select
