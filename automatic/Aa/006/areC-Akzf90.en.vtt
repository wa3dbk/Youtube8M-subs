 August on PC Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.110
 a rather special day 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.820
 because he saw a selection of 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.140
 avid splinter cell players e 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.180
 splinter cell series to be able to come

 here and try the campaign an excerpt 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.629
 of the single player campaign an excerpt 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.850
 of the cooperative game campaign 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.230
 practically in an almost final version 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.760
 in short, a selection of players between 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.230
 which also different readers of 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.879
 multiplayer.it that we were able to do here 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.129
 meet we took several photos and 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.830
 have pressed just the game tried 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.420
 in preview then I leave you a series 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.430
 of small hooligans we have done with 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.900
 them to hear a little thing 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.800
 they think of the game what they tried 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.059
 just the first hot impressions 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.019
 we're here with david who's done with 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.269
 play right now practically 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.159
 finished playing the excuse milk 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.510
 operational thrust salvation save me 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.400
 all I ask for hot impressions 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.080
 hot if you are a player of the series a 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.690
 Absolutely from the series player 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.360
 first chapter and I loved it 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.119
 ie I had the feeling that that 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.250
 have time to play the first is 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:22.130
 revised as simple as I knew it e 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.259
 graphically spectacular beautiful beautiful 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.270
 stealth mechanics we are back 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.750
 to that to what you love but has me 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.969
 made to fall in love with the series aspect 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.049
 generates single player which for me is that 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.689
 to play right away 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.549
 exactly we are here with luca that just 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.960
 finished playing a small piece 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.609
 of the splinter single player campaign 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.570
 cell black list then most of all if it is 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.810
 a player of the series 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.799
 absolutely is played when it 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.600
 a quarter of an hour abundant impressions 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.640
 hd simo just without hair on the tongue 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.810
 to me it immediately looks like a splinter cell more 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.360
 important in the saga a little as they were i 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.290
 first three 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.900
 there is no marking apart from us 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.060
 we know we have seen 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.930
 the only thing that says there is is lean 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.350
 of conviction 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.910
 the rest is pushed knows the pure I don't know how 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.460
 the silk between difficulties but they are a lot 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.950
 quite a few times despite being anyway 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.230
 a fairly regular gambler 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.110
 stealth just like the other phase 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.959
 lately we have seen that a lot 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.910
 very stealth we are here with clear 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.560
 in short, it is quite particular to find 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.200
 a girl who will always give that boost 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.720
 it's not really the classic women's game 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.940
 you liked it you tried the cooperative 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.680
 of this spinter sel is here exact for 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.630
 now we know that venice Europeans 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.239
 there is a splinter cell player either 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.920
 enough of the guys only that 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.610
 here they are much more prepared than 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.790
 myself 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.520
 impressions a cool you have the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.489
 otherwise really exciting 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.010
 like other video games in the end the 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.630
 third in short yes very much and I found 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.830
 unfortunately difficult because there is one 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.870
 this is quite a recurring question 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.989
 cooperative really really tough 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.060
 or at least fun and entertaining for 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.510
 force otherwise I believe that not there 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.790
 would play and but it is difficult anymore 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.190
 fun, not all of us commit waste 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:20.709
 we are here with federico that hardly 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.630
 finished playing the demo let's say 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.250
 in short, the bild symbol of the disputing ones 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.610
 the black list you liked impressions 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.860
 hot 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.890
 yes yes yes very interesting also because 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.069
 an even newer approach we are 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.890
 returned to 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.249
 to that stealth of the first 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.769
 trilogy but also an action that resumes 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:42.230
 in the last chapters a nice mix with 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.469
 rumble but exceptional testimonial of the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.060
 day was luca ward voice actor 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:49.129
 historian of keanu reeves russell crowe 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.709
 robert downey junior and many others 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.989
 again that was the first voice of sam 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.239
 fisher in the first three chapters of the game 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.799
 and somehow it marks precisely this 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.049
 return to the past of the series since 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.150
 it also returns in this century in this 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.219
 black list to make the entry again 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.260
 sunfish together we exchanged 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.609
 a chat about what the is 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.900
 dubbing in video games on what 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.069
 it was his experience with this drive 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.349
 saddle and more generally on what 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.159
 means doubling not only i 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.709
 video games 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.209
 I leave you a little excerpt of this 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.349
 interview which will then be published in 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.910
 integral way 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:25.940
 in the next few days you will find them in short 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:28.370
 whatever you like about sam fisher 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.509
 what is a character something 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.520
 some element and you like del 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.449
 protagonist of the sprinters saddle but 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.150
 meanwhile there is one thing that struck me 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.610
 the relationship he has with his daughter then 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.090
 we find not only the war machine 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:47.570
 but man and this is his important 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.250
 his coldness is also his courage 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.070
 because it takes courage to do these 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.139
 things and no false modesty and I 'm a 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.270
 I am always very brave man 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.949
 been and am also a very real man 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.240
 as simple as he is a very man 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:05.390
 so he is not a father of three children 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.090
 this is also this thing that he 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:11.420
 to this this passion for this 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.550
 daughter impressed me a lot and more in 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.410
 general of the series of the series of 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.660
 spinter sel there is some element 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.220
 in particular this mix of spy 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.410
 story somehow tries to be 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.120
 also very cinematic as well 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.870
 refer a bit to james bond a little 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.700
 bourne 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.130
 there is some element in particular that 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.010
 in short, he has appreciated you 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.040
 just the proximity 007 among other things 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.230
 I was the voice of 007 for almost one 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.460
 decade so we're pleased 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:42.740
 this indeed but already from the first 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.500
 videogame while I was doing it myself 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.420
 inspired bond obviously not 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.490
 even if the character is completely 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.520
 different but I find it interesting 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.340
 this thing to retrace a bit that is 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.650
 which reminds him the combination is missing 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.050
 tuxedo but sooner or later second 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.640
 the women will give it to me 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.230
 probably lacking compared to a 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:09.280
 james bond is so what indeed there is is 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:12.230
 which I am a lover of 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.920
 female beauty of the part of the 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.540
 female audience so he yes 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.510
 missing is what we see maybe maybe the 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.660
 next video game a story the lake 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:27.160
 someone a little too loyal to duty 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:29.750
 in short, we must also have fainted 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.100
 we are waiting to return to 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.290
 maybe test a phase enough 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.450
 advanced in the game since precisely 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.370
 by now it is in the home straight but I would say 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.330
 that now here from buccinasco and everything e 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.330
 so thanks for joining us 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.790
 puts a little already I know you that is 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.710
 pretty well known item you 're wrong 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.050
 he in truth we say seriously for 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.630
 federico maggiore is the boy who covers 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.450
 who takes care of our video reviews and 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.100
 also interviews and point after anyway 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.380
 federico you will continue to hear a lot 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:05.630
 often from our pieces I agree 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.630
 greeting all bye guys hello
