00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.940
 a tuber that feeds more than eight 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.580
 thousand years and cultivated it on land in 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.680
 small-scale or large-scale production 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.890
 annual growth exceeds 2 million 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.840
 500 thousand tons and demand does not stop 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.279
 grow as well as the forms of cultivation 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.960
 so the agency's researchers 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.910
 São Paulo State Agribusiness Technology 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.920
 de mococa são paulo are studying the 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.960
 in the greenhouse for the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.930
 production of mini potato tubers 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.379
 there are four thousand plants that two 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.690
 varieties asterix more pink and 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.539
 agate more hopscotch 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.000
 in this system the plant does not stay in the ground 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.460
 there is no substrate or channel and the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.620
 roots are suspended in the air 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.100
 the plant is fed by 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.430
 water loaded with nutrients and potatoes 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.000
 is collected as if it were a grape in the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.640
 is a technique in which the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.330
 root system he stays in the air he 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.729
 is nourished with water and nutrients for a 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.890
 nebulization by a mist that reaches 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.409
 the root system because of the plant 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.409
 stay with the exposed root system 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.320
 we have the advantage of being able to harvest 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.759
 these seed potatoes is in a way 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.799
 stepped 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.979
 that is to say as the plant 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.770
 to emit the potatoes in the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.960
 people are picking and with that we 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.840
 can choose a size that the producer 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.759
 What are you going to get this potato? 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.649
 seed is to wish 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.610
 the mobilization is done in a circuit 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.829
 closed and water is treated with ozone 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.770
 associated with ultraviolet light 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.500
 eliminates impurities from falling into the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.170
 returns to the distributed system 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.320
 by pressure regulating valves 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.899
 generator is as a precaution if it is missing 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.050
 electric power here on planet earth 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.879
 aeroponics goes against the economy of 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.680
 water for more 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.439
 sustainable with 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.299
 less pesticides or work 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.939
 developed here at the São Paulo agency of 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.549
 agribusiness technology in mococa in the 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.920
 state of São Paulo is also being 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:29.310
 studied by nasa space agency 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.250
 North American for cultivation in 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.689
 absence of gravity or even in 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.569
 other planets 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.939
 because this nutritious solution fr 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.790
 circulating and recirculating then it goes 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.709
 and back in the system gives to adapt 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.409
 in the absence of severity since 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.689
 This mist this water is 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.579
 in the air is the main advantage including 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.010
 rate of tuber multiplication by 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.019
 plant in this system it can reach up to 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.000
 50 tubers per plant 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.469
 for now in mococa são paulo 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.889
 researchers are studying the 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:04.319
 spacing the amount of nutrients and 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:07.349
 the nebulization intervals 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.120
 one thing is certain that greenhouse since 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.760
 mounted in a region with altitude above 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.109
 of 1,000 meters can produce per year 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.030
 up to 150 thousand mini potato tubers there 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:21.810
 greater production potential 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.060
 mild climate conditions and as araxá 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.479
 plant it can can produce 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.579
 up to 3 cycles per plan uses less 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:32.370
 pesticides due to the fact that this 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.639
 closed with screens before the child in a 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.519
 environment we do not have here is 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.919
 practically solo is he is practically 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.009
 inert we have the incidence of pests 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.870
 diseases is quite limited to people 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:47.609
 has little of that organism is that within 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.470
 knowledge is of use 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.530
 public and the producer who is 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.319
 interested party may contact the 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.239
 of mococa in the state of São Paulo is 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.819
 a pioneering work in Brazil to 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.720
 first production and research unit 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.540
 of seed potatoes in aeroponics and you 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.250
 are the first to note 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.590
 this technology is logical that he who 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.109
 interested in the technology you want
