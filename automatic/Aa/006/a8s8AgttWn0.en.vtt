hey youtube it's katrina welcome to day
40<00:00:03.360> of<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.689> orbit<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.290> i'm<00:00:04.799> laughing<00:00:05.730> because

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 
40 of the orbit and i'm laughing because

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.220 
40 of the orbit and i'm laughing because
i<00:00:07.080> was<00:00:07.710> just<00:00:07.770> talking<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.990> one<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.019> my

i was just talking to one of my

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.039 
i was just talking to one of my
roommates<00:00:10.559> about<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:12.240> temperature<00:00:12.750> danger

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
roommates about the temperature danger

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.340 
roommates about the temperature danger
zone<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.799> if<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.880> are<00:00:15.120> not<00:00:15.809> certain<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.199> what

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
zone and if you are not certain of what

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.490 
zone and if you are not certain of what
that<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.830> should<00:00:17.039> google<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.900> we<00:00:18.900> are<00:00:19.080> both

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
that is you should google it we are both

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.560 
that is you should google it we are both
certified<00:00:20.000> to<00:00:21.000> be<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.869> food<00:00:22.650> prep<00:00:23.570> supervisors

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
certified to be a food prep supervisors

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.259 
certified to be a food prep supervisors
because<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.380> took<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.130> course<00:00:26.369> online<00:00:26.670> and

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
because we took this course online and

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.929 
because we took this course online and
took<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.720> test<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.650> got<00:00:28.800> over<00:00:29.400> seventy

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
took a test and we got over seventy

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.010 
took a test and we got over seventy
percent<00:00:30.650> apparently<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.800> means<00:00:33.020> apparently

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
percent apparently that means apparently

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.540 
percent apparently that means apparently
that<00:00:34.170> means<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.559> you're<00:00:34.800> qualified<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
that means that you're qualified to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.799 
that means that you're qualified to
watch<00:00:36.000> people<00:00:36.300> make<00:00:36.600> food<00:00:38.059> but<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.540> did<00:00:39.690> learn

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
watch people make food but we did learn

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
watch people make food but we did learn
a<00:00:39.870> lot<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.290> now<00:00:40.559> we're<00:00:40.710> paranoid<00:00:41.129> whenever<00:00:41.399> we

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
a lot and now we're paranoid whenever we

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.500 
a lot and now we're paranoid whenever we
make<00:00:41.790> food<00:00:42.030> or<00:00:42.329> cool<00:00:43.140> down<00:00:43.170> food<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:43.800> anything

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
make food or cool down food or anything

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.630 
make food or cool down food or anything
so<00:00:45.680> essentially<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.390> big<00:00:49.640> thing

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
so essentially if you have a big thing

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.959 
so essentially if you have a big thing
that's<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.329> warm<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:55.219> like<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.309> pot<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.579> stew

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that's like warm like like a pot of stew

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.990 
that's like warm like like a pot of stew
or<00:00:57.000> something<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.719> or<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.739> see<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.879> you

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
or something like that or I see that you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.569 
or something like that or I see that you
just<00:01:00.210> made<00:01:00.920> don't<00:01:01.920> put<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> fridge

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
just made don't put it in the fridge

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.280 
just made don't put it in the fridge
because<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.120> will<00:01:03.270> lower<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.780> temperature<00:01:04.080> in

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
because it will lower the temperature in

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
because it will lower the temperature in
the<00:01:04.350> fridge<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.309> will<00:01:05.549> possibly<00:01:05.820> bring

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the fridge and that will possibly bring

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.350 
the fridge and that will possibly bring
you<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> temperature<00:01:07.229> danger<00:01:07.439> zone<00:01:08.360> it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
you into the temperature danger zone it

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.289 
you into the temperature danger zone it
will<00:01:09.600> raise<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.799> will<00:01:10.950> raise<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.430> string<00:01:12.180> of

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
will raise it will raise the string of

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.359 
will raise it will raise the string of
your<00:01:12.450> fridge<00:01:12.659> oh<00:01:12.840> my<00:01:13.049> god<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.979> will<00:01:14.159> raise<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
your fridge oh my god it will raise the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.609 
your fridge oh my god it will raise the
temperature<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> fridge<00:01:15.439> possibly<00:01:16.439> bring

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
temperature in the fridge possibly bring

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.870 
temperature in the fridge possibly bring
you<00:01:16.770> into<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> temperature<00:01:17.490> danger<00:01:17.700> zone

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
you into the temperature danger zone

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.640 
you into the temperature danger zone
which<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:19.880> 42<00:01:20.880> 140<00:01:21.390> degrees<00:01:21.630> forty<00:01:21.990> my<00:01:22.110> worst

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
which is 42 140 degrees forty my worst

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.640 
which is 42 140 degrees forty my worst
41<00:01:23.280> 41<00:01:23.970> degrees<00:01:24.360> Fahrenheit<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.140> 140<00:01:25.619> degrees

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
41 41 degrees Fahrenheit to 140 degrees

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.280 
41 41 degrees Fahrenheit to 140 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:26.509> that<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> temperature

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
Fahrenheit that is the temperature

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.350 
Fahrenheit that is the temperature
danger<00:01:28.590> zone<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.430> where<00:01:29.549> bacterial

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
danger zone and that is where bacterial

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.270 
danger zone and that is where bacterial
growth<00:01:30.590> will<00:01:31.590> double<00:01:32.490> every<00:01:32.640> half<00:01:33.000> hour<00:01:33.150> so

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
growth will double every half hour so

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.030 
growth will double every half hour so
also<00:01:35.280> when<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.150> move<00:01:36.930> leftovers

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
also when you move leftovers

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
also when you move leftovers
from<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.189> dinner<00:01:39.340> table<00:01:39.700> into<00:01:39.820> the

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
from the dinner table into the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.460 
from the dinner table into the
refrigerator<00:01:40.180> you<00:01:40.659> should<00:01:40.810> put<00:01:40.990> them<00:01:41.079> in<00:01:41.229> tiny

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
refrigerator you should put them in tiny

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.580 
refrigerator you should put them in tiny
containers<00:01:42.009> so<00:01:42.159> that<00:01:42.310> they<00:01:42.399> can<00:01:42.549> cool<00:01:42.880> faster

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
containers so that they can cool faster

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.780 
containers so that they can cool faster
yeah<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:44.770> don't<00:01:44.920> leave<00:01:45.100> food<00:01:45.220> after<00:01:45.490> over<00:01:45.670> two

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
yeah and don't leave food after over two

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.399 
yeah and don't leave food after over two
hours<00:01:46.030> all<00:01:46.180> right<00:01:46.330> enough<00:01:46.720> of<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:46.899> for<00:01:47.140> today

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
hours all right enough of that for today
