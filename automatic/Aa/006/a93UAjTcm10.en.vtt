00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
design otherwise would not draw anything

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.740 
design otherwise would not draw anything
so<00:00:24.149> let's<00:00:24.390> use<00:00:24.630> example<00:00:25.470> where<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.489> can<00:00:26.759> build<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
so let's use example where I can build a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.100 
so let's use example where I can build a
Jersey<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.680> let's<00:00:29.399> pick<00:00:29.610> one<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.180> like<00:00:30.450> we
