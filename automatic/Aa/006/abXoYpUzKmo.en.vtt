00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.069
 animals delivered to their own fate 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.990
 it is unfortunately a sad reality 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.210
 in the region of namur 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.000
 this horse is abandoned since 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.009
 several years hurt he owes his 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.190
 survival of residents who took care 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.690
 to put a blanket 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.880
 listen does not have water in the summer and has 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.640
 practically nothing to eat the winter 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.109
 can not leave it like this then 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.550
 we do not live very far from here and 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.900
 almost every day we come and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.550
 since he's hurt we all come 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.950
 the days twice a day for the sai 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.610
 and give him medicine and he 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.530
 give to eat 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.760
 here you have already tried to talk to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.230
 his owner 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.190
 yes how he reacts he does not react I 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.010
 think he has other worries 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.020
 the owner also stayed 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.190
 deaf to service warnings 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.829
 veterinary inspection 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.620
 few days before Christmas the association 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.079
 animals in danger is mandated to come 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.579
 seize the mount we have a wound here that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.050
 date of several weeks but who 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.670
 is not cared for properly because 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.769
 the conditions obviously to exercise 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.970
 the care of this horse is not 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.710
 gathered since it must of course be 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.670
 dry we are in the bad season so 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.810
 it is not possible to apply 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.010
 body care and to ring this wound 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.930
 which is obviously accidental 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.710
 probably one of the injuries related to 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.439
 barbed wire but boarding 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.930
 game looks rather tricky it requires 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:28.530
 a lot of patience on the part of 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.970
 members of the association who if we have 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.619
 simply for the sake of flooring 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.479
 so the horse has been so used to 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.369
 stay dense took without ever 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.150
 to come out of it than just walking 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.600
 on macadam terrorizes him 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.370
 to work around the problem the valves will 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.370
 finally back in the meadow 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.730
 that's the state of a problem with 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.560
 horses that are not handled 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.210
 that we leave like that to have given in 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.090
 a meadow was like winter year 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:00.680
 after year their behavior becomes again 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:04.100
 a little wild they are so 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.080
 confined in their habits that the 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.250
 less annoyance makes them very very 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.200
 afraid to warn them 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.340
 ok we are good and are horses who 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.530
 can be extremely dangerous 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.810
 precisely because they are afraid of 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.300
 hour later the horse arrives on 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.250
 refuses to meslin the bishop where he can 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.810
 finally be properly cared for 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.280
 now happiness for him has 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.640
 really started he will end up 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.200
 finally dry in a spacious box with 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.120
 a longer lease race and especially with 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.670
 good care and in a second time 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.900
 either he will live here said to even aeternam 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.190
 or else it could possibly be 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.030
 proposed for adoption in 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.030
 very strict conditions 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.900
 in his misfortune this horse has some 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.610
 chance yesterday again the refuge would have 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.720
 not been able to welcome him bazaar 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.160
 does well things is that two 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.750
 chevrons is adopted we have been the 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.470
 drive this morning so he replaces a 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.400
 happy to find a stranger 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.140
 it is for example the mine to the bishop 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.610
 we only take horses that are 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.530
 seized for cases of abuse so 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.750
 by judicial or inspection 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.790
 veterinary is the other floor 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.260
 refuges in principle works the same 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.700
 way and still sometimes welcomes 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.050
 things that are eventually abandoned 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.400
 voluntarily by their owners 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.050
 and if for many years we have them 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.280
 accept more simply because at 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.590
 take place and given priority 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.240
 to horses who are victims of bad 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.650
 treatments 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.500
 the animal is immediately caught 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.810
 charge by the veterinarian was called is 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.380
 infected he risk of box and the rest 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.420
 of his life 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.959
 such negligence is 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.060
 unfortunately commonplace 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.190
 people do not want to start 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.260
 make the necessary expenses because 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.120
 the sons and his listening obviously expensive 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.580
 drugs are expensive and then by 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.170
 neglect simply get hard at 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.550
 all alone simply people 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.769
 think it'll heal like that and 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.269
 as long as the horse does not limp has not 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.970
 the air of losing weight we do nothing and we 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.239
 expects additional proof of letting 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.760
 go 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.650
 this horse is not identified by means 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.340
 an electronic chip as required 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.079
 yet the law since 2008 must 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.209
 have a chip a notebook 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.959
 identification with the report 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.400
 graph a written report and they 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.380
 must be registered in the database 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.049
 data center of the confederation 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.520
 belgian horse in this case so beautiful the 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.229
 owner did not consider it necessary to 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.090
 the necessary fees while it's 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.740
 an obligation 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.140
 we still often come here the absence of 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.280
 peace under quite primarily 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.870
 for old horses because the 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.220
 people think it's an old horse on 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.110
 must not identify him he is still going 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.360
 to die on your own not to slaughter 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.380
 so we do not do it where they do not have 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.380
 done in a timely manner
