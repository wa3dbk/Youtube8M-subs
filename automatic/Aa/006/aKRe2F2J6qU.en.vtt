00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.980
 how about friends welcome to a new 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.259
 video and today I bring you a new map 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.829
 for minecraft carisio and it's from this 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.629
 incredible town or kingdom then in that 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:17.490
 We will take a tour around the 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.580
 place as usual on my channel 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.460
 then we will start at this moment by 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.589
 here we have the kingdom the castle that the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.740
 truth is very well done I liked it 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:31.050
 much much much around here we have all 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.079
 the houses because we have a tower that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.239
 I suppose it's the clock in a moment 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.730
 we will enter it but we will start with 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.160
 the houses to see what's inside 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.230
 we have some steps that take us 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.050
 to the second level and in the second level 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.090
 we have nothing more than a bed a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.370
 waste of space let's go and we're going 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.640
 to fix so that it looks at least 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.640
 best 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.440
 if at least it 's a little better 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.440
 let's see here 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.629
 yes I think it is the best and good 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.990
 will follow 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.729
 through the streets of this place 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.939
 You can see that everything is made on the basis of 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.450
 stone and from this material I do not remember 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.460
 what's it called I think it's gravel 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.710
 good being here we have input 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.720
 to this tower 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.240
 we are not entering it 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.869
 we have chests here 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.049
 I guess we can not go up here 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.049
 inside then logically 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.049
 we will fly 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.870
 and that we are 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.120
 we have the entrance actually I never 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.360
 I had entered this place 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.700
 Miss who is doing the video wow 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.130
 what a great 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.860
 we do not have the one that serves us I suppose here 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.180
 well you know how great this place is 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.490
 I suppose it's the one of the one in 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.630
 high class since they give everything they 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.119
 we have here impressive awesome 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.970
 it's better than the little houses we have and 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:13.099
 I'm going to move that the ground is 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.099
 changing by floors that we are changing 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.700
 because we have more below 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.010
 almost dead 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.790
 I was close to die good 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.790
 let's keep going 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:35.130
 wow we stop somewhere else 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:38.110
 well, continuing with him with the people 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.540
 you can see that in this place we have 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.540
 around about 12 houses 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.290
 all with their bed and some larger 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:51.019
 that the others have one that is small 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.640
 another that is bigger or can be more 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.690
 small just a little better 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.740
 distributed in space 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.740
 let's see that inside 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.870
 well there's nothing interesting there 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:09.260
 we will leave here 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:12.030
 because we have a well of truth was 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.860
 very shallow but I did it deeper 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.860
 to make it look a little better 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.799
 so 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.799
 We will continue with the tour 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.220
 on this side we have these sculptures 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.800
 do not be nines 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.100
 I think it's around here we have these 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.760
 towers that I do not really know what they are 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.730
 It looks like statues 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.220
 or something like that has already gone up 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.800
 them and I do not think anything 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.920
 nothing bad but I do not really know what they are 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.500
 we will continue if at this moment we will enter 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.500
 to the castle around here we have more of those 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.880
 things that I do not know are from where 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.430
 came the seven or what is this 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.460
 a house not finished 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.330
 Wow 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.830
 it is not this place 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.670
 well I guess we 're determined 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.760
 cool 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.859
 is very hidden from all the others 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.420
 then we will go to the castle to 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.320
 conclude this tour is either 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.230
 how cool is 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.530
 but right here that we have my entry 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.370
 we have a rise a tower that we 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.620
 lets see the whole place 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.620
 but the point is not this now we have 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.060
 this great wall that divides us from everything 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.669
 the rest 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.710
 so we'll enter the castle to 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.260
 that can see the inside of him 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.030
 and so finally decide if they download it 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.430
 or not just download because actually 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:58.630
 I liked it and I want to bring good this 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:02.110
 content to the channel let's see 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:06.130
 and here we have this long corridor here 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:09.790
 we have the throne some flags and this does not 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:13.080
 I know what other flags are and we will leave 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.080
 running for the fastest 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:21.310
 we are happening that we have the lights 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:26.480
 I know very well around here we have a jail 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:30.040
 and good trunk we will follow the stands 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.420
 everything is made from this trunk 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.390
 well let's go 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.380
 going up 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.950
 and we arrived fast 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:44.550
 and here we have this this balcony that we 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.830
 lets see the whole city ​​the whole town 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.330
 and this would be all friends I hope there is 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.070
