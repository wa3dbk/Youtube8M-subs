00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
feel like they make bad decisions on the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.910 
feel like they make bad decisions on the
core<00:00:35.160> or<00:00:35.719> they<00:00:36.719> don't<00:00:36.840> move<00:00:37.260> as<00:00:37.469> well<00:00:37.620> or

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
core or they don't move as well or

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.119 
core or they don't move as well or
whatever<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.500> you<00:00:40.500> know<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.739> feel<00:00:40.980> like

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
whatever it is you know I just feel like

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.639 
whatever it is you know I just feel like
it<00:00:41.520> makes<00:00:41.910> me<00:00:42.090> focus<00:00:42.780> my<00:00:42.930> mind<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.350> bit<00:00:43.469> better

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
it makes me focus my mind a bit better

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.819 
it makes me focus my mind a bit better
yeah<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.420> mean<00:00:46.230> both<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.680> them

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
yeah I think I mean both of them

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.260 
yeah I think I mean both of them
obviously<00:00:46.980> will<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.489> helped<00:00:47.700> me<00:00:47.879> in

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
obviously will have helped me in

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.049 
obviously will have helped me in
different<00:00:48.930> ways<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.590> think<00:00:49.920> also<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.940> one

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
different ways but I think also the one

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.350 
different ways but I think also the one
will<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.329> final<00:00:51.660> last<00:00:51.840> year<00:00:52.140> was<00:00:53.360> important

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
will and final last year was important

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.010 
will and final last year was important
for<00:00:54.539> me<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.170> way<00:00:56.030> that<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> couple

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
for me on the way that this is a couple

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.819 
for me on the way that this is a couple
of<00:00:58.079> weeks<00:00:58.170> after<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:59.100> well<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:01.410> know<00:01:01.559> I

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
of weeks after that as well you know I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.759 
of weeks after that as well you know I
think<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.820> my<00:01:03.120> career<00:01:03.180> was<00:01:03.660> normally<00:01:04.500> being

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
think in my career was normally being

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.980 
think in my career was normally being
quite<00:01:05.070> gradual<00:01:05.760> sort<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.180> progress<00:01:06.450> most

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
quite gradual sort of progress most

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.620 
quite gradual sort of progress most
years<00:01:07.580> with<00:01:08.580> my<00:01:08.729> results<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.320> things<00:01:11.630> and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
years with my results and and things and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.800 
years with my results and and things and
I<00:01:12.780> think<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.830> one<00:01:13.950> wooden<00:01:14.220> final<00:01:14.640> was<00:01:14.820> who<00:01:15.659> was

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I think the one wooden final was who was

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.109 
I think the one wooden final was who was
really<00:01:16.049> tough<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.040> played<00:01:17.580> well<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.850> that

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
really tough but I played well in that

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.020 
really tough but I played well in that
final<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.100> basically<00:01:20.100> had<00:01:20.430> gone<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:21.000> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
final and I basically had gone for it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.390 
final and I basically had gone for it
you<00:01:21.360> know<00:01:21.530> there's<00:01:22.530> some<00:01:22.680> shots<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.250> would

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
you know there's some shots that I would

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.770 
you know there's some shots that I would
have<00:01:23.490> liked<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.820> changed<00:01:25.310> but<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:27.659> know

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
have liked to have changed but you know

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.600 
have liked to have changed but you know
I<00:01:27.810> went<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.500> lost<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.950> match<00:01:29.130> kind<00:01:29.490> of

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
I went for it and lost the match kind of

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.030 
I went for it and lost the match kind of
on<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:30.000> my<00:01:30.240> terms<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.869> felt<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.500> didn't<00:01:31.770> sort<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
on on my terms I felt I didn't sort of

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.859 
on on my terms I felt I didn't sort of
just<00:01:32.280> sit<00:01:32.520> back<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.790> wait<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.810> I<00:01:36.810> think

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
just sit back and wait and I think

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.899 
just sit back and wait and I think
that's<00:01:37.079> maybe<00:01:37.350> why<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.740> managed<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.340> recover

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
that's maybe why I managed to recover

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.149 
that's maybe why I managed to recover
from<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.360> defeat<00:01:39.720> was<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.439> didn't<00:01:40.829> come

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
from that defeat was like I didn't come

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.380 
from that defeat was like I didn't come
off<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> court<00:01:41.670> thing<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.060> kind<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.479> what<00:01:42.689> if

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
off the court thing and kind of what if

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.789 
off the court thing and kind of what if
you<00:01:45.390> know<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.990> got<00:01:46.200> back<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> practice

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
you know and I got back on the practice

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.800 
you know and I got back on the practice
court<00:01:47.130> five<00:01:47.399> six<00:01:47.759> days<00:01:47.939> later<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.570> felt

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
court five six days later and I felt

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.289 
court five six days later and I felt
great<00:01:49.140> whereas<00:01:49.649> when<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.890> lost<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.490> slam

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
great whereas when I lost and slam

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.830 
great whereas when I lost and slam

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
for a few months afterwards I hadn't

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.690 
for a few months afterwards I hadn't
dealt<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.270> particularly<00:01:57.750> well<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.700> you

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
dealt with it particularly well but you

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.459
