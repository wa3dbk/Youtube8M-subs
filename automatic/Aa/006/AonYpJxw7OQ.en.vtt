- and I do about one click to give

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.960 
- and I do about one click to give
myself<00:01:50.680> a<00:01:50.890> little<00:01:50.920> bit<00:01:51.130> of<00:01:51.250> compression<00:01:51.580> not

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
myself a little bit of compression not

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.389 
myself a little bit of compression not
much<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.479> find<00:01:53.320> with<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.590> titanium<00:01:53.920> spring

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
much I find with the titanium spring

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.850 
much I find with the titanium spring
it's<00:01:54.550> a<00:01:54.610> bit<00:01:54.789> softer<00:01:55.300> so<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:55.990> don't<00:01:56.530> like<00:01:56.619> to<00:01:56.740> go

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
it's a bit softer so I don't like to go

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.499 
it's a bit softer so I don't like to go
up<00:01:56.979> too<00:01:57.130> much<00:01:57.280> on<00:01:57.490> spring<00:01:57.970> rate<00:01:58.149> I<00:01:58.179> just<00:01:58.420> like

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
up too much on spring rate I just like

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.639 
up too much on spring rate I just like
that<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.659> little<00:01:58.869> bit<00:01:58.960> of<00:01:59.020> compression<00:01:59.229> and

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
that a little bit of compression and

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.039 
that a little bit of compression and
it's<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.369> really<00:02:00.580> smooth<00:02:00.909> smooth<00:02:01.690> working

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
it's a really smooth smooth working

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.080 
it's a really smooth smooth working
system<00:02:02.409> there<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:03.159> then<00:02:03.310> on<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.490> front<00:02:03.610> I'm

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
system there and then on the front I'm

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.080 
system there and then on the front I'm
running<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.450> 66<00:02:04.929> here<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.920> an<00:02:06.039> air<00:02:06.789> fork

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
running the 66 here this is an air fork

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.229 
running the 66 here this is an air fork
6680<00:02:07.929> a<00:02:08.080> so<00:02:08.860> I'm<00:02:08.979> running<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.310> 88<00:02:09.700> wide<00:02:09.910> open

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
6680 a so I'm running the 88 wide open

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.150 
6680 a so I'm running the 88 wide open
so<00:02:10.509> I'm<00:02:10.600> running<00:02:10.750> full<00:02:11.049> full<00:02:11.530> 7-inch<00:02:11.950> travel<00:02:13.019> I

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
so I'm running full full 7-inch travel I

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.680 
so I'm running full full 7-inch travel I
ramped<00:02:15.160> up<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.489> compression<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.060> little<00:02:16.330> bit<00:02:16.510> I

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
ramped up the compression a little bit I

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.520 
ramped up the compression a little bit I
think<00:02:17.049> we'll<00:02:17.170> see<00:02:17.290> here<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:18.269> think<00:02:19.269> two<00:02:20.049> two

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
think we'll see here I think two two

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.000 
think we'll see here I think two two
terms<00:02:20.799> on<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.010> compression<00:02:21.310> knob<00:02:21.610> there<00:02:21.880> and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
terms on the compression knob there and

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.440 
terms on the compression knob there and
I<00:02:24.010> like<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.519> have<00:02:24.610> my<00:02:24.730> suspension<00:02:25.090> nice<00:02:25.269> and

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
I like to have my suspension nice and

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.090 
I like to have my suspension nice and
balfour<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.870> bit<00:02:26.019> with<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> bit<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.530> bit<00:02:27.010> of

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
balfour the bit with a bit of a bit of

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.500 
balfour the bit with a bit of a bit of
dampening<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:27.670> here<00:02:28.180> I'll<00:02:28.299> give<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.450> an

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
dampening so here I'll give you an

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.430 
dampening so here I'll give you an
example<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.959> dampening<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.350> have<00:02:29.609> so<00:02:31.440> it's

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
example of the dampening I have so it's

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.900 
example of the dampening I have so it's
pretty<00:02:32.620> slow<00:02:32.890> like<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.280> can<00:02:33.400> take<00:02:33.519> my<00:02:33.609> hands<00:02:33.850> off

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
pretty slow like I can take my hands off

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.060 
pretty slow like I can take my hands off
