00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
sparked an air assault and mark five but

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.269 
sparked an air assault and mark five but
hopefully<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.529> get<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:25.890> all<00:00:25.920> three<00:00:26.099> even

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
hopefully we get to see all three even

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.890 
hopefully we get to see all three even
in<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.400> future<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:26.880> pretty<00:00:27.480> much<00:00:27.660> those

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
in the future but pretty much those

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.480 
in the future but pretty much those
three<00:00:28.140> figures<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.650> resembled<00:00:29.130> after<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
three figures are resembled after the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.189 
three figures are resembled after the
members<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.029> that's<00:00:30.269> why<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.449> included<00:00:30.750> them<00:00:31.019> in

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
members so that's why I included them in

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.310 
members so that's why I included them in
this<00:00:31.380> video<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.480> I've<00:00:33.480> got<00:00:33.630> my<00:00:33.750> custom<00:00:34.140> base

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
this video and I've got my custom base

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.889 
this video and I've got my custom base
it<00:00:35.309> was<00:00:35.430> supposed<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.730> be<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> McFarland

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
it was supposed to be like the McFarland

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.319 
it was supposed to be like the McFarland
rock<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:38.010> came<00:00:38.219> with<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> Moon<00:00:38.820> edition<00:00:39.239> of

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
rock that came with the Moon edition of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.170 
rock that came with the Moon edition of
Halo<00:00:39.480> Reach<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:40.020> think<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.410> came<00:00:40.530> with<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.829> but

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
Halo Reach I think it came with that but

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.310 
Halo Reach I think it came with that but
that's<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.510> based<00:00:42.690> off<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.079> can

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
that's what it's based off the can

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.389 
that's what it's based off the can
basically<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.100> thought<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.370> looked

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
basically and I just thought it looked

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.340 
basically and I just thought it looked
better<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.420> kind<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.719> got<00:00:45.870> my<00:00:46.020> own<00:00:46.170> little

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
better and I kind of got my own little

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.010 
better and I kind of got my own little
small<00:00:46.770> mountain<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.940> hope<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.600> guys<00:00:48.750> enjoy
