00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
what's up guys it's John and today I

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.290 
what's up guys it's John and today I
thought<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:01.979> would<00:00:02.129> do<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.460> show<00:00:02.700> you<00:00:02.760> all<00:00:03.090> the

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
thought I would do is show you all the

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.720 
thought I would do is show you all the
ways<00:00:03.449> that<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.929> can<00:00:04.259> kill<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.710> Rhino<00:00:05.100> quickly

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
ways that you can kill the Rhino quickly

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.639 
ways that you can kill the Rhino quickly
in<00:00:05.970> extinction<00:00:06.720> mode<00:00:06.930> now<00:00:07.170> if<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.379> don't<00:00:07.529> know

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
in extinction mode now if you don't know

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.680 
in extinction mode now if you don't know
the<00:00:07.830> Rhino<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.610> boss<00:00:08.880> you'll<00:00:09.269> be<00:00:09.389> seeing

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
the Rhino is the boss you'll be seeing

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.709 
the Rhino is the boss you'll be seeing
in<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.170> final<00:00:10.679> area<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.670> extinction<00:00:12.450> mountain

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
in the final area of extinction mountain

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.780 
in the final area of extinction mountain
known<00:00:12.900> as<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.410> cabin<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.280> guy<00:00:14.490> can<00:00:14.700> be

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
known as the cabin and this guy can be

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.070 
known as the cabin and this guy can be
pretty<00:00:15.000> difficult<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.540> deal<00:00:15.719> with<00:00:15.870> if<00:00:15.990> you

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
pretty difficult to deal with if you

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.570 
pretty difficult to deal with if you
don't<00:00:16.260> know<00:00:16.379> how<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.560> effectively<00:00:17.160> kill<00:00:17.369> him

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
don't know how to effectively kill him

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.640 
don't know how to effectively kill him
so<00:00:17.760> what<00:00:17.910> I'm<00:00:18.029> gonna<00:00:18.150> do<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.810> show<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.140> all<00:00:19.439> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
so what I'm gonna do is show you all the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.230 
so what I'm gonna do is show you all the
ways<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.920> can<00:00:19.949> efficiently<00:00:20.460> kill<00:00:20.789> him<00:00:21.000> let's

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
ways you can efficiently kill him let's

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.660 
ways you can efficiently kill him let's
begin<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.410> probably<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> easiest

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
begin so probably one of the easiest

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.220 
begin so probably one of the easiest
ways<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.060> kill<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> Rhinos<00:00:24.660> by<00:00:24.869> taking

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
ways to kill the Rhinos by taking

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.109 
ways to kill the Rhinos by taking
advantage<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.710> its<00:00:25.890> AI<00:00:26.010> by<00:00:26.400> using<00:00:26.670> what<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.910> like

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
advantage of its AI by using what I like

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.820 
advantage of its AI by using what I like
to<00:00:27.240> call<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.570> barrier<00:00:27.990> strategy<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.710> you'll

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
to call a barrier strategy so you'll

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.529 
to call a barrier strategy so you'll
notice<00:00:29.130> right<00:00:29.160> now<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> positioned<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.150> barrier

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
notice right now I positioned a barrier

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.389 
notice right now I positioned a barrier
in<00:00:30.750> between<00:00:30.840> me<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.470> Rhino<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.040> barrier

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
in between me and the Rhino that barrier

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.970 
in between me and the Rhino that barrier
being<00:00:32.610> defense<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.410> because<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.739> way<00:00:34.829> his

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
being defense and because of the way his

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.810 
being defense and because of the way his
AI<00:00:35.250> works

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
AI works

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.690 
AI works
he<00:00:36.180> sort<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.570> needs<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.079> second<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:38.340> sort<00:00:38.550> of

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
he sort of needs a second to sort of

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.250 
he sort of needs a second to sort of
have<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.940> direct<00:00:39.270> line<00:00:39.450> at<00:00:39.690> me<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.230> he

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
have like a direct line at me so that he

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.750 
have like a direct line at me so that he
can<00:00:40.469> charge<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:40.980> because<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.399> fence<00:00:41.610> is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
can charge but because that fence is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.340 
can charge but because that fence is
there<00:00:41.940> he<00:00:42.390> doesn't<00:00:42.719> have<00:00:42.809> time<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.140> set<00:00:43.320> up

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
there he doesn't have time to set up

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.049 
there he doesn't have time to set up
that<00:00:43.500> direct<00:00:43.800> line<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.219> he<00:00:44.370> won't<00:00:44.550> charge<00:00:44.879> me

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
that direct line so he won't charge me

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
that direct line so he won't charge me
and<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.930> use<00:00:46.079> his<00:00:46.260> fences<00:00:46.649> cover

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
and I can just use his fences cover

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.440 
and I can just use his fences cover
going<00:00:47.219> back<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.579> forth<00:00:47.789> killing<00:00:48.120> him<00:00:48.210> sort<00:00:48.390> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
going back and forth killing him sort of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.090 
going back and forth killing him sort of
taking<00:00:48.750> advantage<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.079> his<00:00:49.230> AI<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:50.010> you

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
taking advantage of his AI so you

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.470 
taking advantage of his AI so you
noticed<00:00:50.370> I'm<00:00:50.489> constantly<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> move<00:00:51.210> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
noticed I'm constantly on the move and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.029 
noticed I'm constantly on the move and
he<00:00:51.539> doesn't<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:52.079> time<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> lock-on<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:52.920> he

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
he doesn't have time to lock-on so he

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.650 
he doesn't have time to lock-on so he
can't<00:00:53.250> hurt<00:00:53.370> me<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.059> course<00:00:54.180> if<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.539> too

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
can't hurt me now of course if I get too

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.060 
can't hurt me now of course if I get too
close<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.110> fence<00:00:55.289> he<00:00:55.440> may<00:00:55.590> slay<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
close to the fence he may slay on the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.619 
close to the fence he may slay on the
ground<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.640> may<00:00:56.760> hop<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> fence<00:00:57.360> but

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
ground or you may hop the fence but

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.630 
ground or you may hop the fence but
either<00:00:58.109> situation<00:00:58.770> gives<00:00:58.949> me<00:00:59.039> plenty<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.430> time

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
either situation gives me plenty of time

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.160 
either situation gives me plenty of time
to<00:00:59.760> get<00:00:59.879> away<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.270> should<00:01:00.480> be<00:01:00.629> fine<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
to get away and I should be fine and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.869 
to get away and I should be fine and
this<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.559> basically<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.100> barrier<00:01:02.460> strategy

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
this is basically the barrier strategy

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.310 
this is basically the barrier strategy
in<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> nutshell<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.629> make<00:01:03.780> sure<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.199> it

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
in a nutshell just make sure you do it

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.530 
in a nutshell just make sure you do it
when<00:01:04.530> there<00:01:04.680> are<00:01:04.830> many<00:01:05.070> aliens<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> map<00:01:05.970> so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
when there are many aliens on the map so

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.210 
when there are many aliens on the map so
another<00:01:06.810> strategy<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.409> may<00:01:07.650> want<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.860> use<00:01:08.070> to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
another strategy you may want to use to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.039 
another strategy you may want to use to
kill<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> Rhino<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.119> by<00:01:09.330> using<00:01:09.630> stuff<00:01:10.020> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
kill the Rhino is by using stuff that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.000 
kill the Rhino is by using stuff that
you<00:01:10.290> find<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.680> ground

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
you find on the ground

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.870 
you find on the ground
so<00:01:11.070> you'll<00:01:11.189> notice<00:01:11.340> right<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.850> I

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
so you'll notice right there that I

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
so you'll notice right there that I
threw<00:01:12.060> down<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.479> flare<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.900> while<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> player

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
threw down a flare and while the player

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.350 
threw down a flare and while the player
may<00:01:13.710> not<00:01:13.890> initially<00:01:14.460> distract<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> Rhino

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
may not initially distract the Rhino

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.120 
may not initially distract the Rhino
what<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.140> will<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.740> strike<00:01:16.979> though

the<00:01:56.640> Rhino<00:01:56.909> another<00:01:57.600> thing<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:57.930> do<00:01:58.049> of

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
the Rhino another thing you can do of

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.109 
the Rhino another thing you can do of
course<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.590> using<00:01:58.860> armor-piercing<00:01:59.640> rounds<00:01:59.969> so

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
course is using armor-piercing rounds so

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.539 
course is using armor-piercing rounds so
because<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.840> Rhino<00:02:01.110> has<00:02:01.290> those<00:02:01.979> plates<00:02:02.310> on

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
because the Rhino has those plates on

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.609 
because the Rhino has those plates on
his<00:02:02.759> back<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.689> only<00:02:03.810> hit<00:02:04.049> him<00:02:04.110> from<00:02:04.469> one

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
his back you can only hit him from one

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.590 
his back you can only hit him from one
angle<00:02:04.979> with<00:02:05.130> regular<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.579> incendiary<00:02:06.060> rounds

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
angle with regular and incendiary rounds

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.020 
angle with regular and incendiary rounds
but<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.990> are<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.350> use<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.030> armor-piercing

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
but if you are to use the armor-piercing

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.790 
but if you are to use the armor-piercing
rounds<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.390> can<00:02:09.420> hit<00:02:09.629> him<00:02:09.690> from<00:02:09.959> any<00:02:10.200> angle

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
rounds you can hit him from any angle

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.530 
rounds you can hit him from any angle
and<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.160> will<00:02:11.310> make<00:02:11.520> your<00:02:11.640> life<00:02:11.760> easier

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540
