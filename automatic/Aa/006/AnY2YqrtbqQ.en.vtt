well<00:00:02.230> I<00:00:02.260> got<00:00:02.710> bad<00:00:02.950> news<00:00:02.980> on<00:00:03.879> this<00:00:04.029> thing<00:00:05.009> just

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:06.009 
well I got bad news on this thing just

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.199 
well I got bad news on this thing just
discovered<00:00:06.610> a<00:00:07.410> coolant<00:00:08.410> leak<00:00:08.679> from<00:00:09.549> the<00:00:09.610> green

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:10.209 
discovered a coolant leak from the green

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:15.419 
discovered a coolant leak from the green
picture<00:00:10.749> tube<00:00:10.959> on<00:00:11.289> this<00:00:11.610> mitsubishi<00:00:12.610> TV<00:00:14.429> this

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:15.429 
picture tube on this mitsubishi TV this

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.340 
picture tube on this mitsubishi TV this
is<00:00:15.549> doesn't<00:00:15.759> buckle<00:00:16.029> even<00:00:16.570> get<00:00:16.810> on<00:00:16.960> the<00:00:17.080> green

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.350 
is doesn't buckle even get on the green

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.570 
is doesn't buckle even get on the green
board<00:00:18.990> instead<00:00:19.990> it<00:00:20.200> on<00:00:20.350> this<00:00:20.620> convergence

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
board instead it on this convergence

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.880 
board instead it on this convergence
board<00:00:22.050> you're<00:00:23.050> going<00:00:23.200> to<00:00:23.290> see<00:00:23.440> some<00:00:23.650> right

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
board you're going to see some right

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.810 
board you're going to see some right
there<00:00:24.210> get<00:00:25.210> over<00:00:25.510> here<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.980> just<00:00:27.460> started

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
there get over here it just started

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.399 
there get over here it just started
recently<00:00:28.830> seeing<00:00:29.830> us<00:00:29.920> some<00:00:30.100> more<00:00:30.250> over<00:00:30.400> there

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:31.409 
recently seeing us some more over there

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.739 
recently seeing us some more over there
so<00:00:32.409> it<00:00:32.949> didn't<00:00:33.280> get<00:00:33.399> on<00:00:33.579> the<00:00:33.609> underside<00:00:34.149> likely

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:34.749 
so it didn't get on the underside likely

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:37.799 
so it didn't get on the underside likely
but<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:36.070> actually<00:00:36.670> not<00:00:37.030> what<00:00:37.329> comes<00:00:37.600> to

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
but but actually not what comes to

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.130 
but but actually not what comes to
Stevie<00:00:38.230> to<00:00:38.409> original<00:00:38.980> and<00:00:39.190> died<00:00:39.429> I<00:00:40.140> am

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
Stevie to original and died I am

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.000 
Stevie to original and died I am
suspecting<00:00:42.629> that's<00:00:43.629> this<00:00:43.960> little<00:00:44.559> this

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
suspecting that's this little this

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.549 
suspecting that's this little this
little<00:00:45.969> thing<00:00:46.449> right<00:00:46.479> here<00:00:46.690> I<00:00:46.960> think<00:00:47.289> it's<00:00:47.409> a

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
little thing right here I think it's a

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.950 
little thing right here I think it's a
diode<00:00:48.190> rectifier<00:00:48.640> which<00:00:49.239> is<00:00:49.420> basically<00:00:49.839> a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
diode rectifier which is basically a

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.069 
diode rectifier which is basically a
voltage<00:00:50.440> regulator<00:00:50.829> I<00:00:51.659> think<00:00:52.659> that's<00:00:52.899> the

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
voltage regulator I think that's the

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.610 
voltage regulator I think that's the
faulty<00:00:53.620> part<00:00:53.889> it's<00:00:54.670> now<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:56.079> far<00:00:56.350> as<00:00:56.409> the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
faulty part it's now as far as the

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.349 
faulty part it's now as far as the
coolant<00:00:57.039> leak<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:58.329> just<00:00:58.839> started<00:00:59.589> like<00:01:00.359> it

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
coolant leak it just started like it

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.819 
coolant leak it just started like it
wasn't<00:01:01.690> like<00:01:01.809> this<00:01:01.989> when<00:01:02.049> I<00:01:02.260> first<00:01:02.469> brought<00:01:02.769> it

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
wasn't like this when I first brought it

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.460 
wasn't like this when I first brought it
here<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.809> because<00:01:05.290> showing<00:01:05.680> up<00:01:05.800> in<00:01:05.920> here<00:01:06.100> you

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
here but because showing up in here you

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.900 
here but because showing up in here you
can<00:01:08.470> kind<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:08.770> see<00:01:08.980> a<00:01:09.010> little<00:01:09.310> drop<00:01:09.640> right

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
can kind of see a little drop right

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.680 
can kind of see a little drop right
there<00:01:10.260> hanging<00:01:11.260> off<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.710> wired<00:01:12.420> sick<00:01:13.420> red

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
there hanging off the wired sick red

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.680 
there hanging off the wired sick red
wire<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.810> it<00:01:17.310> has<00:01:18.310> not<00:01:18.640> gotten<00:01:19.060> anywhere<00:01:19.420> else

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
wire so it has not gotten anywhere else

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.300 
wire so it has not gotten anywhere else
it<00:01:19.930> especially<00:01:20.440> hasn't<00:01:20.920> gotten<00:01:21.100> on<00:01:21.280> the

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
it especially hasn't gotten on the

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.520 
it especially hasn't gotten on the
screen<00:01:21.700> signal<00:01:22.240> board<00:01:22.480> which<00:01:22.750> is<00:01:22.900> a<00:01:22.930> very<00:01:23.350> good

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
screen signal board which is a very good

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.870 
screen signal board which is a very good
thing<00:01:25.260> so<00:01:26.260> I<00:01:26.320> have<00:01:26.740> slid<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.190> tray<00:01:27.370> out<00:01:27.550> as<00:01:27.670> far

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
thing so I have slid the tray out as far

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.310 
thing so I have slid the tray out as far
as<00:01:28.000> possible<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:30.630> no<00:01:31.630> more<00:01:31.780> coolest<00:01:32.170> should

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
as possible and no more coolest should

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.990 
as possible and no more coolest should
be<00:01:32.440> leaking<00:01:32.860> on<00:01:33.040> any<00:01:33.250> of<00:01:33.430> these<00:01:33.550> circuit

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
be leaking on any of these circuit

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.360 
be leaking on any of these circuit
boards<00:01:34.360> but<00:01:34.660> it<00:01:34.960> just<00:01:35.470> started<00:01:36.010> with<00:01:36.040> the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
boards but it just started with the

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.350 
boards but it just started with the
screen<00:01:36.730> picture<00:01:37.090> tube<00:01:37.420> right<00:01:37.720> here<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:40.060> I'm

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
screen picture tube right here so I'm

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.520 
screen picture tube right here so I'm
going<00:01:40.510> to<00:01:40.540> have<00:01:40.690> to<00:01:40.750> get<00:01:40.990> some<00:01:41.050> sort<00:01:41.290> of<00:01:41.380> like<00:01:41.500> a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
going to have to get some sort of like a

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.140 
going to have to get some sort of like a
drip<00:01:41.890> pan<00:01:42.160> or<00:01:42.370> something<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.790> catch<00:01:42.940> the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
drip pan or something to catch the

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.590 
drip pan or something to catch the
kitchen<00:01:43.810> more<00:01:43.990> coolant<00:01:45.270> cuz<00:01:46.270> then<00:01:46.390> I<00:01:46.450> think

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
kitchen more coolant cuz then I think

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.100 
kitchen more coolant cuz then I think
it's<00:01:46.690> going<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:46.900> stop<00:01:47.170> anytime<00:01:47.440> soon<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.750> so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
it's going to stop anytime soon but so

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.050 
it's going to stop anytime soon but so
far<00:01:50.320> it's<00:01:50.650> just<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:51.010> green<00:01:51.220> picture<00:01:51.610> tube<00:01:51.820> and

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
far it's just the green picture tube and

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.280 
far it's just the green picture tube and
nothing<00:01:52.450> else<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:57.090> back<00:01:58.090> to<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:58.390> convergence

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
nothing else so back to this convergence

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.350 
nothing else so back to this convergence
1<00:01:59.560> this<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.670> X<00:02:00.790> this<00:02:01.150> whole<00:02:02.909> section<00:02:03.909> right

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
1 this is X this whole section right

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.920 
1 this is X this whole section right
over<00:02:04.420> here<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.409> power<00:02:05.620> supply<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.930> then

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
over here is the power supply and then

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.750 
over here is the power supply and then
the<00:02:08.019> rest<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.350> you<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:08.530> this<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:10.330> convergence

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
the rest of you is this the convergence

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.940 
the rest of you is this the convergence
figured<00:02:13.299> out<00:02:13.390> what<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:14.140> thing<00:02:14.200> does<00:02:14.560> over

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
figured out what that thing does over

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.410 
figured out what that thing does over
there<00:02:17.939> but<00:02:18.939> this<00:02:19.650> right<00:02:20.650> here<00:02:20.709> i<00:02:21.310> believe<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:22.120> i

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
there but this right here i believe is i

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.490 
there but this right here i believe is i
believe<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:24.840> bad<00:02:25.840> part<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:29.140> probably

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
believe this is the bad part it probably

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.050 
believe this is the bad part it probably
won't<00:02:29.650> be<00:02:29.709> much<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:33.579> thing<00:02:33.819> doesn't

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
won't be much if this thing doesn't

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.710 
won't be much if this thing doesn't
start<00:02:34.209> working<00:02:34.780> after<00:02:36.120> after<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.269> replaced

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
start working after after I replaced

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.960 
start working after after I replaced
that<00:02:37.840> band<00:02:38.290> I'm<00:02:39.220> going<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.459> say<00:02:39.640> this<00:02:39.670> whole

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
that band I'm going to say this whole

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.190 
that band I'm going to say this whole
board<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.390> toast<00:02:41.909> because<00:02:42.909> of<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:43.209> coolant

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
board is toast because of this coolant
