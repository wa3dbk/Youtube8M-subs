hi my name is Mario anzalone and today
we're<00:00:09.170> going<00:00:09.380> for<00:00:09.650> a<00:00:09.710> walk<00:00:10.040> in<00:00:10.220> the<00:00:10.250> woods

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
we're going for a walk in the woods

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.910 
we're going for a walk in the woods
we're<00:00:10.940> in<00:00:11.210> Corson's<00:00:11.780> Brook<00:00:12.020> woods<00:00:12.260> and<00:00:12.530> Staten

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
we're in Corson's Brook woods and Staten

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.740 
we're in Corson's Brook woods and Staten
Island<00:00:13.250> and<00:00:13.490> there<00:00:14.180> are<00:00:14.270> lots<00:00:14.450> of<00:00:14.570> really

Island and there are lots of really

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.050 
Island and there are lots of really
beautiful<00:00:15.200> spring<00:00:15.470> ephemerals<00:00:15.710> here<00:00:16.250> so<00:00:16.880> we

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
beautiful spring ephemerals here so we

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.970 
beautiful spring ephemerals here so we
thought<00:00:17.240> we<00:00:17.450> would<00:00:17.480> walk<00:00:18.020> around<00:00:18.230> the<00:00:18.650> forest

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
thought we would walk around the forest

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.679 
thought we would walk around the forest
and<00:00:19.250> show<00:00:19.490> you<00:00:19.550> some<00:00:19.970> cool<00:00:20.150> plants<00:00:20.540> that<00:00:20.660> are

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
and show you some cool plants that are

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.790 
and show you some cool plants that are
in<00:00:20.810> flower<00:00:20.990> now<00:00:21.310> one<00:00:22.310> thing<00:00:22.340> that<00:00:22.550> we<00:00:22.759> have<00:00:22.970> is

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
in flower now one thing that we have is

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.889 
in flower now one thing that we have is
trout<00:00:24.800> Lily<00:00:25.070> if<00:00:25.369> you<00:00:25.669> can<00:00:25.849> kind<00:00:26.599> of<00:00:26.660> take<00:00:26.840> a

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:26.899 
trout Lily if you can kind of take a

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.920 
trout Lily if you can kind of take a
look<00:00:27.110> around<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:27.590> see<00:00:27.829> how<00:00:28.220> extensive<00:00:28.930> this

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
look around and see how extensive this

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.560 
look around and see how extensive this
particular<00:00:30.290> patch<00:00:30.710> is<00:00:31.130> a<00:00:31.460> lot<00:00:32.119> of<00:00:32.210> people<00:00:32.450> have

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
particular patch is a lot of people have

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.389 
particular patch is a lot of people have
this<00:00:32.660> idea<00:00:32.809> that<00:00:33.020> trees<00:00:33.410> are<00:00:33.620> very<00:00:33.649> old<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:34.280> of

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
this idea that trees are very old and of

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.210 
this idea that trees are very old and of
course<00:00:34.640> they<00:00:34.790> can<00:00:35.000> be<00:00:35.180> but<00:00:35.899> small<00:00:36.559> little<00:00:36.890> wild

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
course they can be but small little wild

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.740 
course they can be but small little wild
flowers<00:00:37.430> can<00:00:37.700> also<00:00:37.850> be<00:00:38.090> really<00:00:38.270> old<00:00:38.510> this

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
flowers can also be really old this

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.779 
flowers can also be really old this
particular<00:00:39.050> patch<00:00:39.469> could<00:00:39.800> be<00:00:39.949> hundreds<00:00:40.699> of

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
particular patch could be hundreds of

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.150 
particular patch could be hundreds of
years<00:00:40.850> old<00:00:41.210> these<00:00:41.719> plants<00:00:42.140> are<00:00:42.260> colonial<00:00:42.649> and

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
years old these plants are colonial and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.270 
years old these plants are colonial and
kind<00:00:43.760> of<00:00:43.879> grow<00:00:44.149> out<00:00:44.359> as<00:00:44.629> they<00:00:44.899> grow<00:00:45.079> older<00:00:45.280> so

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
kind of grow out as they grow older so

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.849 
kind of grow out as they grow older so
this<00:00:46.640> one<00:00:47.359> patch<00:00:47.600> could<00:00:47.960> all<00:00:48.079> be<00:00:48.260> one<00:00:48.530> single

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
this one patch could all be one single

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.279 
this one patch could all be one single
organism<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.239> on<00:00:50.510> some<00:00:50.719> of<00:00:50.809> these<00:00:50.960> trout

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
organism so on some of these trout

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:52.689 
organism so on some of these trout
lilies<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.800> anthers<00:00:52.160> are<00:00:52.309> different<00:00:52.579> colors

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
lilies the anthers are different colors

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.939 
lilies the anthers are different colors
the<00:00:53.269> anthers<00:00:53.629> are<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.140> male<00:00:54.320> parts<00:00:54.710> and

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
the anthers are the male parts and

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.340 
the anthers are the male parts and
they're<00:00:55.489> tan<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.749> we're<00:00:56.870> going<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.079> look<00:00:57.199> and

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
they're tan so we're going to look and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.450 
they're tan so we're going to look and
see<00:00:57.469> if<00:00:57.499> we<00:00:57.589> can<00:00:57.710> find<00:00:57.859> one<00:00:57.980> with<00:00:58.190> another

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
see if we can find one with another

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.270 
see if we can find one with another
color<00:00:58.699> on<00:00:58.940> it<00:00:59.109> the<00:01:00.109> anthers<00:01:00.409> on<00:01:00.589> this<00:01:00.769> one<00:01:01.010> are

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
color on it the anthers on this one are

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.160 
color on it the anthers on this one are
yellow<00:01:01.820> as<00:01:02.030> you<00:01:02.179> can<00:01:02.359> see<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:02.690> male<00:01:02.839> parts

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
yellow as you can see the male parts

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.229 
yellow as you can see the male parts
around<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.469> edge<00:01:03.589> that's<00:01:04.339> just<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.760> way<00:01:04.879> that

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
around the edge that's just a way that

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.780 
around the edge that's just a way that
you<00:01:05.269> can<00:01:05.480> note<00:01:05.690> that<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.470> there<00:01:07.159> is<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.490> lot<00:01:07.730> of

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
you can note that the there is a lot of

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.760 
you can note that the there is a lot of
genetic<00:01:08.270> diversity<00:01:08.390> in<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.050> population<00:01:09.470> when

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
genetic diversity in the population when

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.030 
genetic diversity in the population when
the<00:01:09.860> anthers<00:01:10.100> are<00:01:10.250> different<00:01:10.520> colors<00:01:12.040> this

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
the anthers are different colors this

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.469 
the anthers are different colors this
plan<00:01:13.250> also<00:01:13.399> has<00:01:13.640> really<00:01:13.880> pretty<00:01:14.030> modeled

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
plan also has really pretty modeled

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.660 
plan also has really pretty modeled
leaves<00:01:15.100> sometimes<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.250> leaves<00:01:16.430> have<00:01:16.549> a

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
leaves sometimes the leaves have a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.340 
leaves sometimes the leaves have a
little<00:01:16.970> bit<00:01:17.060> of<00:01:17.090> white<00:01:17.299> in<00:01:17.479> them<00:01:17.689> sometimes

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
little bit of white in them sometimes

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.109 
little bit of white in them sometimes
it's<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.530> little<00:01:18.560> bit<00:01:18.829> of<00:01:18.920> purple<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.579> that's

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
it's a little bit of purple and that's

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.310 
it's a little bit of purple and that's
why<00:01:20.240> it's<00:01:20.360> called<00:01:20.509> trout<00:01:20.780> Lily<00:01:21.049> because

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
why it's called trout Lily because

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.660 
why it's called trout Lily because
people<00:01:21.619> felt<00:01:21.860> that<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.070> leaves<00:01:22.310> were<00:01:22.520> the

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
people felt that the leaves were the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.240 
people felt that the leaves were the
same<00:01:22.909> shape<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.450> coloration<00:01:24.140> as<00:01:24.320> trout<00:01:24.590> this

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
same shape and coloration as trout this

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.010

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
plant here is called spring beauty

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.870 
plant here is called spring beauty
spring<00:01:27.829> beauty<00:01:28.100> is<00:01:28.189> another<00:01:28.430> one<00:01:28.640> of<00:01:28.670> our

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
spring beauty is another one of our

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.880 
spring beauty is another one of our
spring<00:01:29.329> wildflowers<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.469> has<00:01:30.619> a<00:01:30.649> really

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
spring wildflowers that has a really

spring wildflowers that has a really
short<00:01:31.180> timeframe<00:01:32.350> all<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.560> our<00:01:33.710> spring

short timeframe all of our spring
ephemerals<00:01:34.369> they're<00:01:34.880> called<00:01:35.090> ephemeral

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
ephemerals they're called ephemeral

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.359 
ephemerals they're called ephemeral
because<00:01:35.750> they<00:01:35.869> don't<00:01:36.020> last<00:01:36.170> very<00:01:36.350> long<00:01:36.590> but

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
because they don't last very long but

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.350 
because they don't last very long but
it's<00:01:37.670> important<00:01:38.119> that<00:01:38.240> they're

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
it's important that they're

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.359 
it's important that they're
photosynthesize<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.289> lot<00:01:39.649> so<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.250> they're

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
photosynthesize a lot so that they're

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.550 
photosynthesize a lot so that they're
