as<00:06:09.009> you<00:06:09.159> guys<00:06:09.340> can<00:06:09.610> see<00:06:09.669> it's<00:06:10.180> on<00:06:10.449> one<00:06:10.810> cutout

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
as you guys can see it's on one cutout

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.670 
as you guys can see it's on one cutout
and<00:06:11.819> expose<00:06:12.819> that<00:06:12.849> the<00:06:13.360> camera<00:06:13.810> with<00:06:14.110> a<00:06:14.319> heart

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
and expose that the camera with a heart

protection<00:06:19.870> let's<00:06:20.349> see<00:06:20.589> right<00:06:20.620> here<00:06:20.979> looks

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
protection let's see right here looks

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.959 
protection let's see right here looks
like<00:06:21.719> become<00:06:22.719> a<00:06:22.750> kind<00:06:23.199> kind<00:06:23.589> of<00:06:23.740> seats<00:06:24.250> inside

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:24.969 
like become a kind kind of seats inside

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:29.279 
like become a kind kind of seats inside
of<00:06:25.120> the<00:06:25.210> case<00:06:26.339> so<00:06:27.449> there<00:06:28.449> is<00:06:28.569> a<00:06:28.599> little<00:06:28.990> bit<00:06:29.199> of

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.289 
of the case so there is a little bit of

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:29.850 
of the case so there is a little bit of
protection

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
protection

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.909 
protection
I<00:06:29.979> wouldn't<00:06:30.310> say<00:06:30.520> completely<00:06:31.050> protected<00:06:32.050> but

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
I wouldn't say completely protected but

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.269 
I wouldn't say completely protected but
it<00:06:33.039> cannot<00:06:33.250> sit<00:06:33.580> inside<00:06:34.379> so<00:06:35.379> let's<00:06:35.589> widen<00:06:35.770> test

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:36.279 
it cannot sit inside so let's widen test

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:39.540 
it cannot sit inside so let's widen test
here<00:06:36.669> the<00:06:37.029> responsiveness<00:06:37.990> of<00:06:38.469> the<00:06:38.529> power<00:06:39.190> and

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
here the responsiveness of the power and

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.240 
here the responsiveness of the power and
volume<00:06:39.759> rocker<00:06:40.409> I'm<00:06:41.409> not<00:06:41.680> going<00:06:41.949> to<00:06:42.009> be<00:06:42.129> able

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
volume rocker I'm not going to be able

look<00:07:16.839> at<00:07:16.960> the<00:07:17.080> signal<00:07:17.560> I<00:07:17.680> don't<00:07:17.889> think<00:07:18.069> the

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:18.159 
look at the signal I don't think the

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:20.100 
look at the signal I don't think the
signal<00:07:18.520> is<00:07:18.639> affected<00:07:19.240> at<00:07:19.419> all<00:07:19.449> so<00:07:19.839> farm

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110 
signal is affected at all so farm

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.980 
signal is affected at all so farm
showing<00:07:20.500> right<00:07:20.710> there<00:07:20.740> three<00:07:21.490> bars<00:07:21.839> so<00:07:22.839> it

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
showing right there three bars so it

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.339 
showing right there three bars so it
should<00:07:23.199> be<00:07:23.229> fine

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:25.349 
should be fine
