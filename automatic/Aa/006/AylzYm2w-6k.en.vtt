of every man or every boy a thing I

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.680 
of every man or every boy a thing I
certainly<00:01:00.220> when<00:01:00.369> I<00:01:00.400> read<00:01:00.640> it<00:01:00.820> growing<00:01:01.540> up

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
certainly when I read it growing up

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.479 
certainly when I read it growing up
really<00:01:02.350> empathize<00:01:02.710> with<00:01:02.769> him<00:01:03.129> as<00:01:03.220> a<00:01:03.280> character

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
really empathize with him as a character

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.969 
really empathize with him as a character
everything<00:01:04.210> he<00:01:04.299> was<00:01:04.390> going<00:01:04.449> through<00:01:04.900> I'd<00:01:05.290> turn

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
everything he was going through I'd turn

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.950 
everything he was going through I'd turn
every<00:01:06.220> page<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.670> go<00:01:06.760> this<00:01:07.030> is<00:01:07.240> well<00:01:07.750> not

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
every page and go this is well not

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.109 
every page and go this is well not
exactly<00:01:08.290> like<00:01:08.500> my<00:01:08.770> life<00:01:08.950> but<00:01:09.369> there's<00:01:09.880> so<00:01:10.060> many

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
exactly like my life but there's so many

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.270 
exactly like my life but there's so many
similarities<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:11.140> I<00:01:11.200> think<00:01:11.409> everyone<00:01:11.829> can

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
similarities and I think everyone can

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.639 
similarities and I think everyone can
empathize<00:01:13.090> with<00:01:13.149> that<00:01:13.420> idea<00:01:13.780> not<00:01:14.409> quite

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
empathize with that idea not quite

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.499 
empathize with that idea not quite
fitting<00:01:15.070> in<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:15.700> looking<00:01:15.909> at<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.329> the

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
fitting in and looking at the the

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.760 
fitting in and looking at the the
environment<00:01:16.990> around<00:01:17.049> you<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:17.469> going<00:01:17.619> this

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
environment around you and going this

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.520 
environment around you and going this
doesn't<00:01:17.920> quite<00:01:18.609> sort<00:01:19.390> of<00:01:19.479> work<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.229> I<00:01:20.350> think

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
doesn't quite sort of work and I think

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.690 
doesn't quite sort of work and I think
it's<00:01:20.679> part<00:01:20.890> of<00:01:20.950> growing<00:01:21.219> up<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.369> being<00:01:21.609> a

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
it's part of growing up and being a

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.880 
it's part of growing up and being a
teenager<00:01:22.090> so<00:01:22.659> following<00:01:23.109> his<00:01:23.350> journey<00:01:23.679> and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
teenager so following his journey and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.469 
teenager so following his journey and
following<00:01:24.250> his<00:01:24.399> story<00:01:24.670> I<00:01:25.060> think<00:01:25.149> it's

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
following his story I think it's

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.730 
following his story I think it's
something<00:01:25.719> that<00:01:26.049> everybody<00:01:26.320> who's<00:01:26.590> gonna
