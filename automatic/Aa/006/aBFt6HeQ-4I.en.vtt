00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
like a drawing and all I'm doing is just

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.119 
like a drawing and all I'm doing is just
clicking<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.230> little<00:03:34.440> button<00:03:34.709> in<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:34.950> fun

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129

filters<00:03:35.639> thing<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.510> one<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.989> distortion

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.120 

and<00:03:46.900> this<00:03:47.140> one<00:03:47.320> makes<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:47.680> look<00:03:47.860> like<00:03:48.100> a

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
and this one makes it look like a

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.580 
and this one makes it look like a
drawing

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.009 

remember<00:03:52.550> I've<00:03:52.700> also<00:03:52.910> adjusted<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.660> colors

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
remember I've also adjusted the colors

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.460 
remember I've also adjusted the colors
so<00:03:54.379> it<00:03:55.360> looks<00:03:56.360> a<00:03:56.480> little<00:03:56.629> bit<00:03:56.840> strange<00:03:57.140> anyway

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
so it looks a little bit strange anyway

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.759
