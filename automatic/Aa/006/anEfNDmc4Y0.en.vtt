00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.800
 long 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.629
 because we are here all the time 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.860
 that too exaggeratedly said 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.649
 bit of home to come so 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.910
 knows everything from the same then the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.949
 theoretical highlight because we look 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.460
 then you would like to watch if you 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.460
 the time would 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.230
 quite cool super job on earth 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.670
 whole repertoire is timeless you know 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.009
 We build on the text just a small 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.079
 but these are in 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.149
 self-contained flush stories 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.890
 and if you like them then you go to 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.899
 all glorious and glue and stay 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.210
 but the celebration also sticks to it 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.750
 beautiful we were already out of the trend as 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.750
 we started 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.680
