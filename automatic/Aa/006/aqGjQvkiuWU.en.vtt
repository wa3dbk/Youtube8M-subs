00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
scallops as much as possible so these

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.629 
scallops as much as possible so these
have<00:03:12.260> actually<00:03:12.590> been<00:03:12.709> on<00:03:12.769> paper<00:03:13.099> towel<00:03:13.370> for

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
have actually been on paper towel for

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.220 
have actually been on paper towel for
about<00:03:13.790> six<00:03:14.030> hours<00:03:14.180> now<00:03:14.569> you<00:03:14.780> want<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.019> try<00:03:15.139> and

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
about six hours now you want to try and

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.780 
about six hours now you want to try and
suck<00:03:15.379> out<00:03:15.500> every<00:03:15.680> ounce<00:03:15.919> of<00:03:16.129> moisture<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.609> can

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
suck out every ounce of moisture you can

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.670 
suck out every ounce of moisture you can
out<00:03:16.939> of<00:03:17.030> your<00:03:17.120> scallop<00:03:17.569> when<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.019> do<00:03:18.200> this<00:03:18.409> you

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
out of your scallop when you do this you

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.619 
out of your scallop when you do this you

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
actually end up with scallops that will

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.479 
actually end up with scallops that will
cook<00:03:20.810> way<00:03:21.079> better<00:03:21.349> the<00:03:21.919> other<00:03:22.069> thing<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.280> want

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489

to look for with your scallops is this

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.530 
to look for with your scallops is this
muscle<00:03:25.310> on<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.579> end<00:03:25.760> this<00:03:26.060> is<00:03:26.180> actually<00:03:26.479> where

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
muscle on the end this is actually where

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.420 
muscle on the end this is actually where
the<00:03:26.659> scallop<00:03:27.019> attaches<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.949> shell<00:03:28.220> and

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
the scallop attaches to the shell and

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.509 
the scallop attaches to the shell and
this<00:03:29.329> is<00:03:29.510> what<00:03:29.750> is<00:03:30.319> really<00:03:30.620> rubbery<00:03:30.889> and<00:03:31.159> chewy

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519
