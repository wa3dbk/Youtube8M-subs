00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.140 
and this segment want to talk about how
to<00:00:05.790> grow<00:00:06.180> daylilies<00:00:06.930> in<00:00:07.080> oregon<00:00:07.589> now<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.610> grew

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
to grow daylilies in oregon now I grew

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.690 
to grow daylilies in oregon now I grew
up<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.540> estacada<00:00:10.019> near<00:00:10.349> Mount<00:00:10.559> Hood<00:00:10.800> so<00:00:11.519> I'm

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
up in estacada near Mount Hood so I'm

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.850 
up in estacada near Mount Hood so I'm
very<00:00:11.730> familiar<00:00:12.330> with<00:00:12.750> growing<00:00:13.320> flowers<00:00:13.530> in

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
very familiar with growing flowers in

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.400 
very familiar with growing flowers in
Oregon<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.549> we<00:00:15.210> live<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.690> very<00:00:15.929> mild

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
Oregon and we live in a very mild

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.250 
Oregon and we live in a very mild
climate<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.340> we're<00:00:18.240> exactly<00:00:18.720> halfway

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
climate and we're exactly halfway

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.470 
climate and we're exactly halfway
between<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:20.100> equator<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:20.939> North<00:00:21.060> Pole

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
between the equator and the North Pole

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.580 
between the equator and the North Pole
so<00:00:22.109> right<00:00:22.350> at<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.619> 54<00:00:23.220> 45<00:00:24.000> degree<00:00:24.590> latitude

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
so right at that 54 45 degree latitude

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.490 
so right at that 54 45 degree latitude
which<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.640> wonderful<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.420> plants<00:00:28.050> because<00:00:28.349> we

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
which is wonderful for plants because we

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.950 
which is wonderful for plants because we
have<00:00:28.710> perfect<00:00:29.189> seasons<00:00:29.689> exactly<00:00:30.689> three

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
have perfect seasons exactly three

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.930 
have perfect seasons exactly three
months<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.349> summer<00:00:31.529> three<00:00:31.920> months<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.399> winter

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
months of summer three months of winter

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.420 
months of summer three months of winter
and<00:00:33.120> three<00:00:33.540> months<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.870> fall<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.350> spring<00:00:34.500> so

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
and three months of fall and spring so

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.420 
and three months of fall and spring so
we<00:00:36.329> are<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.200> lucky<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.800> plant<00:00:38.040> pretty<00:00:38.280> much

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
we are so lucky we can plant pretty much

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.459 
we are so lucky we can plant pretty much
anything<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.149> our<00:00:39.300> garden<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.870> it'll<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.230> well

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
anything in our garden and it'll do well

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.549 
anything in our garden and it'll do well
especially<00:00:41.370> day<00:00:41.850> lilies<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.170> trick<00:00:43.379> with

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
especially day lilies so the trick with

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.529 
especially day lilies so the trick with
day<00:00:43.739> lilies<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.370> plan<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.879> any<00:00:45.059> time<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
day lilies is plan on any time of the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.150 
day lilies is plan on any time of the
year<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:46.020> Oregon<00:00:46.410> because<00:00:46.590> they<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.890> survive

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
year in Oregon because they can survive

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.500 
year in Oregon because they can survive
the<00:00:47.340> winter<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.850> doesn't<00:00:48.180> matter<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.390> you

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the winter so it doesn't matter if you

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.000 
the winter so it doesn't matter if you
plant<00:00:48.780> them<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> middle<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.890> winter

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
plant them in the middle of winter

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.799 
plant them in the middle of winter
they'll<00:00:50.399> still<00:00:50.640> come<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.300> really<00:00:51.660> well

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
they'll still come up and do really well

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.139 
they'll still come up and do really well
but<00:00:52.559> they're<00:00:52.770> mostly<00:00:53.100> sold<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> spring

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
but they're mostly sold in the spring

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.689 
but they're mostly sold in the spring
either<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.260> container<00:00:55.680> growing<00:00:56.190> or<00:00:56.399> by<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
either in a container growing or by the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.720 
either in a container growing or by the
bare<00:00:57.059> root<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.469> time<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> spring

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
bare root and at that time in the spring

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.910 
bare root and at that time in the spring
plant<00:01:00.210> them<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.539> sunny<00:01:00.899> spot<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.530> your<00:01:01.710> yard

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
plant them in a sunny spot in your yard

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.600 
plant them in a sunny spot in your yard
so<00:01:02.820> day<00:01:03.090> lilies<00:01:03.449> are<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.870> root<00:01:04.140> and

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
so day lilies are just a root and

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.070 
so day lilies are just a root and
they're<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.030> true<00:01:06.330> bulb<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.930> they

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
they're not a true bulb because they

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.140 
they're not a true bulb because they
come<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.560> root<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.340> they've<00:01:08.670> got<00:01:08.790> lots<00:01:08.970> of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
come as a root and they've got lots of

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.850 
come as a root and they've got lots of
greeneries<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> blooms<00:01:10.409> come<00:01:10.710> up

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
greeneries and then the blooms come up

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.679 
greeneries and then the blooms come up
in<00:01:11.040> bloom<00:01:11.250> all<00:01:11.400> summer<00:01:11.430> long<00:01:11.760> they're<00:01:12.540> not

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
in bloom all summer long they're not

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.210 
in bloom all summer long they're not
used<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> cut<00:01:13.409> flower<00:01:13.530> too<00:01:13.890> much<00:01:14.070> because

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
used as a cut flower too much because

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.640 
used as a cut flower too much because
they<00:01:14.400> don't<00:01:14.580> last<00:01:14.760> as<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> cut<00:01:15.479> flower<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.439> as

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
they don't last as a cut flower so as

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.039 
they don't last as a cut flower so as
long<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.460> root<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.939> covered<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.750> green

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
long as the root is covered in the green

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.910 
long as the root is covered in the green
is<00:01:19.380> exposed<00:01:20.150> it'll<00:01:21.150> grow<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.409> make<00:01:22.619> sure

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
is exposed it'll grow so just make sure

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.149 
is exposed it'll grow so just make sure
that<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.580> roof<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.150> covered<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
that the roof is covered and I like to

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.039 
that the roof is covered and I like to
actually<00:01:26.340> kind<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.000> clump<00:01:27.360> up<00:01:27.570> my<00:01:27.780> roots

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
actually kind of clump up my roots

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.990 
actually kind of clump up my roots
because<00:01:28.500> they<00:01:28.680> need<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.100> crowded<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> bloom

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
because they need to be crowded to bloom

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.999 
because they need to be crowded to bloom
so<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:30.930> almost<00:01:31.079> better<00:01:31.409> instead<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.890> just

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
so it's almost better instead of just

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.620 
so it's almost better instead of just
planning<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.759> should<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.030> three<00:01:33.270> or<00:01:33.390> four

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
planning one I should have three or four

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.109 
planning one I should have three or four
together<00:01:33.979> clumped<00:01:34.979> because<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.700> will<00:01:35.850> get

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
together clumped because that will get

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.609 
together clumped because that will get
more<00:01:36.299> blooms<00:01:36.540> right<00:01:36.900> away<00:01:37.110> next<00:01:37.350> summer

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
more blooms right away next summer

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.289 
more blooms right away next summer
because<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.340> by<00:01:38.520> itself<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.970> probably<00:01:39.150> won't

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
because one by itself I probably won't

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.480 
because one by itself I probably won't
get<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> lot<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> blooms<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.259> first<00:01:40.470> year<00:01:40.740> but

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
get a lot of blooms the first year but

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.399 
get a lot of blooms the first year but
they<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.729> multiply<00:01:42.450> quickly<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.110> over<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
they do multiply quickly and over the
