00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.190 
have it here so i'm gonna go and find
some<00:02:03.709> cave<00:02:03.979> there's<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.369> mine<00:02:04.700> shaft<00:02:04.959> not<00:02:05.959> mine

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
some cave there's a mine shaft not mine

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.639 
some cave there's a mine shaft not mine
chapter<00:02:06.770> but<00:02:07.009> mine<00:02:07.840> mine<00:02:08.840> shaft<00:02:09.170> down<00:02:09.349> there

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
chapter but mine mine shaft down there

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.309 
chapter but mine mine shaft down there
so<00:02:10.039> let's<00:02:10.759> go<00:02:10.940> down<00:02:11.180> there<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.450> I'm<00:02:12.140> going<00:02:12.260> to

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
so let's go down there and I'm going to

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.569 
so let's go down there and I'm going to
show<00:02:12.379> you<00:02:12.650> something<00:02:13.010> really<00:02:13.130> cool<00:02:13.370> actually

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
show you something really cool actually

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:18.009 
show you something really cool actually
there<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:14.030> there<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:16.090> cave<00:02:17.090> over<00:02:17.390> here<00:02:17.720> cave

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
there is there is a cave over here cave

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.830 
there is there is a cave over here cave
system<00:02:18.440> smooth<00:02:18.709> gonna<00:02:19.010> go<00:02:19.340> in<00:02:19.519> there<00:02:19.720> there<00:02:20.720> we

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
system smooth gonna go in there there we

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.020 
system smooth gonna go in there there we
go<00:02:20.989> so<00:02:21.319> this<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.160> cave<00:02:22.489> system<00:02:22.910> that

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
go so this is a cave system that

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.240 
go so this is a cave system that
actually<00:02:23.180> looks<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:24.319> is<00:02:24.440> how<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.680> looks<00:02:24.709> with

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
actually looks this is how it looks with

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.280 
actually looks this is how it looks with
the<00:02:25.310> regular<00:02:26.209> this<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:26.900> how<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.049> regular

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
the regular this is how the regular

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.610 
the regular this is how the regular
system<00:02:28.069> works<00:02:28.430> but<00:02:28.880> if<00:02:29.239> we<00:02:29.510> press<00:02:29.900> an<00:02:30.110> L<00:02:30.380> button

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
system works but if we press an L button

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.550 
system works but if we press an L button
on<00:02:30.920> my<00:02:31.010> keyboard<00:02:31.630> look<00:02:32.630> at<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.900> just<00:02:33.319> like<00:02:33.440> I

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
on my keyboard look at that just like I

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.979 
on my keyboard look at that just like I
have<00:02:33.739> everything<00:02:34.430> with<00:02:34.819> a<00:02:34.900> surrounded<00:02:35.900> by

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
have everything with a surrounded by

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.229 
have everything with a surrounded by
torches<00:02:36.470> even<00:02:36.799> if<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.010> don't<00:02:37.069> well<00:02:37.910> I'm<00:02:38.150> gonna

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
torches even if I don't well I'm gonna

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.449 
torches even if I don't well I'm gonna
go<00:02:38.390> even<00:02:38.870> deeper<00:02:39.670> there<00:02:40.670> we<00:02:40.819> go<00:02:40.970> oh<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:43.040> didn't

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
go even deeper there we go oh I didn't

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.759 
go even deeper there we go oh I didn't
saw<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:43.849> so<00:02:44.390> basically<00:02:44.840> even<00:02:45.290> if<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.530> want

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
saw that so basically even if you want

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.940 
saw that so basically even if you want
to<00:02:46.609> make<00:02:46.850> your<00:02:47.269> brightness<00:02:47.750> even<00:02:48.019> bigger<00:02:48.560> what

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
to make your brightness even bigger what

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.740 
to make your brightness even bigger what
we're<00:02:49.069> gonna<00:02:49.250> do<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:49.700> go<00:02:49.819> to<00:02:49.880> options<00:02:50.480> and

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
we're gonna do you go to options and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.259 
we're gonna do you go to options and
video<00:02:51.170> settings<00:02:51.560> go<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.190> smooth<00:02:52.670> gliding<00:02:52.970> in

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
video settings go to smooth gliding in

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.809 
video settings go to smooth gliding in
this<00:02:53.389> smooth<00:02:53.660> sliding<00:02:53.930> if<00:02:54.230> it's<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:55.069> minimum<00:02:55.670> or

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
this smooth sliding if it's a minimum or

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.640 
this smooth sliding if it's a minimum or
maximum<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.600> brightness<00:02:57.049> will<00:02:57.200> be<00:02:57.319> really

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
maximum the brightness will be really

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.949 
maximum the brightness will be really
good<00:02:57.680> but<00:02:58.100> if<00:02:58.220> it's<00:02:58.400> off<00:02:58.579> well<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.690> will<00:02:59.780> be

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
good but if it's off well it will be

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.509 
good but if it's off well it will be
much<00:03:00.170> different<00:03:00.620> as<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:00.799> can<00:03:00.950> see<00:03:01.130> it's<00:03:01.250> much

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
much different as you can see it's much

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.479 
much different as you can see it's much
the<00:03:01.579> brightness<00:03:02.239> is<00:03:02.359> much<00:03:02.540> lower<00:03:02.889> and<00:03:03.889> if<00:03:04.310> I

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
the brightness is much lower and if I

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.509 
the brightness is much lower and if I
set<00:03:04.670> it<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.790> minimum<00:03:05.209> here<00:03:05.480> or<00:03:05.930> maximum<00:03:06.519> there

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
set it to minimum here or maximum there

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.250 
set it to minimum here or maximum there
we<00:03:07.609> go<00:03:07.730> since<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:08.209> much<00:03:08.510> brighter<00:03:08.810> it's<00:03:09.049> much

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
we go since it's much brighter it's much

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.690 
we go since it's much brighter it's much
better<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:10.010> that's<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.280> pretty<00:03:10.430> cool<00:03:10.670> thing

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
better so that's a pretty cool thing

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.789 
better so that's a pretty cool thing
that<00:03:11.420> even<00:03:11.750> if<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:11.959> forget<00:03:12.260> some<00:03:12.500> torches

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
that even if you forget some torches

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
pretty good feature to this mod so yeah

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.920 
pretty good feature to this mod so yeah
all<00:03:18.560> right<00:03:18.739> I'm<00:03:18.859> gonna<00:03:18.920> go<00:03:19.099> back<00:03:19.310> up<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:19.930> also

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
all right I'm gonna go back up and also

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.870 
all right I'm gonna go back up and also
yeah<00:03:21.590> it's<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.799> real<00:03:21.950> bit<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.190> little<00:03:22.370> bit<00:03:22.579> buggy

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
yeah it's a real bit a little bit buggy

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.909 
yeah it's a real bit a little bit buggy
whip<00:03:23.150> did<00:03:23.329> with<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.959> grass<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.530> can<00:03:24.590> see<00:03:24.799> it's

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
whip did with the grass you can see it's

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.350 
whip did with the grass you can see it's
kind<00:03:25.099> of<00:03:25.190> black<00:03:25.970> but<00:03:26.299> it's<00:03:26.540> not<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:26.720> big<00:03:26.959> deal

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
kind of black but it's not a big deal

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.750 
kind of black but it's not a big deal
anyways<00:03:29.920> also<00:03:30.920> this<00:03:31.040> pretty<00:03:31.340> cool<00:03:31.489> thing<00:03:31.730> is

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
anyways also this pretty cool thing is

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.150 
anyways also this pretty cool thing is
that<00:03:31.970> if<00:03:32.209> you<00:03:32.300> press<00:03:32.599> C<00:03:33.110> on<00:03:33.379> your<00:03:33.590> button<00:03:33.950> on

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
that if you press C on your button on

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.009 
that if you press C on your button on
your<00:03:34.400> button<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:34.910> your<00:03:35.000> keyboard<00:03:35.209> you're

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
your button on your keyboard you're

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.410 
your button on your keyboard you're
going<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.349> get<00:03:36.470> those<00:03:36.819> coordinates<00:03:37.819> on<00:03:38.330> the

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
going to get those coordinates on the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.360 
going to get those coordinates on the
top<00:03:38.690> left<00:03:39.470> corner<00:03:39.620> as<00:03:40.160> in<00:03:40.370> CX<00:03:41.230> set<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.500> epsilon

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
top left corner as in CX set and epsilon

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.490 
top left corner as in CX set and epsilon
so<00:03:43.640> as<00:03:44.000> it<00:03:44.630> see<00:03:44.840> it's<00:03:44.989> a<00:03:45.050> pretty<00:03:45.080> cool<00:03:45.440> thing

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
so as it see it's a pretty cool thing

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.500 
so as it see it's a pretty cool thing
you<00:03:45.920> don't<00:03:46.040> need<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.310> switch<00:03:46.580> to<00:03:46.819> F<00:03:46.970> cream<00:03:47.330> on
