00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.490 
silver
phased<00:01:31.780> ones<00:01:32.110> which<00:01:32.290> are<00:01:32.380> really

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
phased ones which are really

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.760 
phased ones which are really
cool-looking<00:01:32.830> and<00:01:34.110> by<00:01:35.110> even<00:01:35.320> by<00:01:35.439> different

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
cool-looking and by even by different

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.800 
cool-looking and by even by different
locale<00:01:36.100> ones<00:01:36.490> they're<00:01:36.700> just<00:01:36.970> their<00:01:37.150> colors<00:01:37.540> do

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
locale ones they're just their colors do

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.990 
locale ones they're just their colors do
vary<00:01:38.080> a<00:01:38.260> lot<00:01:38.439> and<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:38.710> I've<00:01:39.100> seen<00:01:39.340> green<00:01:39.610> ones

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
vary a lot and so I've seen green ones

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.350 
vary a lot and so I've seen green ones
which<00:01:40.450> I'd<00:01:40.630> really<00:01:40.930> like<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.290> get<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.820> there's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
which I'd really like to get and there's

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.440 
which I'd really like to get and there's
even<00:01:43.570> albinos<00:01:44.110> I<00:01:44.549> think<00:01:45.549> Tom<00:01:45.759> Crutchfield<00:01:46.270> had

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
even albinos I think Tom Crutchfield had

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.700 
even albinos I think Tom Crutchfield had
some<00:01:46.689> of<00:01:46.780> them<00:01:46.900> I<00:01:47.049> saw<00:01:47.229> they're<00:01:47.500> really

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
some of them I saw they're really

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.060 
some of them I saw they're really
expensive<00:01:48.009> but<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:50.229> know<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.470> more<00:01:50.680> morph<00:01:50.950> so

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
expensive but you know the more morph so

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.620 
expensive but you know the more morph so
these<00:01:51.159> are<00:01:51.369> popping<00:01:51.729> up<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:52.360> think<00:01:52.570> the

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
these are popping up and I think the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.120 
these are popping up and I think the
popularity<00:01:53.049> really<00:01:53.439> should<00:01:53.619> go<00:01:53.740> up<00:01:53.860> on<00:01:54.009> these

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
popularity really should go up on these

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.499 
popularity really should go up on these
because<00:01:54.280> these<00:01:54.460> are<00:01:54.520> just<00:01:54.790> really<00:01:55.090> awesome

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
because these are just really awesome

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.950 
because these are just really awesome
snakes<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:58.119> can<00:01:58.150> see<00:01:58.360> they're<00:01:58.509> not<00:01:58.600> bad<00:01:58.810> and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
snakes you can see they're not bad and

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.950 
snakes you can see they're not bad and
not<00:01:59.049> really<00:01:59.290> aggressive<00:01:59.740> or<00:01:59.860> anything<00:02:00.040> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
not really aggressive or anything and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.700 
not really aggressive or anything and

the silver ones are nice too which is

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.340 
the silver ones are nice too which is
what<00:03:52.940> this<00:03:53.030> guy's<00:03:53.270> he's<00:03:53.510> had<00:03:53.720> four<00:03:53.930> silver<00:03:54.140> so

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
what this guy's he's had four silver so

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.590 
what this guy's he's had four silver so
if<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.470> get<00:03:54.620> another<00:03:54.770> hat<00:03:54.980> for<00:03:55.160> silver<00:03:55.520> and<00:03:55.730> I

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
could potentially proof Silver's but

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.720 
could potentially proof Silver's but
probably<00:03:58.700> just<00:03:58.850> get<00:03:59.030> one<00:04:03.130> it's<00:04:04.130> really<00:04:04.520> really
