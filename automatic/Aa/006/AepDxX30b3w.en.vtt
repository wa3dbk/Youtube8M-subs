know one point to one point for
something<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.810> keep<00:01:34.020> doing

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
something like that if I keep doing

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.219 
something like that if I keep doing
really<00:01:34.530> well<00:01:34.820> have<00:01:35.820> nineteen<00:01:36.299> thousand<00:01:36.869> five

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
really well have nineteen thousand five

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.499 
really well have nineteen thousand five
hundred<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.799> sixty<00:01:38.400> eight<00:01:38.610> kills<00:01:39.030> which<00:01:39.299> is

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
hundred and sixty eight kills which is

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.789 
hundred and sixty eight kills which is
pretty<00:01:39.960> good<00:01:40.500> average<00:01:41.400> kills<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.090> game<00:01:42.270> 18<00:01:42.799> it

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
pretty good average kills a game 18 it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.670 
pretty good average kills a game 18 it
should<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.490> more<00:01:44.670> than<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.380> maybe<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:46.590> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
should be more than that maybe because I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.230 
should be more than that maybe because I
back<00:01:46.890> out<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.250> many<00:01:47.399> games<00:01:47.640> when<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> have

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
back out of so many games when I have

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.359 
back out of so many games when I have
like<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.630> killer<00:01:48.930> two<00:01:49.170> kills<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.799> usually<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
like one killer two kills but usually I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.510 
like one killer two kills but usually I
you<00:01:50.880> know<00:01:51.000> average<00:01:51.509> around<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.049> good<00:01:52.500> 30<00:01:53.100> kills

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
you know average around a good 30 kills

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.090 
you know average around a good 30 kills
or<00:01:53.970> more<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.869> domination<00:01:55.409> game<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.979> then

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
or more in a domination game and then

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.859 
or more in a domination game and then
team<00:01:56.340> deathmatch<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:56.939> that's<00:01:57.600> probably

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
team deathmatch like that's probably

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.980 
team deathmatch like that's probably
right<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.350> team<00:01:58.530> deathmatch<00:01:59.990> accuracy

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
right for like team deathmatch accuracy

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.300 
right for like team deathmatch accuracy
fifty<00:02:01.439> five<00:02:01.710> percent

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
fifty five percent

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.980 
fifty five percent
only<00:02:04.310> use<00:02:04.400> a<00:02:04.430> sniper<00:02:04.759> man<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.390> haven't<00:02:05.780> really

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
only use a sniper man I haven't really

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.249 
only use a sniper man I haven't really
uh<00:02:06.189> you<00:02:07.189> know<00:02:07.310> use<00:02:07.520> any<00:02:07.759> of<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.030> other<00:02:08.259> weapons

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
uh you know use any of the other weapons

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.589 
uh you know use any of the other weapons
not<00:02:09.560> really<00:02:09.800> interested<00:02:10.310> Josie's<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.239> sniper

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
not really interested Josie's a sniper

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.220 
not really interested Josie's a sniper
so<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:11.870> do<00:02:11.989> have<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.349> really<00:02:12.709> high<00:02:12.890> accuracy

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230
