 one of all the games that takes 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.949
 his heels of 2013 there is only one that goes 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.109

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.970
 It is fun 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.270
 they do not take away enough rpg elements that 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.460
 I had previously I want to do more 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.850
 with frank sun monetize for people 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.500

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.610
 will play a lot for the subject say 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.440
 well let's see normally of idea 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:26.260
 we are going to regret what the 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:29.740
 contrary to what the game water 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.500
 of aldecoa had strong and good friend 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.080
 mediate 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.480
 I thought the story was very good 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.750
 develops as it advances the turns of 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.490
 nut that you are giving incredible and I 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.010
 I 'm still entering the dlc now see 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.070
 how do you think about what happened with the 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.869
 final everything says final they are interspersed 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.869
 post this saying it ends up confusing 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.610
 good 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.610
 Well this 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.149
 good but if we go back to the best 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.010
 2013 games you have to name a game 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.610
 because we have an era of consoles 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.100
 that mario maya write word is a game 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.080
 of 2003 platforms not only for 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.170
 its 3d format but also what can 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.210
 play 4 by moving through the world of 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.940
 the shoulders is this time comment a 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.980
 little release of action occupies 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.380
 again it becomes the bad guy and 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.380
 we're going to play 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:06.819
 and this year 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.680
 we must highlight more excellence 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:14.049
 They are always direct to 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.049
 and there is a game 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.590
 with these characters 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:13.360
 on bicycle 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:33.890

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.110
 you want to do everything but if you have a 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.500
 special preference because it will work with 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.500
 the gta 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.500
 if it is also a bad difference because if 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.500

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.860
 the side to several ok infinite is the 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.960
 story when one pulls out graphics 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.540
 when we finish the gameplay or the 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.280
 sound that is what the story is and 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.280
