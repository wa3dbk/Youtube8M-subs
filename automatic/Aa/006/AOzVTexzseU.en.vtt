there and let's close that gap and now
we<00:03:29.609> can<00:03:29.849> finish<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.209> top<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:34.500> let's<00:03:34.680> add<00:03:34.799> some

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
we can finish the top so let's add some

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.089 
we can finish the top so let's add some
detail<00:03:35.370> by<00:03:36.299> I<00:03:36.930> guess<00:03:37.290> let's<00:03:37.470> flush<00:03:37.859> out<00:03:38.010> our

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
detail by I guess let's flush out our

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.879 
detail by I guess let's flush out our
inventory<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:39.139> let's<00:03:40.139> go<00:03:40.290> grab<00:03:40.500> her<00:03:40.620> going

inventory and let's go grab her going
some<00:03:41.099> for<00:03:41.310> headlights<00:03:41.670> an<00:03:42.060> item<00:03:42.930> frame<00:03:43.139> so<00:03:43.410> we

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
some for headlights an item frame so we

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.180 
some for headlights an item frame so we
can<00:03:43.680> put<00:03:43.799> them<00:03:43.919> inside<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.459> sign<00:03:45.120> red<00:03:45.780> wool<00:03:46.190> add

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
can put them inside a sign red wool add

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.879 
can put them inside a sign red wool add
this<00:03:47.970> redstone<00:03:48.540> stuff<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.260> now<00:03:49.500> not<00:03:49.680> not

ghosts but this ones and their son light

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.909 
ghosts but this ones and their son light
sensors<00:03:53.430> or<00:03:53.639> daylight<00:03:53.940> sensors<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:55.500> our<00:03:55.739> two

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
sensors or daylight sensors so our two

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.610 
sensors or daylight sensors so our two
item<00:03:56.250> frames<00:03:56.459> go<00:03:56.639> here<00:03:56.910> our<00:03:57.410> glowstone<00:03:58.410> goes

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
item frames go here our glowstone goes

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.710 
item frames go here our glowstone goes
inside<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.669> you<00:03:59.730> know<00:03:59.819> what<00:03:59.849> might<00:04:00.299> look<00:04:00.480> cool

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
inside but you know what might look cool

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.960 
inside but you know what might look cool
if<00:04:01.169> we<00:04:01.380> replace<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:02.010> glow<00:04:02.220> stone<00:04:02.489> with<00:04:02.700> the

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
if we replace that glow stone with the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.479 
if we replace that glow stone with the
newly<00:04:03.209> added<00:04:03.919> become<00:04:04.919> things<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.310> see<00:04:05.459> what

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
newly added become things to see what

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.470 
newly added become things to see what
they<00:04:05.669> look<00:04:05.700> like<00:04:05.849> I<00:04:08.060> don't<00:04:09.060> know<00:04:09.120> that's<00:04:09.299> not

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
they look like I don't know that's not

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.940 
they look like I don't know that's not
right<00:04:09.599> let's<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:09.959> take<00:04:10.079> it<00:04:10.200> out<00:04:10.260> an<00:04:10.620> item

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
right let's just take it out an item

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.659 
right let's just take it out an item
frame<00:04:11.630> then<00:04:12.630> turbulent<00:04:13.139> goes<00:04:13.260> inside<00:04:13.669> hmm

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
frame then turbulent goes inside hmm

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.940 
frame then turbulent goes inside hmm
mature<00:04:15.419> like<00:04:15.630> it<00:04:15.840> looks<00:04:15.989> like<00:04:16.109> led<00:04:16.470> maybe<00:04:16.739> for

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
mature like it looks like led maybe for

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.199 
mature like it looks like led maybe for
like<00:04:17.099> if<00:04:17.280> we<00:04:17.370> ever<00:04:17.400> you're<00:04:17.639> like<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.760> sports<00:04:18.090> car

old-fashioned fuel truck we're just
gonna<00:04:22.169> stick<00:04:22.409> to<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.620> regular<00:04:22.950> glowstone<00:04:23.310> so<00:04:24.240> we

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
gonna stick to a regular glowstone so we

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.760 
gonna stick to a regular glowstone so we
need<00:04:24.659> are<00:04:24.780> two<00:04:24.810> levers<00:04:25.229> in<00:04:25.260> here<00:04:25.590> they're

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
need are two levers in here they're

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.140 
need are two levers in here they're
certain<00:04:26.070> of<00:04:26.130> your<00:04:26.250> antennas<00:04:26.700> but<00:04:26.849> we<00:04:26.940> got<00:04:27.060> to

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
it back and back here where we're going

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.580 
it back and back here where we're going
to<00:04:33.030> put<00:04:33.120> our<00:04:33.180> daylight<00:04:33.540> sensors<00:04:33.990> let's<00:04:34.410> see

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
to put our daylight sensors let's see

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.880 
to put our daylight sensors let's see
here<00:04:35.930> let's<00:04:36.930> connect<00:04:37.230> those<00:04:37.440> stuffs<00:04:37.710> know

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
here let's connect those stuffs know

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.590 
here let's connect those stuffs know
those<00:04:38.400> need<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.610> be<00:04:38.730> you<00:04:39.180> need<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.420> switch

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
those need to be you need to switch

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.810 
those need to be you need to switch
places<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:40.140> let's<00:04:40.320> just<00:04:40.500> delete<00:04:40.740> those<00:04:41.010> they

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
places so let's just delete those they

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.100 
places so let's just delete those they
light<00:04:42.030> sensors<00:04:42.420> go<00:04:42.570> there<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:42.900> way<00:04:42.960> they

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
light sensors go there that way they

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.320 
light sensors go there that way they
light<00:04:43.290> up<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:44.070> two<00:04:44.370> more<00:04:44.550> daylight<00:04:44.880> sensors

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
light up and two more daylight sensors

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.600 
light up and two more daylight sensors
on<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.600> back<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.140> then<00:04:46.620> our<00:04:46.740> redstone<00:04:47.310> come

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
on the back and then our redstone come

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
on the back and then our redstone come
paraders<00:04:48.030> I<00:04:48.150> think<00:04:48.300> that's<00:04:48.420> what<00:04:48.540> they're

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
paraders I think that's what they're

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.970 
paraders I think that's what they're
called<00:04:48.840> because<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.470> know<00:04:49.560> they<00:04:49.650> actually

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
called because you know they actually

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.620 
called because you know they actually
fill<00:04:50.190> this<00:04:50.370> thing's<00:04:50.640> from<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:51.000> top<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.420> I'm

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
fill this thing's from the top that I'm

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.820 
fill this thing's from the top that I'm
filling<00:04:51.870> from<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.110> bottom<00:04:52.350> they<00:04:52.680> just

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
filling from the bottom they just

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.170 
filling from the bottom they just
connects<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.280> hoses<00:04:53.610> on<00:04:53.730> the<00:04:53.790> top<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.090> they

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
connects the hoses on the top and they

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.060 
connects the hoses on the top and they
fill<00:04:54.360> it<00:04:54.450> in<00:04:54.540> so<00:04:55.110> then<00:04:55.290> our<00:04:55.380> item<00:04:55.650> frames<00:04:55.860> goes

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
fill it in so then our item frames goes

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.760 
fill it in so then our item frames goes
on<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.460> back<00:04:56.640> our<00:04:56.880> Red<00:04:57.690> Bulls<00:04:57.900> inside<00:04:58.530> those

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
on the back our Red Bulls inside those

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.930 
on the back our Red Bulls inside those
are<00:04:58.890> gonna<00:04:58.980> be<00:04:59.040> your<00:04:59.130> brake<00:04:59.340> lights<00:04:59.370> or<00:04:59.790> an

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
are gonna be your brake lights or an

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.690 
are gonna be your brake lights or an
item<00:05:00.030> frame<00:05:00.360> for<00:05:01.170> our<00:05:01.200> license<00:05:01.800> plate<00:05:02.010> and<00:05:02.220> I
