00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.130
 Good day to all with you Peregrine Falcon 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.610
 and today we look at such an interesting 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.760
 thing like 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.690
 counter 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.910
 Consider 3 types of analog 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.490
 serial and binary to start 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.200
 I will introduce you to the design of the new 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:31.020
 short pulse generator 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.970
 in here it is in front of you when we click on 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.510
 the key signal disappears for a short 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.950
 time this time can be customized 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.240
 using a repeater 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.809
 and the very first shevchik is analog 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.910
 the counter every time we press a button 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.910
 signal strength is reduced by one 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.030
 how to do it with us 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:01.120
 here is the most common 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:05.140
 itself usually pagan memory analog 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.350
 but slightly changed the way we can 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.620
 it fully powered on all the power we 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.420
 there will be a way out here 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.540
 but how to make a signal 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.110
 decreased 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.690
 we can lengthen the signal path and here it is 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.240
 on its own little 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.570
 discharged but in order for this 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.740
 happened when you press the key do 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.630
 lock marking with piston 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.409
 which overlaps 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.070
 this wire is now testing when 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.270
 I press 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.340
 fully powered 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.340
 and push the button 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.940
 we have a piston for seconds off and it moves 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:55.330
 son lengthens therefore weaken and how 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.150
 the result is a signal strength decreases by 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.130
 decreases 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.850
 our next counter is a shear 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.960
 register 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:10.380
 on d3 eras he is very fast and very little 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.380
 very small 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.650
 press the keys the finals from here are shifted 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.750
 that way you can do it 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.340
 successive steps or for others 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.340
 target use shift register 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.490
 here in the form it works 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.210
 it's based on the d3 rah and here's the d-trigger 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.960
 in solo 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:43.890
 variation of how it works it remembers 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:47.580
 the state of the winter entrance when 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.080
 we press the key is remembered then 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.660
 input state 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.950
 if at the input one click on 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:59.700
 the exit key is also one if 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.860
 input 0 press the exit key too 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.120
 0 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.780
 if we connect them like this 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:12.540
 consistently 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:15.880
 and block the signal from this repeater 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:21.730
 short pulse generator 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:24.690
 can do consistent . 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.630
 but if you serve a little thread construction 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.670
 can do reset 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.230
 of this 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:38.489
 shift register any moment there are 2 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:44.940
 kind of there is such a simpler thing on one 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:47.970
 You can make a piston quickly 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.450
 propels all signals to the end 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:56.680
 they pass so quickly disappears but 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:59.230
 can you make her 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.689
 did not progress to the end but all at once 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.310
 completely strayed for this 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:09.670
 we can just lift these blocks 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.930
 I'll show you how 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.040
 shaman key 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.040
 she instantly gets off 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.850
 next topic 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:28.550
 also very interesting here before you 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:30.400
 a masterpiece of engineering is t3 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.220
 flat 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:39.389
 what's his feature is he without pistons 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.389
 flat and just based on 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.070
 boot funnels maps 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:52.010
 when we press the button then the signal 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.889
 changing to the opposite here she is behind 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:59.199
 no rotar short pulses 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.199
 and wires which 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:08.190
 blocking here these boot funnels 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:13.770
 sales signal disappears subject 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:16.020
 proposed in the next funnel and here 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:21.060
 comparator registers presence 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:24.570
 described the subject briefly and if 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.390
 we will consistently connect these 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:31.460
 trigger and then we can do the most 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.460
 simple thrash her george 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:36.069
 Lose Jack just 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.620
 to lie on the binary number 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.070
 if you connect then the cipher from the root 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.070
 can do 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.320
 our 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.880
 serial shevchik 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:59.930
 or a timer or something else you can do 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:03.670
 that's it all with you was a peregrine falcon wait 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.670
 next episodes for now
