can see what it looks like so here it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.770 
can see what it looks like so here it
gets<00:00:41.070> basically<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> same<00:00:41.969> design<00:00:42.390> except

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
gets basically the same design except

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.840 
gets basically the same design except
for<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.440> another<00:00:43.710> rack<00:00:43.980> two<00:00:44.280> spaces<00:00:44.579> down

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
for I have another rack two spaces down

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.600 
for I have another rack two spaces down
to<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.420> bunch<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:46.039> below<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> bunch<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.370> half

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
to but a bunch of below a bunch of half

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.250 
to but a bunch of below a bunch of half
slabs<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.579> what<00:00:50.579> he<00:00:50.640> call<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
slabs and then the what he call this a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.500 
slabs and then the what he call this a
piston<00:00:52.260> pushing<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.160> burning<00:00:53.969> chicken<00:00:54.300> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
piston pushing the burning chicken and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.299 
piston pushing the burning chicken and
or<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> chicken<00:00:55.350> that's<00:00:55.530> already<00:00:55.800> dead<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
or a chicken that's already dead and

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.250 
or a chicken that's already dead and
items<00:00:56.789> sitting<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> block<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.199> it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
items sitting on the block here so it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.630 
items sitting on the block here so it
pushes<00:00:58.410> items<00:00:58.859> or<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> chicken<00:00:59.489> off<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
pushes items or the chicken off the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.880 
pushes items or the chicken off the
block<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.270> then<00:01:00.690> into<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.050> water<00:01:01.350> flow<00:01:01.710> that

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
block and then into this water flow that

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.060 
block and then into this water flow that
goes<00:01:01.949> down<00:01:02.250> into<00:01:02.489> my<00:01:02.699> base<00:01:03.470> so<00:01:04.470> these<00:01:04.680> are<00:01:04.739> half

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
goes down into my base so these are half

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.520 
goes down into my base so these are half
slabs<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.729> I've<00:01:05.850> said<00:01:06.000> before<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:07.260> when<00:01:07.500> I

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
slabs like I've said before and when I

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.050 
slabs like I've said before and when I
press<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> button<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.220> my<00:01:08.369> face<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.850> water

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
press the button at my face the water

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.000 
press the button at my face the water
will<00:01:09.210> come<00:01:09.420> down<00:01:09.659> rest<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.470> half<00:01:10.680> slab

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
will come down rest is this half slab

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.219 
will come down rest is this half slab
here<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.490> then<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> chickens<00:01:12.540> will<00:01:12.780> kind<00:01:13.110> of

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
here and then the chickens will kind of

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.050 
here and then the chickens will kind of
you<00:01:13.380> know<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> hangout<00:01:14.189> session<00:01:14.700> here

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
you know have a hangout session here

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.510 
you know have a hangout session here
drink<00:01:15.659> coffee<00:01:15.900> hang<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:16.979> go<00:01:17.159> oh<00:01:17.189> well

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.800 
drink coffee hang out and go oh well
let's<00:01:17.700> continue<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> rest<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.630> world

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
let's continue on the rest of the world

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.530 
let's continue on the rest of the world
ER<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.229> then<00:01:19.799> they'll<00:01:20.150> jump<00:01:21.150> onto<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
ER and then they'll jump onto this

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.899 
ER and then they'll jump onto this
netherrack<00:01:22.020> freely<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> key<00:01:23.670> that's

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
netherrack freely that's the key that's

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.999 
netherrack freely that's the key that's
why<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.150> works<00:01:24.600> versus<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.590> other<00:01:25.740> way

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
why this works versus the other way

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.679 
why this works versus the other way
doesn't<00:01:26.369> force<00:01:26.580> them<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> nether<00:01:27.450> whacked

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
doesn't force them on the nether whacked

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.200 
doesn't force them on the nether whacked
they<00:01:28.259> walk<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.799> their<00:01:28.920> freely<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.640> basically

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
they walk on their freely and basically

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.630 
they walk on their freely and basically
the<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.509> out<00:01:31.049> burn<00:01:31.380> burn<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.950> they<00:01:32.460> will

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the go out burn burn and they will

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.370 
the go out burn burn and they will
continue<00:01:32.880> walking<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.720> down<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> next

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
continue walking on down to the next

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.289 
continue walking on down to the next
block<00:01:34.619> below<00:01:34.950> them<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.460> oh<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:36.000> continue

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
block below them going oh I can continue

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.819 
block below them going oh I can continue
on<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.140> then<00:01:37.590> they<00:01:37.740> will<00:01:37.860> burn<00:01:39.380> this<00:01:40.380> piston

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
on and then they will burn this piston

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.710 
on and then they will burn this piston
will<00:01:40.950> push<00:01:41.130> them<00:01:41.430> or<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.030> items<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.479> get

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
will push them or the items that get

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.990 
will push them or the items that get
stuck<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.470> block<00:01:43.799> into<00:01:44.670> your<00:01:44.820> little

stuck on this block into your little

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.340 
stuck on this block into your little
water<00:01:45.329> here<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.049> head<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.259> down

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
water here and then you can head it down

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.240 
water here and then you can head it down
to<00:01:46.470> your<00:01:46.530> base<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:46.829> i'm<00:01:46.920> going<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.070> show<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
to your base so i'm going to show you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.210 
to your base so i'm going to show you
now<00:01:47.579> what<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.970> looks<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.560> in<00:01:49.560> my<00:01:49.740> creative

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
now what this looks like in my creative

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.190 
now what this looks like in my creative
world<00:01:50.430> where<00:01:50.670> I've<00:01:50.759> made<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.090> glass<00:01:51.390> so

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
world where I've made it with glass so

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.870 
world where I've made it with glass so
it's<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> lot<00:01:52.500> easier<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:53.430> I'm<00:01:53.520> doing

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
it's a lot easier to see what I'm doing

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.719 
it's a lot easier to see what I'm doing
okay<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:54.899> here's<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.500> same<00:01:55.979> design<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.700> i

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
okay so here's the same design that i

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.870 
okay so here's the same design that i
have<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.719> basically<00:01:58.290> with<00:01:58.770> glass<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.850> can

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
have just basically with glass you can

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.760 
have just basically with glass you can
see<00:02:00.180> exactly<00:02:00.600> what<00:02:00.930> i'm<00:02:01.049> doing<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.530> again

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
see exactly what i'm doing so again

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.920 
see exactly what i'm doing so again
here's<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.790> flow<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.030> water<00:02:03.329> coming<00:02:03.719> from

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
here's the flow of water coming from

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.050 
here's the flow of water coming from
your<00:02:04.259> chicken<00:02:04.619> farm<00:02:04.860> magically<00:02:05.579> over<00:02:05.820> here

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
your chicken farm magically over here

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.809 
your chicken farm magically over here
and<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.009> bunch<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.310> half<00:02:08.520> slabs

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and then on to a bunch of half slabs

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.760 
and then on to a bunch of half slabs
here<00:02:08.970> i<00:02:09.000> found<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.750> number<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.259> about

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
here i found the the number of about

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.020 
here i found the the number of about
five<00:02:11.099> or<00:02:11.340> six<00:02:11.520> seems

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
five or six seems

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.150 
five or six seems
work<00:02:12.290> gives<00:02:13.290> them<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:13.650> enough<00:02:13.709> space<00:02:14.100> to

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
work gives them just enough space to

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.570 
work gives them just enough space to
hang<00:02:14.459> out<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.090> then<00:02:15.240> basically<00:02:16.160> after<00:02:17.160> they

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
hang out and then basically after they

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.830 
hang out and then basically after they
get<00:02:17.730> tired<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.120> hanging<00:02:18.480> out<00:02:18.540> they're<00:02:18.750> gonna

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
get tired of hanging out they're gonna

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.990 
get tired of hanging out they're gonna
come<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.440> try<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.130> continue<00:02:20.550> on<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.850> rest

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
come and try to continue on in the rest

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.790 
come and try to continue on in the rest
of<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.120> world<00:02:21.350> so<00:02:22.350> I'm<00:02:22.440> just<00:02:22.590> going<00:02:22.709> to

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
of the world so I'm just going to

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.620 
of the world so I'm just going to
explain<00:02:23.220> exactly<00:02:23.819> what<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.120> numbers<00:02:24.480> are

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
explain exactly what the numbers are

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.110 
explain exactly what the numbers are
here<00:02:24.900> okay<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:25.470> we<00:02:25.560> have<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:26.340> flow<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:26.850> water

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
here okay so we have a flow of water

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.320 
here okay so we have a flow of water
into<00:02:27.540> five<00:02:27.780> or<00:02:27.959> six<00:02:28.170> half<00:02:28.739> slabs<00:02:29.100> onto<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.940> sign

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
into five or six half slabs onto a sign

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.690 
into five or six half slabs onto a sign
right<00:02:30.690> next<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.319> half<00:02:31.560> half<00:02:32.069> slabs<00:02:32.489> on

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
right next to this half half slabs on

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.870 
right next to this half half slabs on
the<00:02:32.790> same<00:02:33.030> block<00:02:33.390> okay<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.530> then<00:02:34.890> one<00:02:35.190> spacing

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
the same block okay and then one spacing

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.120 
the same block okay and then one spacing
between<00:02:36.030> where<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.170> burning<00:02:37.770> netherrack

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
between where the burning netherrack

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
between where the burning netherrack
flames<00:02:38.489> will<00:02:38.730> be<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.090> then<00:02:39.780> another<00:02:40.709> rack

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
flames will be and then another rack

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.000 
flames will be and then another rack
with<00:02:42.150> flames<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.410> then<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> piston

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
with flames on it and then a piston

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.910 
with flames on it and then a piston
directly<00:02:44.610> below<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:45.810> from<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.440> top<00:02:46.650> here

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
directly below that so from the top here

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.890 
directly below that so from the top here
that<00:02:47.100> should<00:02:47.310> be<00:02:47.400> four<00:02:47.670> squares<00:02:48.150> on<00:02:48.480> do<00:02:48.720> this

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that should be four squares on do this

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.570 
that should be four squares on do this
little<00:02:49.200> dirt<00:02:49.500> block<00:02:49.800> where<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.250> chickens

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
little dirt block where the chickens

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.449 
little dirt block where the chickens
wolf<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.540> fall<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.470> then<00:02:52.860> fall<00:02:53.160> to

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
wolf so the fall to and then fall to

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.910 
wolf so the fall to and then fall to
okay<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.900> think<00:02:55.110> it's<00:02:55.230> four<00:02:55.470> one<00:02:55.709> two

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
okay so that think it's four one two

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.000 
okay so that think it's four one two
three<00:02:56.040> four<00:02:56.489> exactly<00:02:57.390> okay<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:58.890> just

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
three four exactly okay and this is just

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.800 
three four exactly okay and this is just
a<00:02:59.160> small<00:02:59.430> little<00:02:59.459> timing<00:03:00.150> anyone<00:03:00.480> can<00:03:00.660> do<00:03:00.780> this

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
a small little timing anyone can do this

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.410 
a small little timing anyone can do this
it's<00:03:01.140> really<00:03:01.380> easy<00:03:01.590> all<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.700> timings<00:03:03.120> are<00:03:03.269> set

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
it's really easy all the timings are set

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.820 
it's really easy all the timings are set
on<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.630> lowest<00:03:03.959> setting<00:03:04.260> which<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.560> four

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
on the lowest setting which is four

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.000 
on the lowest setting which is four
clicks<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:06.569> basically<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.380> does<00:03:07.590> not<00:03:07.769> need

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
clicks and basically this does not need

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.699 
clicks and basically this does not need
to<00:03:08.190> go<00:03:08.340> fast<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.840> know<00:03:09.930> preferably<00:03:10.260> you

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
to go fast it you know preferably you

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.840 
to go fast it you know preferably you
want<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:10.950> have<00:03:11.069> it<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.250> go<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.519> slow<00:03:11.700> as

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
want to have it to go the slow as

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.880 
want to have it to go the slow as
possible<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:12.690> never<00:03:13.140> messes<00:03:13.560> up<00:03:13.709> you're

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
possible so this never messes up you're

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.559 
possible so this never messes up you're
gonna<00:03:14.010> have<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.220> reset<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:14.610> because<00:03:15.239> sometimes

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
gonna have to reset it because sometimes

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.380 
gonna have to reset it because sometimes
if<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.840> set<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.230> on<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:16.860> fast<00:03:17.190> interval<00:03:17.760> if<00:03:18.209> you

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
if you set it on a fast interval if you

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.600 
if you set it on a fast interval if you
log<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:18.989> out<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.170> few<00:03:19.410> times<00:03:19.560> quickly<00:03:19.890> this

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
log in and out a few times quickly this

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.890 
log in and out a few times quickly this
will<00:03:20.790> reset<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.269> you'll<00:03:21.360> have<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.600> redo<00:03:21.870> it

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
will reset and you'll have to redo it

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.479 
will reset and you'll have to redo it
you<00:03:22.110> don't<00:03:22.260> really<00:03:22.380> want<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.680> do<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:22.890> so<00:03:23.459> I

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
you don't really want to do that so I

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.870 
you don't really want to do that so I
just<00:03:23.610> have<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.820> on<00:03:23.940> for<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.810> slow<00:03:25.019> as<00:03:25.140> possible

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
just have it on for the slow as possible

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.160 
just have it on for the slow as possible
so<00:03:26.880> basically<00:03:27.239> let's<00:03:27.720> just<00:03:27.870> see<00:03:27.959> what<00:03:28.079> this

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
so basically let's just see what this

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.340 
so basically let's just see what this
looks<00:03:28.230> like<00:03:28.470> real<00:03:28.920> quickly<00:03:29.810> it's<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.900> one<00:03:31.049> two

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
looks like real quickly it's a one two

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.170 
looks like real quickly it's a one two
three<00:03:31.799> four<00:03:32.040> let's<00:03:32.250> just<00:03:32.430> put<00:03:32.579> a<00:03:32.610> bunch<00:03:32.910> like

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
three four let's just put a bunch like

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.759 
three four let's just put a bunch like
they're<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.870> coming<00:03:34.019> down<00:03:34.170> from<00:03:34.590> my<00:03:34.799> my<00:03:36.769> my

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
they're just coming down from my my my

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.110 
they're just coming down from my my my
chicken<00:03:38.100> farm<00:03:38.310> here<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.610> let's<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:38.910> see<00:03:39.030> how

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
chicken farm here and let's just see how

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.289 
chicken farm here and let's just see how
this<00:03:39.269> works<00:03:39.450> here<00:03:39.920> okay<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:40.980> we<00:03:41.130> have<00:03:41.160> 11<00:03:41.820> death

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
this works here okay so we have 11 death

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.710 
this works here okay so we have 11 death
which<00:03:42.570> is<00:03:42.690> not<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> big<00:03:42.989> deal<00:03:44.540> so<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.600> see

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
which is not a big deal so you see

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.280 
which is not a big deal so you see
they're<00:03:45.900> gonna<00:03:45.989> hang<00:03:46.290> out<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:48.140> there<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.260> go

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
they're gonna hang out and there you go

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.349 
they're gonna hang out and there you go
see<00:03:49.590> how<00:03:49.680> they<00:03:49.859> freely<00:03:50.310> just<00:03:50.640> jump<00:03:50.850> off<00:03:51.060> and

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
see how they freely just jump off and

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.210 
see how they freely just jump off and
just<00:03:51.750> in<00:03:51.870> case<00:03:52.019> is<00:03:52.230> piss<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.470> little<00:03:52.620> push<00:03:52.920> them

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
just in case is piss a little push them

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.660 
just in case is piss a little push them
or<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.549> items<00:03:53.880> off<00:03:55.040> ya<00:03:56.040> see<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.489> works

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
or the items off ya see it works

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.479 
or the items off ya see it works
perfectly<00:03:57.090> fine<00:03:57.709> so<00:03:58.709> one<00:03:58.890> thing<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.340> remember

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
perfectly fine so one thing to remember

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.330 
perfectly fine so one thing to remember
that<00:04:00.410> you<00:04:01.410> need<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.680> have<00:04:01.829> enough<00:04:02.070> space

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
that you need to have enough space

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.759 
that you need to have enough space
before<00:04:02.660> before<00:04:03.660> they<00:04:03.959> get<00:04:04.140> pushed<00:04:04.380> on<00:04:04.590> to

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
before before they get pushed on to

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.060 
before before they get pushed on to
water<00:04:05.329> so<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.450> water<00:04:06.480> doesn't<00:04:06.780> put<00:04:07.769> out<00:04:07.799> there

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
water so the water doesn't put out there

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.009 
water so the water doesn't put out there
flames<00:04:08.370> so<00:04:08.609> I<00:04:08.640> found<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.060> perfect<00:04:09.269> number<00:04:09.630> is

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
flames so I found the perfect number is

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.020 
flames so I found the perfect number is
one<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.519> below<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:11.940> net<00:04:12.269> Iraq<00:04:12.540> 1<00:04:13.109> 2<00:04:13.560> 3<00:04:13.890> 4<00:04:14.549> 5

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
one this is below the net Iraq 1 2 3 4 5

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.460 
one this is below the net Iraq 1 2 3 4 5
and<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.660> fifth<00:04:15.930> block<00:04:16.289> is<00:04:16.560> your<00:04:16.739> water<00:04:16.979> block

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
and the fifth block is your water block

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.570 
and the fifth block is your water block
so<00:04:19.470> yeah<00:04:19.620> see<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:19.890> again<00:04:20.099> that's<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.370> perfect

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
so yeah see you again that's the perfect

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.940 
so yeah see you again that's the perfect
number<00:04:20.909> just<00:04:21.330> before<00:04:21.659> they<00:04:21.870> just<00:04:22.590> before<00:04:22.800> they

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
number just before they just before they

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.600 
number just before they just before they
died<00:04:23.099> to<00:04:23.310> hit<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.550> water

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
died to hit the water

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.270 
died to hit the water
and<00:04:24.900> this<00:04:25.900> is<00:04:26.020> pretty<00:04:26.469> easy<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.830> make<00:04:26.979> i<00:04:27.129> don't

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
and this is pretty easy to make i don't

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.409 
and this is pretty easy to make i don't
think<00:04:27.400> i<00:04:27.460> need<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.639> make<00:04:27.789> a<00:04:27.849> tutorial<00:04:28.180> on<00:04:28.360> how

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
think i need to make a tutorial on how

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.610 
think i need to make a tutorial on how
to<00:04:28.509> make<00:04:28.629> it<00:04:28.719> if<00:04:28.870> you<00:04:28.960> have<00:04:29.050> any<00:04:29.199> questions

you<00:04:34.800> one<00:04:35.800> key<00:04:36.099> thing<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.580> forgot<00:04:36.729> to<00:04:36.879> mention

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
you one key thing I forgot to mention

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.240 
you one key thing I forgot to mention
which<00:04:37.479> isn't<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.289> most<00:04:38.319> important<00:04:38.979> but<00:04:39.129> it's

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
which isn't the most important but it's

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.209 
which isn't the most important but it's
a<00:04:39.340> good<00:04:39.460> idea<00:04:39.639> is<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.659> have<00:04:41.289> a<00:04:41.319> single<00:04:41.979> glass

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
a good idea is I have a single glass

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:46.409 
a good idea is I have a single glass
block<00:04:42.669> right<00:04:42.969> here<00:04:43.740> basically<00:04:44.740> what<00:04:45.370> this<00:04:45.580> one

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
block right here basically what this one

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.350 
block right here basically what this one
block<00:04:46.810> does<00:04:47.169> is<00:04:47.500> if<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.520> chickens<00:04:48.849> group<00:04:49.150> up

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
block does is if the chickens group up

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.800 
block does is if the chickens group up
too<00:04:49.629> much<00:04:49.810> they<00:04:50.590> will<00:04:50.949> push<00:04:51.370> each<00:04:51.580> other<00:04:51.819> over

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
too much they will push each other over

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.770 
too much they will push each other over
the<00:04:52.840> burning<00:04:53.379> flames<00:04:54.240> so<00:04:55.240> if<00:04:55.360> you<00:04:55.449> have<00:04:55.599> this

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
the burning flames so if you have this

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.360 
the burning flames so if you have this
block<00:04:56.139> here<00:04:56.379> which<00:04:56.560> will<00:04:56.710> have<00:04:56.919> what<00:04:57.250> will

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
block here which will have what will

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.209 
block here which will have what will
happen<00:04:57.729> is<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.810> chickens<00:04:59.229> will<00:04:59.469> bump<00:05:00.009> up

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:00.219 
happen is the chickens will bump up

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:01.679 
happen is the chickens will bump up
against<00:05:00.520> this<00:05:00.669> block<00:05:01.029> here<00:05:01.330> and<00:05:01.509> then<00:05:01.599> they

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:01.689 
against this block here and then they

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:05.640 
against this block here and then they
will<00:05:01.810> slowly<00:05:02.560> file<00:05:03.069> down<00:05:03.900> but<00:05:04.900> yeah<00:05:05.050> so<00:05:05.349> just<00:05:05.379> a

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
will slowly file down but yeah so just a

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.339 
will slowly file down but yeah so just a
single<00:05:05.889> block<00:05:06.250> beside<00:05:06.669> so<00:05:06.879> half<00:05:07.090> slab<00:05:07.389> sign

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
single block beside so half slab sign

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.769 
single block beside so half slab sign
block<00:05:09.159> basically<00:05:09.759> that<00:05:09.939> block<00:05:10.150> just<00:05:10.360> prevents

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:10.779 
block basically that block just prevents

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:12.929 
block basically that block just prevents
them<00:05:10.960> from<00:05:11.099> pushing<00:05:12.099> each<00:05:12.370> other<00:05:12.550> off<00:05:12.729> the

00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:12.939 
them from pushing each other off the

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:21.270 
them from pushing each other off the
flames

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.340 

you
