00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
it in the campaign but yeah we've got a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.020 
it in the campaign but yeah we've got a
stunt<00:01:24.689> arena<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.200> GTA<00:01:25.740> 5<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.820> on

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
stunt arena in GTA 5 this is it on

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.569 
stunt arena in GTA 5 this is it on
screen<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.170> then<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.070> see<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.369> Yan

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
screen now and then you can see that Yan

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.370 
screen now and then you can see that Yan
has<00:01:29.759> actually<00:01:30.090> found<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> interior<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.350> this

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
has actually found the interior for this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.530 
has actually found the interior for this
so<00:01:31.650> possibly<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.310> will<00:01:32.549> become<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.030> GTA<00:01:33.450> online

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
so possibly it will become to GTA online

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.499 
so possibly it will become to GTA online
in<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.380> future<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:35.310> stunt<00:01:35.790> races<00:01:36.240> under

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
track looks amazing it's something we

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.639 
track looks amazing it's something we
don't<00:01:41.610> really<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:42.210> or<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.930> don't<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.229> have

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
don't really do or we don't really have

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.530 
don't really do or we don't really have
an<00:01:43.950> GTA<00:01:44.310> 5<00:01:44.579> right<00:01:44.820> now<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.270> will<00:01:45.420> be

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
an GTA 5 right now so it will be

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.690 
an GTA 5 right now so it will be
different<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.649> does<00:01:46.829> look<00:01:47.009> very<00:01:47.159> good

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
different and it does look very good

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
different and it does look very good

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
we've also then got the interior to what

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.730 
we've also then got the interior to what
looks<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.130> some<00:01:50.520> kind<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.970> bar<00:01:51.630> I'm<00:01:52.500> not

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
