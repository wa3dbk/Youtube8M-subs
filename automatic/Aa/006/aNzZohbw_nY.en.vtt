00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
yeah some something different but I

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.050 
yeah some something different but I
think<00:05:25.280> this<00:05:25.580> weather<00:05:25.850> is<00:05:26.060> not<00:05:26.270> really<00:05:28.060> made

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
think this weather is not really made

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.270 
think this weather is not really made
for<00:05:29.090> it<00:05:29.450> or<00:05:29.810> they<00:05:30.290> don't<00:05:30.410> have<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.770> time<00:05:30.980> ready

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.750 
for it or they don't have the time ready
