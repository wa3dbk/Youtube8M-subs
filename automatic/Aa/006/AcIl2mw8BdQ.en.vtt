wanted to do a little better job of
explaining<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:08.069> installed<00:00:08.970> spring<00:00:09.480> height

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
explaining the installed spring height

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.150 
explaining the installed spring height
today<00:00:11.030> I'm<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.210> did<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> previous<00:00:13.139> video<00:00:13.710> on<00:00:13.769> it

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
today I'm I did a previous video on it

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.630 
today I'm I did a previous video on it
but<00:00:15.560> had<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.590> lot<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.830> questions<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.400> don't<00:00:17.580> know

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
is we need to make sure that our springs

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.160 
is we need to make sure that our springs
are<00:00:58.800> sitting<00:00:59.160> at<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> correct<00:00:59.730> height<00:00:59.820> on<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
are sitting at the correct height on the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.429 
are sitting at the correct height on the
head<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:02.100> other<00:01:02.250> words<00:01:02.539> I've<00:01:03.539> got<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.170> tool

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
head in other words I've got this tool

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.160 
head in other words I've got this tool
on<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.270> I'll<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.450> show<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.930> real

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
on here but I'll just show you this real

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.140 
on here but I'll just show you this real
quick<00:01:07.400> one<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.549> things<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> we're

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
quick one of the things that we're

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.310 
quick one of the things that we're
concerned<00:01:09.479> about<00:01:09.920> there<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> specification

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
concerned about there is a specification

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.899 
concerned about there is a specification
for<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> height<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.070> spring<00:01:14.400> sits<00:01:14.700> at

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
for the height that the spring sits at

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.260 
for the height that the spring sits at
so<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.299> other<00:01:15.390> words<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:16.369> put<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.520> retainer<00:01:18.000> on

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
so in other words I put this retainer on

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.580 
so in other words I put this retainer on
here<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:20.570> these<00:01:21.570> keepers<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.140> retainers

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
here like so these keepers and retainers

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.870 
here like so these keepers and retainers
are<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> hold<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.159> retainer<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
are going to hold that retainer in a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.710 
are going to hold that retainer in a
specific<00:01:24.119> location<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.920> distance<00:01:26.369> from<00:01:26.720> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
specific location the distance from the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.870 
specific location the distance from the
spring<00:01:28.170> pad<00:01:28.560> down<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.369> where<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.549> spring

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
spring pad down here where the spring

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.810 
spring pad down here where the spring
actually<00:01:30.180> sits<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:32.220> bottom<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
actually sits and the bottom of the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.609 
actually sits and the bottom of the
retainer<00:01:33.240> where<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> spring<00:01:33.869> contacts<00:01:34.409> at

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
retainer where the spring contacts at

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.609 
retainer where the spring contacts at
that<00:01:34.829> distance<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:36.200> now<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.470> were<00:01:37.590> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that distance there now if you were to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.590 
that distance there now if you were to
measure<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.880> actually<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.420> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
measure that you can actually get a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.469 
measure that you can actually get a
hyped<00:01:40.049> out<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.439> it

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
hyped out of it

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.569

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
that is called installed height there's

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.460 
that is called installed height there's
a<00:01:44.640> specification<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.899> because<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
a specification for that because the

closed<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.680> it's<00:02:10.770> also<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.220> going<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.430> have

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
closed and it's also not going to have

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.190 
closed and it's also not going to have
the<00:02:11.790> correct<00:02:12.060> pressure<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.750> cam<00:02:12.990> when

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the correct pressure on the cam when

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.710 
the correct pressure on the cam when
this<00:02:13.320> valve<00:02:13.560> opens<00:02:13.740> up<00:02:14.160> on<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.030> cam<00:02:15.210> opens<00:02:15.600> it

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
this valve opens up on the cam opens it

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.510 
this valve opens up on the cam opens it
up<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.990> screen<00:02:16.260> pressure<00:02:16.560> goes<00:02:16.860> directly<00:02:17.100> to

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
up the screen pressure goes directly to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:27.110 
up the screen pressure goes directly to
the<00:02:17.610> camshaft<00:02:25.070> so<00:02:26.070> this<00:02:26.220> tool<00:02:26.490> right<00:02:26.730> here<00:02:26.760> now

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the camshaft so this tool right here now

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.550 
the camshaft so this tool right here now
I've<00:02:27.240> got<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.660> here<00:02:27.870> where<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.110> spring<00:02:28.440> is

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
I've got it in here where the spring is

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.170 
I've got it in here where the spring is
going<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.740> go<00:02:28.950> my<00:02:29.250> spring<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.670> going<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.850> sit<00:02:30.060> in

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
going to go my spring is going to sit in

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.840 
going to go my spring is going to sit in
there<00:02:30.360> when<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:30.540> compressed<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:32.340> reading

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
there when it's compressed it's reading

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.940 
there when it's compressed it's reading
one<00:02:33.750> inch<00:02:35.000> 902<00:02:36.000> thousandths<00:02:36.600> which<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:37.650> really

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
one inch 902 thousandths which is really

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.150 
one inch 902 thousandths which is really
close<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.400> one<00:02:38.550> inch<00:02:38.700> 900<00:02:39.330> my<00:02:40.200> spec<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:43.160> should

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
close to one inch 900 my spec is should

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.080 
close to one inch 900 my spec is should
have<00:02:44.280> 122<00:02:45.120> pounds<00:02:45.330> at<00:02:45.660> one<00:02:45.780> inch<00:02:45.959> 900,000<00:02:47.090> so

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
have 122 pounds at one inch 900,000 so

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.120 
have 122 pounds at one inch 900,000 so
my<00:02:48.750> height<00:02:49.020> here<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.500> measure<00:02:49.800> is

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
my height here that I measure is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.449 
my height here that I measure is
measuring<00:02:50.970> one<00:02:51.150> inch<00:02:51.320> 900,000<00:02:52.320> when<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.130> set

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
measuring one inch 900,000 when you set

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.850 
measuring one inch 900,000 when you set
up<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.850> set<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.840> performance<00:02:54.989> cylinder<00:02:55.650> heads

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
up a set of performance cylinder heads

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.340 
up a set of performance cylinder heads
with<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.130> set<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.910> custom<00:02:57.239> Springs<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.959> valves

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
with a set of custom Springs and valves

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.100 
with a set of custom Springs and valves
and<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.500> cam<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:58.770> everything<00:02:59.540> you<00:03:00.540> have<00:03:00.870> to

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
and a cam and everything you have to

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.810 
and a cam and everything you have to
measure<00:03:01.320> your<00:03:01.620> installed<00:03:02.040> height<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.610> not

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
measure your installed height it's not

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.000 
measure your installed height it's not
this<00:03:03.209> is<00:03:03.390> not<00:03:03.420> something<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.920> know

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
this is not something that is you know

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.840 
this is not something that is you know
optional<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.959> know<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:08.190> I'm<00:03:08.310> good<00:03:08.550> on<00:03:08.700> this

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
optional so I know that I'm good on this

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.840 
optional so I know that I'm good on this
one<00:03:08.930> because<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:11.060> measured<00:03:12.060> one<00:03:12.239> inch<00:03:12.420> 900,000

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
one because I measured one inch 900,000

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.520 
one because I measured one inch 900,000
so<00:03:14.850> my<00:03:15.150> spring<00:03:15.450> height<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.810> good<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.200> can<00:03:16.380> go

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
so my spring height is good I can go

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.479 
so my spring height is good I can go
ahead<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:19.260> way<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.590> do<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:19.860> is<00:03:20.100> once<00:03:20.310> I

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
ahead and the way that I do it is once I

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.570 
ahead and the way that I do it is once I
get<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:21.330> height<00:03:21.510> right<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:22.220> go<00:03:23.220> ahead<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.400> put

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
get the height right I go ahead and put

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.130 
get the height right I go ahead and put
my<00:03:23.730> valve<00:03:23.940> seal<00:03:24.209> on<00:03:24.390> there<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.690> move<00:03:24.870> on<00:03:24.989> to

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
my valve seal on there and I move on to

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.330 
my valve seal on there and I move on to
the<00:03:25.200> next<00:03:25.320> valve<00:03:25.620> I'll<00:03:25.799> go<00:03:25.890> down<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.070> do<00:03:26.250> this

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
the next valve I'll go down and do this

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.170 
the next valve I'll go down and do this
one<00:03:26.519> next<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.840> that's<00:03:28.019> basically<00:03:29.180> spring

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
one next so that's basically spring

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.320 
one next so that's basically spring
installed<00:03:30.540> height<00:03:30.720> in<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.019> nutshell<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:32.330> it's

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
installed height in a nutshell so it's

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.360 
installed height in a nutshell so it's
real<00:03:33.630> important<00:03:34.140> that<00:03:34.260> we<00:03:34.440> make<00:03:34.980> sure<00:03:35.010> we<00:03:35.280> get

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
real important that we make sure we get

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.140 
real important that we make sure we get
this<00:03:35.549> correct<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:37.650> springs<00:03:38.340> have<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.910> big

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
this correct the springs have a big

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.539 
this correct the springs have a big
effect<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.840> on<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.590> way<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.280> engine

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
effect on the on the way that the engine

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.970 
effect on the on the way that the engine
runs<00:03:41.580> on<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.000> valve<00:03:42.180> train<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:43.500> anytime<00:03:43.709> you

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
runs on the valve train so anytime you

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.060 
runs on the valve train so anytime you
do<00:03:44.100> custom<00:03:44.519> heads<00:03:44.989> and<00:03:45.989> very<00:03:46.530> often<00:03:46.709> the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
do custom heads and very often the

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.699 
do custom heads and very often the
machinist<00:03:47.940> if<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:49.100> if<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.310> take<00:03:50.580> your<00:03:51.709> heads

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
machinist if you if you take your heads

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.550 
machinist if you if you take your heads
to<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:52.950> machine<00:03:53.100> shop<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:54.750> machinist<00:03:55.320> in<00:03:55.470> the

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
to a machine shop the machinist in the

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.400 
to a machine shop the machinist in the
shop<00:03:55.769> will<00:03:56.070> actually<00:03:56.630> ask<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.959> well<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.320> know

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
shop will actually ask you well you know

the<00:04:15.010> installed<00:04:15.340> height<00:04:15.550> and<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.850> pressure

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
the installed height and the pressure

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.539 
the installed height and the pressure
and<00:04:16.299> so<00:04:16.450> forth<00:04:16.750> but<00:04:17.440> we're<00:04:17.650> able<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.890> take<00:04:18.280> and

five angle valve job on there we get

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.840 
five angle valve job on there we get
undercut<00:05:04.750> swirl<00:05:05.080> push<00:05:05.380> polished<00:05:05.890> valves<00:05:06.280> so

too tight in other words if you put a

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.909 
too tight in other words if you put a

camshaft in your motor that has you know
a<00:05:27.010> lot<00:05:27.250> more<00:05:27.430> lift<00:05:27.729> in<00:05:27.910> stock<00:05:28.240> and<00:05:28.600> you<00:05:28.690> have

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
a lot more lift in stock and you have

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.920 
a lot more lift in stock and you have
stock<00:05:29.169> Springs<00:05:29.680> on<00:05:29.890> here<00:05:30.750> you're<00:05:31.750> going<00:05:31.870> to

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
stock Springs on here you're going to

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.300 
stock Springs on here you're going to
have<00:05:32.140> a<00:05:32.169> real<00:05:32.470> problem<00:05:32.860> you<00:05:32.890> could<00:05:33.130> actually

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
have a real problem you could actually

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.880 
have a real problem you could actually
blow<00:05:33.610> your<00:05:33.880> engine<00:05:34.210> doing<00:05:34.450> that<00:05:34.630> because<00:05:34.890> if

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
blow your engine doing that because if

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.860 
blow your engine doing that because if
the<00:05:36.100> cam<00:05:36.280> chef<00:05:36.550> has<00:05:36.729> too<00:05:36.880> much<00:05:37.030> for<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.419> lift

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
the cam chef has too much for the lift

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.050 
the cam chef has too much for the lift
for<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.110> springs<00:05:38.470> it'll<00:05:39.100> smash<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.729> springs

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
for the springs it'll smash the springs

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.060 
for the springs it'll smash the springs
down<00:05:40.270> so<00:05:40.510> all<00:05:40.720> these<00:05:40.900> coils<00:05:41.260> smash<00:05:41.650> into<00:05:41.890> each

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
down so all these coils smash into each

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.670 
down so all these coils smash into each
other<00:05:42.280> and<00:05:42.720> then<00:05:43.720> the<00:05:43.840> rocker<00:05:44.110> will<00:05:44.350> actually

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
other and then the rocker will actually

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.010 
other and then the rocker will actually
try<00:05:44.830> to<00:05:44.860> push<00:05:45.160> that<00:05:45.370> further<00:05:45.669> and<00:05:46.600> it'll<00:05:46.840> break

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
try to push that further and it'll break

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.290 
try to push that further and it'll break
the<00:05:47.080> spring<00:05:47.530> good<00:05:47.860> drop<00:05:48.100> a<00:05:48.130> vowel<00:05:48.460> could<00:05:49.000> Bend

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
the spring good drop a vowel could Bend

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.900 
the spring good drop a vowel could Bend
pushrods<00:05:49.840> could<00:05:50.200> bend<00:05:50.440> vows<00:05:50.680> okay<00:05:51.280> you<00:05:51.790> could

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
pushrods could bend vows okay you could

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.810 
pushrods could bend vows okay you could
have<00:05:52.060> a<00:05:52.090> very<00:05:52.330> serious<00:05:53.460> serious<00:05:54.460> engine

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820
