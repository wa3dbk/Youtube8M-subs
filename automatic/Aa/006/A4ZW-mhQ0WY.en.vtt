00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 at sportsfreunde I'm simon yours 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.150
 Muscle do I declare you in this 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.220
 why maybe with the one video 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.870
 or the other the expected one 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.700
 muscle growth is absent 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.469
 There are so many athletes trying 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.059
 yourself and especially when you are in the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.500
 gym just look around the one or 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.330
 you see other faces again and again 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.279
 but which gives this mega 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.270
 disciplined but have to simply 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.369
 certain points 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.920
 and there are just five reasons why 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.150
 the muscle growth that one expects 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.980
 that one wishes for that one 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.740
 perhaps working hard but 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.960
 Nevertheless , the first reason is missing 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.340
 you have no training plan in 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.020
 training plan gives the first 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.600
 line first of all a structure before so 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.890
 know what you have to do if you gem 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.780
 go or at home in the cellar 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.000
 starts to score so well what you know 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.719
 you have to work from a to 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.579
 z ago 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.829
 that is to say the order pretend 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.420
 the sentence number the repetition numbers in the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.160
 best case also other parameters 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.230
 are predetermined so you are exactly 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.539
 know what you have to do and have one 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.250
 very clear structure and structure is that 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.050
 half life I believe someone very much 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.910
 creative so a little structure as 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.710
 I can still do it very high 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.659
 So estimate a good training plan 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.549
 In any case, that is already what it is 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.150
 derive many other errors as well 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.619
 to let 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.510
 and who with a good training plan 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.100
 the power works first and foremost 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.189
 especially in terms of training one 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.380
 amount right so the second mistake is 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.240
 lack of endurance 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.159
 Although there are athletes who catch themselves 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.170
 to register in a cheap gym 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.210
 or buy the most blatant action 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.280
 really spend a lot of money and money 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.049
 spraying at the beginning of motivation 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.250
 yes that was the beginning and then 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.200
 then over time the motivation becomes 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.299
 always a little less 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.860
 of course it is in the end a few durchs 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.450
 so it really is not yet a question 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.799
 biceps from today to tomorrow thick 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.509
 that has meant that 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.700
 perseverance that very special 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.320
 important the motivation really has to be 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.040
 maintained over the entire period 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.380
 become 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.000
 and you just have the goal or even 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.049
 rather he has to go away as a goal 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.210
 be defined 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.100
 then you are only then able 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.570
 Are you even able to do this 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.399
 small progresses the granny too 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.200
 recognize reward and then you 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.969
 also to motivate it again 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.670
 As far as nutrition is concerned, it is said 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.409
 again and again 70 percent 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.330
 success makes the diet 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.130
 sounds very much now for the first time 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.959
 is it because that's actually the case 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.720
 nutrition is actually what it is 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.390
 much of the whole at the end of a success 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.610
 or causing failure means im 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.959
 plain text if a training extremely good 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.530
 and you really are capable of being tough too 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.090
 work out 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.310
 during training everything is there 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.840
 with stamina then do 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.010
 It can still be that if you 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.300
 your body just not the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.550
 corresponding building blocks for 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.690
 Muscle structure available that 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.280
 simply nothing will come of it 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.019
 that's always this example of what I am 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.790
 like to repeat you really have that 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.950
 most blatant architects you really have 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.989
 that the best concept you have is 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.390
 best construction workers the newest and 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.519
 most modern equipment to build a house 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.319
 but what the fans are simply missing is the 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.220
 mortar these are the stones and the whole 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.750
 building materials 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.000
 what should become of it if you have the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.620
 Greatest people committed but just 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.239
 on building material fun or nothing 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.989
 girlfriend you have the same with the 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.640
 nutrients 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.709
 so if it's too macro or micro 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.090
 nutrient deficiency is very special 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.380
 important perhaps in place the b 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.090
 vitamins will be back once 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.870
 just as well underestimates vegetarian 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.880
 vegan 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.859
 I also have a lot to do with vegans 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.329
 I myself am meatless eater you 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.680
 just have to be careful that you 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.450
 especially with the vitamins 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.650
 Ordinary cover have three straight 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.940
 this of course for the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.280
 energetic metabolism of 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.019
 protein carbohydrates and fatty acids 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.329
 There is not only a vitamin 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.310
 but the complete bandwidth of b1 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.269
 B12 should always be 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.980
 be covered 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.090
 the last point and I'll tell you so 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.100
 that it's usually just a convenient one 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.079
 excuse but there are a few cases 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.190
 That's where the really missing 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.930
 regeneration 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.459
 we all know hopefully that 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.500
 Muscle clock during the regeneration period 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.630
 of course, growing means in plain text 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.760
 the muscle grows after training 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.769
 and not during the workout 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.630
 So to charming composition and already 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.730
 Compensation then there is also this 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.540
 model of super compensation now 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.250
 maybe not so interesting 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.230
 but actually on the spot 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.700
 worth mentioning those are the points where 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.049
 many, of course, say yes, I believe 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.819
 I am in the training because of that 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.040
 nothing happens to me i'm just too 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.989
 it is not the case most of the time 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.780
 So there you would really have two or 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.630
 three workouts a day every day 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.489
 to the point of absolute muscle 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.530
 exhaustion of absolute collax from 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.220
 central nervous system day after day 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.629
 carry out 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.079
 that you really end up with it 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.479
 that would often count 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.349
 lack of regeneration muscle growth 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.909
 fails 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.049
 I'll tell you another thing 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.849
 human body extreme 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.960
 adaptable otherwise we would be even 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.400
 not here if the human body 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.960
 not in a position to be his 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.250
 environmental conditions the 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.000
 conditions accordingly 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.580
 adjust 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.110
 that's why you do not assume that you 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.120
 such a very small sensitive so 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.680
 something can hardly tolerate training and 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.449
 only rest breaks that is possible 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.909
 actually the diversion of already 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.930
 and then right compensation 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:45.150
 it also works with the 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.229
 Muscle development and when the growth is stimulating 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.509
 So muscle growth does not stay out 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.639
 if that does not happen then it's mostly relative 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.800
 little to do with lack of regeneration 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.780
 very few exceptions confirm this 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.129
 all right, I hope I have mine 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.629
 video also looks good on everyone 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.190
 case with me on facebook over the 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.930
 link to this is right below this video 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.509
 in the description see you in the 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.509
 next video many greetings your simon
