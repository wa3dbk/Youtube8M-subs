top<00:01:23.520> neatly<00:01:24.509> hidden<00:01:24.960> away<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
top neatly hidden away is the

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.390 
top neatly hidden away is the
instructions<00:01:27.659> manual<00:01:28.229> which<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.979> Chinese

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
instructions manual which is in Chinese

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.749 
instructions manual which is in Chinese
of<00:01:29.579> course<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.530> this<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> controller<00:01:32.670> of

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
of course and this is the controller of

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.450 
of course and this is the controller of
course<00:01:33.090> underneath<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.979> batteries

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
course underneath you have the batteries

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.520 
course underneath you have the batteries
that<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.780> power<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.140> controller

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
that is going to power this controller

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.490 
that is going to power this controller
so<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.640> has<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> built<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.020> battery<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
so this has not a built in battery and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980 
so this has not a built in battery and
you<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.619> see<00:01:40.890> from<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> design<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.850> very<00:01:42.720> very

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
you can see from the design is very very

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.359 
you can see from the design is very very
similar<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.950> Xbox<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:45.000> controller<00:01:45.030> has

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
similar to the Xbox one controller has

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.090 
similar to the Xbox one controller has
sticks<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.579> similar<00:01:48.180> places<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:49.380> design<00:01:49.950> of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
sticks in similar places the design of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.010 
sticks in similar places the design of
the<00:01:50.189> sticks<00:01:50.460> are<00:01:50.640> very<00:01:50.970> similar<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.810> of

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the sticks are very similar and of

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020 
the sticks are very similar and of
course<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> d-pad<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:53.070> pretty<00:01:53.490> much<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.820> same

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
course the d-pad is pretty much the same

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.030 
course the d-pad is pretty much the same
as<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.570> Xbox<00:01:54.780> controller<00:01:55.200> along<00:01:55.680> with<00:01:55.740> the

button<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.090> back<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.660> of

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
button and this is the back and of

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.660 
button and this is the back and of
course<00:02:16.350> this<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.710> options<00:02:17.130> button<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.580> you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
course this is the options button so you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.850 
course this is the options button so you
can<00:02:17.820> use<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.810> navigate<00:02:18.840> around<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
can use this to navigate around the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.490 
can use this to navigate around the
Android<00:02:20.340> menus<00:02:20.760> just<00:02:21.030> using<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.990> controllers

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
Android menus just using the controllers

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.790 
Android menus just using the controllers
sitting<00:02:22.920> away<00:02:23.130> from<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.790> TV<00:02:24.000> where<00:02:24.840> your<00:02:25.530> game

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
sitting away from the TV where your game

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.520 
sitting away from the TV where your game
box<00:02:26.070> might<00:02:26.340> be<00:02:26.490> connected<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.870> let's<00:02:28.140> pop<00:02:28.350> the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
box might be connected so let's pop the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.850 
box might be connected so let's pop the
batteries<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.930> design<00:02:31.200> as<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.500> said<00:02:31.709> is

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
batteries in the design as I said is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.220 
batteries in the design as I said is
pretty<00:02:32.130> much<00:02:32.330> very<00:02:33.330> very<00:02:33.540> similar<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.959> the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
pretty much very very similar to the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.430 
pretty much very very similar to the
Xbox<00:02:34.830> one<00:02:35.100> controller<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:36.200> they<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.290> done

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
Xbox one controller and they have done

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.740 
Xbox one controller and they have done
some<00:02:37.680> decent<00:02:38.220> things<00:02:38.820> about<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.510> guess

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
some decent things about this I guess

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.380 
some decent things about this I guess
the<00:02:40.290> finish<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.830> pretty<00:02:41.190> good<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.730> quality<00:02:42.300> of

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
the finish is pretty good the quality of

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.280 
the finish is pretty good the quality of
the<00:02:42.480> plastic<00:02:42.660> seems<00:02:43.260> pretty<00:02:43.980> good<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:45.290> yes

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
the plastic seems pretty good and yes

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.130 
the plastic seems pretty good and yes
the<00:02:46.500> ergonomic<00:02:47.040> feel<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.120> hands<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.630> also

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
the ergonomic feel in the hands is also

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.020 
the ergonomic feel in the hands is also
good<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.920> think<00:02:50.070> they<00:02:50.340> have<00:02:50.459> done<00:02:50.670> some

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
good so I think they have done some

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.990 
good so I think they have done some
things<00:02:51.330> right<00:02:51.690> with<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.709> controller<00:02:53.190> but

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
things right with this controller but

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.540 
things right with this controller but
it's<00:02:54.150> cheap<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.660> we<00:02:54.840> can't<00:02:55.140> expect<00:02:55.470> much<00:02:55.680> so

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
it's cheap so we can't expect much so

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.380 
it's cheap so we can't expect much so
anyway<00:02:56.850> let's<00:02:57.030> pop<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.750> batteries<00:02:58.170> in<00:02:59.390> so

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
anyway let's pop the batteries in so

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.840 
anyway let's pop the batteries in so
apparently<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.930> get<00:03:01.260> 80<00:03:01.590> hours<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.220> gameplay

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
apparently you get 80 hours of gameplay

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.960 
apparently you get 80 hours of gameplay
with<00:03:03.390> these<00:03:03.630> batteries<00:03:04.200> not<00:03:05.100> sure<00:03:05.400> how<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.910> is

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
with these batteries not sure how it is

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.729 
with these batteries not sure how it is
going<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.300> be<00:03:06.420> with<00:03:06.720> other<00:03:06.989> batteries<00:03:07.440> but<00:03:07.650> you

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
going to be with other batteries but you

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.010 
going to be with other batteries but you
can<00:03:07.860> use<00:03:08.040> any<00:03:08.250> double-a<00:03:08.850> sized<00:03:09.060> batteries<00:03:09.570> in

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
can use any double-a sized batteries in

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.330 
can use any double-a sized batteries in
this<00:03:10.650> controller<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.400> that's<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.090> idea<00:03:12.270> here

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
this controller so that's the idea here

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.910 
this controller so that's the idea here
so<00:03:14.340> now<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.640> batteries<00:03:15.420> are<00:03:15.600> in<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.959> hitting

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
so now the batteries are in and hitting

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.060 
so now the batteries are in and hitting
the<00:03:17.130> home<00:03:17.310> button<00:03:17.930> hitting<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.620> long<00:03:19.830> press

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
the home button hitting the long press

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.030 
the home button hitting the long press
will<00:03:20.700> initiate<00:03:21.090> pairing<00:03:22.049> so<00:03:22.680> I'm<00:03:22.769> going<00:03:22.950> to

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
will initiate pairing so I'm going to

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.770 
will initiate pairing so I'm going to
Pat<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:23.489> with<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.660> Xiaomi<00:03:25.350> me<00:03:25.650> 4i<00:03:26.570> which<00:03:27.570> is

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
Pat this with the Xiaomi me 4i which is

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.840 
Pat this with the Xiaomi me 4i which is
their<00:03:28.019> latest

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
their latest

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.880 
their latest
me3<00:03:29.850> replacement<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.750> country<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:31.799> I'm

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
going to be pad using this device and

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.130 
going to be pad using this device and
play<00:03:34.920> some<00:03:35.130> games<00:03:35.370> with<00:03:36.060> this<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.840> bear<00:03:37.110> with

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
play some games with this so bear with

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.810 
play some games with this so bear with
me<00:03:39.290> so<00:03:40.290> we<00:03:40.440> have<00:03:40.590> some<00:03:40.799> games<00:03:41.130> installed<00:03:41.579> here

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
me so we have some games installed here

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.530 
me so we have some games installed here
but<00:03:42.510> first<00:03:42.720> I'm<00:03:42.930> going<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.140> do<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.410> pairing

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
but first I'm going to do the pairing

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.910 
but first I'm going to do the pairing
alright<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:45.780> there<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.079> something<00:03:46.290> Chinese

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
alright so there is something Chinese

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.640 
alright so there is something Chinese
here<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.549> I'm<00:03:47.700> going<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:47.940> hit<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:49.230> start

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
here and I'm going to hit that and start

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.210 
here and I'm going to hit that and start
pairing<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:51.989> think<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.799> controller

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
pairing so I think it is the controller

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.229 
pairing so I think it is the controller
well<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.690> is<00:03:54.750> now<00:03:55.230> connecting<00:03:55.860> and

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
well it is it is now connecting and

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.970 
well it is it is now connecting and
connected<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.750> controller<00:03:58.170> so<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.500> can<00:03:58.799> use

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
connected to the controller so I can use

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.300 
connected to the controller so I can use
the<00:03:59.280> control<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.360> navigate<00:04:00.870> around<00:04:01.310> if

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
the control to navigate around if

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.180 
the control to navigate around if
possible<00:04:03.079> let's<00:04:04.079> see<00:04:04.290> if<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.530> goes<00:04:04.709> back

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.360 

nope<00:04:07.490> well<00:04:08.480> something<00:04:08.870> just<00:04:09.050> happened<00:04:09.470> well

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
nope well something just happened well

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.670 
nope well something just happened well
it<00:04:10.400> is<00:04:10.910> opening<00:04:11.300> up<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.660> multitasking<00:04:12.380> menu

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
it is opening up the multitasking menu

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.539 
it is opening up the multitasking menu
which<00:04:13.420> I'm<00:04:14.420> not<00:04:14.660> sure<00:04:14.930> why<00:04:15.140> but<00:04:15.440> let's<00:04:16.010> go<00:04:16.310> into

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
which I'm not sure why but let's go into

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.729 
which I'm not sure why but let's go into
a<00:04:16.580> game<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:16.970> tried<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:21.380> I'm<00:04:21.440> going<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.650> open

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
a game and tried it so I'm going to open

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.750 
a game and tried it so I'm going to open
Riptide<00:04:22.370> gp2<00:04:22.730> here<00:04:26.080> place<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:27.260> on<00:04:27.350> this<00:04:27.470> box<00:04:27.830> so

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
Riptide gp2 here place it on this box so

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.600 
Riptide gp2 here place it on this box so
that<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:29.000> can<00:04:29.150> see<00:04:29.680> so<00:04:30.680> that's<00:04:30.860> Riptide<00:04:31.460> gp2

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
that you can see so that's Riptide gp2

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.340 
that you can see so that's Riptide gp2
I'm<00:04:34.610> going<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:34.940> play<00:04:35.180> it<00:04:35.240> with<00:04:36.140> this

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
I'm going to play it with this

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.010 
I'm going to play it with this
controller<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:38.710> well<00:04:39.710> it<00:04:39.980> does<00:04:40.520> work<00:04:40.960> it<00:04:41.960> does

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
controller so well it does work it does

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.440 
controller so well it does work it does
work<00:04:42.410> and<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:42.770> can<00:04:42.920> see<00:04:43.130> that<00:04:43.420> there<00:04:44.420> is

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
work and you can see that there is

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.140 
work and you can see that there is
movement<00:04:45.050> on<00:04:45.230> the<00:04:45.470> screen<00:04:45.590> I<00:04:46.010> am<00:04:46.610> using<00:04:46.940> the

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
movement on the screen I am using the

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.260 
movement on the screen I am using the
controller<00:04:47.480> to<00:04:47.690> do<00:04:47.810> that<00:04:50.380> I'm<00:04:51.380> going<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:51.740> just

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
controller to do that I'm going to just

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.340 
controller to do that I'm going to just
hit<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.450> first<00:04:53.690> level<00:04:54.110> here<00:04:54.380> so<00:04:56.080> this<00:04:57.080> has<00:04:57.140> a

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
hit the first level here so this has a

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.370 
hit the first level here so this has a
three<00:04:57.650> axis<00:04:57.860> accelerometer<00:04:58.780> so<00:04:59.780> let's<00:05:00.050> see<00:05:00.230> if

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
three axis accelerometer so let's see if

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.910 
three axis accelerometer so let's see if
this<00:05:00.590> works<00:05:00.890> too<00:05:01.220> you<00:05:02.000> know<00:05:02.120> do<00:05:02.480> the

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
this works too you know do the

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.560 
this works too you know do the
left/right<00:05:03.920> controls<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:04.670> turning<00:05:05.030> here<00:05:05.390> in

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
left/right controls and turning here in

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.320 
left/right controls and turning here in
this<00:05:06.170> game<00:05:06.410> because<00:05:06.680> that<00:05:07.300> does<00:05:08.300> happen<00:05:10.330> so

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
this game because that does happen so

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.630 
this game because that does happen so
let's<00:05:11.600> let<00:05:11.960> me<00:05:12.110> just<00:05:12.320> show<00:05:12.530> this<00:05:12.740> this<00:05:13.400> has

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
let's let me just show this this has

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.630 
let's let me just show this this has
recognized<00:05:14.150> the<00:05:14.300> controller<00:05:14.720> and<00:05:15.050> says<00:05:15.650> pause

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
recognized the controller and says pause

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.790 
recognized the controller and says pause
the<00:05:16.820> game<00:05:17.000> by<00:05:17.240> touching<00:05:17.600> the<00:05:17.930> button<00:05:18.260> on<00:05:18.440> top

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
the game by touching the button on top

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.860 
the game by touching the button on top
left<00:05:19.130> of<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.340> screen<00:05:19.460> or<00:05:19.880> by<00:05:20.120> pressing<00:05:20.360> start

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
left of the screen or by pressing start

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.350 
left of the screen or by pressing start
on<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.380> gamepad<00:05:21.800> controller<00:05:22.280> so<00:05:22.850> it<00:05:22.880> has

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
on the gamepad controller so it has

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.060 
on the gamepad controller so it has
recognized<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:24.140> gamepad<00:05:24.620> controller

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
recognized the gamepad controller

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:32.250 
recognized the gamepad controller
appropriately<00:05:25.880> I'm<00:05:26.330> going<00:05:26.510> to<00:05:26.570> just<00:05:26.720> hit<00:05:26.919> OK

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.080 

all<00:05:32.770> right<00:05:33.130> so<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.580> three<00:05:33.790> axis

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
all right so the three axis

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.570 
all right so the three axis
accelerometer<00:05:34.600> doesn't<00:05:35.290> work<00:05:35.530> but<00:05:35.830> because

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
accelerometer doesn't work but because

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.270 
accelerometer doesn't work but because
the<00:05:36.700> analog<00:05:37.060> sticks<00:05:37.360> work<00:05:37.740> you<00:05:38.740> can<00:05:38.830> see<00:05:39.100> the

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
the analog sticks work you can see the

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.310 
the analog sticks work you can see the
game<00:05:39.490> playing<00:05:39.820> in<00:05:39.970> the<00:05:40.030> background

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.800 

apparently<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.590> joystick<00:05:45.520> also<00:05:46.030> supports

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
apparently the joystick also supports

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.520 
apparently the joystick also supports
Rumble<00:05:47.620> with<00:05:48.220> a<00:05:48.250> vibration<00:05:48.850> motor<00:05:49.030> inside

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
Rumble with a vibration motor inside

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.160 
Rumble with a vibration motor inside
that<00:05:50.530> does<00:05:50.800> not<00:05:51.100> work<00:05:51.460> yet<00:05:51.940> on<00:05:52.240> this<00:05:52.690> so<00:05:53.110> I'm

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
that does not work yet on this so I'm

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.880 
that does not work yet on this so I'm
going<00:05:53.350> to<00:05:53.380> try<00:05:54.270> well<00:05:55.270> no<00:05:55.450> it<00:05:55.690> doesn't<00:05:55.990> work<00:05:56.170> but

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
going to try well no it doesn't work but

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.160 
going to try well no it doesn't work but
I<00:05:57.220> am<00:05:57.460> sure<00:05:57.760> it<00:05:57.970> will<00:05:58.060> work<00:05:58.360> with<00:05:58.630> other<00:05:58.840> games

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
I am sure it will work with other games

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:04.230 
I am sure it will work with other games
and<00:06:00.210> probably<00:06:01.210> other<00:06:02.010> devices<00:06:03.010> too<00:06:03.460> so<00:06:04.060> it

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
and probably other devices too so it

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.050 
and probably other devices too so it
might<00:06:04.840> need<00:06:05.080> some<00:06:05.440> support<00:06:05.520> for<00:06:06.520> example<00:06:06.970> it

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
might need some support for example it

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.900 
might need some support for example it
might<00:06:07.560> work<00:06:08.560> with<00:06:08.770> a<00:06:08.830> game<00:06:09.420> specific<00:06:10.420> device

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
might work with a game specific device

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.450 
might work with a game specific device
like<00:06:12.910> the<00:06:13.090> me<00:06:13.240> box<00:06:13.510> perhaps<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:14.290> me<00:06:14.410> box<00:06:14.680> is

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
like the me box perhaps the me box is

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.790 
like the me box perhaps the me box is
concentrated<00:06:16.300> on<00:06:16.420> media<00:06:16.810> and<00:06:16.870> gaming<00:06:17.440> so

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
concentrated on media and gaming so

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.830 
concentrated on media and gaming so
possibly<00:06:18.220> the<00:06:18.430> the<00:06:18.850> rumble<00:06:19.150> works<00:06:19.390> with<00:06:19.630> that

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
possibly the the rumble works with that

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.520 
possibly the the rumble works with that
but<00:06:20.770> with<00:06:21.070> Riptide<00:06:21.520> gp2<00:06:21.880> doesn't<00:06:22.420> work<00:06:22.600> but

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
but with Riptide gp2 doesn't work but

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.960 
but with Riptide gp2 doesn't work but
you<00:06:23.590> can<00:06:23.710> see<00:06:23.950> that<00:06:24.130> the<00:06:24.280> joystick<00:06:24.730> still

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
you can see that the joystick still

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.590 
you can see that the joystick still
works<00:06:25.240> with<00:06:25.930> analog<00:06:26.410> controls<00:06:27.360> so<00:06:28.360> I'm<00:06:28.420> going

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
works with analog controls so I'm going

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.590 
works with analog controls so I'm going
to<00:06:28.660> stop<00:06:28.870> playing<00:06:29.050> here<00:06:29.440> and<00:06:30.030> head<00:06:31.030> home<00:06:31.300> so

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
to stop playing here and head home so

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.270 
to stop playing here and head home so
the<00:06:31.780> me<00:06:31.960> button<00:06:32.350> will<00:06:32.560> take<00:06:32.740> you<00:06:32.950> home<00:06:33.270> this<00:06:34.270> is

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
the me button will take you home this is

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.550 
the me button will take you home this is
this<00:06:36.280> does<00:06:36.520> nothing<00:06:36.700> but<00:06:37.570> anyway<00:06:37.990> that<00:06:38.230> was

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
this does nothing but anyway that was

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.840 
this does nothing but anyway that was
what<00:06:39.340> you<00:06:39.850> saw<00:06:40.240> the<00:06:40.300> me<00:06:41.110> controller<00:06:41.710> in<00:06:42.070> action

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
what you saw the me controller in action

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.750 
what you saw the me controller in action
the<00:06:43.000> me<00:06:43.150> gamepad<00:06:43.660> controller<00:06:44.110> it<00:06:45.040> looks<00:06:45.490> good

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760 
the me gamepad controller it looks good

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.930 
the me gamepad controller it looks good
it<00:06:46.270> feels<00:06:47.020> good<00:06:47.200> in<00:06:47.380> the<00:06:47.470> hands<00:06:47.740> that<00:06:47.950> matters

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
it feels good in the hands that matters

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.730 
it feels good in the hands that matters
more<00:06:49.180> when<00:06:49.510> it<00:06:49.630> comes<00:06:49.840> to<00:06:49.990> gaming<00:06:50.350> and<00:06:50.560> it's

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
more when it comes to gaming and it's

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.890 
more when it comes to gaming and it's
wireless<00:06:51.040> they<00:06:52.000> say<00:06:52.210> it<00:06:52.330> works<00:06:52.570> across

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 
wireless they say it works across

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.250 
wireless they say it works across
devices<00:06:53.500> but<00:06:54.280> we<00:06:54.640> are<00:06:54.730> not<00:06:54.880> sure<00:06:55.120> yet<00:06:55.390> but<00:06:55.690> we

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
devices but we are not sure yet but we

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.930 
devices but we are not sure yet but we
will<00:06:56.470> test<00:06:56.680> it<00:06:56.890> and<00:06:57.130> let<00:06:57.370> you<00:06:57.490> know<00:06:57.640> in<00:06:57.910> the

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
will test it and let you know in the

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.520 
will test it and let you know in the
full<00:06:58.240> review<00:06:58.450> later<00:06:58.750> you<00:06:59.020> can<00:06:59.140> check<00:06:59.350> it<00:06:59.440> out

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
full review later you can check it out
