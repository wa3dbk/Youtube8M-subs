00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:04.179
 Automatically translated by the machine. This is my favorite summer hairstyle. 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:04.970
 It is perfect for hot weather as it makes your neck hair. 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.100
 If it's enough needles to be ridiculously sturdy, it's perfect for windy days or bad hair days. 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.360
 You will need a brush, pin, hair relationship and some decorations. 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.410
 Brush your hair and part of the waist to divide into two parts. 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.410
 One of the parts that is tied into a ponytail to keep it in the way. 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:42.199
 You may want the edge of the needle and any layers to leave 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.690
 Come down. The other parts of your hair tweezers are tight 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.260
 To the end. You need to get started, so donkey 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.710
 The first step is to pay back, not the basis. 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.880
 This will ensure that one side of your head is lying flat. 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.990
 Tied it as close as possible to the end of the year. 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.030
 Now repeat on the other side, but don't turn it off at this time. 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.060
 If this style of work is short hair, many people ask, the answer is yes. 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.090
 Just put the hair part, so the scorpion starts on the side of your head. 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.890
 Take a nap and pull up on the top of the head. 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.790
 Slide it to the place where the scorpion is held at the end of the scorpion. 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.790
 You may need more than one pin, but it just needs to stay for a minute while we fix 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.730
 the other side. Remove the tie and pull it from the other dice 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.730
 It and the other side of your head. As the first dice to follow the same line 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.370
 They span at the top. The beginning of the dice at the ends of the armpit 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.459
 The other one. The needle is in place. 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.459
 Now, the first pleat will start on the top so that both ends are hidden. 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.650
 You should add both sides of the pin. You can see the ends that are hidden on the left side 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:42.069
 Very good, but the people on the right need to be crushed more. 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:49.069
 I used the technique of pinning the scorpion to grab a bit from the scalp, 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.979
 Pull away, turn the needle again and slide it down. 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:04.729
 The distortion makes it very safe. Now it's just a straightening or 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:09.069
 Your face curls at the edges and around the layers. 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:16.069
 And added some beautiful accessories. I think I made the daisy chain. 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.560
 In the past, I also used small bows and fake flowers, and anything will happen. 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.860
 And it's all over. Lovely, sweet, very beautiful in summer. 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.860
 This is a bit fantastic. So it is perfect to imagine that you are in a 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.680
 Romantic novels and flowers your days stare at the window with eagerness and wait for a lost 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.680
 Love. I hope this is a useful video, please check
