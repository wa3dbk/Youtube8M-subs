00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:14.490
 Sprinter torino 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:21.120
 Although this car is it's an era that has been fine-tuning in Koshimizu motor sports 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.789
 Basically it can be said that it is one that has left much of the goodness of 86 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.169
 The engine is 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.169
 Based on 4 engines 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.870
 Necessary bar size piston and 256 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:38.660
 156 which cam is put 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.300
 Sports 4 has become a little practical use was also left specifications shook and if 86 Juie this 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:47.020
 Beginning 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:50.420
 Good but I think a very smooth of is can be seen from the situation you are driving 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.589
 Can be adjusted separately with expansion and contraction 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:59.079
 The moist textured foot contains a tasteful suspension 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:04.309
 What about what try actually given where said 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:09.380
 The car originally called 86 is that time 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:12.680
 The normal leg of the prince is so soft and it is Toyota 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.409
 It may be natural to say so because it is Toyota 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.200
 Very practical 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:21.610
 I was important 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:25.710
 That's good for us as a sports driver 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.840
 Image of feels like say Do I Ya to give Cho button 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.230
 That 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.780
 Everyone's car buttons and stiffening 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:39.930
 I always had sports driving 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.930
 The say 86 surviving in such Fu something now to reverse the 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.340
 Collection which tastes such a place completely differently 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:52.159
 I became an adult 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.159
 Because there is a very part that I know selfish 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.909
 Suspension stroke 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:04.510
 Groundability While securing such things as much as possible 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:07.290
 Cutlet of this 86 specific rear 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.929
 Motion of rigid axle 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.269
 Do not erase 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.810
 That's the tail can also run I Do not tried to run while subtly slide if Hashire abandon 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.810
 There is 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.030
 2 chan something is normal now 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:30.690
 Very 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:32.680
 There is another breath of the 86 in a Daiaji Daiaji For example, in this kind of place 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.100
 Hi Land by all means 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.100
 It will be March when connecting the marks 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.590
 Color 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:45.830
 I also say that this is also a long stroke feeling 86 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.060
 There is still a feeling of being calm 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.690
 The current engine speed is around 4500 rpm 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.850
 Hmm 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.870
 5000 rotations separately 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.180
 The top operates up to the limit of 7,000 revolutions 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.600
 It's not that I'm doing my best 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.800
 Still 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.570
 I said at the beginning though 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.570
 Buy a torque for free 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.959
 If you run while taking advantage of this 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.959
 Very spot 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:23.020
 Honda's 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:26.340
 even though there's I'm also good to say if whether open'd Khan Khan vtec 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.450
 While this spring is better 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:36.010
 I still feel 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:36.010
 Compact Ne od so I have speed too much 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.340
 I can run happily 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.670
 Finish the performance and adjust the curvature of the corner 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.870
 is 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.650
 Pause and go barely fit 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.650
 Firmly in 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.330
 Accel on from the middle of this 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:01.000
 I will go like that 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.000
 I think you think tiny sports Camilla Ntte per in 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.850
 The tire is this car 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.520
 To mainstream Well, that's ... 86 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.520
 hq tamaru 15 printing 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.070
 10 fiscal Well it was popular 20 years ago 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.760
 Life size than life size 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:26.330
 Though it is big 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:28.650
 Because internal withdrawal is suppressed so as not to change it 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.689
 fundamentally 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.210
 I feel that the side sewing of the tire is tight with that radio 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:42.710
 2 people 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:46.490
 It was found a decent Gima of technology because there is a feeling close to the car of the horse 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.810
 17 or that oneself 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.810
 If there is a choice 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:05:01.319
 I can do it with a modern car 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:01.319
 Where is the fun that there is no sense of incongruity even if you switch directly 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.140
 Bad do 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:12.210
 Or you can enjoy something like compact light that you ca n't taste with other companies 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.210
 Hmm
