00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.510 
so I think I'm giving the body a bit
more<00:01:53.720> time<00:01:53.990> to<00:01:54.020> adjust<00:01:54.320> this<00:01:54.710> time<00:01:55.010> so<00:01:55.250> I'm<00:01:55.280> not

absolute<00:03:07.220> death<00:03:07.489> but<00:03:07.909> I<00:03:08.180> didn't<00:03:08.720> frog<00:03:09.019> this

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
absolute death but I didn't frog this

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.380 
absolute death but I didn't frog this
week<00:03:09.560> look<00:03:09.829> at<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.040> last<00:03:10.310> week<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:10.909> that's

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
week look at the last week so that's

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.410 
week look at the last week so that's
always<00:03:11.629> a<00:03:11.750> positive<00:03:12.079> for<00:03:12.560> me<00:03:15.010> apart<00:03:16.010> from<00:03:16.310> that

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
always a positive for me apart from that

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.599 
always a positive for me apart from that
my<00:03:17.420> measurements<00:03:18.079> in<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.769> good<00:03:18.980> areas<00:03:19.430> of

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
my measurements in the good areas of

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.509 
my measurements in the good areas of
stock<00:03:19.910> answer<00:03:20.329> I<00:03:20.840> want<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.709> go<00:03:21.890> down<00:03:22.099> I<00:03:22.280> think

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
stock answer I want a go down I think

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.039 
stock answer I want a go down I think
I'm<00:03:22.640> starting<00:03:22.849> to<00:03:23.000> get<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.209> little<00:03:23.299> bit<00:03:23.420> flat<00:03:23.840> up

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
I'm starting to get a little bit flat up

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.589 
I'm starting to get a little bit flat up
which<00:03:24.319> means<00:03:24.620> i<00:03:25.069> think<00:03:25.970> i<00:03:26.060> need<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.329> increase

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
which means i think i need to increase

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.800 
which means i think i need to increase
my<00:03:26.810> carbs<00:03:27.230> again<00:03:27.500> slightly<00:03:28.540> what<00:03:29.540> I'm<00:03:29.629> going

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
my carbs again slightly what I'm going

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.569 
my carbs again slightly what I'm going
to<00:03:29.840> stop<00:03:30.049> doing<00:03:30.290> later<00:03:30.620> on<00:03:30.829> is<00:03:31.040> introduced

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
to stop doing later on is introduced

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.180 
to stop doing later on is introduced
carb<00:03:31.909> cycling<00:03:32.299> as<00:03:32.659> well<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:33.620> that's<00:03:33.890> going<00:03:34.129> to

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
carb cycling as well so that's going to

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.119 
carb cycling as well so that's going to
really<00:03:34.430> bring<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.060> fat<00:03:35.450> off<00:03:35.629> nicely<00:03:35.959> but<00:03:36.859> at

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
really bring the fat off nicely but at

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.619 
really bring the fat off nicely but at
the<00:03:37.250> moment<00:03:37.400> i<00:03:37.730> think<00:03:37.940> my<00:03:38.060> calories<00:03:38.480> are<00:03:38.599> a

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
the moment i think my calories are a

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.479 
the moment i think my calories are a
little<00:03:38.780> bit<00:03:38.989> too<00:03:39.260> low<00:03:39.620> what<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.280> did<00:03:40.459> was

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
little bit too low what I did was

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.069 
little bit too low what I did was
actually<00:03:40.879> measure<00:03:41.090> my<00:03:41.269> calories<00:03:41.690> this<00:03:41.840> week

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
actually measure my calories this week

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.740 
actually measure my calories this week
and<00:03:42.409> on<00:03:43.280> certain<00:03:43.849> days<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.239> was<00:03:44.359> only<00:03:44.450> getting

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
and on certain days I was only getting

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.780 
and on certain days I was only getting
maybe<00:03:45.590> 1600<00:03:46.519> calories<00:03:47.169> 1600<00:03:48.169> and<00:03:48.790> that's

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
maybe 1600 calories 1600 and that's

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.909 
maybe 1600 calories 1600 and that's
nowhere<00:03:50.180> near<00:03:50.389> enough<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:51.049> maintain<00:03:51.230> the

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
nowhere near enough to maintain the

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.960 
nowhere near enough to maintain the
muscles<00:03:52.450> on<00:03:53.450> my<00:03:53.660> body<00:03:53.900> so

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
muscles on my body so

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.830 
muscles on my body so
not<00:03:55.300> go<00:03:55.450> up<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.780> about<00:03:56.280> 2200<00:03:57.280> I<00:03:57.370> think

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
not go up to about 2200 I think

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.370 
not go up to about 2200 I think
increased<00:03:58.840> protein<00:03:59.080> increased<00:03:59.680> carbs

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
increased protein increased carbs

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.590 
increased protein increased carbs
and<00:04:01.470> then<00:04:02.120> hopefully<00:04:03.120> they'll<00:04:03.270> keep<00:04:03.450> my

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
and then hopefully they'll keep my

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.710 
and then hopefully they'll keep my
muscles<00:04:03.960> were<00:04:04.020> there<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:05.730> mean<00:04:06.210> that<00:04:06.390> nothing

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
muscles were there I mean that nothing

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.410 
muscles were there I mean that nothing
new<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.990> update<00:04:07.350> our<00:04:08.210> measurements<00:04:09.210> in<00:04:09.300> my

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
new to update our measurements in my

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.930 
new to update our measurements in my
arms<00:04:09.870> looking<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.590> little<00:04:10.740> bit<00:04:10.920> flatter<00:04:11.250> than

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
arms looking a little bit flatter than

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.230 
arms looking a little bit flatter than
that<00:04:12.650> nothing<00:04:13.650> much<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:13.980> report<00:04:14.010> all<00:04:14.970> right
