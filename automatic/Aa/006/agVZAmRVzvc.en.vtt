00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.209 
show you what peel a star if you go to
your<00:00:07.319> ex<00:00:07.620> core<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.360> is<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> new<00:00:09.750> file<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:11.040> you

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
your ex core and is a new file that you

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.600 
your ex core and is a new file that you
make<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.429> new<00:00:11.610> project<00:00:12.059> first<00:00:13.219> let's<00:00:14.219> call<00:00:14.490> it

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
make a new project first let's call it

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.029 
make a new project first let's call it
view<00:00:15.000> based<00:00:15.210> application<00:00:16.490> free<00:00:17.490> list<00:00:18.800> app<00:00:20.689> and

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
view based application free list app and

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.880 
view based application free list app and
finish<00:00:23.039> what<00:00:23.640> they<00:00:23.880> are<00:00:24.029> basically<00:00:24.390> they<00:00:24.869> r<00:00:24.990> NS

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
finish what they are basically they r NS

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.939 
finish what they are basically they r NS
dictionaries<00:00:26.869> converted<00:00:27.869> into<00:00:27.960> file<00:00:28.410> format

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
dictionaries converted into file format

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.820 
dictionaries converted into file format
so<00:00:29.760> let<00:00:30.000> me<00:00:30.029> make<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.720> little<00:00:30.840> smaller<00:00:31.050> let's

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
so let me make it a little smaller let's

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.440 
so let me make it a little smaller let's
go<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> one<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.399> peel<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.730> true<00:00:32.880> there's

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
go to one of the peel is true there's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.389 
go to one of the peel is true there's
already<00:00:33.600> plist<00:00:34.170> file<00:00:34.590> included<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
already plist file included in the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.700 
already plist file included in the
project<00:00:35.610> which<00:00:36.000> gives<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.540> key<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.649> value

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
project which gives you key and value

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.979 
project which gives you key and value
and<00:00:38.280> what<00:00:38.430> type<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.059> fish<00:00:39.329> string<00:00:39.690> if

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and what type it is a fish string if

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.500 
and what type it is a fish string if
it's<00:00:40.200> boolean<00:00:40.620> array<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.879> how<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.360> have

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it's boolean array you how you can have

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.090 
it's boolean array you how you can have
dictionaries<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.559> dictionary

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
dictionaries you can have dictionary

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.770 
dictionaries you can have dictionary
inside<00:00:44.370> dictionaries<00:00:44.910> erasing<00:00:45.539> side

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
inside dictionaries erasing side

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.510 
inside dictionaries erasing side
dictionaries<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.469> bunch<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.190> different

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
dictionaries a bunch of different

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.220 
dictionaries a bunch of different
variables<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.210> think<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.629> them<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
variables you can think of them as a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.090 
variables you can think of them as a
nice<00:00:49.890> way<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.160> format<00:00:50.640> your<00:00:51.320> variables<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.980> let

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
nice way to format your variables so let

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.240 
nice way to format your variables so let
me<00:00:53.219> go<00:00:53.370> ahead<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.610> make<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> plist<00:00:54.539> file<00:00:55.100> let<00:00:56.100> me

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
me go ahead and make a plist file let me

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.189 
me go ahead and make a plist file let me
show<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.820> basic<00:00:57.360> pillars<00:00:57.660> file

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
show you how a basic pillars file

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.400 
show you how a basic pillars file
actually<00:00:58.890> looks<00:00:59.370> like<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.090> say<00:01:00.410> open

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
actually looks like if I just say open

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.920 
actually looks like if I just say open
it<00:01:01.530> as<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> source<00:01:02.579> core<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.570> will<00:01:03.690> see<00:01:03.750> that

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
it as a source core so you will see that

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.280 
it as a source core so you will see that
it<00:01:04.739> has<00:01:04.799> some<00:01:05.430> XML<00:01:05.909> file<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.869> looks<00:01:07.110> like

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
it has some XML file it looks like

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.530 
it has some XML file it looks like
there's<00:01:07.590> some<00:01:07.650> key<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:10.040> drinky<00:01:11.119> drinky<00:01:12.119> trend

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
there's some key and drinky drinky trend

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.890 
there's some key and drinky drinky trend
so<00:01:13.110> key<00:01:13.320> value<00:01:13.619> pairs<00:01:13.890> race<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.540> an<00:01:15.689> array

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
so key value pairs race are in an array

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.060 
so key value pairs race are in an array
format<00:01:17.030> for<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.060> particular<00:01:18.420> key<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.860> that's

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
format for the particular key so that's

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100 
format for the particular key so that's
how<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.490> looks<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.909> if<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.540> source<00:01:21.810> for

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
how it looks like if you do source for

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.149 
how it looks like if you do source for
but<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.250> how<00:01:23.750> expertly<00:01:24.750> said<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.439> let's

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
but this is how expertly said as let's

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.929 
but this is how expertly said as let's
make<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.369> new<00:01:26.640> file<00:01:27.090> call<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.579> find

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
make a new file call it you can find

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.499 
make a new file call it you can find
that<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.680> inside<00:01:31.970> resources<00:01:32.970> actually

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
that in inside resources actually

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.679 
that in inside resources actually
resource<00:01:34.460> property<00:01:35.460> list<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.710> let's<00:01:37.710> call<00:01:38.009> it

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
resource property list and let's call it

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.740 
resource property list and let's call it
global<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> place<00:01:41.490> where<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:42.000> save<00:01:42.570> all

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
global so a place where you can save all

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.260 
global so a place where you can save all
your<00:01:42.780> global<00:01:43.290> values<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.310> by<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:44.909> doing<00:01:45.090> that

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
your global values so by for doing that

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.969 
your global values so by for doing that
you<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> sit<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.470> add<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> row<00:01:46.920> you

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
you have to sit for to add a row you

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.910 
you have to sit for to add a row you
have<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.460> say<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:48.540> click<00:01:48.810> add<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.320> row<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
have to say right click add a row and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.580 
have to say right click add a row and
you<00:01:50.490> will<00:01:50.579> say<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> new<00:01:50.939> item<00:01:51.329> cuz<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> name<00:01:52.350> is

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
you will say a new item cuz the name is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.539 
you will say a new item cuz the name is
a<00:01:52.829> strange<00:01:53.520> much<00:01:53.790> sex<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.189> my<00:01:56.369> name

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
a strange much sex and like you my name

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.649 
a strange much sex and like you my name
so<00:01:57.479> that's<00:01:57.659> how<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.840> save<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.439> new<00:01:59.219> row<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.060> I'll

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
so that's how I save a new row and I'll

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.109 
so that's how I save a new row and I'll
say<00:02:01.130> address<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.960> i<00:02:03.960> will<00:02:04.110> say<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.799> an

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
say address and i will say this is an

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.080 
say address and i will say this is an
array<00:02:07.849> and<00:02:09.020> i<00:02:10.020> can<00:02:10.289> say<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.640> i<00:02:11.760> were<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.970> add

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
array and i can say and if i were to add

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.460 
array and i can say and if i were to add
something<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.959> have

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
something to it I have

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.370 
something to it I have
to<00:02:13.560> such<00:02:13.770> do<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.490> say<00:02:15.060> our<00:02:15.360> DRO<00:02:15.660> should

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
to such do this and say our DRO should

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.530 
to such do this and say our DRO should
have<00:02:16.500> added<00:02:16.860> inside<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.850> close<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.210> and

now I want to display it spontaneous log
percentage<00:05:30.660> at<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:30.960> rate<00:05:31.110> I'm<00:05:31.350> going<00:05:31.380> to

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
percentage at the rate I'm going to

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.230 
percentage at the rate I'm going to
defer<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.490> string<00:05:32.790> so<00:05:33.000> i<00:05:33.060> will<00:05:33.180> say<00:05:33.390> that

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
defer to the string so i will say that

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.230 
defer to the string so i will say that
object<00:05:36.240> for<00:05:36.510> key<00:05:36.980> what<00:05:37.980> is<00:05:38.100> the<00:05:38.220> first<00:05:38.550> object

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
object for key what is the first object

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.790 
object for key what is the first object
on<00:05:39.390> top<00:05:39.630> name<00:05:39.960> so<00:05:40.860> i<00:05:40.920> will<00:05:41.070> just<00:05:41.100> say<00:05:42.350> name<00:05:43.350> so

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
on top name so i will just say name so

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.130 
on top name so i will just say name so
it<00:05:43.860> will<00:05:44.010> care<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:44.610> give<00:05:44.820> me<00:05:45.000> whatever<00:05:45.930> the

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
it will care and give me whatever the

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.820 
it will care and give me whatever the
key<00:05:46.470> is<00:05:46.650> for<00:05:46.980> the<00:05:47.130> name<00:05:47.310> so<00:05:48.000> there<00:05:48.570> we<00:05:48.660> go<00:05:48.830> to

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
key is for the name so there we go to

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.470 
key is for the name so there we go to
close<00:05:50.280> this<00:05:50.520> and<00:05:50.790> let's<00:05:51.600> see<00:05:51.720> if<00:05:51.780> it<00:05:51.900> runs<00:05:53.480> said

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
close this and let's see if it runs said

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.890 
close this and let's see if it runs said
to<00:05:55.170> simulator<00:05:55.770> and<00:05:56.160> run<00:05:56.460> it<00:05:59.510> so<00:06:00.510> to<00:06:00.660> access

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
to simulator and run it so to access

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.260 
to simulator and run it so to access
that<00:06:01.380> particular<00:06:01.920> one<00:06:02.400> and<00:06:02.640> it<00:06:02.730> will<00:06:02.880> log<00:06:03.090> it

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
that particular one and it will log it

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.020 
that particular one and it will log it
out<00:06:03.450> so<00:06:04.410> nothing<00:06:05.010> will<00:06:05.130> be<00:06:05.310> shown<00:06:05.580> in<00:06:05.610> the

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
out so nothing will be shown in the

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.240 
out so nothing will be shown in the
iPhone<00:06:06.720> because<00:06:07.200> it's<00:06:07.350> a<00:06:07.440> few<00:06:07.560> country<00:06:08.040> based

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
in here you see the name shows up wave

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.250 
in here you see the name shows up wave
in<00:06:15.870> Adana<00:06:16.370> similarly<00:06:17.370> i<00:06:17.400> can<00:06:17.550> use<00:06:17.970> it<00:06:18.260> for

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
in Adana similarly i can use it for

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:26.050 
in Adana similarly i can use it for
other<00:06:19.470> things<00:06:19.650> so<00:06:20.430> I<00:06:20.490> want<00:06:20.790> to<00:06:21.410> display<00:06:23.840> the

to that ad ress spelling mistake common
things<00:07:01.400> so<00:07:01.610> if<00:07:01.699> you<00:07:01.850> do<00:07:01.970> a<00:07:02.030> spelling<00:07:02.240> which<00:07:02.419> to

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
things so if you do a spelling which to

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.140 
things so if you do a spelling which to
get<00:07:02.750> one<00:07:02.930> place<00:07:03.280> do<00:07:04.280> it<00:07:04.430> everywhere<00:07:06.940> go<00:07:07.940> ahead

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.150 
get one place do it everywhere go ahead

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.110 
get one place do it everywhere go ahead
and<00:07:08.360> run<00:07:08.570> it<00:07:08.750> I<00:07:08.930> should<00:07:09.289> give<00:07:09.470> me<00:07:09.590> a<00:07:09.620> dictionary

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
and run it I should give me a dictionary

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.650 
and run it I should give me a dictionary
so<00:07:11.120> there<00:07:11.330> we<00:07:11.419> go<00:07:11.449> dictionary<00:07:12.260> with

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:13.660 
so there we go dictionary with
