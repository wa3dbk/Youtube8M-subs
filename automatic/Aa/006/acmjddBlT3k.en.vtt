00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
geared more towards our street cars we

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.630 
geared more towards our street cars we
want<00:02:54.879> good<00:02:55.030> handling<00:02:56.069> but<00:02:57.069> they'll<00:02:57.219> want<00:02:57.430> the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
want good handling but they'll want the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.949 
want good handling but they'll want the
all<00:02:57.939> the<00:02:58.060> noise<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:58.269> get<00:02:58.659> we<00:02:58.780> have<00:02:58.810> a

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
all the noise you get we have a

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.110 
all the noise you get we have a
spherical<00:02:59.469> on<00:02:59.560> both<00:02:59.739> ends<00:03:00.069> having<00:03:00.969> the

bushing on the floorboard mount keeps

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.119 
bushing on the floorboard mount keeps
things<00:03:03.970> pretty<00:03:04.060> quiet<00:03:04.569> but<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.709> still<00:03:05.980> have

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
things pretty quiet but you still have

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.360 
things pretty quiet but you still have
your<00:03:06.280> spherical<00:03:06.760> end<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:08.500> take<00:03:08.709> out<00:03:08.920> most<00:03:09.159> of

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
your spherical end to take out most of

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.819 
your spherical end to take out most of
the<00:03:09.430> bind<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.260> really<00:03:11.290> improves<00:03:11.799> handling

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
the bind so it really improves handling

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.319 
the bind so it really improves handling
one<00:03:14.829> other<00:03:14.950> thing<00:03:15.069> we<00:03:15.370> wanted<00:03:15.609> to<00:03:15.670> show<00:03:15.939> you<00:03:16.000> is

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
one other thing we wanted to show you is

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.390 
one other thing we wanted to show you is
we're<00:03:16.540> using<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:17.049> fluted<00:03:17.680> polyurethane

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
we're using a fluted polyurethane

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.390 
we're using a fluted polyurethane
bushing<00:03:19.409> if<00:03:20.409> you<00:03:20.530> look<00:03:20.650> at<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.799> inside<00:03:21.189> of<00:03:21.250> the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
bushing if you look at the inside of the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.129 
bushing if you look at the inside of the
bush<00:03:21.579> and<00:03:21.609> you<00:03:21.819> see<00:03:22.000> those<00:03:22.150> grooves<00:03:22.569> that<00:03:22.840> run

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
bush and you see those grooves that run

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.759 
bush and you see those grooves that run
the<00:03:23.260> length<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:24.669> inside<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.209> bushing

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
the length of the inside of the bushing

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.080 
the length of the inside of the bushing
those<00:03:26.769> are<00:03:26.950> called<00:03:27.129> flutes<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:27.760> what<00:03:27.909> that

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
those are called flutes and what that

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.289 
those are called flutes and what that
allows<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.780> grease<00:03:29.109> to<00:03:29.349> flow<00:03:30.030> between<00:03:31.030> the

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
allows is grease to flow between the

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.330 
allows is grease to flow between the
bolts<00:03:31.599> leave<00:03:31.840> in<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.109> bushing<00:03:32.530> over<00:03:33.220> the

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
bolts leave in the bushing over the

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.330 
bolts leave in the bushing over the
entire<00:03:33.609> length<00:03:33.879> of<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.239> sleeve<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:36.220> you'll

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
entire length of the sleeve so you'll

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.860 
entire length of the sleeve so you'll
have<00:03:36.430> grease<00:03:36.760> there<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.239> you<00:03:37.329> also<00:03:37.480> have<00:03:37.659> been

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
have grease there and you also have been

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.300 
have grease there and you also have been
rounding<00:03:38.200> outside<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.709> bushing<00:03:39.069> when<00:03:39.220> you

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
rounding outside the bushing when you

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.240 
rounding outside the bushing when you
grease<00:03:39.579> it<00:03:39.819> through<00:03:40.689> the<00:03:40.810> grease<00:03:41.019> fitting<00:03:41.439> so

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
grease it through the grease fitting so

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.149 
grease it through the grease fitting so
I'll<00:03:42.370> give<00:03:42.549> you<00:03:42.639> a<00:03:42.669> nice<00:03:42.879> quiet<00:03:43.569> smooth<00:03:44.169> squeak
