here<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.579> today<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:57.030> put<00:00:57.239> these<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
here to do today is put these to a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.630 
here to do today is put these to a
real-world<00:00:57.899> test<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.710> give<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.370> good

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
real-world test and give you a good

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.490 
real-world test and give you a good
comparison<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.260> how<00:01:01.289> these

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.690 

I<00:01:10.680> came<00:01:11.680> out<00:01:11.800> of<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:11.980> beach<00:01:12.160> to<00:01:12.340> test<00:01:12.580> the

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
I came out of the beach to test the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.100 
I came out of the beach to test the
eagle-eyed<00:01:13.000> sunglasses<00:01:13.600> versus<00:01:13.930> just

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
eagle-eyed sunglasses versus just

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.300 
eagle-eyed sunglasses versus just
regular<00:01:14.410> Oakley's<00:01:14.770> that<00:01:14.920> I'm<00:01:15.010> wearing<00:01:15.190> right

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
regular Oakley's that I'm wearing right

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.430 
regular Oakley's that I'm wearing right
now<00:01:15.460> so<00:01:16.210> as<00:01:16.300> a<00:01:16.420> group<00:01:16.570> we<00:01:16.630> haven't<00:01:17.260> we're<00:01:17.350> gonna

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
now so as a group we haven't we're gonna

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.550 
now so as a group we haven't we're gonna
put<00:01:17.620> it<00:01:17.680> to<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.860> test<00:01:18.000> take<00:01:19.000> it<00:01:19.150> out<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.270> our

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
put it to the test take it out of our

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.030 
put it to the test take it out of our
case<00:01:20.560> just<00:01:20.860> turn<00:01:21.760> take<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.480> look<00:01:22.660> at<00:01:22.750> how<00:01:22.870> they

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
case just turn take a look at how they

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.510 
case just turn take a look at how they
how<00:01:24.040> they<00:01:24.160> look<00:01:25.860> everything<00:01:26.860> does<00:01:27.070> appear<00:01:27.490> to

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
how they look everything does appear to

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.410 
how they look everything does appear to
be<00:01:27.640> brighter<00:01:28.830> although<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:30.940> does<00:01:31.180> kind<00:01:31.390> of

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
be brighter although it does kind of

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.810 
be brighter although it does kind of
have<00:01:31.540> a<00:01:31.600> yellow<00:01:31.870> or<00:01:31.990> orange<00:01:32.140> hue<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.100> it<00:01:33.130> I'm

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
have a yellow or orange hue to it I'm

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.740 
have a yellow or orange hue to it I'm
going<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.030> go<00:01:34.120> ahead<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.330> just<00:01:34.420> do<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:34.600> quick

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
going to go ahead and just do a quick

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.910 
going to go ahead and just do a quick
comparison<00:01:35.020> between<00:01:35.950> glasses<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.900> just<00:01:38.080> by

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
comparison between glasses so just by

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.600 
comparison between glasses so just by
putting<00:01:39.190> them<00:01:39.400> up<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.640> down<00:01:40.140> kind<00:01:41.140> of<00:01:41.170> see<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
putting them up and down kind of see the

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.240 
putting them up and down kind of see the
oak<00:01:42.790> is<00:01:43.000> kind<00:01:43.240> of<00:01:43.360> give<00:01:43.510> me<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:43.750> better<00:01:44.650> image<00:01:44.920> as

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
oak is kind of give me a better image as

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.180 
oak is kind of give me a better image as
far<00:01:45.490> as<00:01:46.170> things<00:01:47.170> just<00:01:47.500> being<00:01:47.740> kind<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:48.100> the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
far as things just being kind of the

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.310 
far as things just being kind of the
normal<00:01:48.580> color<00:01:48.820> when<00:01:49.479> I<00:01:49.510> go<00:01:49.690> to<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.900> Eagle<00:01:50.200> eyes

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
normal color when I go to the Eagle eyes

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.170 
normal color when I go to the Eagle eyes
things<00:01:50.710> do<00:01:50.920> become<00:01:51.070> crisper<00:01:51.700> but<00:01:51.850> they<00:01:51.940> kind

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
things do become crisper but they kind

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.600 
things do become crisper but they kind
of<00:01:52.240> almost<00:01:52.600> seem<00:01:52.810> yellow<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:54.250> if<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.430> go<00:01:54.550> ahead

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
of almost seem yellow so if you go ahead
