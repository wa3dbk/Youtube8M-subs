about<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.280> thank<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:10.290> how<00:01:10.500> does<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.680> differ

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
about it thank you so how does it differ

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.100 
about it thank you so how does it differ
from<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> m8<00:01:11.399> to<00:01:11.490> start<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.850> how<00:01:12.840> does<00:01:13.020> it

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
from the m8 to start with how does it

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.289 
from the m8 to start with how does it
differ<00:01:13.170> from<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.500> m8<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> main<00:01:14.210> option<00:01:15.210> on

this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.720> full-frame<00:01:16.229> sensor<00:01:16.700> this<00:01:17.700> allows<00:01:17.999> us

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
this is full-frame sensor this allows us

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.289 
this is full-frame sensor this allows us

the<00:01:34.770> main<00:01:34.950> differences<00:01:35.399> are<00:01:35.459> in<00:01:36.109> the<00:01:37.109> options

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the main differences are in the options

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.559 
the main differences are in the options
in<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> firmware<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.090> gives<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.450> user

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
in the firmware and this gives the user

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.959 
in the firmware and this gives the user
a<00:01:39.810> lot<00:01:39.990> more<00:01:40.200> options<00:01:40.459> one<00:01:41.459> a<00:01:41.490> particularly

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
a lot more options one a particularly

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.230 
a lot more options one a particularly
like<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.659> ISO<00:01:43.109> option<00:01:44.009> where<00:01:44.969> we<00:01:45.090> can

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
like is the ISO option where we can

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.109 
like is the ISO option where we can
scroll<00:01:45.509> through<00:01:45.569> and<00:01:46.139> choose<00:01:46.909> bios<00:01:47.909> those

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
scroll through and choose bios those

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.230 
scroll through and choose bios those
half<00:01:48.539> stops<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.679> there's<00:01:49.950> also<00:01:50.069> a<00:01:50.549> pull<00:01:50.939> 80

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.809 
half stops and there's also a pull 80
and<00:01:51.689> what<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.959> OSD<00:01:52.319> range<00:01:52.670> we're<00:01:53.670> going

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
and what is the OSD range we're going

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.800 
and what is the OSD range we're going
from<00:01:53.969> 160<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.950> 2500<00:01:55.969> with<00:01:56.969> half<00:01:57.209> stops<00:01:57.539> and
