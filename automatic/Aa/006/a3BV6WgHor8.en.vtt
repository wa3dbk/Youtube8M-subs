00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.110 
you can't get with just you twos basic
partner<00:00:31.289> program<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.369> how<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.640> works<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:33.059> you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
partner program so how it works is you

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.389 
partner program so how it works is you
join<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.750> partner<00:00:34.170> Network<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.980> get<00:00:35.160> paid

join in partner Network and you get paid

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.069 
join in partner Network and you get paid
through<00:00:35.700> them<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.149> they<00:00:36.210> take<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> cut<00:00:36.840> in

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
through them and they take a cut in

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.970 
through them and they take a cut in
exchange<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:38.309> extra<00:00:39.059> features<00:00:39.540> or

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
exchange for extra features or

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.290 
exchange for extra features or
advantages<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.460> join<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.879> network<00:00:41.969> as

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
advantages to join the network as

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.520 
advantages to join the network as
opposed<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:42.899> having<00:00:43.140> regular

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
opposed to just having regular

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.380 
opposed to just having regular
partnership<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.910> think<00:00:45.149> one<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
partnership and I think one of the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.060 
partnership and I think one of the
biggest<00:00:45.570> advantages<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.680> don't<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:46.950> to

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
biggest advantages is you don't have to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.459 
biggest advantages is you don't have to
wait<00:00:47.250> for<00:00:47.280> your<00:00:48.000> monetization<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:49.200> your

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
wait for your monetization of your

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.069 
wait for your monetization of your
videos<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:50.219> pending<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:51.079> instant

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
videos to be pending it's instant

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.350 
videos to be pending it's instant
there's<00:00:52.289> no<00:00:52.469> reviews<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.550> videos<00:00:54.030> as

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
there's no reviews of your videos as

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.869 
there's no reviews of your videos as

soon as you claim it then it's

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.060

automatically<00:00:57.629> monetized<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.559> you're<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
automatically monetized if you're a

automatically monetized if you're a
regular<00:00:59.340> partner<00:00:59.910> then<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.539> wait

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
regular partner then you have to wait

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.569 
regular partner then you have to wait

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
for your videos to be monetized and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.060 
for your videos to be monetized and
sometimes<00:01:03.510> they<00:01:03.750> never<00:01:04.110> get<00:01:04.260> monetize<00:01:04.769> or

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
sometimes they never get monetize or

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.219 
sometimes they never get monetize or
they<00:01:05.189> take<00:01:05.400> forever<00:01:05.630> another<00:01:06.630> advantage<00:01:06.810> of

overall<00:02:46.530> than<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.100> would<00:02:47.340> with<00:02:47.870> no<00:02:48.870> partner

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
overall than you would with no partner

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.130 
overall than you would with no partner
network<00:02:49.770> even<00:02:50.550> with<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.820> cut<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:51.810> typical

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
network even with the cut and a typical

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.080 
network even with the cut and a typical
cut<00:02:52.530> would<00:02:52.890> be<00:02:53.100> around<00:02:53.400> seventy<00:02:53.910> percent

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
cut would be around seventy percent

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.270 
cut would be around seventy percent
where<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.840> get<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.110> keep<00:02:55.260> seventy<00:02:55.709> percent<00:02:55.830> of

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
where you get to keep seventy percent of

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.220 
where you get to keep seventy percent of
the<00:02:56.430> revenue<00:02:56.820> so<00:02:57.450> by<00:02:57.780> now<00:02:57.959> you're<00:02:58.170> probably

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
the revenue so by now you're probably

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.920 
the revenue so by now you're probably
thinking<00:02:58.620> which<00:02:59.489> networks<00:03:00.090> should<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.750> look

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
thinking which networks should you look

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.650 
thinking which networks should you look
into<00:03:01.320> there<00:03:02.190> are<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> few<00:03:02.910> big-name<00:03:03.239> players

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
into there are a few big-name players

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.260 
into there are a few big-name players
that<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.860> would<00:03:05.040> recommend<00:03:05.340> looking<00:03:05.640> at<00:03:06.000> and

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
that I would recommend looking at and

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.050 
that I would recommend looking at and
those<00:03:06.930> three<00:03:07.260> would<00:03:07.650> be<00:03:07.709> maker<00:03:08.160> studios<00:03:08.730> which

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
those three would be maker studios which

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.090 
those three would be maker studios which
is<00:03:09.209> actually<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.690> one<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.870> I'm<00:03:10.080> in<00:03:10.320> there's

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
is actually the one that I'm in there's

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.220 
is actually the one that I'm in there's
also<00:03:11.370> full<00:03:11.820> screens<00:03:12.270> another<00:03:12.600> big<00:03:12.840> one<00:03:12.989> and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
also full screens another big one and

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.910 
also full screens another big one and
big<00:03:13.530> frame<00:03:13.920> are<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.760> three<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.450> are<00:03:15.920> just

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
big frame are the three that are just

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.250 
big frame are the three that are just
off<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.220> top<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.459> my<00:03:17.610> head<00:03:17.730> now<00:03:18.540> maker<00:03:18.780> studios

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
off the top of my head now maker studios

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.560 
off the top of my head now maker studios
actually<00:03:19.620> has<00:03:19.769> two<00:03:20.100> tiers<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.730> maker<00:03:20.970> studios

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
actually has two tiers the maker studios

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.920 
actually has two tiers the maker studios
tier<00:03:22.049> is<00:03:22.310> for<00:03:23.310> larger<00:03:24.030> channels<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.720> they

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
tier is for larger channels and they

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.720 
tier is for larger channels and they
also<00:03:25.110> have<00:03:25.350> another<00:03:25.590> tier<00:03:26.130> which<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.549> like

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
also have another tier which is like

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.750 
also have another tier which is like
their<00:03:26.880> normal<00:03:27.269> ter<00:03:27.600> called<00:03:28.080> rpm<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:29.459> most<00:03:29.670> of

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
their normal ter called rpm so most of

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.640 
their normal ter called rpm so most of
you<00:03:29.910> will<00:03:30.000> be<00:03:30.180> joining<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.630> RPM<00:03:31.110> tier<00:03:31.410> but

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
you will be joining the RPM tier but

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.410 
you will be joining the RPM tier but
it's<00:03:31.769> still<00:03:31.980> all<00:03:32.220> maker<00:03:32.459> studios<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.239> don't

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
it's still all maker studios so don't

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
machinima which has been getting a

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.170 
machinima which has been getting a
pretty<00:03:43.049> bad<00:03:43.500> rep<00:03:43.799> recently<00:03:44.310> there's<00:03:45.000> also

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
pretty bad rep recently there's also

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.280 
pretty bad rep recently there's also
places<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.930> TGN<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:47.870> plenty<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:48.959> others

places like TGN and plenty of others

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.039

that<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:49.680> can<00:03:49.950> find<00:03:50.459> probably<00:03:51.090> but<00:03:51.600> I<00:03:51.780> would

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
that you can find probably but I would

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.410 
that you can find probably but I would
really<00:03:52.410> recommend<00:03:52.950> sticking<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.970> one<00:03:54.269> of<00:03:54.360> the

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
really recommend sticking to one of the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.509 
really recommend sticking to one of the
big<00:03:54.600> three<00:03:54.810> players<00:03:55.200> like<00:03:55.620> big<00:03:55.890> frame<00:03:56.190> full

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
big three players like big frame full

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.090 
big three players like big frame full
screen<00:03:56.850> or<00:03:56.970> maker<00:03:57.150> studios<00:03:57.630> now<00:03:58.320> I<00:03:58.350> recommend

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
screen or maker studios now I recommend

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.740 
screen or maker studios now I recommend
maker<00:03:59.310> studios<00:03:59.820> as<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.120> said<00:04:00.330> before<00:04:00.360> that's

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
maker studios as I said before that's

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.120 
maker studios as I said before that's
the<00:04:00.959> one<00:04:01.080> I'm<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.709> would<00:04:01.950> make<00:04:02.070> sense

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
the one I'm in so that would make sense

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.880 
the one I'm in so that would make sense
I've<00:04:02.670> been<00:04:03.120> with<00:04:03.420> them<00:04:03.630> since<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:04.019> was<00:04:04.200> in<00:04:04.230> rpm

I've been with them since I was in rpm

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.130 
I've been with them since I was in rpm
and<00:04:04.920> then<00:04:05.190> eventually<00:04:05.580> as<00:04:06.150> my<00:04:06.540> channel<00:04:06.930> grew

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
and then eventually as my channel grew

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.990 
and then eventually as my channel grew
you<00:04:07.380> can<00:04:07.560> get<00:04:07.680> promoted<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.310> maker<00:04:08.489> studios

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000
