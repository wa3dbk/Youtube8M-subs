 son was born with the intention of creating the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.900
 game had a great deal of energy and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.800
 same time without losing the focus on 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.449
 reality 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.309
 in addition most games 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.070
 published so far were bikes 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.360
 call so little movement and so 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.309
 focused on the need for a business 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.950
 of these crisis paradigms has a game 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.260
 called track and yes at the time the game 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.600
 ragnarok online rpg most popular no 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.579
 Brazil but game that had everything in the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.559
 sky competitors hey life 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.480
 national register beyond the dynamics and 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.340
 in-game action that made it possible to 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.980
 faster actions of the characters and 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.329
 also the monsters the command of the player 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.280
 the wide variety of characters 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.899
 available to be chosen by 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.850
 players made you like him 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.019
 was one of the biggest online 3d games 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.030
 Sunday 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.240
 the price reached in Brazil and not Mass 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.920
 published by the house in games the box 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.840
 managed the game well until the year 2008 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.390
 from the company began to relax 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.210
 care online game support not 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.950
 played as well as today and the game was 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.360
 attacked by various hackers 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.040
 I understand that they are still from the server 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.869
 during the whole week and if not 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.689
 only the racks found a failure in the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.060
 chip that was the team of the game quickly 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.040
 begin to explore various problems ag 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.689
 the players that I am nothing're povÃ£o 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.979
 lazy began to use the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.509
 programs for the country in a manner well 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.130
 faster 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.200
 but in this case to fall at the end 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.579
 comparable to that in which the game was withdrawn 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.579
 had over 20,000 accounts banned 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.990
 but what happened to it in Brazil to 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.810
 his idea with the launching of a name 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.429
 I'm being, I 'm sick. 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.289
 but a bit more like the blitz 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.909
 had a new money system 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.890
 quite different from you regret 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.090
 I remembered a lot of shooting games in 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.310
 third person 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.950
 the game and also tried people who speaks 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.709
 and three of his grandchildren then even more 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.890
 here is public fund going on said 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.900
 club at the end of 2008 the company raised 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.610
 bankruptcy of a split are crazy about 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.370
 he has the son who does not have in Brazil 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.170
 esmoriz percent in the two periods but 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.880
 already spread over the internet and many 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.560
 players said they trust this type of 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.709
 Brazilian content and not spend the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.930
 play with 72 but in the end everything happened 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.870
 as well as company crashed game gave a car 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.790
 new video games since complicating the aha 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.640
 2009 and was responsible for the albums on 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.060
 Brazil and the price had two what 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.650
 happened then the game did not do both 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.630
 success as Ireland had foreseen. 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.310
 because the company's assistance in trying to 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.530
 make the game more realistic has just 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.540
 somehow spoiling on the 3rd of 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.810
 February 2013 the company decreed 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.230
 bankruptcy on 25 March the game was 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.010
 off permanent mit form arrives 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.160
 talk about it, okay? 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.250
 let's talk about the game then the game exists 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.170
 two tribes wheels pistons 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.609
 the city of mureaux was in the north of 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.650
 mainland and was better known as 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.450
 pillar and why to redeem assets are 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.250
 marked by their religiosity 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.639
 by having its magical power highly 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.840
 destructive activity has four classes 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:25.019
 the knight to make uses a bago and 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.030
 atalanta the city speech is in the south 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.889
 it's called that carter 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.440
 the money of this team is characterized 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.660
 as great fighters ages strong and 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.540
 talented player also has 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:41.730
 four classes that are paic 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.799
 the archer is the mechanic and a fighter 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.780
 the city of khar has much more advanced 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.969
 than pillai is the best city for 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.859
 commerce making the city more 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:51.840
 due to the large amount of 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.909
 local conditional clicks to create a 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.790
 music that he did not even have to 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.950
 middle and turns into a hell and not 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.730
 can we forget the castle bless where 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.769
 many players 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.359
 I even spent hours and hours 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.840
 doing the most fun in a 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.889
 rpg kill the castle ps was where 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.299
 pt happened 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.909
 he had this name because there is a 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.889
 castle which every Sunday schools of the 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.780
 game got together to try to destroy 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.340
 your defenses 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.840
 the winner was the start all week 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.209
 with a crown that the professional was 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.949
 attack in the course of this dispute 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.810
 many fights between clans happen 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.070
 making fine tuning more 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.050
 interesting 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.580
 every time you entered the castle 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.870
 so someone from the club paulo para 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.740
 try to kill yourself 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.940
 picture is there 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.669
 but it's not just a white castle that 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.310
 clan disputes there was no bellatin 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.680
 called by many lucky sodium is a 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.560
 acronym of survivor is that in Portuguese 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.240
 means survive or die, my latina is 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.409
 the place where those who have resulted in fame 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.970
 and wealth 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.919
 there were several monsters motif 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.780
 powerful in that they appeared 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.000
 around several rounds 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.250
 only'm stronger survives 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.340
 to win only at night and make a 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.680
 high score much higher than the 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.270
 that the rivals and also winner of 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.560
 create a crown that will make the 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.560
 leader of the clan could redeem a 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.720
 percentage of gold purchased where or 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.790
 whether someone tries to dispute reports and 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.680
 failed uru used to enter the 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.610
 dispute and directly to the clan to 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.490
 leadership 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.290
 The difference between brest and sodium is that 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.600
 winner stayed with crown only 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.070
 while the population was larger 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.990
 that is, he runs the risk of losing 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.300
 crown any time because if someone 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.980
 scored higher is treated 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.980
 by a place of the clan in the leadership 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.760
 that's it, we can not forget the 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.860
 Good things, it's not a father, that's a lot. 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.540
 people were fun for the incidents 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.330
 one to one or perhaps the most important 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.770
 goal of the game so that you stay 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.800
 stronger 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.750
 before the greater goal the supreme glory 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.250
 it was level 100 that was very 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.020
 difficult when you reach this level 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.090
 You do a mission that you were 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.010
 various bugs as reward won 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.760
 last takes the five also at the time was 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.620
 very strong but in the course of time the 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.510
 game was a link with new weapons were 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.100
 launched and the difficulty to climb 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.600
 level is no longer so large that the 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.820
 old goal has no more 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.669
 as much value as the game had the director 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.560
 of items in the year divided the Indians who 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.360
 are adaptations made in the waters to 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.400
 improve your attack power 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.390
 so it 's a game that does not have several 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.270
 changes 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:27.390
 changes for better or for worse there 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.160
 It's at your discretion, it 's so good. 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.720
 the video is staying here if you 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.790
 liked the video does not let you evaluate 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.380
 add to your favorites 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.200
 if you think something is missing 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.600
 said the comment about you 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.020
 want to see more videos as and subscribe 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.020
