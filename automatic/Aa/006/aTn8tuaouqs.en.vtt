00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 or that of a house of 57 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:14.089
 we are talking about 6,000 towers up 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:18.240
 tx rx plates and micro athletic 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:22.250
 the design of this box the front 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.370
 would be practical what is the housing 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.540
 of steel 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:34.010
 for USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports on the front 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:37.970
 we will have a 3.0 and a 2.0 connections 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.750
 audio and micro on and reset 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.700
 that will almost appreciate us 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.480
 and the load as you can see is a 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.480
 plastic housing 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.770
 is ready for the assembly of 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.520
 any equipment without the need of 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.840
 tools 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.910
 this means very simple 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.550
 the two million that we have here are 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.550
 to remove manually worth without 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.370
 need screwdriver with which 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.370
 will give us access to the box very good 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.940
 on the side as you can see 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.630
 we can buy two fans for 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.630
 better cooling 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.390
 the box inside as you can check 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.300
 has a system here for the source 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.409
 of food do not take dust and a 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.140
 dust filter that you have here 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.939
 so that the source does not suffer and does not 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.939
 fill with dust and there comes a moment until 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:43.439
 the bar or the performance of it brings 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:47.709
 Built-in front fan here 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.560
 a rear fan and as you can see 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:54.340
 where the outputs of the pc would come from and 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.549
 They are also with screws for 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.250
 Disassembly by hand without the need of 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.359
 no type of screwdriver here 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.299
 we would have all the necessary pieces 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:07.360
 for mounting the motherboard and any 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.220
 piece that we have to attach to the box 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.150
 here as you can see it would be to put 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.650
 the hard drives and here the readers 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.019
 here we could attach another fan 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.239
 with a dust filter trip so that 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.040
 the fan does not get dirty and one of the 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.760
 most important characteristics that 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.760
 have this box 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.459
 if we select one 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.220
 liquid cooling brings an output 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.709
 for tubes this little box draws it 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.020
 and I think it's a very important detail 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.730
 when choosing our box since 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.220
 a liquid cooling lately 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.370
 is being one of the most options 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.060
 decanted by the users has eight 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.560
 pci-express exits or so to be 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.720
 to have eight in fact from the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.849
 front of the cards that 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.280
 let's connect the alderete of degree of 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.310
 capture of the graphics card though 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.890
 normally we can not connect 8 if 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.360
 we can not connect 3 or 4 as by 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.380
 example the graphics card would eat 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.140
 up to 33 slots here would be out the 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.120
 part of connecting and to the motherboard the 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.870
 front of the plate where you put where 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.549
 would come the usb connections and everything 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.549
 here would give the power supply 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.620
 and the truth 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.570
 that the box does not become very large and 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.510
 it must be small to issue a size 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.670
 just for a normal house because if the 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.400
 house is very big we will need many 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.980
 phases and it's smaller we'll need 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.560
 because a smaller smaller space does not 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.040
 then good as you can check already 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.890
 some screws are pre-installed here 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.300
 to be able to put them on the plate has 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.250
 several screws that this normally 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.720
 you have to place them but in this 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.700
 plate are already set to predefined 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.080
 mind to place the plate and the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.420
 screw more without any kind of 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.450
 problem one of the most details 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.810
 highlight this plaque are 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.750
 the filter 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.400
 of the feed account so that it does not 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.579
 fill with dust 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.270
 the output for if we install a source 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:18.260
 free as a liquid cooling 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:21.590
 and its size that is quite comfortable and 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.920
 well we have to say that this box is 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.560
 high-end features and has a 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.830
 flower more than correct and good so that 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.380
 our pieces not without generating so 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.090
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.040
 give you favorites and do not forget to go through 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.520
 drains page to see the cost of 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.520
 this box
