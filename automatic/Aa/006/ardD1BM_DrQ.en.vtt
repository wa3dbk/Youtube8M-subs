00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.910
 hello girls and here is finally of 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.490
 gel earrings 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.429
 this is the result and of the first 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.929
 proof that I do therefore did not come 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.840
 very well, however, I do not mind 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.119
 I don't even need a first thing 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.820
 piece of tinfoil and with the spot 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.060
 I'm going to recreate what will be the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.490
 silhouette of my earring naturally 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.109
 you can make all the forms that I want 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.809
 as a first form came to my mind 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.680
 this and to them I said oh well 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:40.320
 let's experiment then use a gel 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.390
 monophasic you can use or a 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.489
 monophasic or a gel manufacturer 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.950
 to our choice I use this 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.590
 which I bought on the bushman site in 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.489
 how cheap it was and so I decided 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.710
 to buy it to use it right for 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.930
 these jobs I go to fill with 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.070
 this monophasic gene the whole shape 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.070
 of my earring 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.200
 9 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.220
 if it is not perfect because then yes 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:17.080
 will go to file to change then I go into 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:21.290
 lamp catalyze output from the lamp 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:26.290
 I always take a second pass 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.290
 I make more monophasic gel than enamel 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.610
 then they go into the lamp to catalyze 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.470
 everything comes out of the grease lamp 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.039
 and detach the tigelle piece from the paper 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.030
 tinfoil 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:48.950
 then start giving it the shape with the file 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:52.220
 buffer o and started to color it this is 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.460
 the first yellow I use and is the gel 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:01.850
 jeans of the milan I bought 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:07.009
 I recently catalyze and then use this 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.899
 magenta color that is of bushman use 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.410
 always the commercial because I personally 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.660
 I find it better then to catalyze and lastly 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.600
 color goes from using the red vampyr 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.549
 that always of bushman from the video is not 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.510
 will see the difference in colors very well 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:27.470
 because I have this yellow light and me 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.290
 sorry however from the picture then yes 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.519
 will see better once he spent all the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.459
 color of the pa to be catalyzed out 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.640
 from the lamp I place the earring on a 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.030
 buffer covered with aluminum foil e 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.530
 I make a gel polish 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:52.840
 catalizzate the fat and start giving 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.840
 the actual shape has an earring 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:01.370
 that is, making it just more square and 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.299
 more uniform then buffer or and time start 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.299
 with micro painting 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.140
 I use the colors of Christian Knees 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.850
 both white and red while like 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.650
 I always use this brush 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.480
 they had given to try it e 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:25.760
 honestly I find myself by god and started a 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.760
 recreate a very simple flower 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.280
 of course I had more space to 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.780
 arrangement so I thought of 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:37.430
 Decorate it all with flowers dot lines 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.430
 in short, see what he did 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.010
 this is my first finished earring 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.230
 I hope you say you liked it and 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.270
 also the earring and if I send you a 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.270
 kiss from the next hello video
