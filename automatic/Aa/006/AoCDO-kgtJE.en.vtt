00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.090
 the hearing of the opening of the closing 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.549
 heart valves is done by means of 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.410
 an apparatus called was coppio us 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.410
 that the doctor places on the chest 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.159
 [Music] 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.180
 the heart valves are four 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.250
 located between the atria and two 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.080
 ventricles and two other 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.970
 ventricles of the aorta and 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.470
 pulmonary 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.480
 let's look at the heart valves in a 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.520
 journey through the heart to which 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.680
 we started in the right atrium 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.200
 blood enters the atrium where it can be 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.580
 view of the tricuspid valve formed by 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.680
 three small veils 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.420
 these when separated allow the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.820
 passage of blood into the ventricle 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.129
 the veils are insured by 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.530
 some strings that give it the appearance of 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.750
 a right ventricle parachute if 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.730
 sees the pulmonary valve formed by three 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.090
 small folds that when separated 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.310
 allow the blood to escape 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.960
 after having traveled through the lungs 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.960
 the blood returns to the left atrium 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.970
 of the heart in this shelter can be seen 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.220
 bicuspid or mitral valve that 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.450
 difference of usp tribe has only 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.490
 two veils 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.780
 When the blood is opened it goes to the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.119
 Left ventricle 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.280
 the valve is also secured by ropes 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.720
 as if it were a parachute 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.060
 when all the blood has passed into the 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.860
 ventricle the valve closes 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.740
 regression to the atrium and ventricle 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.630
 the aortic valve can be seen when 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.180
 This allows the passage of the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.479
 blood through the aortic artery so that 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.820
 distributed throughout the body. 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.070
 hearing the sounds of the valves 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:47.220
 so-called outbreaks of 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:54.550
 auscultation and cusp 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.950
 pulmonary tricuspid and optic the first 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.000
 noise is caused by the closure 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.670
 mitral valves and 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.290
 tricuspid valve and the second valve 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.479
 aortic or pulmonary 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.979
 listening for noise helps us to 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.979
 interpret the state of the heart
