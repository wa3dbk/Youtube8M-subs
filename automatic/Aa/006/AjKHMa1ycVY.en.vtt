00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
slices my a loop and I'm going to add

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.719 
slices my a loop and I'm going to add
the<00:01:25.170> salt<00:01:25.610> so<00:01:26.610> when<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.049> add<00:01:28.159> spices<00:01:29.159> just

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
basically spray over and then use a fork

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.920 
basically spray over and then use a fork
because<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.979> its<00:01:38.340> good<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> fork<00:01:39.689> is

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
because of its good with the fork is

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.889 
because of its good with the fork is
easy<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.560> mix<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.030> use<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> spoon<00:01:42.689> as

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
easy to mix it you can use a spoon as

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:53.300 
easy to mix it you can use a spoon as
well<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.350> your<00:01:43.530> fork<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.040> good

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:04.610
