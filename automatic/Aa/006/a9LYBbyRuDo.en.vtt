00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.690
 ah 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.540
 this chick youtube that such here the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.010
 breakers man in a video in which 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.780
 I want to bring you a few attacks 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.210
 about warriors and good 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.939
 the goods in these videos that I recorded the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.699
 I have 17 but good and we the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.200
 I finished improving to the maximum that is the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.970
 18 and nothing I want that good I want that 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.720
 you know I'm going to bring more attacks on 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.840
 this unit because I like it quite 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.510
 and good here I bring you a couple of attacks 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.110
 or three sample attacks so you can see 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.740
 more or less the novice depending on how you look 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.180
 I am with this unit and nothing good 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.130
 attack a real player here 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.680
 here I am charged is machine gun because 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.180
 is one shot and he's going to give me 3 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.060
 energy that is what the missile costs me 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.460
 so it does not cost me anything 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.320
 ok then we go there you know how they are 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.150
 the attacks with warriors is to throw smoke 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:10.450
 and guiding them is convenient to go sending 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.190
 flares before the town hall between 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.890
 buildings for example to this canyon then 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.860
 I will then throw it to another building before 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.240
 from the town hall because if you do not leave 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.510
 to open up a lot and it's very difficult 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.070
 control them also how good it is that 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.640
 Spends energy but not spend so much 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.479
 as to need to save vale 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.409
 here the logical thing is to throw a smoke before 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.790
 from before throwing the flare and spears 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.200
 the smoke and then you start to paralyze 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.090
 the rest of buildings but 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.740
 when I was in the boom cannon stopped 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.740
 I say I have very little energy left 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.890
 and I preferred not to release the smoke because I already 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.210
 it cost 8 and I say good enough 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.940
 I calculated, I think I think it's a 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.920
 paralyzer and another but not 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.210
 in short here we see that attacked a base 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.490
 of resources the truth is that this basis 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.350
 of resources with another unit is 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.540
 complicated because there is a large amount 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.150
 of boom cannons there are also a few 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.430
 rocket launchers and monkey guns and all this 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.350
 there are also many not the truth is that 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.780
 do it with warriors is not so so 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.960
 difficult as it seems in fact now 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.000
 you will see what 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.740
 and on a lot of energy I have to 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.060
 4 paralyzers and I think it gives me to 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.620
 a healing too or I do not know 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.319
 and if you give me others for a cure 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.209
 even to launch a missile and you have already 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.090
 I've seen how many casualties I've had 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.220
 I'll have had ten or so be the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.660
 truth is that it seems complicated but it is 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.220
 that with warriors most of the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.319
 bases that seem really complicated 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.060
 they're easy 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.880
 here you see 16 casualties and it is that it is not 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.519
 so much and finally I bring you one to the 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.050
 machine that this one in 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.150
 Consideration is much more difficult 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.019
 than the previous 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.910
 Well you are seeing that these two 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:01.200
 shocked I thought they did not arrive 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.500
 to the headquarters but if they arrive 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.830
 they also arrive 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.510
 the flamethrowers from here to the end and 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.720
 good thing is that I have to dedicate myself to 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.940
 paralyze those flamethrowers and here I do not 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.250
 fixed how much mine there was thought that 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.810
 there was less than there is actually and 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.600
 good that makes it a fucking cure 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.450
 ass all the side and all the right side 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.980
 It is unhealed but good as there is not 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.080
 you shoot too many defenses 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.760
 well nothing happens you see here a 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.290
 paralyzer burns thrown in fact 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.050
 the two concussionists point because 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.570
 are pointing and well here I had a 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.700
 lot of casualties but good at least 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.830
 has done me and since I did not have any more 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.650
 more islands in the archipelago for denying me 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.330
 anyway anyway, it was already a video of 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.570
 show I want you to know that I'm going to 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.570
 record more with this unit and well what 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.820
 if you like it, maybe you can do some 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.950
 strategy about warriors and make a 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.260
 video more focused on this unit that 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.490
 as I say I quite like anyway 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.930
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.740
 kids and see you in the next 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.740
 see you later
