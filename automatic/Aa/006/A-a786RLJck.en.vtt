think<00:01:50.189> would<00:01:50.280> surprise<00:01:50.549> many<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.360> younger

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
think would surprise many it's younger

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.920 
think would surprise many it's younger
than<00:01:51.810> many<00:01:51.960> would<00:01:52.140> expect<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.509> everything

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
than many would expect so if everything

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.170 
than many would expect so if everything
goes<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> plan<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.799> game<00:01:56.040> will<00:01:56.310> continue<00:01:57.000> to

goes to plan the game will continue to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.170 
goes to plan the game will continue to
grow<00:01:57.360> by<00:01:57.719> embracing<00:01:58.110> modern<00:01:58.950> methods<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.640> it

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
grow by embracing modern methods and it

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.999 
grow by embracing modern methods and it
would<00:02:00.299> seem<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.200> only<00:02:01.350> aspect<00:02:01.590> of

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
would seem that's not the only aspect of

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.700 
would seem that's not the only aspect of
bingo<00:02:02.430> that's<00:02:02.610> getting<00:02:03.000> up<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> date<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.719> lot<00:02:04.590> of

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
bingo that's getting up to date a lot of

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.260 
bingo that's getting up to date a lot of
the<00:02:04.799> old<00:02:04.950> bigger<00:02:05.219> terminology<00:02:05.909> has<00:02:05.969> kind<00:02:06.210> of

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the old bigger terminology has kind of

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.089 
the old bigger terminology has kind of
been<00:02:06.420> outlawed<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.049> think<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.409> sort<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.649> maybe

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
been outlawed I think it's sort of maybe

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.919 
been outlawed I think it's sort of maybe
this<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.429> political<00:02:08.789> correctness<00:02:09.149> crept<00:02:09.750> into

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
this in political correctness crept into

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.020 
this in political correctness crept into
the<00:02:10.140> into<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> business<00:02:10.679> which<00:02:10.950> we<00:02:11.099> now<00:02:11.280> which

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
the into the business which we now which

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.190 
the into the business which we now which
we<00:02:12.180> now<00:02:12.330> welcome<00:02:12.540> so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
we now welcome so

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.960 
we now welcome so
we're<00:02:13.470> no<00:02:13.590> longer<00:02:13.620> legs<00:02:14.099> are<00:02:14.340> leveling<00:02:14.700> and

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
we're no longer legs are leveling and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.839 
we're no longer legs are leveling and
we're<00:02:15.180> certainly<00:02:15.420> not<00:02:15.510> too<00:02:15.810> fat<00:02:16.020> lady<00:02:16.230> anymore

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
we're certainly not too fat lady anymore

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.610 
we're certainly not too fat lady anymore
so<00:02:17.849> you'll<00:02:18.599> find<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:18.959> pretty<00:02:19.019> politically

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
so you'll find it's pretty politically

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.150 
so you'll find it's pretty politically
correct<00:02:19.920> these<00:02:20.040> days<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.430> happily<00:02:20.970> so
