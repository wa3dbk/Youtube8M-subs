00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.230
 the mölltaler glacier in austria 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.910
 meet here at a workout 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.460
 Event the best ski crosser of three 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.740
 four drivers per race 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.040
 Mutual courage and risk-taking 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.779
 decide on victory and defeat 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.460
 also the 18 year old german julia 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.080
 eichinger has hers a year ago 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.369
 passion for skicross discovered 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.990
 original ideas I had from 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.310
 one not as I rode along 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.559
 and I knew it sport from 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.940
 first moment and that's what 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.410
 quite different for me now 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.350
 personally as we the classic 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.320
 skiing the classic skier left 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.180
 right blue red that was it then 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.660
 my goal is down there and there is 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.640
 we have action and more movement one 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.980
 You just feel the passion 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.019
 in the whole over a kilometer 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.910
 long stretch those with steep curves 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.830
 Opportunities and waves is prepared with 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.780
 up to 100 kilometers per hour too 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.420
 lawn that makes meanwhile thousands 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.890
 skiers in europe have fun in the last few years 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.479
 two years, the number of skis has increased 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:21.030
 crosser on european slopes 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:22.799
 doubles you touched janko or at that time 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.310
 I pass him even with the jumpers 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.080
 and that ensures a lot of adrenaline 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.610
 in the qualification everyone first 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.260
 individually over the route 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.820
 the time spent decides the 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.810
 division of groups with those in 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.760
 is started to run 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.350
 the best two of each run come 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.920
 continue to the next round until the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.920
 final 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.740
 very important in skicross is the state 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.940
 the inner tension actually becomes 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.190
 getting bigger and then it's there 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.810
 fast as possible into the goal 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.810
 a fierce fight begins 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.479
 look that you drive up the other 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.310
 always on line eighth is there 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.050
 at the moments where you never go to today 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.660
 high triple but just times from 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.340
 the unjustified there with the one today 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.440
 burns off and then you can show that 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.890
 he crashes and with it to drive 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:25.790
 but the know simply, the well 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.320
 arriving at the audience live that is often 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.720
 A crash gives up the absolute rank 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.459
 three and so jumps it's easy 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.920
 Austria yes that's an action-packed 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.560
 and there is the direct competition age 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.340
 or great thing on all cases 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.600
 something new and very spectacular and 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.840
 must be pretty crazy types 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.150
 decisive the gladiators in the snow 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.470
 are also interesting for the media as 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.630
 at the olympic games in vancouver 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.860
 for the first time a ski cross run in the 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.510
 television was broadcast 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.730
 software for surprise at the 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.940
 Ratings it was believed that 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.860
 third strongest sport ever 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.080
 Nobody would be surprised 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.549
 believed that so much quote made 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.230
 can be with this new sport 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.940
 after olympia there was even a small one 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.220
 fight who this first worldcup on 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.769
 German soil may transmit between 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.360
 ard and zdf that won the zdf 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.739
 but this year at the götschen in 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.930
 bischofswiesen we are off it happy 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.780
 let me know it live if 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.370
 it's really fat 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.720
 more and more often the ski crosser need now 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.810
 at performances for the sponsors 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.650
 posing big companies and 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.870
 Automobile companies have skicross as 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.820
 cool sports discovered for themselves as once 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.880
 the snowboard 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.880
 the sponsors have seen there 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.250
 no field yet, no one for themselves 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.410
 has claimed and therefore 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.840
 jump sponsors on it that's young it 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.850
 is fresh the people good or the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.709
 Athletes are good so it's alpine 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.989
 driver for racing and that's it 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.430
 a bit stuffy season with us 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.840
 some relaxed mood especially with 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.299
 the other nations we understand ours 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.980
 best ski alpine is the old school 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.910
 I say now and we are just that 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.160
 young generation the freaky then 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.380
 I'm not going to say that here yet 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.940
 but trust more bird 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.530
 I once said that I was believed 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.840
 not that any alpine ride under it 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.010
 would 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.180
 freaky that shows up already at 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.250
 warm up for the race 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.250
 Now it is getting serious for Julia Eichinger 

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.450
 but already in the second group comes 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.160
 It's dueling with a duel 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.540
 your competitors through them 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.930
 precious time she loses the last 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.090
 four of his kind side by side 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.490
 drove and yes had the right 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.740
 pretty much pushed over and then to 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.440
 langlauf then it threw me 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.420
 Mostly this is skicross victory 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.400
 or defeat fall or that 's good 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.580
 I start my driver with the best 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.980
 I am newcomer and I have the 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.360
 guests have made the hell hot and 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.060
 that will continue to do so 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.890
 she becomes the fascination of skicross 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.280
 like so many others, not so fast 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.280
 let go
