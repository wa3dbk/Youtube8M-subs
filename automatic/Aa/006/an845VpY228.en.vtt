the<00:00:18.359> XP<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.050> get<00:00:19.230> from<00:00:19.410> mining<00:00:19.770> blocks

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
the XP that we get from mining blocks

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.400 
the XP that we get from mining blocks
and<00:00:20.400> as<00:00:21.060> always<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.630> only<00:00:21.720> way<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.960> find<00:00:22.230> out

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
and as always the only way to find out

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.620 
and as always the only way to find out
is<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> test<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.240> one<00:00:24.390> I've

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
is to do a test so this is the one I've

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.779 
is to do a test so this is the one I've
set<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:24.960> we've<00:00:25.680> got<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.010> six<00:00:26.250> different<00:00:26.460> types

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
set up we've got the six different types

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.820 
set up we've got the six different types
of<00:00:27.060> blocks<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.840> mined<00:00:28.050> for<00:00:28.199> XP<00:00:28.619> in

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
of blocks that we can mined for XP in

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.609 
of blocks that we can mined for XP in
the<00:00:28.980> game<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.460> put<00:00:30.000> them<00:00:30.179> into<00:00:30.330> groups<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.869> 27

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the game and put them into groups of 27

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.500 
the game and put them into groups of 27
now<00:00:32.340> what<00:00:32.550> we're<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.090> mined<00:00:33.360> them

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
now what we're going to do is mined them

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.810 
now what we're going to do is mined them
one<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.809> time<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:34.890> I'm<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.309> exit

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
one at a time and then I'm going to exit

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.940 
one at a time and then I'm going to exit
the<00:00:35.910> game<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.329> analyze<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.899> save<00:00:37.140> data<00:00:37.380> using

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the game and analyze the save data using

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.520 
the game and analyze the save data using
a<00:00:38.070> program<00:00:38.489> called<00:00:38.520> MBT<00:00:39.239> edit<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.350> will

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
a program called MBT edit and this will

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.860 
a program called MBT edit and this will
give<00:00:40.680> us<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.040> number<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> amount<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.480> XP

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
give us a number for the amount of XP

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.569 
give us a number for the amount of XP
that<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.590> rather<00:00:43.770> than<00:00:44.010> using<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
that we have so rather than using the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.220 
that we have so rather than using the
meter<00:00:44.760> down<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.180> bottom<00:00:45.450> we're<00:00:46.110> actually

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
meter down the bottom we're actually

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.260 
meter down the bottom we're actually
going<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.620> find<00:00:46.770> out<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> exact<00:00:47.489> number<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.820> XP

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
going to find out the exact number of XP

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.690 
going to find out the exact number of XP
that<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:48.539> get<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.440> once<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.829> mined<00:00:50.160> one<00:00:50.370> set<00:00:50.579> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
that we get so once I mined one set of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.900 
that we get so once I mined one set of
blocks<00:00:50.879> I'm<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.660> reset<00:00:52.079> my<00:00:52.289> XP<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.980> then

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
blocks I'm going to reset my XP and then

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.270 
blocks I'm going to reset my XP and then
mine<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> next<00:00:54.539> set<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.050> analyze<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.039> again

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
mine the next set and analyze it again

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.860 
mine the next set and analyze it again
with<00:00:56.460> NBT<00:00:56.879> edit<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.360> we're<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> do<00:00:57.719> that

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
with NBT edit and we're going to do that

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.150 
with NBT edit and we're going to do that
for<00:00:58.079> all<00:00:58.140> these<00:00:58.289> different<00:00:58.530> block<00:00:58.890> types

for all these different block types

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.700 
for all these different block types
we've<00:00:59.399> got<00:00:59.609> colon<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.059> redstone<00:01:00.750> or<00:01:00.960> lapis
