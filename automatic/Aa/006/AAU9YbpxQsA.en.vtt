00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.020 
so the eco looks like a fossilized fly
maybe<00:06:12.840> this<00:06:13.200> is<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:13.980> fossilized<00:06:14.520> Rock<00:06:14.820> at<00:06:14.970> the

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
maybe this is the fossilized Rock at the

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.060 
maybe this is the fossilized Rock at the
back<00:06:15.240> and<00:06:15.570> then<00:06:16.170> whenever<00:06:16.500> we<00:06:16.590> have<00:06:16.800> in<00:06:16.950> the
