00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.210 
but upwards vertically and horizontally
so<00:02:40.610> right<00:02:41.360> here<00:02:41.570> is<00:02:41.600> vertically<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:46.130> now

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
so right here is vertically and now

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.840 
so right here is vertically and now
we're<00:02:46.640> going<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:46.940> do<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.320> but<00:02:51.130> now<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.700> can

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
we're going to do it but now you can

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.420 
we're going to do it but now you can
keep<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.209> like<00:02:53.330> this<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.810> see<00:02:54.709> that<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:55.100> kind

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
you're going to take one of those sides

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.370 
you're going to take one of those sides
which<00:03:35.239> is<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:36.430> side<00:03:37.430> right<00:03:37.459> here<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:38.269> one<00:03:39.230> of

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
which is this side right here of one of

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.890 
which is this side right here of one of
the<00:03:39.560> layers<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.370> then<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.030> fold<00:03:41.209> it<00:03:41.360> over<00:03:41.510> and

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
the layers and then you fold it over and

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.539 
the layers and then you fold it over and
show<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.590> line<00:03:42.799> I<00:03:43.100> didn't<00:03:43.370> draw<00:03:43.519> a

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
show it to the line I didn't draw a

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.850 
show it to the line I didn't draw a
straight<00:03:43.820> line<00:03:43.850> but<00:03:44.380> Jesse<00:03:45.380> it's<00:03:45.500> like<00:03:45.650> right

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
straight line but Jesse it's like right

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.970 
straight line but Jesse it's like right
there<00:03:46.070> and<00:03:46.940> get<00:03:47.209> all<00:03:47.329> right<00:03:47.480> good<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:48.650> fold<00:03:48.920> it

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
there and get all right good you fold it

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.360 
there and get all right good you fold it
over<00:03:50.290> let<00:03:51.290> make<00:03:51.410> sure<00:03:51.530> this<00:03:51.920> part<00:03:52.220> down<00:03:52.310> here

you<00:03:53.239> don't<00:03:53.480> overlap<00:03:53.900> it<00:03:54.109> like<00:03:54.260> or<00:03:54.500> you'll<00:03:56.019> rip

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
you don't overlap it like or you'll rip

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.599 
you don't overlap it like or you'll rip
the<00:03:57.200> paper<00:03:57.820> so<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:59.709> guys<00:04:00.709> do<00:04:00.980> that<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.430> you

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
the paper so you guys do that and you

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:07.830 
the paper so you guys do that and you
get<00:04:01.790> together<00:04:02.079> remaining<00:04:03.079> three<00:04:03.320> sides<00:04:04.180> so

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.290 

23<00:04:11.080> sure<00:04:12.080> got<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.680> be<00:04:12.740> very<00:04:12.770> careful<00:04:13.300> what

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
23 sure got to be very careful what

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:21.729 
23 sure got to be very careful what
you're<00:04:14.480> doing<00:04:16.870> on<00:04:18.010> here<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:20.900> now<00:04:20.959> you<00:04:21.590> can

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
you're doing on here and now you can

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.720 
you're doing on here and now you can
take<00:04:21.889> a<00:04:21.950> side<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.520> then<00:04:23.270> you<00:04:23.660> see<00:04:23.870> that<00:04:24.050> this

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
take a side and then you see that this

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.430 
take a side and then you see that this
you<00:04:25.730> push<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.419> first<00:04:26.660> layer<00:04:26.870> like<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.260> very

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
you push the first layer like the very

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.400 
you push the first layer like the very
first<00:04:27.800> layer<00:04:28.040> up<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.630> then<00:04:29.630> you<00:04:29.990> see<00:04:30.169> that

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
first layer up and then you see that

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.700 
first layer up and then you see that
your<00:04:30.560> thumb<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:31.010> just<00:04:31.270> check<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.450> then<00:04:32.750> to<00:04:33.139> go

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
your thumb you just check it then to go

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.800 
your thumb you just check it then to go
all<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:33.919> way<00:04:34.040> and<00:04:34.340> then<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:34.730> push<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.150> up<00:04:35.270> and

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
all the way and then you push it up and

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.440 
all the way and then you push it up and
you<00:04:35.960> kind<00:04:36.200> of<00:04:36.260> get<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.470> center<00:04:39.280> alright<00:04:40.450> so

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
you kind of get the center alright so

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.480 
you kind of get the center alright so
right<00:04:41.480> here<00:04:41.870> now<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:42.680> can<00:04:42.919> see<00:04:43.100> that<00:04:43.130> it's

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
right here now you can see that it's

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.090 
right here now you can see that it's
kind<00:04:43.760> of<00:04:43.820> like<00:04:44.510> weird<00:04:44.870> just<00:04:45.680> push<00:04:45.950> this

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
kind of like weird just push this

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.900 
kind of like weird just push this
outward<00:04:46.760> in<00:04:47.450> an<00:04:48.080> outward<00:04:48.440> motion<00:04:48.680> so<00:04:49.610> you<00:04:49.700> push

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
outward in an outward motion so you push

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.420 
outward in an outward motion so you push
it<00:04:50.030> in<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.330> you<00:04:50.510> watch<00:04:50.750> that<00:04:50.780> is<00:04:51.260> like<00:04:52.250> this

you guys and my videos I've made if you
go<00:06:08.860> to<00:06:08.919> my<00:06:09.099> channel<00:06:09.610> you<00:06:09.759> can<00:06:09.880> see<00:06:10.120> that<00:06:10.150> I'm

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
go to my channel you can see that I'm

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.350 
go to my channel you can see that I'm
like<00:06:11.919> my<00:06:12.160> very<00:06:12.280> first<00:06:12.580> video<00:06:12.729> it<00:06:13.090> was<00:06:13.180> how<00:06:13.300> to

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
like my very first video it was how to

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.839 
like my very first video it was how to
make<00:06:13.569> an<00:06:13.660> origami<00:06:13.750> crane<00:06:14.250> so<00:06:15.250> make<00:06:15.639> sure<00:06:15.669> you

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
make an origami crane so make sure you

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.330 
make an origami crane so make sure you
wash<00:06:16.060> that<00:06:16.090> and<00:06:16.539> hopefully<00:06:17.110> you<00:06:17.319> have<00:06:17.590> an

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
wash that and hopefully you have an

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.680 
wash that and hopefully you have an
advantage<00:06:18.610> because<00:06:19.000> you<00:06:19.210> know<00:06:19.360> how<00:06:19.479> to<00:06:19.569> make

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
advantage because you know how to make

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.310 
advantage because you know how to make
an<00:06:19.930> origami<00:06:22.650> bird<00:06:23.650> base<00:06:23.860> hopefully<00:06:24.789> by<00:06:24.970> now

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320
