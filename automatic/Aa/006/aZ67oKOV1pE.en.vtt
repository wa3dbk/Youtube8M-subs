00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
shot on it because it's a blonde blonde

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.450 
shot on it because it's a blonde blonde
all<00:01:24.700> right<00:01:24.960> exactly<00:01:25.960> so<00:01:26.409> you<00:01:26.560> have<00:01:26.829> this<00:01:26.979> cream

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
all right exactly so you have this cream

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.319 
all right exactly so you have this cream
touch<00:01:28.240> alright<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:30.130> I<00:01:30.340> got<00:01:30.819> what<00:01:30.999> you<00:01:31.119> said

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
touch alright but I got what you said

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.179 
touch alright but I got what you said
because<00:01:31.539> it<00:01:31.840> is<00:01:32.049> not<00:01:32.229> easy<00:01:32.380> because<00:01:32.590> this<00:01:33.100> is

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
because it is not easy because this is

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.059 
because it is not easy because this is
an<00:01:33.310> extra<00:01:33.639> Brut<00:01:33.909> so<00:01:34.600> only<00:01:34.869> four<00:01:35.409> grams<00:01:35.770> for<00:01:36.039> the

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
an extra Brut so only four grams for the

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.989 
an extra Brut so only four grams for the
dosage<00:01:36.549> so<00:01:37.539> it's<00:01:38.499> super<00:01:38.950> dry<00:01:39.189> exactly<00:01:39.759> and

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:39.999 
dosage so it's super dry exactly and

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.449 
dosage so it's super dry exactly and
then<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.929> have<00:01:41.020> this<00:01:41.170> mineralogy<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:42.310> it's

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
then you have this mineralogy so it's

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.760 
then you have this mineralogy so it's
very<00:01:42.670> straightforward<00:01:42.999> is<00:01:43.749> an<00:01:43.929> undetermined

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
very straightforward is an undetermined

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.249 
very straightforward is an undetermined
its<00:01:45.039> vintage<00:01:45.520> which<00:01:46.209> is<00:01:46.240> maybe<00:01:46.780> not<00:01:46.959> the

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
its vintage which is maybe not the

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.899 
its vintage which is maybe not the
easiest<00:01:47.590> vintage<00:01:48.189> in<00:01:48.340> champagne<00:01:48.729> which<00:01:48.880> is

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
easiest vintage in champagne which is

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.269 
easiest vintage in champagne which is
2005<00:01:50.219> in<00:01:51.219> Magnum<00:01:51.759> well<00:01:52.450> in<00:01:52.779> Magnum<00:01:53.289> so<00:01:53.709> then

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:54.279 
2005 in Magnum well in Magnum so then

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:55.320 
2005 in Magnum well in Magnum so then
you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
you

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.300 
you
even<00:01:55.570> more<00:01:55.720> freshness<00:01:55.960> right<00:01:56.350> it's<00:01:56.800> only<00:01:57.040> from

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
even more freshness right it's only from

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.450 
even more freshness right it's only from
all<00:01:57.550> points<00:01:57.820> from<00:01:58.270> comma<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.380> IVs<00:01:59.800> so<00:02:00.250> you're

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
all points from comma and IVs so you're

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.570 
all points from comma and IVs so you're
on<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.790> tremolo<00:02:01.740> exactly<00:02:02.740> exactly

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580

here<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.010> very<00:02:15.340> fragile<00:02:15.670> balance<00:02:16.230> that

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
here this is a very fragile balance that

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.050 
here this is a very fragile balance that
you<00:02:17.410> have<00:02:17.440> between<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.160> terroir<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.819> the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
you have between the terroir and the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.330 
you have between the terroir and the
winemaking<00:02:20.020> process<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.670> style<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:23.340> what

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
winemaking process and the style of what

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.940 
winemaking process and the style of what
the<00:02:24.430> grape<00:02:24.760> creepy<00:02:25.209> right<00:02:25.989> away<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.230> get<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.680> real

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
the grape creepy right away I get a real

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.390 
the grape creepy right away I get a real
flimsy<00:02:27.459> minerality<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.380> little<00:02:30.160> bit<00:02:30.310> of

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
flimsy minerality to it a little bit of

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.729 
flimsy minerality to it a little bit of
sweetness<00:02:30.760> just<00:02:30.819> in<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.330> right<00:02:31.450> place<00:02:31.739> having

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
sweetness just in the right place having

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.920 
sweetness just in the right place having
it<00:02:32.830> seems<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.459> was<00:02:33.790> thinking<00:02:34.120> Riesling<00:02:34.600> green

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
it seems I was thinking Riesling green

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.370 
it seems I was thinking Riesling green
or<00:02:35.200> something<00:02:36.069> like<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.840> it's

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
or something like that and it it's

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.530 
or something like that and it it's
delicate<00:02:38.980> enough<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:40.150> doesn't<00:02:40.330> seem

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
delicate enough that it doesn't seem

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.690 
delicate enough that it doesn't seem
like<00:02:40.750> with<00:02:40.930> something<00:02:41.110> from<00:02:41.410> Alsace<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.459> seems

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
like with something from Alsace it seems

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.559 
like with something from Alsace it seems
maybe<00:02:43.030> I'll<00:02:43.330> maybe<00:02:43.690> more<00:02:44.110> like<00:02:44.830> Austria<00:02:45.569> or

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
maybe I'll maybe more like Austria or

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.220 
maybe I'll maybe more like Austria or
maybe<00:02:47.470> Jeremy<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:48.610> fox<00:02:48.970> or<00:02:49.300> something<00:02:49.510> but<00:02:50.200> I

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
maybe Jeremy like fox or something but I

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.320 
maybe Jeremy like fox or something but I
really<00:02:50.560> like<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.980> balance<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.580> wine<00:02:51.790> this

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
really like the balance it's a wine this

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.809 
really like the balance it's a wine this
sort<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.840> blenders<00:02:53.290> it's<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.860> savoriness<00:02:54.610> to

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
sort of a blenders it's a savoriness to

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.300 
sort of a blenders it's a savoriness to
it<00:02:54.940> yeah<00:02:55.209> yeah<00:02:55.900> that's<00:02:56.290> it

right
you<00:03:21.880> is<00:03:22.360> not<00:03:22.570> from<00:03:22.780> this<00:03:22.959> region<00:03:23.380> so<00:03:23.650> no<00:03:23.799> but

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
you is not from this region so no but

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.160 
you is not from this region so no but
you<00:03:24.310> yes<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.650> tone<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.970> -<00:03:28.510> all<00:03:28.989> right

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
you yes it is the tone is - all right

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.740 
you yes it is the tone is - all right
all<00:03:29.769> right<00:03:29.829> from<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.790> single<00:03:31.060> vineyard<00:03:31.150> only

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
all right from a single vineyard only

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.380 
all right from a single vineyard only
volcanic<00:03:32.230> soils<00:03:32.620> so<00:03:33.130> that's<00:03:33.430> why<00:03:33.700> exactly

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
volcanic soils so that's why exactly

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.539 
volcanic soils so that's why exactly
that's<00:03:34.750> why<00:03:34.959> when<00:03:35.170> you<00:03:35.290> mentioned<00:03:35.829> flaps<00:03:36.070> then

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
that's why when you mentioned flaps then

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.060 
that's why when you mentioned flaps then
I<00:03:36.579> was<00:03:36.820> like<00:03:36.940> that's<00:03:37.690> not<00:03:37.989> completely<00:03:38.890> wrong

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
I was like that's not completely wrong

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.039 
I was like that's not completely wrong
because<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.850> get<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.090> spiciness<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:40.930> know

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
because you get the spiciness you know

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.020 
because you get the spiciness you know
and<00:03:41.260> from<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.040> volcano<00:03:42.370> sauce<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.850> this

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
and from the volcano sauce and this

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.569 
and from the volcano sauce and this
mineralogy<00:03:43.690> two<00:03:43.930> great<00:03:44.170> choices<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:45.040> mean

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
mineralogy two great choices I mean

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.410 
mineralogy two great choices I mean
these<00:03:45.730> are<00:03:45.970> easily<00:03:46.799> 90<00:03:47.799> points<00:03:48.160> in<00:03:48.280> fact<00:03:48.549> you

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
these are easily 90 points in fact you

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.670 
these are easily 90 points in fact you
know<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:49.540> would<00:03:49.780> just<00:03:49.810> come<00:03:50.140> to<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.350> restaurant
