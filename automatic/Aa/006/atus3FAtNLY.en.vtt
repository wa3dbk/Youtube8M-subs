00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.480
 the natural sports life without colorants 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.460
 no preservatives and only two ingredients 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.940
 that are natural and that your body knows 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.070
 recognize very well 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.129
 I'm here it's not where my house is because 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.280
 is the kitchen but small and here 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.190
 we're 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.230
 then these lides ideal for 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.430
 any day but especially when 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.080
 you are doing sport you are sweating 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.080
 you're losing a lot of salts 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.910
 There are four ingredients that are 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.489
 fundamental 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.870
 you take the bottle first in this case 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.940
 it's a plastic one but situation is 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.500
 something else so you have to take your 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.290
 bottle that you will take to make 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.540
 sport and then you fill it with the base 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.030
 this is coconut water water 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.180
 of coconut is very rich and also has 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:00.059
 many electrolytes hydrate very well 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.059
 then you fill it with coconut water 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.760
 efe 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.890
 what is next the next thing is that 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.050
 you have to add a little you 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.170
 to make the water then you have 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.760
 add salt to the rhythm but it can not be 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.280
 anyone has to be unrefined salt 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.140
 because the unrefined salt in 2000 is 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.020
 two main elements that are the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.840
 sodium chloride but it also has 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.330
 many other elements in less quantity 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.910
 I think they are also important for the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.460
 body and site really rehydrate 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.800
 you have to use this type of salt to 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.630
 then this is a little bit of salt without 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.920
 refine that today in today is very 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.290
 easy to find 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.630
 I am here in Alicante, I buy in 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.490
 the store 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.229
 that costs me less than one euro for a 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.450
 kilo then this is a pinch of salt 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.579
 unrefined this really what you 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.450
 helps hydrate and retain water 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.450
 mobile 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.110
 and the next thing is a splash of lemon 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.210
 The lemon also has units 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.670
 they have many vitamins 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.670
 toxic clean lemons 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.120
 and when you have the sun if you want 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.739
 sweeten it a little bit like we are 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.610
 using a lot of energy talking to 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:33.490
 sport, sometimes it's good 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:37.360
 in the most natural and best ways 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.350
 is adding honey but not all are equal 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.870
 this one in particular is innocence and has been 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.510
 filtered or heated the best are 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.730
 honeys that are pure or that are 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.860
 really raw that have been encouraged 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.200
 for not your honey warms what 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.870
 do you break the enzymes say 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.250
 destroy the enzymes denatured 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:04.530
 but good a little trickle and this is if not 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.530
 they have salt because the basics are fine 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.280
 and finally if you want 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.110
 take this to the next level these are 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.490
 good you do not have to do it but if 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.310
 you know you're going to have a very session 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.160
 intense and that maybe you're going to need a 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.820
 little more 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.670
 and it may be a little bit of this are 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.760
 chia seeds the chia seeds is 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:36.000
 a super food that the 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:40.300
 Aztec warriors and is high in protein 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.880
 certain proteins also have omega 3 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.740
 and this also in the water is like 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.180
 the seed is swollen and a 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.489
 kind of gel 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:55.610
 Y 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:59.300
 and nothing else this then short mixes a 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.190
 little you put it in your backpack in the 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.739
 where you go there and I'm a 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.750
 sports drink much better than 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.819
 cat the why of anything else 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.230
 that you can buy in a store this is 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.209
 natural the body assimilate it what 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.010
 recognizes very well and will hydrate and 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.950
 you 'll see how they help you in your matches 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.669
 of career alone 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.669
 up plants
