I did this okay so the first step in

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.330 
I did this okay so the first step in
creating<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:27.180> scrub<00:00:27.810> shirt<00:00:28.230> top<00:00:28.619> thing<00:00:29.070> is

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
creating the scrub shirt top thing is

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.799 
creating the scrub shirt top thing is
going<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:31.289> UM<00:00:32.009> pick<00:00:32.579> out<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:33.000> slightly

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
going to be to UM pick out a slightly

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.740 
going to be to UM pick out a slightly
oversized<00:00:34.559> shirt<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:36.149> that's<00:00:36.329> going<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.570> fit

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
oversized shirt one that's going to fit

oversized shirt one that's going to fit
you<00:00:36.840> quite<00:00:37.079> loosely<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:37.710> these

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
you quite loosely because these

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.520 
you quite loosely because these
scriptures<00:00:38.969> aren't<00:00:39.420> linked<00:00:39.780> tight<00:00:40.170> fitting

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
scriptures aren't linked tight fitting

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.690 
scriptures aren't linked tight fitting
they<00:00:40.649> aren't<00:00:40.920> close<00:00:41.070> at<00:00:41.370> all

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
this website look like just like a plain

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.770 
this website look like just like a plain
I'm<00:01:25.140> t-shirt<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.850> also<00:01:27.090> forgot<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.630> mention

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
I'm t-shirt and I also forgot to mention

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.710 
I'm t-shirt and I also forgot to mention
that<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.320> doubled<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.280> four<00:01:29.640> times<00:01:29.909> so

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that I doubled this up four times so

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.740 
that I doubled this up four times so
you're<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.710> four<00:01:32.750> separate

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
you're going to have four separate

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.600 
you're going to have four separate
sheets<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.259> material<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.310> did<00:01:35.490> that

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
sheets of material and I just did that

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.210 
sheets of material and I just did that
so<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:36.030> wouldn't<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.479> too<00:01:37.110> thin<00:01:37.409> or<00:01:37.530> sheer<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
so it wouldn't be too thin or sheer and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.749 
so it wouldn't be too thin or sheer and
what<00:01:39.030> you're<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.960> since<00:01:40.170> I

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
what you're going to do is since I

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.359 
what you're going to do is since I
doubled<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> fabric<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.799> won't<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.220> do

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
doubled the fabric up I won't have to do

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.030 
doubled the fabric up I won't have to do
this<00:01:44.520> next<00:01:44.909> step<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:45.299> if<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.659> did<00:01:46.259> not<00:01:46.470> double

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
this next step but if you did not double

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.039 
this next step but if you did not double
the<00:01:47.070> fabric<00:01:47.579> you're<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.180> have<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.540> turn

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the fabric you're going to have to turn

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.219 
the fabric you're going to have to turn
the<00:01:49.470> materials<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.509> good<00:01:51.810> sides<00:01:52.020> are

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
the materials so the good sides are

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.899 
the materials so the good sides are
facing<00:01:52.380> together<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.430> way<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.610> can

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
facing together and that way you can

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.240 
facing together and that way you can
make<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.149> seam<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.290> underside<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
make a seam on the underside of the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.280 
make a seam on the underside of the
fabric<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.790> bad<00:01:56.969> side<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.780> since<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.110> did

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
fabric of the bad side but since I did

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.530 
fabric of the bad side but since I did
that<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> don't<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.280> do<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.969> step<00:02:00.299> I'm

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
that I don't have to do that step I'm

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.410 
that I don't have to do that step I'm
just<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.380> sew<00:02:01.920> along<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.549> sides<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.329> the

cut out a fairly big sized um almost
square<00:03:52.730> but<00:03:53.120> it's<00:03:53.269> a<00:03:53.329> little<00:03:53.540> bit<00:03:53.630> of<00:03:53.720> a

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
square but it's a little bit of a

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.039 
square but it's a little bit of a
rectangle<00:03:54.470> piece<00:03:55.459> of<00:03:55.609> fabric<00:03:55.820> and<00:03:56.329> what<00:03:56.690> I<00:03:56.720> did

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
rectangle piece of fabric and what I did

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.599 
rectangle piece of fabric and what I did
was<00:03:57.230> I<00:03:57.410> folded<00:03:58.190> down<00:03:59.260> this<00:04:00.260> side<00:04:00.709> and<00:04:01.070> the

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
was I folded down this side and the

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.789 
was I folded down this side and the
bottom<00:04:01.790> side<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.570> I<00:04:02.750> didn't<00:04:03.049> fold<00:04:03.260> down<00:04:03.530> this

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
bottom side and I didn't fold down this

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.699 
bottom side and I didn't fold down this
side<00:04:04.100> because<00:04:04.609> it<00:04:04.910> is<00:04:05.420> actually<00:04:06.320> attached

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
side because it is actually attached

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.380 
side because it is actually attached
right<00:04:07.070> there<00:04:07.310> what<00:04:07.489> I<00:04:07.519> did<00:04:07.790> was<00:04:07.940> I<00:04:08.030> just<00:04:08.060> cut

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
right there what I did was I just cut

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.560 
right there what I did was I just cut
out<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.540> big<00:04:08.840> long<00:04:09.079> piece<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:09.799> folded<00:04:10.130> it<00:04:10.430> and

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
out a big long piece and I folded it and

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.910 
out a big long piece and I folded it and
that's<00:04:11.570> why<00:04:11.750> I<00:04:11.780> don't<00:04:11.900> need<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.290> hem<00:04:12.470> that<00:04:12.500> but

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
that's why I don't need to hem that but

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.590 
that's why I don't need to hem that but
if<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.160> didn't<00:04:13.519> do<00:04:13.700> that<00:04:13.850> then<00:04:14.030> you<00:04:14.180> will<00:04:14.390> need

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
if you didn't do that then you will need

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.659

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
what job she actually has but she has to

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:08.730 
what job she actually has but she has to
wear<00:06:07.000> scrubs<00:06:07.270> she's<00:06:08.050> not<00:06:08.169> like<00:06:08.289> a<00:06:08.319> nurse<00:06:08.560> or

the<00:06:10.779> sides<00:06:11.020> um<00:06:11.909> tied<00:06:12.909> but<00:06:13.479> I<00:06:13.870> figured<00:06:14.469> this<00:06:14.500> is

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
the sides um tied but I figured this is

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.180 
the sides um tied but I figured this is
pretty<00:06:15.190> close<00:06:15.909> cut<00:06:16.620> so<00:06:17.620> she<00:06:17.710> wouldn't<00:06:18.039> really

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
pretty close cut so she wouldn't really

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.140 
pretty close cut so she wouldn't really
need<00:06:18.460> that<00:06:18.669> and<00:06:18.940> also<00:06:19.630> if<00:06:20.009> a<00:06:21.009> lot<00:06:21.729> of<00:06:21.849> scrubs

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
need that and also if a lot of scrubs

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.140 
need that and also if a lot of scrubs
shirts<00:06:22.360> I<00:06:22.539> noticed<00:06:22.930> have<00:06:23.529> like<00:06:24.009> a<00:06:24.039> V<00:06:24.490> cut<00:06:25.000> out

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
shirts I noticed have like a V cut out

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.930 
shirts I noticed have like a V cut out
like<00:06:25.449> right<00:06:25.659> here<00:06:26.050> and<00:06:27.039> I<00:06:27.430> guess<00:06:27.580> that's<00:06:27.729> to

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
like right here and I guess that's to

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.430 
like right here and I guess that's to
make<00:06:28.060> it<00:06:28.180> easier<00:06:28.479> if<00:06:28.900> you<00:06:28.990> could<00:06:29.110> like<00:06:29.229> sit

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
make it easier if you could like sit

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.019 
make it easier if you could like sit
down<00:06:29.620> or<00:06:29.800> something<00:06:29.919> but<00:06:30.310> I'm<00:06:30.610> not<00:06:30.789> going<00:06:30.969> to
