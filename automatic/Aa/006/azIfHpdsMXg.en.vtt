00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the camera this is going this way you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.930 
the camera this is going this way you
can<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> batteries<00:00:59.489> correctly

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
can have the batteries correctly

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.060 
can have the batteries correctly
inserted<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.170> doesn't<00:01:01.469> go<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.710> correctly

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
inserted if it doesn't go in correctly

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.219 
inserted if it doesn't go in correctly
and<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.789> find<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.180> very<00:01:03.210> tough<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:04.080> it's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
and you find it very tough then it's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.390 
and you find it very tough then it's
probably<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.680> right<00:01:04.920> way<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.159> again

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
probably not the right way so again

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.160 
probably not the right way so again

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
snaps in place that level comes up so

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.330 
snaps in place that level comes up so
that<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> batteries<00:01:12.990> send<00:01:13.380> me<00:01:13.439> say<00:01:13.590> kid<00:01:13.799> if

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that the batteries send me say kid if

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.130 
that the batteries send me say kid if
you<00:01:14.520> pop<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.909> down<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.479> batteries<00:01:15.750> pop<00:01:15.990> out

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
certain that to the slot find put that

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.580 
certain that to the slot find put that
there<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.159> push<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:42.290> should<00:01:43.290> click<00:01:43.470> in

down now and snap boom it takes a
picture<00:02:41.340> boom<00:02:42.340> snap<00:02:42.700> I<00:02:43.060> just<00:02:43.690> pushed<00:02:43.900> the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
picture boom snap I just pushed the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.560 
picture boom snap I just pushed the
completely<00:02:44.350> down<00:02:44.620> has<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:44.860> very<00:02:45.160> fast<00:02:45.570> focus

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
completely down has a very fast focus

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.040 
completely down has a very fast focus
mechanism<00:02:47.080> on<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.710> as<00:02:48.040> well<00:02:48.280> as<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.490> very<00:02:48.700> fast

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
mechanism on it as well as a very fast

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.110 
mechanism on it as well as a very fast
shutter<00:02:50.050> lag<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.500> it's<00:02:50.620> not<00:02:50.740> vey<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.970> don't

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
shutter lag so it's not vey you don't

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.520 
shutter lag so it's not vey you don't
have<00:02:52.240> that<00:02:52.360> delays<00:02:52.660> like<00:02:52.870> other<00:02:53.080> cameras

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
have that delays like other cameras

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.290 
have that delays like other cameras
again<00:02:53.860> it's<00:02:54.040> an<00:02:54.130> EXO<00:02:54.640> model<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.210> you're

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
again it's an EXO model so it you're

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.690 
again it's an EXO model so it you're
gonna<00:02:55.450> have<00:02:55.570> premium<00:02:56.140> processors<00:02:56.890> on<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.250> so

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
gonna have premium processors on that so

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.070 
gonna have premium processors on that so
I<00:02:57.760> just<00:02:57.790> took<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.090> few<00:02:58.270> pictures<00:02:58.480> if<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:58.840> wanted

to zoom in I can do that and and it
shows<00:03:01.690> me<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.930> number<00:03:02.530> of<00:03:02.830> zoom<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.460> have

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730
