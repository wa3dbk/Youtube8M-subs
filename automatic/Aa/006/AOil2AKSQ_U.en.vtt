source<00:01:17.700> what<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:18.900> special<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.259> this

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
source what is really special about this

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.770 
source what is really special about this
is<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.799> they've<00:01:20.250> gathered<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.299> lot<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.600> data

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
is that they've gathered a lot of data

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.560 
is that they've gathered a lot of data
over<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.170> years<00:01:22.439> about<00:01:22.619> about<00:01:23.520> RFI<00:01:24.000> shielding

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
over the years about about RFI shielding

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.499 
over the years about about RFI shielding
so<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.229> has<00:01:25.409> superior<00:01:26.220> RFI<00:01:26.729> shielding<00:01:27.150> which

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
so this has superior RFI shielding which

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.630 
so this has superior RFI shielding which
is<00:01:27.659> very<00:01:27.840> important<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.470> today's<00:01:28.950> world<00:01:29.400> of

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
is very important in today's world of

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.050 
is very important in today's world of
you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> RF<00:01:30.600> market<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:32.100> everywhere

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
you know the RF market is everywhere

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.880 
you know the RF market is everywhere
especially<00:01:33.210> metro<00:01:33.869> areas<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.439> really

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
especially metro areas it's really

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.340 
especially metro areas it's really
really<00:01:35.280> busy<00:01:35.430> out<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:37.140> will

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
really busy out there so this will

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.370 
really busy out there so this will
perform<00:01:37.799> flawlessly<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:39.390> all<00:01:39.600> those<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:39.990> far

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
perform flawlessly and all those as far

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.450 
perform flawlessly and all those as far
as<00:01:40.500> features<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.220> has<00:01:41.509> zero<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:43.259> 60<00:01:43.680> DB<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.430> gain

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
as features it has zero to 60 DB of gain

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.770 
as features it has zero to 60 DB of gain
in<00:01:44.909> 3<00:01:45.750> DB<00:01:45.990> steps<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> switch<00:01:47.270> some<00:01:48.270> low<00:01:48.479> cuts

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
in 3 DB steps on a switch some low cuts

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.399 
in 3 DB steps on a switch some low cuts
naturally<00:01:50.030> mute<00:01:51.030> polarity<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.079> that's

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
naturally mute polarity and that's

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.660 
naturally mute polarity and that's
essentially<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.299> works<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.770> AC<00:01:55.770> which<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
essentially it works on AC which is the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.569 
essentially it works on AC which is the
first<00:01:56.820> AC<00:01:57.149> product<00:01:57.930> they've<00:01:58.020> ever<00:01:58.229> made<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:59.009> 60

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
first AC product they've ever made in 60

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.730 
first AC product they've ever made in 60
years<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.420> pretty<00:02:00.659> special<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.350> looks

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
years so it's pretty special it looks

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.469 
years so it's pretty special it looks
beautiful<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.549> made<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.210> same

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
beautiful it's made to the same

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.130 
beautiful it's made to the same
standards<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:04.649> their<00:02:05.280> microphones<00:02:05.729> so

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
standards as as their microphones so

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.630 
standards as as their microphones so
well<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.500> I'm<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> location<00:02:08.280> engineer

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
well you know I'm a location engineer

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.699 
well you know I'm a location engineer
myself<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.539> think<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.989> kind<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.259> thing<00:02:10.500> is

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
myself so I think this kind of thing is

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.650 
myself so I think this kind of thing is
going<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.129> come<00:02:11.310> really<00:02:11.700> handy<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.300> those<00:02:12.540> of

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
going to come really handy for those of

the<00:02:27.260> MK<00:02:27.410> 22<00:02:28.070> as<00:02:28.460> you<00:02:28.940> know<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.270> 21<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:29.780> one<00:02:29.870> of

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
the MK 22 as you know the 21 is one of

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.930 
the MK 22 as you know the 21 is one of
my<00:02:30.020> favorite<00:02:30.560> capsules<00:02:31.100> that<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.490> guys<00:02:31.640> made

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
my favorite capsules that you guys made

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.450 
my favorite capsules that you guys made
chefs<00:02:32.930> considers<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.890> MK<00:02:34.460> 21<00:02:34.520> as<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.600> ideal

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
chefs considers the MK 21 as the ideal

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.850 
chefs considers the MK 21 as the ideal
in<00:02:37.460> their<00:02:37.850> range<00:02:38.240> of<00:02:38.540> polar<00:02:39.080> patterns<00:02:39.470> the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
in their range of polar patterns the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.160 
in their range of polar patterns the
reason<00:02:40.190> what<00:02:40.430> makes<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.730> MK<00:02:41.090> 21<00:02:41.150> special<00:02:42.020> is

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
reason what makes the MK 21 special is

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.800 
reason what makes the MK 21 special is
the<00:02:42.530> polar<00:02:42.740> pattern<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.600> completely<00:02:44.600> linear

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
the polar pattern is completely linear

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.660 
the polar pattern is completely linear
and<00:02:45.260> independent<00:02:46.100> on<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.250> frequency

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
and independent on the frequency

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.460 
and independent on the frequency

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
response so in the lowest frequencies

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.300 
response so in the lowest frequencies
all<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.800> way<00:02:48.890> up<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.100> highest

MK<00:03:06.710> 21<00:03:06.770> wide<00:03:07.370> cardioid<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.060> make<00:03:08.390> it<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.570> little

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
MK 21 wide cardioid and make it a little

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.720 
MK 21 wide cardioid and make it a little
more<00:03:08.810> directional<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:09.800> when<00:03:09.980> you're<00:03:10.190> just<00:03:10.640> say

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
more directional so when you're just say

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.490 
more directional so when you're just say
you're<00:03:10.880> recording<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.480> string<00:03:11.870> quartet<00:03:12.080> you

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
you're recording a string quartet you

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.220 
you're recording a string quartet you
can<00:03:12.650> use<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:13.040> 22<00:03:13.730> instead<00:03:14.480> of<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.630> 21<00:03:15.050> because

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
can use the 22 instead of the 21 because

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.750 
can use the 22 instead of the 21 because
it<00:03:15.470> plays<00:03:15.710> nice<00:03:16.040> with<00:03:16.070> each<00:03:16.280> other<00:03:16.520> it<00:03:16.640> has<00:03:16.670> a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
it plays nice with each other it has a

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.750 
it plays nice with each other it has a
little<00:03:16.880> more<00:03:16.970> directionality<00:03:17.800> it's<00:03:18.800> become<00:03:19.340> a

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
little more directionality it's become a

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.130 
little more directionality it's become a
really<00:03:20.920> popular<00:03:21.920> capsule<00:03:22.580> and<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:23.870> was<00:03:23.990> just
