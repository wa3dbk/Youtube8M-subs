00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
to be so yeah and this is building the

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.950 
to be so yeah and this is building the

stock apparently you need that that
piece<00:01:44.230> in<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.560> piece<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:45.870> yeah<00:01:46.870> put<00:01:47.170> 2<00:01:47.710> by<00:01:47.890> 3

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
piece in that piece so yeah put 2 by 3

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.180 
piece in that piece so yeah put 2 by 3
and<00:01:48.850> then<00:01:49.570> that<00:01:49.900> one<00:01:50.110> has<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.350> have<00:01:50.590> a<00:01:50.620> hold<00:01:51.010> in

and then that one has to have a hold in
it<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.720> just<00:01:53.020> keep<00:01:53.230> that<00:01:53.320> in<00:01:53.500> mind<00:01:53.830> um<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:56.580> chose

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
it so just keep that in mind um I chose

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.430 
it so just keep that in mind um I chose
it<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:58.090> be<00:01:58.300> a<00:02:00.330> kind<00:02:01.330> of<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.540> cross<00:02:01.840> whole<00:02:02.170> thing

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
it to be a kind of a cross whole thing

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.770 
it to be a kind of a cross whole thing
so<00:02:03.190> you<00:02:03.250> can<00:02:03.400> stick<00:02:03.910> a<00:02:03.940> trigger<00:02:04.270> in<00:02:04.390> there<00:02:04.630> and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
so you can stick a trigger in there and

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.010 
so you can stick a trigger in there and
