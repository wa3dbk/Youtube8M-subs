00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.550
 how to make cards with your own hands from 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.559
 paper dress origami 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.120
 Hello, my name is Ivanova Galina 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.740
 Thanks for stopping by my 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.109
 master class hope it will be for you 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.599
 useful 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:23.339
 today I want to show you how to do 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:26.759
 beautiful origami dress made of paper without 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:30.679
 glue and scissors do-it-yourself 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:34.230
 dresses can decorate any card 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:38.310
 invitation album and photo frames and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.050
 so on to make an origami dress 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.220
 need to take a square sheet of paper 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:51.890
 we fold the square in color 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:56.150
 inwards in the middle of the sides now need 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.400
 square divided into 6 equal stripes 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.800
 the deal is just using niki potion 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.390
 each half into 3 equal parts in 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.789
 I get a half somewhere around 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.359
 10 centimeters means about three to go 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:15.090
 centimeter will be 1 striped extreme 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:22.130
 striped on the wrong side 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:25.130
 and h1 the rest of the paper on 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.130
 half 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:32.490
 that's how it separated half 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:36.109
 square found stripes it did not come out 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.109
 and continue to work 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.909
 next part 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.200
 divided the square into 6 identical 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:55.310
 strips and bend them like this way to 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:03.770
 the center turned out such a blank 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:05.170
 Now you need to open the bottom of our 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.220
 Circuits for this 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.590
 focusing on this middle 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:17.630
 which we have here from her 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:22.700
 like this and I move this piece prozhimayu 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:29.180
 fold and above it turns out this 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:35.090
 the fold will be here 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:40.690
 small crease also deal with the second 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.690
 sides starting from the middle of the part 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.690
 I fit the fold and it turns out with this 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:03:02.170
 the sides are also folds so that they 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:09.790
 came out symmetric now top need 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:14.410
 bend the strip bend the corner and here 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.680
 here it turns out we intersect it and 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.870
 will be a guide what can 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.070
 The same guideline should be done. 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.070
 the other side 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.450
 darkening bending striped 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.450
 focusing on these and not 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.680
 Now I squash these squares 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.680
 is done 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:58.250
 so on the one hand and just flatten out 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:04:00.430
 on the other hand we turn over 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.430
 preparation 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.959
 I need to be explained in pairs so I 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.590
 I will show and you see maybe 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:18.889
 so it will be easier that is, striped 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:22.989
 bend down and one edge starts 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.989
 the middle is starting to bend 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.900
 such as 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.690
 so it turns out that's the same way 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:54.830
 turn over the image and these 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.990
 corners 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.310
 which we here have them too need 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:07.639
 flatten can do extra 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:13.180
 fold in this way can be so be 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.180
 simpler and like that 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.999
 flatten these corners here 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:32.259
 you need to fold our part where we have here 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:37.319
 these folds have turned out need to do 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:37.319
 fold slightly above these folds 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.390
 now bend this fold 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.390
 to the other side 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:09.030
 here we have the middle we are 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.030
 did before 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:19.810
 and the contribution to the point so turned over 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:28.449
 today the frontier world of lats let's say already 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:31.220
 finally our flesh 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:33.350
 there may be a little moment 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.570
 so for harder so look and 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:39.320
 repeat will do next with ours 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:42.290
 Sochi and best of all is an origami dress 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.760
 to make from not very thick paper because 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.000
 that perhaps some moments yes 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:54.800
 Difficult to do so here reveal 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:58.520
 corner about like this and from this 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:02.150
 corner we see bend over here 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:05.560
 up goes the fold like this 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:11.370
 it turns out on the one hand did 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:13.889
 and we do the same with the other side 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:21.340
 you need to try to 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:23.260
 the sides came out the same now from here 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.320
 this corner that you have turned 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:29.730
 need to bend over here 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.730
 paper down 

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:44.689
 and get off at the edge are not paid as well as the 

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:44.689
 this side of the body 

00:07:52.660 --> 00:08:00.660
 a couple on the other side and such 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:04.440
 roach leagues 

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.440
 the results turned out 

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.790
 Thank you for your attention if you liked
