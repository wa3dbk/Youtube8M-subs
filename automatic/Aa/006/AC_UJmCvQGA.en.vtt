 guidotti fronts but the site 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.940
 we defend with 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.530
 5 goals 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.900
 how is the ratio 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.870
 where we can see 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.260
 that we can do it online through the page and register in 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.240
 as username 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.740
 we witness in game 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.820
 just enter we find the selection of servers 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.950
 corresponding to eighth region 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.530
 in this case 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.530
 mundoel we will select europe union 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.230
 here to the creator different types of characters 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.690
 in any case 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.030
 You can choose 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.640
 between the 5 types of characters 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.110
 would be the black is min 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.740
 they have been 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.180
 already more loved 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.780
 a warrior 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.380
 and a world 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.260
 there are three a maximum of three characters 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.060
 because the case like any role play 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.060
 first it is based on levels 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.930
 let's say in 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.930
 in elements for 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.590
 in beijing all invocation them 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.230
 different types of 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.840
 of weapons 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.360
 after we had already been attending types of attacks that suffer here 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.530
 reflected in the statistics of the player 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.729
 and well let's get it money for the different elements and so we do not know 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.110
 go down a little bit 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.430
 we will encourage shared character to see a little the operation 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.349
 we received the screen 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.029
 that tells us the teeth types of understanding screens that have been created 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.399
 gasquet dark circles 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.869
 they ask for accounts with more matches than you have 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:23.869
 different type 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.849
 and good we will access any 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.589
 here these workers goes by teams 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.699
 after destroying 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:37.099
 with said 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.819
 the opposite team 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.909
 You can also do all against all 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.669
 by teams 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.469
 and well we do not enter 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.469
 Here we can see a little the controls that explain it to us 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.169
 but always leaving in it the initial goal we can modify the 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.389
 once we enter safely 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.389
 let's have a moment of waiting for the games to end 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.999
 because we can not enter a game already started 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.359
 and then with two terminals 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.799
 start to play 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.849
 this movement is based on the US keys and doubles is the real 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:26.939
 and we can 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.359
 like the character a little bit 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.359
 our taste using mouse to move the camera 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:36.219
 the new stop you 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.309
 equaled and we are meeting with the different players of the team 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:42.309
 contrary 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:45.939
 we arrive is to make a goal in which we must destroy 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.260
 and with him can be the enemy then that's when you get the 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.399
 Team victory 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:56.429
 when with two mouse buttons May 3 secondary we can perform 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:59.119
 different types of attacks 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:02.579
 film lays out different types of combinations 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.579
 or it is directly a simple attack 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:10.309
 flames that still keeps two pulse to the secondary counterattackxxi 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.560
 occurs primary 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.359
 after normal attacks appear but 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.359
 combined 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.229
 good as you can see from Thursday in simple is about that 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.639
 to kill the adversaries already and because of that get money and equipment 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:47.009
 to go up six days in use of his image and thus be able to improve it his 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.009
 attacks on the most powerful 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.999
 and up to here everything 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:02.460
 we come back in the next video tutorial 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.340
 and to others
