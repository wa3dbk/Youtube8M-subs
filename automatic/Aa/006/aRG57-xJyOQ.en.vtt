think you've got to go for looks to

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.050 
think you've got to go for looks to
start<00:01:32.979> with<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.369> then<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:33.580> look<00:01:33.729> inside

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
start with and then you look inside

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.260 
start with and then you look inside
probably<00:01:34.390> don't<00:01:34.690> you<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.399> probably<00:01:36.399> sitting

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
probably don't you and probably sitting

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.740 
probably don't you and probably sitting
with<00:01:37.360> certain<00:01:38.070> girls<00:01:39.070> isn't<00:01:39.490> it<00:01:39.550> you<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.210> look

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
with certain girls isn't it you the look

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.420 
with certain girls isn't it you the look
of<00:01:40.899> it<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.020> track<00:01:41.590> sure<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.890> start<00:01:42.100> with<00:01:42.280> and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
of it a track sure to start with and

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.590 
of it a track sure to start with and
then<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.610> get<00:01:42.759> to<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:42.970> note<00:01:43.119> know<00:01:43.330> them<00:01:43.509> a<00:01:43.539> bit

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
then you get to the note know them a bit

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.330 
then you get to the note know them a bit
more<00:01:43.930> so<00:01:44.110> I<00:01:44.140> think<00:01:44.380> it's<00:01:44.560> that<00:01:44.680> is<00:01:45.039> the<00:01:45.190> same

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
more so I think it's that is the same

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.930 
more so I think it's that is the same
with<00:01:45.550> cars
