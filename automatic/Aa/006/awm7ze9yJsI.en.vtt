00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.599
 haye is niklas with another 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.160
 toshiba video and two we treat 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.420
 this time the satellite 270 notebook 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.490
 we can go directly with the technical 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.100
 data is installed on an intel here 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.859
 core i7 with whole 2 4 ghz 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.490
 the cores enter in turbo mode 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.630
 with 3.4 gigahertz so almost normal me 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.759
 even almost with a whole 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.710
 gigahertz faster 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.309
 whole 16 gigabytes of ddr3 memory are 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.010
 installed 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.079
 a data storage is used 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.950
 terabyte disk and for the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.550
 graphical performance is a geforce gt 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.530
 740 m installed and to see here 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.770
 also a very nice one here 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.920
 aluminum housing the material quality is yes 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.960
 really first rate and on the right 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.690
 side we see the audio here 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.739
 connections then have two more usb 3.0 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.200
 Connections a hdmi vga connection 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.180
 There are no connections on the back 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.520
 but here you can see the one 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.700
 hinges with which the 17 3 inches 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.470
 display gets irritated and on the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.369
 left side then the ethernet port 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.710
 and two more usb 3.0 connections that 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.890
 display is as mentioned 17 3 inches tall 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.040
 and dissolves at 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.400
 and also supports intel wireless 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.290
 display technology 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.100
 All in all, we can say that 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.010
 our first impression is that toshiba 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.200
 really important notebook especially 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.750
 as far as the performance goes on the market 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.070
 brings and the whole will then 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.440
 paired with a really 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.420
 excellent workmanship of the man 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.220
 I think so too in this 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.440
 video can convince quite well 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.399
 that was it from me i hope you have 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.380
 the video has fallen 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.330
 if so subscribed on 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.950
 our channel and I look forward to it 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.950
 watch the next video until then
