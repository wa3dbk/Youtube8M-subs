00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:08.280
 it's a good thing today I finally saw the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.690
 great gatsby then reporter of the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.500
 teaches that I wanted to make it was the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.150
 free movie together so good 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.150
 let's start this little book 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.830
 written by scott vision and I say small 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.789
 because it's a short story the book 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.529
 It has 180 pages 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.960
 then a book looks very fast 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.720
 especially because they have very good rhythm 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.059
 of reading the truth is very imposing and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.370
 you do not realize that hours have passed 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.620
 be reading until they have 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.879
 tired and fucked that since you go very good 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.489
 but a good part that since this one 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.370
 mind that you advance a lot then that 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.530
 It's very good because before it makes you 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.510
 you bite and you get very excited about something 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.160
 that I do not have this book I read it in 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.289
 English then I really do not know if the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.949
 Spanish version is equal or not but 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.210
 Well, I suppose if it has 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.070
 many powers that I did not know I think 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.870
 that about ten fifteen words talking 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.329
 I had to search them in google translate 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.390
 because I did not know what it meant 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.460
 listened then as I say I do not know if the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.560
 Spanish is the same but I suppose if 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.320
 it is a faithful translation because it must 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.390
 have about 34 words that do not know 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.439
 but more than interrupting the rhythm of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.180
 book I think this is very good 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.240
 because if we can expand a little 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.820
 our vocabulary and get out of what 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.090
 we have and you believe me how to puncture cat way 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.830
 usually spear raisins and things like that 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.500
 which they are our daily bread 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.570
 in the book it basically deals with the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.119
 love story between Jay Gatsby and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.039
 daisy buchanan all this narrated from 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.679
 the point of view of nick carraway that 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.720
 is one maybe the only friend of the 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.670
 only true friend of the jay gatsby 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.709
 the book starts by introducing us to 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.780
 Nicaragua and the way in which new 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:53.220
 york exist in a place in the city 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.170
 called west where his neighbor as he 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.690
 he realizes that they started many 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.060
 parties and you are very very very big 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.770
 then he gets to investigate a little and he 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.049
 he realizes that his neighbor is one 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.670
 it has at its premium wrong 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.030
 living in new york 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.209
 with his brother-in-law Tom Buchanan who is a 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.190
 great big bastard and the truth 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.959
 throughout the book several times that 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.730
 I said that it is good truth if it 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.090
 deserves needle torture under the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.400
 nails that quite then one day to 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.530
 Nicaragua receives an invitation from Jay 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.080
 gatsby to one of his parties which is 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.300
 very curious and weird because all the people 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.400
 it arrives without invitation and nobody knows 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.350
 hat-trick then to this free and not what 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.060
 they paint like a very mysterious character 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.940
 that really not many people have seen 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.440
 but a lot of people talk about him then 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.600
 one more or less begins to make ones 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.370
 criteria a character that I 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.319
 I fell in love from the beginning of a book 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.420
 since the first time that of 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.489
 jordan baker the truth to me 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.940
 surprised the ability of the 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.580
 words that I read that she said of 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.610
 seduce so much without even seeing a 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.319
 person I really know what he was saying is the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.780
 way he speaks the way 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.269
 try the people I do not know then I 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.680
 makes it very seductive and sexy and the truth in 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.540
 the movie made him pretty 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.040
 justice then as a summary of the book 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.389
 fast of what four out of five 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.920
 stars and the truth is very very 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.810
 It is recommended that you read it before you see the 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.299
 movie because even though the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.489
 movie is very good because there were some 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.049
 three little flaws that they do 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.340
 really better to read the book first 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.170
 so you already know read the book first 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.239
 then call does not light at the end is a 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.030
 very short book a tavern area now 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.469
 yes the great gatsby like good movie 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.090
 obviously I think we all know that 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.980
 leonardo dicaprio is the one who interprets the 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.989
 great gatsby and I think an excellent 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.849
 option because the mole of camps is more 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.159
 an act since I lived the 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.530
 infiltrated the truth I've become a fan of 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.079
 his work and many of my films 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.859
 favorites are from like blood diamond 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.940
 the same infiltrators inception me 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.160
 I really like how that wey acts 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.500
 and this movie is not the exception 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.420
 a very good performance and I 'm not going to 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.820
 disappoint anything like microwave gadget 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.650
 take more eggs has your opinions of 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.940
 lives there are many people who do not like and 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.430
 many people who do like how 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.830
 I personally do not like it 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.600
 like spiderman but I do like how 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.180
 acts in other movies like this one 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.470
 same or as they did not happen 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.140
 I do not know if they saw a movie called 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.540
 between brothers who were with wire tap 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.850
 they arrived jodi natalie portman 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.550
 the one interpreted in military deranged and 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.180
 the truth to an excellent situation here 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.280
 it's a regular function the truth no more 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.230
 nor less do it normal point 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.780
 the movie is visually very very very 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.080
 attractive 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.090
 but I do not recommend the den in 3d 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.460
 the truth 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.010
 Well, there were some movies and I like it 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.160
 see them in 3-d others not but I think that 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.780
 it's a movie that does not merit 3d and 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.840
 you are going to enjoy a lot of good in a 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.720
 digital room so do not spend money 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.300
 extras do not go to see her in 3d 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.760
 and well the only faults that I found 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.710
 maybe sometimes you do not want to put it like that 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.280
 I better say one more nothing 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.730
 the two big ones that I found 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.500
 that once I take cannes he did not make me 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.940
 leave the movie the truth as you 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.940
 I say in the book I wanted to kill a 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.970
 shit of times and in the movie 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.220
 is a normal guy with himself and with his 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.870
 human faults all but not a child of 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.730
 Whore who wants to hurt all the 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.500
 people 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.180
 the truth did not make me see it and I think that 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.880
 the actor who tried it lacked that 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.650
 pons to give to make one 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.689
 dislike and one wants to support it 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.909
 I think it's a 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:40.619
 a faith that I do not go and the others 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:43.469
 I can tell them because I would be 

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:45.619
 saying what Gatwick ends up is not 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.999
 convenient very ugly that you put things 

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:50.089
 an aspect that I want to highlight from the 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:53.339
 movie is that it has a soundtrack 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:55.619
 splendid to me I really liked what 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:57.989
 they did combine all this all this 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:59.939
 1920s era with modern music 

00:05:57.989 --> 00:06:01.709
 the truth between the soundtrack the most 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:02.959
 remarkable that we can keep jazzy 

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:06.329
 who is also a producer of the film 

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:08.849
 and former ex wool of the king florence and the 

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:11.639
 machine among others he is that I suppose 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.529
 meet many because more scenes of 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.629
 the parties that we put you 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:18.209
 obviously it did not exist in years 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:20.159
 Twenty but it makes you feel the pulse 

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:21.629
 is at a party then it makes you 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.519
 feel what the characters of the 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:26.639
 movie are feeling being in their 

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:28.860
 party when they heard it 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.679
 the 20 but that the best to a spectator 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.100
 of the year 2013 we are not going to give it much 

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:37.580
 as a commune d 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.449
 and there yes I do not know any artist that 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.669
 think now 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.620
 so also highly recommended in the 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.969
 film lasts 2 hours 20 some 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.499
 people who are in the movies were 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:48.659
 noticing that it is very long but the 

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:51.270
 true to me I was made with a very good 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:52.650
 rhythm just like the book makes it is very 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.509
 very final book that the truth the 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.520
 dialogues are almost the same because as 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:58.020
 the story is short then there's no need 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.389
 remove many things then 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.669
 practically the movie is the book 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.569
 complete with everything and details which I 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.520
 I liked it enough 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:08.110
 and good to finish the movie of 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.389
 also four of five stars well 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.339
 that they already know go to see it and do not see it 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:14.800
 in 3-d do not spend your money do not be 

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:16.330
