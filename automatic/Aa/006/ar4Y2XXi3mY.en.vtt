00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 the referendum there containing different these thirteen 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.320
 apart from equipment 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 unai emery years 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.639
 is to see who we would call him dad 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.059
 this apart here would be our front of our people 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.970
 this part would be the laterals 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.749
 this part of what would be the floor 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.009
 the back 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.909
 who is said to be here 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.289
 would correspond 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.409
 at the bottom 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.409
 and this other part stakes another hotel 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.210
 which means that we will have to go to register to prioritize the pieces of 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.140
 tell 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.159
 the lateral 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.159
 a background a floor a cover 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.600
 and in this case because I want to be a different material the doors 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.180
 so the high idea 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 the material 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.340
 aurum pablo yours 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.340
 I put him in the general this has to end 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.900
 That is why it has to be strengthened 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.860
 All this 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.930
 yes and helmet 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.920
 and this would correspond other material 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.970
 maybe 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.760
 there will be morbid 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.760
 min 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.250
 p 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.250
 Well, we started first, as it would be our 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.120
 finish 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.820
 note that I'm writing on the left side, that is, the code 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.160
 what I am delivering are references 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.180
 references with 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.250
 as its equivalent in its series tolete as the pointers in c ++ 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.100
 now something very important 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.100
 the other drawing a concert in houston 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.759
 suppose they are 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.759
 this one that is here is the lid of an element 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.009
 I'm going to illustrate what did not touch try 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.409
 suppose that this is the one that always appears 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.159
 then 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.159
 this would correspond 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.489
 at the height of flight 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.489
 this would correspond its depth 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.799
 corresponding request 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.310
 notice you wanted soul we make this piece 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.769
 It's on foot if this was a challenge 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.769
 we would have something similar 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.030
 with what the piece above is to say the pope 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.309
 it would still retain its depth 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:56.560
 still retaining 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.979
 its longitude 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.979
 and the thickness of the material would be given by the height 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.789
 but in this piece that was 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.789
 it would only keep its length 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.529
 and its depth of holidays because of its height 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:14.779
 at the time of changing 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:18.319
 from three dimensions to two dimensions you have to have that kind of 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.029
 considerations to be able to make a good paper good quartering a good 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:25.419
 production 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.419
 a good law cuts as you want to call 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:31.840
 following this logic 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.230
 It's like men 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.409
 how are we going to break all this up 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.379
 in lion I will not stop that kind of details and you will see without 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.970
 how many millimeters need to oppose him to make his waste 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.900
 I am fine but I will continue 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.749
 the logic of what I need 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:52.009
 I will propose after a piece of furniture the excess of renny vega 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:53.599
 what is it that 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.599
 what they need to have challenges 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.219
 well let's see in this case 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:06.269
 the covers 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.269
 much this referential to be tattooed matter of melamine 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:14.819
 pull out melamine breast 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.819
 where the length is still the length 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.699
 the depth 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.120
 it's still the depth 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.330
 i the height 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
 he mentioned that in the deficit 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.189
 it's not strange but still being mondesi truck 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.539
 as for the floor 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.539
 with their product they went deep 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.210
 as for the lateral 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.879
 as well 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.870
 this effort 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.719
 zanuck and your photos there is no tube 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.789
 the deep guys 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.789
 in terms of the background 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.219
 of quito coins 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.199
 let's give it a name 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.199
 escape 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.229
 pc s this is going to be the name of the piece not 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:33.889
 we are going to have it 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.029
 let's register the quantity mode 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:38.389
 nor what is it based 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.080
 - add one more 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.490
 it felt nothing 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.490
 the door 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:52.469
 the strong drought as a background but in other material 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:55.469
 in terms of laporta would be less 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.789
 answer 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.360
 note that you have already registered the material 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.439
 but I think I have not yet registered your measures to say 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.280
 here until then after consuming 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.550
 the 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.369
 we are going to be trapped 

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:25.779
 we register you 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:28.779
 floor 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:40.119
 again we can exaggerate the measures 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:43.159
 because in sixtime this depends on him 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:46.680
 depends on whatever it is not dependent on 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.830
 this measure does not depend on the fourth level 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.399
 here too 

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:53.259
 sanz jesus kumate 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:55.680
 despite all movement of the currency 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.080
 good to insist if you have 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.590
 if you have in Chile but synchronized mourning a third party would be good 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.590
 to avoid generating problems I conquered nothing 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:10.469
 - we change the loan again the entity what is 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:13.469
 we already have two high all this 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:19.199
 so now we would need discharged something that brings all this together 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:20.960
 that is to say 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.960
 a helmet 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:26.030
 I worried 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.139
 the
