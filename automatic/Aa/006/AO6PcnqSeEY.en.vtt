that you're bullying the hot iron on and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.289 
that you're bullying the hot iron on and
how<00:03:07.890> tight<00:03:08.190> your<00:03:08.340> pulled<00:03:08.580> in<00:03:08.670> against<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.150> raw

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
those are things that really can change

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.710 
those are things that really can change
