00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.019

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.070
 adaptation that's life in the united states 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.650
 what you can tell us a few words to 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.880
 those about it here i adapt where 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.800
 day after day it's true that fifteen 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.029
 days I miss that one side it's done 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.100
 a month that I'm here he counted 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.019
 like that because I still have 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.119
 things because really everything is 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.160
 new here it's true that's my 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.960
 adaptation is going pretty well I'm 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.199
 glad it's true that ubs to the states 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.350

 that's it's charm and not just 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.129
 by month there I advise to start to 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.170
 understand a little bit how it works here 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.300
 because it's different from europe 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.070
 I get to know my teammates 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.899
 what do you want how does it work 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.550
 it is that they also progressed 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.340
 classified it every day a little 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.800
 learning new to me that it 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.969
 either on the ground whatsoever that's it 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.829
 did the trip yesterday that was my 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.539
 first trip still does arrive in the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.100
 times the little details like that I 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.100
 discover and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.640
 so I feel valued 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.640
 32 tracks 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.360
 did the fact of having missed the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.920
 preparation an impact on his sisters 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.420
 that's what I missed 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.619
 there are many things I do not know 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.610
 in the game we have a playbook but when 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.100
 I will look at what we are doing 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.930
 today I say to myself but it's good we 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.240
 do not know I get lost I think 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.369
 here I am lacking benchmarks while we 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.259
 at matches we do not have much to 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.450
 work agreement workouts 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.710
 certain things for 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.869
 workouts is here to take my 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.789
 shower no other thing so civil project 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.259
 as much information as possible 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.670
 it's a new collar the flu of 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.840
 to work like that we have really good 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.670
 bossed a lot of things that are 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.890
 news and the fact of having missed the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.770
 preparing for a disability because I 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.119
 not understand but here again 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.979
 it's small details 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.030
 I have faith in agreement then him two 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.580
 questions that I want to ask you the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.850
 first that's why the wm tickets and 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.930
 the second for what atlanta for 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.220
 discover 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.930
 How it works because it's 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.130
 different from Europe it's different from 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.050
 what I'm used to 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.800
 to do that in France or in 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.930
 russia and live it 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.120
 the united states experience with that's the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.660
 mentality of these people there is different 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.190
 of ours 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.620
 basketball also exist in abitibi that 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.890
 would be stupid to die without any attempt 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:34.560
 all that is important 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.930
 I'm happy with them is that the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.370
 wm say the same impact on the players 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.030
 that the nba on the players is what 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.220
 it is a dream 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.500
 agree for me totally disagree 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.640
 because I already had the opportunity to 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.610
 come in the middle of July I always had 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.040
 the name was really not at all 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.190
 adult one is for me to come here 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.660
 but to 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.030
 but here is the career I have 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.680
 europe the fact that they are here the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.510
 a little bit of blood flow 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.200
 spent in my career I told myself 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.850
 why not try I wait rial that 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.980
 I'm waiting for gad weil and the form and in 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.960
 the bottom really say a better 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.760
 player is not it's not that that 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.459
 publicis and him a discovery 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.200
 of this level of this game of this 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.390
 atmosphere the ma 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.129
 and after that so why have 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.420
 chose the team the team atlanta 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.430
 firstly because it is the first 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.790
 team who really contacted me 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.840
 agree from the inside 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.700
 obviously because it's the team that 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.489
 in four years they made three finals 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.280
 so this is a type always end customers 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.530
 of parents at the end of the course in table 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.840
 so that was why interesting 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.840
 and then attacks is a city 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.459
 agree that you have time to go 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.459
 at the museum caucau cnn the aquarium 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:57.379
 okay okay very well and so 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.840
 that's called traveling like that 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.239
 in the united states the road trip is what 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.919
 it's something here that you 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:11.810
 expecting to live political party that 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:13.819
 had recruited me life who sees there when I 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.150
 left alive also an experience 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.600
 of life 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.979
 rossi was doing less 30 it's great 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.019
 interesting because we are good 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.820
 basketball player accordingly no but you 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.470
 discover our morality you tapes reign 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.330
 in really good in the country in 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.949
 which you are living in the united states 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.419
 I want to discover this after 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.740
 noon I went for a walk in town 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.050
 here I go next to the house 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.740
 white finally it's things that 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.389
 there are centers that are I 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.340
 delighted with the experience so closely 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:46.259
 did you already know 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.449
 other players we know that a lot 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.449
 of players evolve in europe is 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:07.660
 okay of course all the players 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.020
 who play in 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.500
 europe managed as 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.470
 but frankly the meeting and 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.840
 it's funny to have them kids 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.419
 opponents and today finally 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.199
 what was piercing here it's nice it's 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.970
 that's also the magic and playing 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:33.070
 in a nba room like that is what 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:35.590
 it's also something we do not have 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.880
 kind of decor and it's a dream then 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.760
 it's a shame because it's not full 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.919
 and suddenly it is a bit empty 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.919
 it is safe but removes the charm well 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.620
 ok thank you very much celine and good 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.620
 luck for the rest of the season
