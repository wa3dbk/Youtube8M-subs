00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.750
 so in between times a criticism of me alone do not worry about a possible 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.569
 good will not come back then 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:14.539
 it's just that it's about a series a canadian mystery series 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.769
 and watching a series is a bit more involved than just a movie 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.570
 I have to watch the series so the last few weeks so gradually 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.529
 looked at and Marie due to the special circumstances, no time 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:25.279
 had 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.199
 finally the whole series look at them that we need said 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.919
 do it alone 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.589
 therefore, and that's why I'm replacing without him, but it's just an exception 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:34.400
 told 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.470
 yes she is about a list Minieri as I said from Canada 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.710
 Munich is called 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.070
 and before ever achieving more here first a few indented 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.030
 b 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.850
 they get a People's Party down to 1 5 billion that leads to reports in Canada 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.740
 not always easy 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.110
 that had another customer use kill but honestly that's over 40 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.900
 Stomping off the backstroke can be done with a tattoo of four in the evening 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.270
 small figures in every direction I could fulfill myself I thought 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.420
 I would be Kaymer I feel their inhabitants at some point the day arrives at the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.130
 you wish that you had with your old father than me 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.490
 Just so rested past let us never understand or evenings were there 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.260
 Protests they should control this place does not fit 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.180
 changed 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.180
 the country has 8 degrees 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.800
 Fox 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.030
 Year would therefore have no hats like series 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.750
 Aldi meanwhile includes two seasons the second season runs in the USA 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.120
 already under four in Germany 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.800
 Soon she will also be the hi-fi 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.830
 yes and the first season now just as synonymous before the synonymous commercially 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.820
 is available 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.120
 which runs here in Germany on RTL 2 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.880
 Percent but it was because of bad odds percent for programs 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.910
 originally moved on Wednesday evening at 22 o'clock 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.040
 and meanwhile 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.890
 Percent the CS around 0 and stand to see and that has just with 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.270
 not great odds to do 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.399
 even as RTL 2 show the second season ever, this time even 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.669
 not clear 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.559
 yes others are in this series it would have been about a small town 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:14.660
 means 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.660
 would not have divorced like heaven and without ideas 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.359
 SLAs Bint derailed if etracker 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.949
 and that will be in these 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:29.349
 Percent called basically 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.569
 normal daily murder case percent more to clear up 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.820
 and 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.650
 b yes it is such that it quickly becomes clear that it is not a coincidence 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.809
 that is me 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:42.099
 because somehow 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.509
 also has her whole life to do with this city 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:49.189
 and it seems that every inhabitant of this city has pilots 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:50.379
 like Dr 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.189
 came here for very specific reasons 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.389
 but you notice that has mystery elements 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.109
 on an element for us everything is so kind 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.389
 opaque 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.559
 and percent is in the first episode so synonymous percent already right 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:05.449
 go then it is 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.450
 and continues in the aftermath 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.379
 on 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.629
 Eckart Lohse is based on a novel by Stephen King Cole Radu Kit 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.979
 and percent 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.979
 I say so if you like the series like 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:24.459
 um for rust or or percent eureka 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.299
 or 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.889
 because what I do 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.439
 is not too much the unfounded bit is not for him to the point 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:34.399
 going 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:37.889
 finally, they will probably be served quite well this year as well 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.999
 where I've heard so many reviews have read where people are 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.619
 so say well 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:47.739
 With this known mystery series, this percent can 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.119
 if we are far from keeping up here 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:53.259
 she had only a mediocre servant 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:57.299
 and I also think that she is badly improvised in German, so I know 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.159
 Not about 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.189
 Percent I have had the feeling 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.099
 the general trend is and we visit Germany now percent 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.989
 as for the synchronization in the qualities how to save I know 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.979
 rather, it's not that much of a focus on the show 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.299
 therefore, that the series does not work at all 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.949
 It has been improvised with passion, it really is a standard one 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:17.289
 Synchronization and 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.729
 because sometimes the two stand on the street talking each other and at all 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:21.699
 no noise 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.860
 the two just just talk that there are no roads Gerolstein 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.689
 Wind noise nothing to hear 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.279
 and that seems a bit embarrassing to me 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.729
 but where that just incidentally you can also look at English is 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.429
 the before the also the possibility that it works or French if 

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:38.370
 You want 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.330
 Personally, I'm not that big a club 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.139
 We would have to have said of this fantasy series in that respect 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.139
 I'm still playing after a few episodes and eventually bored 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.319
 and I did not really care how it goes on anymore 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:52.110
 but 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.529
 if they like such series and the Americans 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:57.779
 Alcoa in this case the Canadians 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:02.169
 there are also in the situation such series with Fritz special effects and fell to 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.189
 to offer to make in the elements 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:07.930
 because they like something then they can be happy for this series of women 

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:10.929
 and men certainly are not completely wrong 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.690
 by nike the series the by 0 5 points i found them said percent 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.229
 on average I did not really pack here 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.190
 Aldi Extras Kind of me 8 points that a lot of extras on it what you get 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:25.430
 Percent girl on 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.710
 with and around interviews with leading actor 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.030
 and for all those who can not wait, but already one out 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.509
 view 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.189
 on the second season 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:38.709
 yes as I said if you want to get a picture of the series we have in 

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:41.969
 Television has the option to do so every Wednesday at 0: 10 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:43.479
 rtl2 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.719
 and then they can still get that dvd-box internally 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:47.969
 like 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:49.580
 that was from me 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.000
 until next time then finally back to Lyon
