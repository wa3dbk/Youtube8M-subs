00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.030 
going to lead you so with Mac the amount
of<00:02:47.819> time<00:02:48.090> he<00:02:48.480> got<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.110> quickly<00:02:49.650> in<00:02:49.799> key

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
of time he got so quickly in key

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.460 
of time he got so quickly in key
situations<00:02:50.370> because<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.569> injury<00:02:51.900> has

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
situations because of that injury has

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.000 
situations because of that injury has
accelerated<00:02:53.010> his<00:02:53.430> process<00:02:54.019> where<00:02:55.019> maybe<00:02:55.530> that

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
accelerated his process where maybe that

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.800 
accelerated his process where maybe that
would<00:02:56.160> be<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.310> year<00:02:56.640> down<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:56.879> road<00:02:57.060> if<00:02:57.450> we

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
would be a year down the road if we

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.089 
would be a year down the road if we
didn't<00:02:57.989> have<00:02:58.019> an<00:02:58.200> injury<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.739> never<00:02:58.890> know

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
didn't have an injury so you never know

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.910 
didn't have an injury so you never know
how<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.430> works<00:02:59.640> out<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:01.200> know<00:03:01.560> i'm<00:03:01.739> not

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
how this works out and you know i'm not

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.940 
how this works out and you know i'm not
sure<00:03:02.099> if<00:03:02.190> all<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.370> us<00:03:02.489> put<00:03:02.670> those<00:03:02.819> two<00:03:03.030> guys<00:03:03.180> up

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
sure if all of us put those two guys up

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.050 
sure if all of us put those two guys up
that's<00:03:04.950> just<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.250> way<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.489> works<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.970> that's

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
that's just the way it works and that's

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.490 
that's just the way it works and that's
the<00:03:06.390> interesting<00:03:06.630> part<00:03:06.840> when<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.380> have

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
the interesting part when you have

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.930 
the interesting part when you have
injuries<00:03:07.860> how<00:03:08.400> things<00:03:08.700> work<00:03:08.880> out<00:03:10.610> what<00:03:11.610> makes

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
injuries how things work out what makes

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.460 
injuries how things work out what makes
them<00:03:12.180> work<00:03:12.390> together<00:03:12.569> because<00:03:12.900> sometimes<00:03:13.380> you

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
them work together because sometimes you

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.640 
them work together because sometimes you
see<00:03:13.650> defense<00:03:14.099> bears<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.790> work<00:03:15.030> because<00:03:15.390> they

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
see defense bears that work because they

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.640 
see defense bears that work because they
represent<00:03:16.650> opposite<00:03:17.370> skills<00:03:17.720> different

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.710 

fairly<00:03:22.650> similar<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:26.760> just<00:03:27.060> does<00:03:27.299> you<00:03:27.599> know

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
fairly similar it just does you know

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.720 
fairly similar it just does you know
it's<00:03:27.930> just<00:03:28.049> like<00:03:28.200> scotty<00:03:29.010> when<00:03:29.250> we<00:03:29.340> put<00:03:29.519> lines

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
it's just like scotty when we put lines

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.160 
it's just like scotty when we put lines
together<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.360> don't<00:03:30.629> know<00:03:30.720> if<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.900> lines<00:03:31.079> are

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
together I don't know if the lines are

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.020 
together I don't know if the lines are
gonna<00:03:31.290> work<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:32.250> try<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.489> put<00:03:32.700> some<00:03:32.849> guys

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
gonna work you try to put some guys

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.340 
gonna work you try to put some guys
together<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.510> don't<00:03:33.660> know<00:03:33.870> if<00:03:33.959> it's<00:03:34.109> going<00:03:34.260> to

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
together you don't know if it's going to

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.580 
together you don't know if it's going to
work<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.739> just<00:03:35.010> have<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.250> feel<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.730> watch<00:03:36.180> it

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
work you just have a feel you watch it

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.800 
work you just have a feel you watch it
and<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.769> see<00:03:37.980> if<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.220> does<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.850> that's<00:03:39.600> what

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
and you see if it does and that's what

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.069 
and you see if it does and that's what
happened<00:03:40.109> with<00:03:40.200> Mac<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.530> Danny<00:03:41.630> it<00:03:42.630> certainly

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
happened with Mac and Danny it certainly

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.170 
happened with Mac and Danny it certainly
was<00:03:43.290> out<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.650> necessity<00:03:44.010> we<00:03:44.400> talked<00:03:45.060> about

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
was out of necessity we talked about

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.789 
was out of necessity we talked about
Michael<00:03:45.599> Del<00:03:45.720> Zotto<00:03:45.930> but<00:03:46.200> Michael<00:03:46.500> Del<00:03:46.650> Zotto

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
Michael Del Zotto but Michael Del Zotto

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.530 
Michael Del Zotto but Michael Del Zotto
was<00:03:47.069> still<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.430> process<00:03:47.609> of<00:03:48.060> being<00:03:48.239> coming

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
was still in the process of being coming

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.599 
was still in the process of being coming
out<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.870> minors<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.410> starting<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.459> play

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
out of the minors and starting to play

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.800 
out of the minors and starting to play
again<00:03:51.440> so<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.500> never<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:54.180> if<00:03:54.389> any<00:03:54.569> coach

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
again so you never and if any coach

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.420 
again so you never and if any coach
tells<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.380> he<00:03:55.500> knows<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:56.069> will<00:03:56.280> work

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
tells you that he knows this will work

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.240 
tells you that he knows this will work
he's<00:03:56.819> lying<00:03:57.090> because<00:03:57.510> we<00:03:57.840> don't<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.650> try<00:03:59.190> it

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
he's lying because we don't you try it

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.879

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
accelerated and we thought they did some

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.600 
accelerated and we thought they did some
good<00:04:21.000> things<00:04:21.060> right<00:04:21.599> away<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:23.370> not<00:04:23.400> only

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
good things right away and not only
