00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
these drivers that i have installed are

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.419 
these drivers that i have installed are
from<00:01:38.209> 2006<00:01:39.049> you<00:01:39.499> know<00:01:39.649> there's<00:01:39.859> versions

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
from 2006 you know there's versions

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.199 
from 2006 you know there's versions
released<00:01:40.609> that<00:01:40.999> were<00:01:41.060> in<00:01:42.069> 2009-2010<00:01:43.069> i<00:01:43.549> mean

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
released that were in 2009-2010 i mean

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:45.879 
released that were in 2009-2010 i mean
it's<00:01:44.359> ridiculous<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.959> have<00:01:45.079> a<00:01:45.200> driver<00:01:45.529> from

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:45.889 
it's ridiculous to have a driver from

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:48.249 
it's ridiculous to have a driver from
2006<00:01:46.700> when<00:01:47.359> there's<00:01:47.539> one<00:01:47.689> there's<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:47.899> released

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
2006 when there's one there's a released

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.529 
2006 when there's one there's a released
in<00:01:48.409> 2009<00:01:49.099> I<00:01:49.340> mean<00:01:49.939> think<00:01:50.119> about<00:01:50.179> how<00:01:50.479> many

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
in 2009 I mean think about how many

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.570 
in 2009 I mean think about how many
changes<00:01:51.200> they've<00:01:51.439> made<00:01:51.469> in

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
changes they've made in

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.130
