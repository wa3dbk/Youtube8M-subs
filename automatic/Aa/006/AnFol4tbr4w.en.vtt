00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.910
 construction where the internal contour in the furnace 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.460
 made of refractory bricks such 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:47.910
 way tab excludes manifestation 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.910
 surface cracks and h 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.489
 a large fireplace was installed in the furnace 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.480
 door with panoramic glass

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.670
 camera mode detection 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:07.460
 the furnace has several burning modes 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:10.280
 in summer mode, flue gases from the firebox 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.450
 passing through the bread chamber immediately 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.390
 goes into the chimney with this mode oven 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.360
 heats up minimally 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.200
 with winter mode, flue gases fall 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.640
 piles into the bread chamber 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.810
 goes down the side channel and 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:35.420
 joining the bottom leaves already in the chimney

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.390
 then you can use thermal 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.850
 seat cushion 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.710
