00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.820
 time of day dear lovers 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:20.320
 sun berries and grapevines in 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:25.480
 this video I want to show how after 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:28.180
 blooms remove extra clusters 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.189
 what exactly bunches for what are they 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:36.579
 are deleted 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:39.850
 why is this done by the example of one 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.520
 the bush I want to show one flowering was 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:49.960
 left is recommended to leave 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:51.629
 2 inflorescence first inflorescence second well 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.329
 as i know 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.649
 characteristic of some varieties that 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.909
 like 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:04.809
 there may be a particular sort of talisman or 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:08.700
 cache 1st water can reach freely 20 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:12.700
 gram and although the female type of flower here is well 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.240
 subject to certain techniques 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.729
 he pollinated pretty good 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.590
 given that the berry is here 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:26.469
 the greatest 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:30.850
 this is the essence of the books well, you can everywhere 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:33.549
 read that somewhere in 1820 the leaves are higher 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.740
 lives can feed by digging weight somewhere 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:40.600
 half a kilogram well, in principle, here I think 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.539
 there is a lot depends on the conditions 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.030
 agricultural technology 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.500
 from what kind of irrigation you vineyard and 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.369
 field how often she 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.020
 feed him well now everything 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.829
 modern varieties and hybrid forms 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.429
 easily give out clusters and a half a kilo and 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.289
 more 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:04.649
 it does not bother you can even say 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:09.310
 so be sure to ration 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:13.750
 when flowering was inserted in 2 20 because 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.610
 and so i see it dusting fine for what 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.620
 This is done to the first inflorescence 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.620
 lower bloom earlier second later 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.730
 a little if 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.360
 bad weather was raining lower inflorescence 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.360
 maybe bad already polycythemia here somehow 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.769
 inflorescence so it flowed perfectly but 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.340
 Lower inflorescence usually larger 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:40.769
 always more developed so lower 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.519
 leave in color on one shoot 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.620
 and the top is removed here the principle is easy 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:51.620
 everything is done pruning on a small 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.620
 Pinscher expose because the movement 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:00.810
 retired from the color and thus we are more 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.540
 food is sent to this inflorescence is not 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.040
 when we break the bush and all modern 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:11.129
 varieties on I have spoken already large roses 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.829
 gives enough therefore on one trace 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:18.329
 bullets 1 impact deliver in order not to 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.609
 when you load a bush well, if pobeh 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.760
 located at the very end of fruit 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:28.650
 arrows he is more developed usually since 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.660
 the force of polarity can be a little stronger there 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:36.690
 pressure but still no more than 1 georgia 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:41.069
 here you can even do this 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:45.540
 as the lower part is somewhere worse visible 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:49.709
 getting dusty and just a little bit 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.639
 and delete and everything will be full 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.790
 I say this variety easily maintain 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:04:00.209
 in Georgia up to two kilograms 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:03.000
 I am glad to be 20 grams and more such 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.919
 small recommendations will be questions 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.109
 write in the comments subscribe to 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.109
