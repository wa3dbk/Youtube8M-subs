down he may have told him but he's got

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.449 
down he may have told him but he's got
some<00:02:11.930> chondral<00:02:12.410> loss<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.980> inside<00:02:13.220> of<00:02:13.340> his

that blue cartilage kind of lost in our

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.120 
that blue cartilage kind of lost in our
goal<00:02:17.660> with<00:02:17.870> these<00:02:18.049> regenerative<00:02:18.680> injections

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
goal with these regenerative injections

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:31.750 
goal with these regenerative injections
is<00:02:19.220> get<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.459> body<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.910> repair

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.770 

there<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.849> can<00:02:32.940> see<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.239> needle<00:02:33.390> kind<00:02:33.720> of

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
there you can see the needle kind of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.180 
there you can see the needle kind of
coming<00:02:34.050> down<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.560> surface<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.099> was

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
coming down to the surface it was

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.559 
coming down to the surface it was
drawing<00:02:37.190> peppering<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.489> an<00:02:38.670> area<00:02:38.879> surface

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
drawing peppering and in an area surface

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.839 
drawing peppering and in an area surface
ready<00:02:42.140> we<00:02:43.140> can<00:02:43.349> walking<00:02:43.950> down<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.400> surface<00:02:44.700> of

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
ready we can walking down the surface of

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.789 
ready we can walking down the surface of
that<00:02:45.200> this<00:02:46.200> agree<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:46.530> call<00:02:46.709> it

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
that this agree we call it

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.229 
that this agree we call it
weight-bearing<00:02:47.129> surface<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.730> joint<00:02:48.060> and

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
weight-bearing surface this joint and

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.759 
weight-bearing surface this joint and
that's<00:02:48.510> reason<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:48.900> kind<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.260> house<00:02:49.530> is

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
that's reason this kind of a house is

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.229 
that's reason this kind of a house is
that<00:02:49.950> area<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.430> drive<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.879> kind<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.060> takes

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
that area that drive it kind of takes

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.210 
that area that drive it kind of takes
most

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220

all right welcome back just going to be
step<00:02:57.560> two<00:02:57.770> of<00:02:58.100> jr's<00:02:58.520> regenerative<00:02:59.270> procedure

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
step two of jr's regenerative procedure

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.780 
step two of jr's regenerative procedure
this<00:03:00.800> is<00:03:00.980> going<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.190> be<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.400> bone<00:03:01.580> marrow

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
this is going to be the bone marrow

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.370 
this is going to be the bone marrow
harvest<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:02.840> what<00:03:02.930> we're<00:03:03.020> going<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.200> do

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
harvest and so what we're going to do

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.710 
harvest and so what we're going to do
was<00:03:03.620> going<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.130> get<00:03:05.120> them<00:03:05.240> all<00:03:05.330> numbed<00:03:05.540> up

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
was going to get them all numbed up

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.850 
was going to get them all numbed up
we're<00:03:06.230> going<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.440> make<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.680> feel<00:03:06.830> very

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
we're going to make it feel very

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.500 
we're going to make it feel very
comfortable<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.880> they're<00:03:08.120> going<00:03:08.240> to<00:03:08.300> go<00:03:08.360> in

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
comfortable and they're going to go in

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.390 
comfortable and they're going to go in
and<00:03:08.630> actually<00:03:08.720> harvest<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.170> stem<00:03:09.440> cells<00:03:09.710> the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
and actually harvest the stem cells the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.250 
and actually harvest the stem cells the
bone<00:03:10.580> marrow<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.030> these<00:03:11.690> two<00:03:11.870> here<00:03:12.020> will<00:03:12.110> take

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
bone marrow and these two here will take

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.750 
bone marrow and these two here will take
the<00:03:12.410> bone<00:03:12.560> marrow<00:03:12.740> over<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.220> lab<00:03:13.430> and

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
the bone marrow over to the lab and

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.450 
the bone marrow over to the lab and
we'll<00:03:14.060> separate<00:03:14.810> out<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.290> stem<00:03:15.860> cells<00:03:16.160> so

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
we'll separate out the stem cells so

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.790 
we'll separate out the stem cells so
this<00:03:17.210> is<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.470> step<00:03:18.470> two

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
this is a step two

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.650 
this is a step two
he<00:03:18.950> should<00:03:19.130> be<00:03:19.250> just<00:03:19.520> fine<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.150> shouldn't

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
he should be just fine and shouldn't

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.620 
he should be just fine and shouldn't
really<00:03:20.810> feel<00:03:21.440> too<00:03:21.590> much<00:03:22.210> so<00:03:23.210> we<00:03:23.300> just<00:03:23.450> got<00:03:23.600> done

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
really feel too much so we just got done

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.020 
really feel too much so we just got done
harvesting<00:03:24.530> Jiro's<00:03:24.920> bone<00:03:25.130> marrow<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.760> really

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
harvesting Jiro's bone marrow it really

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
harvesting Jiro's bone marrow it really
well

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
well

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.220 
well
we<00:03:27.890> got<00:03:28.040> about<00:03:28.130> 70<00:03:28.970> cc's<00:03:29.390> of<00:03:29.420> bone<00:03:29.660> marrow<00:03:29.930> we

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
we got about 70 cc's of bone marrow we

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.260 
we got about 70 cc's of bone marrow we
hit<00:03:30.530> go<00:03:30.650> into<00:03:30.950> that<00:03:31.100> sterile<00:03:31.520> lab<00:03:31.700> now<00:03:31.910> and

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
hit go into that sterile lab now and

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.050 
hit go into that sterile lab now and
isolate<00:03:32.870> out<00:03:32.960> the<00:03:33.080> stem<00:03:33.290> cells<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:34.160> nagi<00:03:34.970> are

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
isolate out the stem cells and nagi are

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.820 
isolate out the stem cells and nagi are
just<00:03:35.330> kind<00:03:35.570> of<00:03:35.630> relax<00:03:35.960> a<00:03:36.050> little<00:03:36.140> bit<00:03:36.350> in<00:03:36.560> about

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
just kind of relax a little bit in about

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.850 
just kind of relax a little bit in about
four<00:03:37.700> hours<00:03:37.730> he'll<00:03:38.210> come<00:03:38.360> back<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.870> stem<00:03:39.680> cell

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
four hours he'll come back the stem cell

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.530 
four hours he'll come back the stem cell
to<00:03:39.950> be<00:03:40.070> ready<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.640> then<00:03:41.210> you'll<00:03:41.360> see<00:03:41.510> that

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
to be ready and then you'll see that

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.540 
to be ready and then you'll see that
procedure<00:03:41.990> where<00:03:42.230> inject<00:03:42.620> those<00:03:42.800> into<00:03:43.370> the

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
procedure where inject those into the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.670 
procedure where inject those into the
femoral<00:03:44.120> condyle<00:03:44.660> where<00:03:45.290> he's<00:03:45.410> got<00:03:45.560> our

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
femoral condyle where he's got our

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.290 
femoral condyle where he's got our
thread<00:03:45.920> kind<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:46.250> defect<00:03:46.580> of<00:03:46.670> cartilage<00:03:47.090> there

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
thread kind of defect of cartilage there

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.060 
thread kind of defect of cartilage there
to<00:03:47.540> get<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.780> body<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.050> regenerate<00:03:48.410> that<00:03:48.740> so

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
to get the body to regenerate that so

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.820 
to get the body to regenerate that so
Jay<00:03:49.880> what<00:03:50.030> do<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.150> think<00:03:50.300> how<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.780> feel<00:03:50.870> it

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
Jay what do you think how to feel it

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.130 
Jay what do you think how to feel it
wasn't<00:03:52.160> bad<00:03:52.250> at<00:03:52.430> all<00:03:52.550> I<00:03:52.610> think<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.240> hype<00:03:53.420> was

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
wasn't bad at all I think the hype was

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.890 
wasn't bad at all I think the hype was
definitely<00:03:54.770> fear<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:55.760> procedure<00:03:56.360> was

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
definitely fear of the procedure was

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.680 
definitely fear of the procedure was
more<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.830> fat<00:03:58.010> laser<00:03:58.250> hair<00:03:58.550> removal<00:03:58.730> that<00:03:59.239> was

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
more a fat laser hair removal that was

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.050 
more a fat laser hair removal that was
much<00:03:59.870> more<00:04:00.050> painful<00:04:00.290> than<00:04:00.860> you<00:04:01.430> know<00:04:01.550> that<00:04:01.940> the

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
much more painful than you know that the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.210 
much more painful than you know that the
bone<00:04:02.270> marrow<00:04:02.450> draw<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.830> was<00:04:03.980> it's

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
bone marrow draw so it was it's

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.580 
bone marrow draw so it was it's
definitely<00:04:04.700> something<00:04:05.209> anybody<00:04:06.080> would<00:04:06.470> be

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
definitely something anybody would be

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:18.030 
definitely something anybody would be
able<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.890> do<00:04:07.010> no<00:04:07.160> problem<00:04:07.570> it's<00:04:08.570> not<00:04:08.720> too<00:04:08.840> bad

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.410 

so<00:04:18.580> you<00:04:18.640> can<00:04:18.760> see<00:04:18.910> there<00:04:19.030> you<00:04:19.060> can<00:04:19.150> see<00:04:19.330> the

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
so you can see there you can see the

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.910 
so you can see there you can see the
needle<00:04:19.720> it's<00:04:20.020> right<00:04:20.290> on<00:04:20.440> top<00:04:20.650> of<00:04:20.800> the

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
needle it's right on top of the

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.820 
needle it's right on top of the
cartilage<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:22.750> then<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:23.170> can<00:04:23.320> see<00:04:23.590> when<00:04:23.740> I

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
cartilage and then you can see when I

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.250 
cartilage and then you can see when I
reject<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.970> little<00:04:25.180> spreads<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.960> spread

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
reject the little spreads the spread

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.620 
reject the little spreads the spread
there<00:04:26.440> of<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.590> solution<00:04:27.240> those<00:04:28.240> are<00:04:28.360> stem

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
there of the solution those are stem

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.240 
there of the solution those are stem
cells<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:29.140> can<00:04:29.260> see<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.500> stem<00:04:29.740> cells<00:04:30.010> still

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
cells you can see the stem cells still

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.310 
cells you can see the stem cells still
there<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.520> we<00:04:30.610> promised<00:04:30.970> ourselves<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.540> bridle

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
there and we promised ourselves a bridle

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.960 
there and we promised ourselves a bridle
a<00:04:32.380> patch<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.890> stem<00:04:33.100> cells<00:04:33.340> are<00:04:33.460> adhesion

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
a patch the stem cells are adhesion

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.280 
a patch the stem cells are adhesion
actually<00:04:34.300> my<00:04:34.420> kind<00:04:34.630> of<00:04:34.660> sticking<00:04:34.990> right<00:04:35.140> there

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
actually my kind of sticking right there

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.220 
actually my kind of sticking right there
to<00:04:35.380> that<00:04:35.410> cartilage<00:04:35.770> that's<00:04:36.640> pretty<00:04:36.940> cool

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
to that cartilage that's pretty cool

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.810 
to that cartilage that's pretty cool
okay<00:04:38.230> so<00:04:38.290> you<00:04:38.470> see<00:04:38.710> here<00:04:39.010> this<00:04:39.310> is<00:04:39.370> Jr's

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
okay so you see here this is Jr's

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.000 
okay so you see here this is Jr's
condyle<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:41.320> is<00:04:41.470> where<00:04:41.620> as<00:04:41.740> cartilage

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
condyle this is where as cartilage

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.710 
condyle this is where as cartilage
defect<00:04:42.550> is<00:04:42.730> where<00:04:42.970> he's<00:04:43.090> lost<00:04:43.330> some<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.540> his

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
defect is where he's lost some of his

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.390 
defect is where he's lost some of his
buffered<00:04:44.140> cartilage<00:04:44.590> and<00:04:44.860> he's<00:04:45.040> getting<00:04:45.160> your

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
buffered cartilage and he's getting your

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.640 
buffered cartilage and he's getting your
itis<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.030> wear<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:46.300> tear<00:04:46.450> here<00:04:47.290> you<00:04:47.380> can<00:04:47.560> see

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
itis and wear and tear here you can see

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.320 
itis and wear and tear here you can see
the<00:04:47.770> needle<00:04:47.950> coming<00:04:48.250> in<00:04:48.490> this<00:04:48.700> is<00:04:48.850> just<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.120> loop

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
the needle coming in this is just a loop

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.930 
the needle coming in this is just a loop
recording<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:50.320> needles<00:04:50.620> coming<00:04:50.860> in<00:04:51.160> you<00:04:51.790> can

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
recording the needles coming in you can

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.640 
recording the needles coming in you can
see<00:04:52.120> this<00:04:52.270> kind<00:04:52.510> of<00:04:52.570> bright<00:04:52.870> spot<00:04:53.170> there

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
see this kind of bright spot there

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.990 
see this kind of bright spot there
that's<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:54.040> platelets<00:04:54.490> and<00:04:54.610> watch<00:04:54.730> how<00:04:54.880> they

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
that's the platelets and watch how they

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.480 
that's the platelets and watch how they
stick<00:04:55.470> they<00:04:56.470> don't<00:04:56.680> move<00:04:56.830> they<00:04:57.010> stick<00:04:57.310> they

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
stick they don't move they stick they

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.010 
stick they don't move they stick they
stay<00:04:57.700> in<00:04:57.790> that<00:04:57.910> spot<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.390> so<00:04:58.510> we<00:04:58.630> did<00:04:58.780> about

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
stay in that spot and so we did about

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.140 
stay in that spot and so we did about
eight<00:04:59.740> different<00:05:00.310> one<00:05:00.400> of<00:05:00.490> these<00:05:00.610> injections

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
eight different one of these injections

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.060 
eight different one of these injections
throughout<00:05:01.450> that<00:05:01.570> whole<00:05:01.630> condyle<00:05:02.290> putting

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
throughout that whole condyle putting

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.290 
throughout that whole condyle putting
these<00:05:03.190> stem<00:05:03.400> cells<00:05:03.430> like<00:05:03.850> that<00:05:04.030> and<00:05:04.180> they'll

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
these stem cells like that and they'll

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.730 
these stem cells like that and they'll
stick<00:05:04.480> like<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:04.690> little<00:05:04.930> kind<00:05:05.110> of<00:05:05.140> biologic

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
stick like a little kind of biologic

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.160 
stick like a little kind of biologic
patch<00:05:06.040> right<00:05:06.820> in<00:05:06.940> that<00:05:07.000> area<00:05:07.060> what's<00:05:08.020> going<00:05:08.140> to

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
patch right in that area what's going to

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.330 
patch right in that area what's going to
happen<00:05:08.470> now<00:05:08.590> Jerry's<00:05:08.950> going<00:05:09.040> to<00:05:09.130> lay<00:05:09.220> like

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
happen now Jerry's going to lay like

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.580 
happen now Jerry's going to lay like
this<00:05:09.400> for<00:05:09.610> about<00:05:09.670> 15<00:05:09.910> minutes<00:05:10.360> so<00:05:11.050> stem<00:05:11.350> cells

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
this for about 15 minutes so stem cells

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.820 
this for about 15 minutes so stem cells
can<00:05:11.740> continue<00:05:12.280> to<00:05:12.400> add<00:05:12.460> hues<00:05:12.790> and<00:05:13.800> kind<00:05:14.800> of

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
can continue to add hues and kind of

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.920 
can continue to add hues and kind of
spread<00:05:15.040> over<00:05:15.280> that<00:05:15.400> condyle<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:16.600> next<00:05:16.840> thing

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
spread over that condyle the next thing

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.880 
spread over that condyle the next thing
you'll<00:05:17.020> see<00:05:17.200> is<00:05:17.320> we're<00:05:17.440> going<00:05:17.560> to<00:05:17.620> brace

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
you'll see is we're going to brace

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.590 
you'll see is we're going to brace
jay-ar<00:05:18.310> and<00:05:18.490> unload<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.120> area<00:05:19.360> that<00:05:19.510> we

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
jay-ar and unload the area that we

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.120 
jay-ar and unload the area that we
treated<00:05:19.870> so<00:05:20.110> that<00:05:20.140> the<00:05:20.350> stem<00:05:20.590> cells<00:05:20.800> don't<00:05:20.980> get

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
treated so that the stem cells don't get

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.410 
treated so that the stem cells don't get
pushed<00:05:21.370> away<00:05:21.520> from<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:21.790> spot<00:05:22.090> they're<00:05:22.270> in

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
pushed away from the spot they're in

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.970 
pushed away from the spot they're in
he's<00:05:23.020> going<00:05:23.200> to<00:05:23.260> take<00:05:23.350> it<00:05:23.380> easy<00:05:23.560> for<00:05:23.800> a<00:05:23.860> couple

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
he's going to take it easy for a couple

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.410 
he's going to take it easy for a couple
weeks<00:05:24.130> wear<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.700> brace<00:05:24.940> and<00:05:25.210> then<00:05:25.270> we're

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
weeks wear the brace and then we're

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.450 
weeks wear the brace and then we're
slowly<00:05:25.720> get<00:05:25.960> them<00:05:26.050> out<00:05:26.140> of<00:05:26.170> the<00:05:26.290> brace<00:05:26.530> so<00:05:27.310> the

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
slowly get them out of the brace so the
