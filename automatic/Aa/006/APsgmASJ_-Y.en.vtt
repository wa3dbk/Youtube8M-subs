driveway up there I'm afraid all these

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.610 
driveway up there I'm afraid all these
trees<00:03:51.440> in<00:03:51.650> there<00:03:51.799> so<00:03:52.099> I'm<00:03:52.190> going<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.400> go<00:03:52.519> inside

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.929

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.030 
it's about 525 Sunday and I'm just going
to<00:04:04.060> walk<00:04:04.239> through<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.569> yard<00:04:04.859> rains<00:04:05.859> about

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
to walk through the yard rains about

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.009 
to walk through the yard rains about
ready<00:04:06.370> to<00:04:06.430> set<00:04:06.640> in<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:07.450> winds<00:04:07.719> have<00:04:07.780> died<00:04:07.989> down

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
ready to set in the winds have died down

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.259 
ready to set in the winds have died down
pretty<00:04:08.530> good<00:04:08.769> kind<00:04:09.700> of<00:04:09.760> surveyed<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.239> damage

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
pretty good kind of surveyed the damage

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:17.689 
pretty good kind of surveyed the damage
from<00:04:10.689> the<00:04:10.870> storm<00:04:12.209> limbs<00:04:13.209> down<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:17.139> neighbor

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
from the storm limbs down the neighbor

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.290 
from the storm limbs down the neighbor
had<00:04:18.699> come<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.150> checked<00:04:19.389> on<00:04:19.539> us<00:04:21.150> some<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.180> the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
had come and checked on us some of the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.439 
had come and checked on us some of the
trees<00:04:22.509> I<00:04:22.690> really<00:04:23.020> thought<00:04:23.229> what<00:04:23.470> FL<00:04:24.449> because

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
trees I really thought what FL because

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.320 
trees I really thought what FL because
the<00:04:25.600> healthy<00:04:26.080> trees<00:04:26.350> were<00:04:26.500> falling<00:04:26.710> didn't

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
the healthy trees were falling didn't

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.850 
the healthy trees were falling didn't
how<00:04:28.330> still<00:04:28.660> seems<00:04:28.870> pretty<00:04:28.990> much<00:04:29.350> intact<00:04:31.860> I'm

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
how still seems pretty much intact I'm

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.230 
how still seems pretty much intact I'm
going<00:04:32.979> to<00:04:33.070> walk<00:04:33.250> down<00:04:33.280> in<00:04:33.639> there<00:04:33.789> next<00:04:34.090> and

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
going to walk down in there next and

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.529 
going to walk down in there next and
when<00:04:37.240> a<00:04:37.270> video<00:04:37.509> tape<00:04:37.720> some<00:04:37.900> of<00:04:38.020> that<00:04:39.300> one<00:04:40.300> down

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
when a video tape some of that one down

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.650 
when a video tape some of that one down
into<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.900> yard<00:04:41.639> the<00:04:42.639> power<00:04:42.849> lines<00:04:43.210> are<00:04:43.419> still

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
into the yard the power lines are still

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.600 
into the yard the power lines are still
intact

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
intact

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.920 
intact
this<00:04:46.000> is<00:04:46.150> damaged<00:04:48.509> there's<00:04:49.509> a<00:04:49.629> tree<00:04:49.900> that

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
this is damaged there's a tree that

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.790 
this is damaged there's a tree that
broke<00:04:50.319> in<00:04:50.469> half<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:53.080> that<00:04:53.199> tree<00:04:53.500> is<00:04:53.590> broke

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
broke in half and that tree is broke

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.640 
broke in half and that tree is broke
from<00:04:54.009> right<00:04:54.219> there<00:04:54.460> and<00:04:54.879> fell<00:04:55.120> on<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.330> ground

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
from right there and fell on the ground

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.679 
from right there and fell on the ground
and<00:04:56.650> rested<00:04:57.099> right<00:04:57.280> there<00:04:57.520> that<00:04:58.449> tree<00:04:58.659> is

00:04:58.679 --> 00:04:58.689 
and rested right there that tree is

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:04.559 
and rested right there that tree is
going<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:58.930> be<00:04:59.020> a<00:04:59.050> difficult<00:04:59.530> one<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.650> cut<00:05:03.569> I'm

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:04.569 
going to be a difficult one to cut I'm

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:05.700 
going to be a difficult one to cut I'm
just<00:05:04.810> going<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.020> start<00:05:05.169> counting<00:05:05.469> them<00:05:05.590> from

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
just going to start counting them from

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.580 
just going to start counting them from
down<00:05:05.889> here<00:05:06.479> you<00:05:07.479> got<00:05:08.099> one<00:05:10.199> that<00:05:11.199> won't<00:05:11.349> cut<00:05:11.500> in

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
down here you got one that won't cut in

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.559 
down here you got one that won't cut in
half<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:12.069> that<00:05:12.490> one<00:05:12.699> is<00:05:12.819> resting<00:05:13.180> on<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.389> power

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 
half to that one is resting on the power

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.330 
half to that one is resting on the power
lines<00:05:13.840> is<00:05:13.990> he<00:05:14.110> right<00:05:14.259> now<00:05:14.289> also<00:05:15.629> to<00:05:17.039> then<00:05:18.039> up<00:05:18.159> on

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
lines is he right now also to then up on

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:30.530 
lines is he right now also to then up on
the<00:05:18.430> hill<00:05:20.729> we<00:05:21.729> got<00:05:21.909> three

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.720 

here's<00:05:31.470> one<00:05:31.710> I'm<00:05:31.860> not<00:05:32.010> too<00:05:32.160> sure<00:05:32.370> where<00:05:32.580> it

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
here's one I'm not too sure where it

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.990 
here's one I'm not too sure where it
fell<00:05:32.940> from<00:05:34.100> that's<00:05:35.100> kind<00:05:35.370> of<00:05:35.430> going<00:05:35.670> over<00:05:35.910> into

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
fell from that's kind of going over into

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.330 
fell from that's kind of going over into
the<00:05:36.210> neighbor's<00:05:36.540> yard<00:05:36.920> that's<00:05:37.920> going<00:05:38.160> to<00:05:38.220> be<00:05:38.310> a

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
the neighbor's yard that's going to be a

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.510 
the neighbor's yard that's going to be a
hard<00:05:38.610> one<00:05:38.670> the<00:05:38.940> handle<00:05:39.360> right<00:05:39.720> there

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.860 

there's<00:05:45.520> a<00:05:45.610> power<00:05:45.910> lines<00:05:46.180> and<00:05:46.360> looks<00:05:46.570> like<00:05:46.720> we

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
there's a power lines and looks like we

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.340 
there's a power lines and looks like we
do<00:05:47.020> have<00:05:47.050> some<00:05:47.350> power<00:05:47.590> lines<00:05:47.860> down<00:05:49.260> from<00:05:50.260> the

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
do have some power lines down from the

00:05:50.350 --> 00:06:00.800 
do have some power lines down from the
transformer<00:05:51.100> in<00:05:51.220> the<00:05:51.310> yard<00:05:51.580> I<00:05:52.440> can<00:05:53.440> see<00:05:53.620> that

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.330 

there's<00:06:01.810> a<00:06:01.900> power<00:06:02.170> line<00:06:02.530> then<00:06:03.340> rip<00:06:03.580> down

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
there's a power line then rip down

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.090 
there's a power line then rip down
here's<00:06:06.340> right<00:06:06.550> next<00:06:06.820> to<00:06:06.910> the<00:06:07.030> road<00:06:08.100> desert

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
here's right next to the road desert

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:18.790 
here's right next to the road desert
rain<00:06:09.310> just<00:06:09.460> walk<00:06:09.700> through

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.940 

broken<00:06:19.800> off<00:06:19.920> right<00:06:20.130> there

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
broken off right there

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.980 
broken off right there
hard<00:06:21.580> to<00:06:21.700> tell

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.710 

here's<00:06:26.990> another<00:06:27.229> one<00:06:27.500> down<00:06:28.270> right<00:06:29.270> next<00:06:29.419> to
