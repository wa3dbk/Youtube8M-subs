00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
always willing to have a bit of a crack

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.020 
always willing to have a bit of a crack
at<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.530> brother<00:03:08.769> Sam<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.579> I<00:03:09.639> think<00:03:09.849> that's

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
at a brother Sam and I think that's

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.879 
at a brother Sam and I think that's
something<00:03:10.269> that<00:03:10.510> brothers<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:11.290> sisters<00:03:11.680> can

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
something that brothers and sisters can

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.949 
something that brothers and sisters can
probably<00:03:12.340> relate<00:03:12.549> to<00:03:12.880> but<00:03:13.299> Ruby<00:03:13.720> is

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
probably relate to but Ruby is

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.710 
probably relate to but Ruby is
completely<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:14.920> utterly<00:03:15.099> reliable<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.359> is

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
completely and utterly reliable and is

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.599 
completely and utterly reliable and is
always<00:03:17.019> on<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.440> front<00:03:17.709> foot<00:03:17.769> trying<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.400> help

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
always on the front foot trying to help

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.670 
always on the front foot trying to help
out<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:19.299> think<00:03:19.359> that<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:20.470> all<00:03:20.620> the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
out and I think that of all the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.470 
out and I think that of all the
character<00:03:21.220> she's<00:03:21.489> probably<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.970> one<00:03:22.000> I'd

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
character she's probably the one I'd

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.159 
character she's probably the one I'd
like<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.989> have<00:03:23.139> with<00:03:23.349> me<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.650> solve<00:03:23.889> my<00:03:24.130> mystery
