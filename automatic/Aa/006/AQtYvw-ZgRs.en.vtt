00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
pin at a 90 degree angle and where

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.779 
pin at a 90 degree angle and where
you're<00:00:46.739> grabbing<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.399> leave<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> nice

you're grabbing is going to leave a nice
little<00:00:48.090> gap<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.690> our<00:00:48.780> wrap<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:51.090> now<00:00:51.210> we're

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
little gap for our wrap so now we're

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.439 
little gap for our wrap so now we're
ready<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> round<00:00:51.960> nose<00:00:52.170> pliers<00:00:53.239> you<00:00:54.239> are

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
ready for the round nose pliers you are

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.510 
ready for the round nose pliers you are
going<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> insert<00:00:55.500> them<00:00:55.710> into<00:00:55.860> your<00:00:56.039> head<00:00:56.219> pin

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
going to insert them into your head pin

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.290 
going to insert them into your head pin
vertically<00:00:57.480> at<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.079> 90<00:00:58.379> degree<00:00:58.500> Bend<00:00:59.300> then

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
vertically at the 90 degree Bend then

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.119 
vertically at the 90 degree Bend then
you<00:01:00.420> use<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:00.780> fingers<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.170> bring<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> wire

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
you use your fingers to bring the wire

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.500 
you use your fingers to bring the wire
up<00:01:02.489> over<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> top<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> pliers<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:05.510> you

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
up over the top of the pliers and you

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.960 
up over the top of the pliers and you
want<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> way<00:01:07.200> around<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.610> our

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
want to go all the way around but so our

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.580 
want to go all the way around but so our
loop<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.420> perfectly<00:01:09.960> round<00:01:10.290> we're<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
loop is perfectly round we're going to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.700 
loop is perfectly round we're going to
have<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> rotate<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.640> pliers<00:01:12.260> when<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.409> bring

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
have to rotate the pliers when we bring

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.850 
have to rotate the pliers when we bring
the<00:01:14.189> wire<00:01:14.369> under<00:01:15.049> and<00:01:16.049> that'll<00:01:16.259> give<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.560> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the wire under and that'll give you a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.190 
the wire under and that'll give you a
nice<00:01:17.310> round<00:01:17.759> loop<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.650> like<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:22.909> yeah<00:01:24.200> and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
nice round loop just like that yeah and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.080 
nice round loop just like that yeah and
now<00:01:25.560> we're<00:01:25.799> going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> use<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> little<00:01:26.850> ball

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
now we're going to use a little ball

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.370 
now we're going to use a little ball
post<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:29.119> since<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.210> ring<00:01:30.780> does<00:01:31.020> not<00:01:31.200> open

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
post and since that ring does not open

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.700 
post and since that ring does not open
we're<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.070> put<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
we're going to have to put it on to the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.910 
we're going to have to put it on to the
head<00:01:34.890> pin<00:01:35.189> first<00:01:35.759> before<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:37.320> get<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.740> loop

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
head pin first before we get the loop

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.170 
head pin first before we get the loop
wrapped<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.430> pull<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.549> up<00:01:41.670> into<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> loop

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
wrapped so just pull it up into the loop

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.710 
wrapped so just pull it up into the loop
just<00:01:44.210> like<00:01:45.210> that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.630 

and<00:01:48.900> then<00:01:49.740> we're<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.130> go<00:01:50.280> back<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.610> our

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and then we're going to go back to our

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.690 
and then we're going to go back to our
chain<00:01:50.940> nose<00:01:51.150> pliers<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.990> if<00:01:52.800> you<00:01:52.920> use<00:01:53.190> them<00:01:53.490> to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
chain nose pliers and if you use them to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.120 
chain nose pliers and if you use them to
hold<00:01:53.940> across<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.750> flat<00:01:55.170> side<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:55.890> loop

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
hold across the flat side of the loop

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.390 
hold across the flat side of the loop
you<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.340> use<00:01:59.670> your<00:01:59.850> other<00:02:00.000> hand<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:01.130> wrap<00:02:02.130> your

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
you can use your other hand to wrap your

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.110 
you can use your other hand to wrap your
wire<00:02:02.610> around<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.480> base<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.170> loop<00:02:05.120> the

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
wire around the base of the loop the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.359 
wire around the base of the loop the
pliers<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.570> really<00:02:06.750> going<00:02:06.870> to<00:02:06.960> give<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.369> some

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
pliers are really going to give you some

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.980 
pliers are really going to give you some
nice<00:02:08.550> leverage<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.240> you<00:02:09.330> can<00:02:09.509> get<00:02:09.630> your<00:02:09.780> wrap

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
nice leverage so you can get your wrap

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.680 
nice leverage so you can get your wrap
done<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:11.520> you're<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:12.240> going<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.510> keep

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
done and you're just going to keep

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.650 
done and you're just going to keep
