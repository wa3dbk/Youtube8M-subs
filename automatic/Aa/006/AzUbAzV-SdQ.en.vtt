00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.290
 after seeing a position of correct preparation as we have of hiv 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.510
 previous when we touch tactical and mental technical aspects 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.499
 that can help you have a much more effective service 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:14.269
 and convert it later a winning serve we have to continue evaluating 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.199
 aspects that are also important, such as the rhythm of the serve and the 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.699
 shoot to the hoop 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.240
 when I refer to such a rhythm to serve I mean check but in a 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.789
 coordination in harmony in the movement so as not to hurt them say both 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.929
 arms can not go uncoordinated 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.369
 for this they bring you a video where we will be evaluating all these phases 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.629
 in the next video we see the preparation potion that we saw the previous day 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.160
 where the min hand before holds the racket 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.350
 and the hand does not dominate before that holds the ball are together 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.320
 the moment we decided to start the movement I fear how both arms come down 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.930
 at the same time and they are separated and then their life at the same time 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.630
 we see that at the moment when both arms raise the non-dominant arm that 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.640
 is the arm that holds the ball 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.240
 percent I would recommend that you sign in the direction of the foot of the 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.490
 previous 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.490
 at the moment I had aso hold the ball 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.720
 it is lodged in the height of your head 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.550
 is when you loose to fly 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.350
 and loose them in a very light way 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.110
 percent is making the ball with the fingertips and fingers 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.910
 because what you're looking for is to have more control of the ball so the ball 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.820
 per cent this is rotating on its own axis in the air 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.460
 percent there are players who welcome it with the palm of their hand but they are 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.870
 a minority and the idea is to have more control I would recommend 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.229
 particularly the palm ag the fingertips the fingers 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.700
 percent another important aspect that we can save here is that the hand 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.159
 dominant 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.030
 that is, the hand that holds the racket 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.759
 at the moment when both arms are going up 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.060
 we see how the dominant arm that holds the racket 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.060
 product of the continental grip of the serve 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.950
 percent and xxi open the palm of your hand at this time 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.020
 Well, the palm of your hand is fun 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.150
 down 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.070
 this product of the continental handle and at the moment when 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.039
 we reach shoulder height 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.079
 percent and above the shoulder 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.009
 the arm in the note a position of l 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:19.119
 with him with the racket and the arm 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.119
 as we see below 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.530
 Next I will show movies images 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.080
 of professional players and we will try to identify aspects that we have 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.080
 been mentioning in this video 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:46.989
 In the next image we can see how the player has the fusion of 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.059
 prepared efe a continental grip and how it holds the ball with 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:54.269
 the signature of your fingers 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.480
 The following image we can observe echoes as it also holds the 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.859
 ball with which he calls his fingers 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.679
 and how the arms have coordinated at the same time 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.769
 we can be the commission whose continental time 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.280
 now we have a following image where we can see praza nadal 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.649
 how both arms have come up in coordination 

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:19.180
 i lotus continental grip 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.900
 open the palm of your hand the palm of your hand would be looking down 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:27.299
 we also observe how subtly to leave 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.109
 percent get out the ball when you release it at the height of your head 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:36.539
 in the following image we can see until yesterday federer as well 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:40.370
 subtly release the ball with the signature of your fingers 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.799
 both arms 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.939
 they are coordinated the other arm does not know very well but 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:50.010
 we inherit that both arms are more or less coordinated shoulder height 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.649
 i can see you can also imagine 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:58.269
 d per cent guillermo cañas an argentinian player 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.290
 i the mayor curious because the catch the ball 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.329
 with the tips of the fingers with the fingertips directly the vast majority 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.239
 of the players 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.369
 against the German of a little the fingers directly the ball william 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:13.929
 we can save canes like cracovia 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:16.929
 colon fingertips subtly 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.189
 we will go as p 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.309
 his arm holding in his hand holding the ball 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:27.449
 goes in the direction of throwing the ball in the direction of his front foot something 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.489
 quite important we want to highlight is that we have also seen it seriously 

00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:33.680
 in all other players 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.400
 below we see an image of Andy Roddick that before technically in one 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.669
 of the accesses 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.849
 what can you say classics 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.069
 percent andy roddick has the second most powerful serve in history 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:50.300
 registered in professional tennis I think if wrong I'm not wrong that came to 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.289
 measure at 249 kilometers per hour 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.770
 percent andy roddick for 100 less than once he threw the ball 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.910
 percent and has his arm dominant arm that holds the racket 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.389
 the position of art 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.809
 now we can see another player nikoláy davydenko 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:09.969
 percent and that's also for having thrown the ball 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:15.349
 his arm up are the accusations the racket has also the position of 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.550
 and well up to here percent we ate with this one for all of it 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.309
 we analyze what the rhythm is to which the path of the ball with aspects 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:28.729
 percent very subtle that you have to go taking into account and there to go 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.509
 deepening little by little if you want to continue deepening and learning more 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.439
