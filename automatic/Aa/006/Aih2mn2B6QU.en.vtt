00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
what they've been saying into actions

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.520 
what they've been saying into actions
and<00:01:08.490> that's<00:01:08.640> looking<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.320> know<00:01:10.409> has

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
and that's looking for and you know has

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.289 
and that's looking for and you know has
there<00:01:10.650> been<00:01:10.680> extra<00:01:11.369> agents<00:01:11.520> there<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.210> know

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
there been extra agents there you know

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.640 
there been extra agents there you know
because<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.630> need<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.080> against<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> All

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
group of theirs yeah I think it is it's

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.160 
group of theirs yeah I think it is it's
not<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.850> much<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.180> confidence<00:01:42.689> level<00:01:42.840> against

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
not so much the confidence level against

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.429 
not so much the confidence level against
these<00:01:43.350> guys<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.770> accuracy<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:46.049> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
these guys it's the accuracy and the you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.780 
these guys it's the accuracy and the you
know<00:01:46.530> I've<00:01:46.619> been<00:01:46.740> involved<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.280> played<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
know I've been involved and played in a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.249 
know I've been involved and played in a
good<00:01:48.240> number<00:01:48.390> test<00:01:48.689> against<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> All<00:01:49.140> Blacks

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
good number test against the All Blacks

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.710 
good number test against the All Blacks
and<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:50.250> know<00:01:50.340> we've<00:01:50.460> been<00:01:50.549> accurate<00:01:50.939> for<00:01:51.180> 80

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
and you know we've been accurate for 80

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.530 
and you know we've been accurate for 80
80<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.409> 83<00:01:52.710> percent<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.640> game<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:54.360> knock

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
80 to 83 percent of the game we knock

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.100 
80 to 83 percent of the game we knock
off<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:54.990> one<00:01:55.399> minute<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:57.149> know<00:01:57.240> they

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
off for one minute and you know they

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.780 
off for one minute and you know they
knock<00:01:58.290> over<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.619> drop<00:01:58.829> goal<00:01:59.040> or<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.430> give<00:01:59.579> away<00:01:59.759> a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
knock over a drop goal or we give away a

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.880 
knock over a drop goal or we give away a
penalty<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.450> something<00:02:01.290> like<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.619> think

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
penalty and something like that I think

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.920 
penalty and something like that I think
that<00:02:02.399> accuracy<00:02:02.759> has<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.210> run<00:02:03.390> right<00:02:03.689> away

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
that accuracy has to run right away

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.840 
that accuracy has to run right away
through<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> game<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.619> think<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.219> we<00:02:05.340> can<00:02:05.520> if<00:02:05.820> we

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
through the game I think if we can if we

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.960 
through the game I think if we can if we
can<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.420> think<00:02:07.220> we<00:02:08.220> know<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.759> we

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
can do that I think we know we can we

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.339 
can do that I think we know we can we
know<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.330> get<00:02:09.420> ourselves<00:02:09.599> into<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.110> winning

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
know we can get ourselves into a winning

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.220 
know we can get ourselves into a winning
position<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.860> think<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.640> having<00:02:11.879> that

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
position I think it's having that

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.759 
position I think it's having that
leaf<00:02:12.409> and<00:02:12.709> thus<00:02:12.950> accuracy<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.290> as<00:02:15.290> was<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
leaf and thus accuracy and as was the

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.550 
leaf and thus accuracy and as was the
execution<00:02:16.489> under<00:02:16.610> extreme<00:02:17.209> pressure<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:18.470> we

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
execution under extreme pressure that we

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.170 
execution under extreme pressure that we
can<00:02:18.769> I<00:02:19.010> suppose<00:02:19.840> play<00:02:20.840> area<00:02:21.080> with
