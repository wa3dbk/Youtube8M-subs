using<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.540> large<00:01:27.780> popsicle<00:01:28.350> stick<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.770> stir<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
using a large popsicle stick to stir the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.440 
using a large popsicle stick to stir the
resin<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.670> you'll<00:01:29.939> also<00:01:30.119> need<00:01:30.390> some

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
resin and you'll also need some

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.980 
resin and you'll also need some
toothpicks<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:33.240> first<00:01:33.509> step<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:33.930> this

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
toothpicks the first step for this

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.929 
toothpicks the first step for this
tutorial<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.710> measure<00:01:34.979> out<00:01:35.189> equal<00:01:35.610> amounts

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
tutorial is to measure out equal amounts

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.850 
tutorial is to measure out equal amounts
of<00:01:36.030> Part<00:01:36.270> A<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.720> Part<00:01:36.750> B<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> resin<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
of Part A and Part B of the resin and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.530 
of Part A and Part B of the resin and
put<00:01:38.009> them<00:01:38.130> into<00:01:38.280> your<00:01:38.520> mixing<00:01:38.820> container<00:01:39.210> if

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
put them into your mixing container if

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.630 
put them into your mixing container if
you're<00:01:40.110> not<00:01:40.259> using<00:01:40.500> one-to-one<00:01:41.100> resin<00:01:41.460> then

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
you're not using one-to-one resin then

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:53.419 
you're not using one-to-one resin then
follow<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> instructions<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.630> your<00:01:42.810> package

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
no areas that look cloudy as you mix you

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.509 
no areas that look cloudy as you mix you
will<00:02:26.140> notice<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.560> air<00:02:26.709> bubbles<00:02:27.099> will<00:02:27.310> start

will notice the air bubbles will start

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.280 
will notice the air bubbles will start

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
to form in your resin don't worry about

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.020 
to form in your resin don't worry about
this<00:02:29.560> all<00:02:29.829> you<00:02:30.010> need<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.310> do<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.670> just<00:02:30.849> leave

minutes you can use a heat gun or a

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.780 
minutes you can use a heat gun or a
lighter<00:02:41.379> to<00:02:41.799> heat<00:02:41.829> up<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.340> bubbles<00:02:42.640> which

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
lighter to heat up the bubbles which

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.430 
lighter to heat up the bubbles which
will<00:02:42.940> make<00:02:43.030> them<00:02:43.180> pop<00:02:43.420> please<00:02:43.959> do<00:02:44.170> be<00:02:44.290> careful

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
will make them pop please do be careful

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.570 
will make them pop please do be careful
if<00:02:44.739> you're<00:02:44.859> using<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:45.190> lighter<00:02:45.400> though

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.220 

it's<00:02:51.580> now<00:02:51.760> time<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:52.180> color<00:02:52.360> your<00:02:52.540> resin<00:02:52.930> I'm

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
it's now time to color your resin I'm

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.380 
it's now time to color your resin I'm
using<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:53.860> pearl<00:02:54.130> white<00:02:54.460> pigment<00:02:54.880> first<00:02:55.120> and

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
using this pearl white pigment first and

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:04.340 
using this pearl white pigment first and
then<00:02:55.570> thoroughly<00:02:55.930> mixing<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.440> into<00:02:56.560> my<00:02:56.770> resin

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.110 

now<00:03:05.350> I'm<00:03:05.590> adding<00:03:05.740> a<00:03:05.950> tiny<00:03:06.160> bit<00:03:06.370> of<00:03:06.550> dark<00:03:06.820> silver

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
now I'm adding a tiny bit of dark silver

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.910 
now I'm adding a tiny bit of dark silver
to<00:03:07.450> create<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.810> color<00:03:07.990> that<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.230> want<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
to create the color that I want the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.410 
to create the color that I want the
unicorn<00:03:09.370> blood<00:03:09.520> that<00:03:09.640> features<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.210> film

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
unicorn blood that features in the film

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.150 
unicorn blood that features in the film
is<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.600> little<00:03:10.900> bit<00:03:10.990> more<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.170> peg<00:03:11.470> than<00:03:11.710> this<00:03:11.860> but

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
is a little bit more a peg than this but

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.280 
is a little bit more a peg than this but
I<00:03:12.220> love<00:03:12.490> the<00:03:12.610> way<00:03:12.730> these<00:03:12.880> pigments<00:03:13.120> look<00:03:13.540> if

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
I love the way these pigments look if

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.750 
I love the way these pigments look if
you<00:03:14.740> would<00:03:14.830> like<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.100> make<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.370> more<00:03:15.490> like<00:03:15.640> the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
you would like to make it more like the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.460 
you would like to make it more like the
version<00:03:16.090> featured<00:03:16.480> in<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.660> film<00:03:16.960> then<00:03:17.320> add<00:03:17.440> a

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
version featured in the film then add a

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.740 
version featured in the film then add a
very<00:03:17.770> small<00:03:18.070> amount<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.550> opaque<00:03:18.850> white<00:03:19.240> resin

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
very small amount of opaque white resin

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.360 
very small amount of opaque white resin
pigment<00:03:22.320> so<00:03:23.320> just<00:03:23.530> for<00:03:23.650> fun<00:03:23.800> I'm<00:03:23.950> adding<00:03:24.250> in

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
pigment so just for fun I'm adding in

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.220 
pigment so just for fun I'm adding in
some<00:03:24.400> white<00:03:24.790> iridescent<00:03:25.450> glitter<00:03:25.600> and<00:03:25.960> when

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
some white iridescent glitter and when

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.660 
some white iridescent glitter and when
this<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.530> cured<00:03:26.860> it<00:03:26.980> gives<00:03:27.130> us<00:03:27.250> this<00:03:27.370> slight

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
this is cured it gives us this slight

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.890 
this is cured it gives us this slight
sparkle<00:03:28.210> which<00:03:28.330> is<00:03:28.480> really<00:03:28.840> pretty<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:31.780> this

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
sparkle which is really pretty so this

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.540 
sparkle which is really pretty so this
is<00:03:31.990> what<00:03:32.140> mine<00:03:32.320> looks<00:03:32.350> like<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:33.070> gorgeous

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
is what mine looks like is a gorgeous

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.610 
is what mine looks like is a gorgeous
silver<00:03:33.790> color<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:34.570> again<00:03:34.600> I<00:03:34.900> recommend<00:03:35.260> that

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
silver color so again I recommend that

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.020 
silver color so again I recommend that
