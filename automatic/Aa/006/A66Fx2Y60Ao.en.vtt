00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.790
 in the brain the information is transmitted through stimuli 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.099
 electric 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.449
 when electric impulse reaches the Parisian end of a neuron the 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.430
 signal is sent chemically to the terminal has a tab of the following 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.430
 black 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:27.269
 synthetic level 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.369
 those known as while you are including serotonin are 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.920
 responsible for maintaining this communication 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.420
 serotonin also calls at 5 o'clock if it releases space and tactic tactics 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.790
 where subsectors are stimulated they have acts after this performance 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.550
 biochemistry of the postsynaptic neuron proteins that act as pumps 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.960
 of transport for serotonin the recapture in which they integrate again 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.180
 they jalonearon appreciated today we know that in depression certain areas of 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.680
 brain show that a low serotonergic activity due to a low 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.600
 Serotonin concentration on the coasts 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.049
 conventional antidepressant medications act by adhering to 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.350
 the serotonin transporter protein 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.910
 thus avoiding its recapture 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.740
 This union is a dynamic process where there are medicines according to 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.640
 transiently is the transport protein responsible for the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.360
 recapture of serotonin 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.120
 this results in an intermittent blockage of the capture system of this black 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.450
 course 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.920
 we know that those medications according to the site that the madrid in another shot of three 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.789
 points 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.179
 by inhibiting serotonin reuptake the concentration of the 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.990
 same in space but without success 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.579
 and it is well known that this increase in the level of serotonin 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.760
 this essential for the relief of patients' depressive state 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.540
 It is profiting acts differently from other serotonin reuptake inhibitors 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.880
 since in addition to joining the primary site according to ians and secondary pti 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.270
 when it was located that modulate the activity of the premium site 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.670
 this union generates a conformational change in protein 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.700
 transporter and at the same time including a greater adherence to 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.209
 visitors trap the primary site 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.549
 because of this unique mechanism of action this madness causes me a blockage 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.489
 more effective towards the recapture of serotonin compared to others 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.400
 medications of its escitalopram class produces an enhanced inhibition of 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.719
 serotonin reuptake and a substantial increase in the concentration of 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.159
 dress black after intensive reading course 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.529
 this mechanism of action is responsible for an activity 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:42.870
 serotonergic majority and seriousness 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.860
 and everything indicates an effective response and superior clinics hence the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.440
 rapidity and therapeutic efficacy are essential parameters of the treatment 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.080
 of depression with this madness
