a student for life there's so many

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.740 
a student for life there's so many
questions<00:02:23.250> left<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.550> answer<00:02:23.670> if<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.420> stop

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.660 

I<00:02:50.180> had<00:02:50.900> an<00:02:51.049> engineering<00:02:51.560> tour<00:02:51.860> guide<00:02:52.159> and<00:02:52.489> he

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
I had an engineering tour guide and he

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.820 
I had an engineering tour guide and he
took<00:02:52.909> me<00:02:53.150> around<00:02:53.239> Benton<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.170> for<00:02:54.560> some

took me around Benton and for some

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.970 
took me around Benton and for some

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.309 

the<00:03:00.980> fire<00:03:01.220> program<00:03:01.879> helped<00:03:02.780> me<00:03:02.930> grow<00:03:03.110> as<00:03:03.140> a

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
the fire program helped me grow as a

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.680 
the fire program helped me grow as a
student<00:03:03.799> because<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.760> gave<00:03:04.909> me<00:03:05.120> like<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.299> lot<00:03:05.569> of

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
student because it gave me like a lot of

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.530 
student because it gave me like a lot of
opportunities<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.950> experience<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:07.970> expand

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
opportunities to experience and expand

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.710 
opportunities to experience and expand
as<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.780> student<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.610> allowed<00:03:10.610> me<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:11.120> really

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
as a student it allowed me to really

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.470 
as a student it allowed me to really
look<00:03:11.959> into<00:03:12.200> not<00:03:13.159> just<00:03:13.610> being<00:03:13.819> a<00:03:13.909> student<00:03:14.299> but

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
look into not just being a student but

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.410 
look into not just being a student but
also<00:03:14.680> like<00:03:15.680> going<00:03:16.069> beyond<00:03:16.459> that<00:03:16.790> doing

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
also like going beyond that doing

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.930 
also like going beyond that doing
research<00:03:17.959> is<00:03:18.200> meaningful<00:03:18.909> wherever<00:03:19.909> a
