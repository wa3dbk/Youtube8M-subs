the sea and going with the flow of the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.699 
the sea and going with the flow of the
wave<00:02:13.940> there's<00:02:14.510> nothing<00:02:14.810> like<00:02:14.990> it

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.240 

every<00:02:19.549> wave<00:02:19.819> is<00:02:20.120> different<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:21.260> patent<00:02:21.980> for

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
every wave is different you patent for

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
it and the city to stand up and catch it

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.309 
it and the city to stand up and catch it
you<00:02:25.310> will<00:02:25.459> zoom<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.939> down<00:02:26.150> on<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.689> to<00:02:27.049> try<00:02:27.290> and

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
you will zoom in down on it to try and

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.910 
you will zoom in down on it to try and
flow<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:28.040> go<00:02:28.250> as<00:02:28.459> long<00:02:28.730> as<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:29.239> can<00:02:29.750> just<00:02:30.200> be

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
flow and go as long as you can just be

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.809 
flow and go as long as you can just be
one<00:02:31.189> with<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.609> way

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.820 

I've<00:02:36.819> had<00:02:37.090> some<00:02:37.330> strange<00:02:37.690> looks<00:02:38.200> as<00:02:38.470> I've<00:02:38.620> gone

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
I've had some strange looks as I've gone

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.430 
I've had some strange looks as I've gone
down<00:02:39.190> by<00:02:39.459> honking<00:02:40.060> people<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.810> then<00:02:41.170> as<00:02:41.319> soon

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
down by honking people and then as soon

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.140 
down by honking people and then as soon
as<00:02:41.500> they'll<00:02:41.709> go<00:02:41.739> out<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.280> water<00:02:42.519> they<00:02:42.910> can

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
as they'll go out in the water they can

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.530 
as they'll go out in the water they can
see<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.890> yes<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.069> can<00:02:45.340> catch<00:02:45.640> waves<00:02:45.970> and

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
see that yes I can catch waves and

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.900 
see that yes I can catch waves and
perhaps<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.230> encourages<00:02:47.890> them<00:02:48.160> well<00:02:48.700> there's

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
perhaps it encourages them well there's

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.580 
perhaps it encourages them well there's
an<00:02:49.000> older<00:02:49.300> person<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.840> do<00:02:50.019> it<00:02:50.050> they<00:02:50.200> say<00:02:50.410> what<00:02:50.560> I

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
an older person to do it they say what I

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.270 
an older person to do it they say what I
