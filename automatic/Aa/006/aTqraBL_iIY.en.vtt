through I'm starting to like Rudy a
little<00:04:29.650> more<00:04:29.740> he<00:04:29.920> still<00:04:30.190> looks<00:04:30.340> kind<00:04:30.610> of<00:04:30.700> weird

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
little more he still looks kind of weird

little more he still looks kind of weird
to<00:04:31.060> me<00:04:31.180> though<00:04:31.210> this<00:04:31.870> setting<00:04:32.260> that

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
to me though this setting that

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.530 
to me though this setting that
everything<00:04:33.940> was<00:04:34.060> like<00:04:34.240> weasels<00:04:34.930> house<00:04:35.140> and

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
everything was like weasels house and

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.730 
everything was like weasels house and
schoolyard<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:37.840> all<00:04:37.930> of<00:04:38.020> that<00:04:38.200> looks<00:04:38.440> really

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
schoolyard and all of that looks really

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.350 
schoolyard and all of that looks really
really<00:04:38.890> I<00:04:39.100> think<00:04:39.370> it's<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.550> schoolyard<00:04:39.790> looks
