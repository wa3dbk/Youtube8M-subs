gian may say it's it's one of those
games<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.520> Jen<00:00:36.000> will<00:00:36.180> shit<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:37.200> what's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
that's why you're watching this the only

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.930 
that's why you're watching this the only
thing<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.910> found<00:00:51.210> hard<00:00:51.600> about<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.079> game

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
thing that I found hard about this game

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.810 
thing that I found hard about this game
was<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.360> fire<00:00:54.629> controller<00:00:55.199> trophy<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
was the fire controller trophy and a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.029 
was the fire controller trophy and a
fire<00:00:57.000> control<00:00:57.539> our<00:00:57.750> bars<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.620> get<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
fire control our bars you to get a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.990 
fire control our bars you to get a
cruise<00:00:59.520> missile<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:01.550> overall<00:01:02.550> true<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:02.969> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
cruise missile the overall true if you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.210 
cruise missile the overall true if you
requires<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.660> call<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.960> every<00:01:04.220> offensive

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
requires you to call in every offensive

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.580 
requires you to call in every offensive
support<00:01:05.460> action<00:01:06.180> which<00:01:06.479> when<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
support action which when you get a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.530 
support action which when you get a
score<00:01:07.890> chain<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> support

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
score chain going you get a support

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.210 
score chain going you get a support
action<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.439> come<00:01:10.590> either<00:01:10.860> Colin

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
action you can come either Colin

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.330 
action you can come either Colin
offensively<00:01:12.150> difference<00:01:12.750> now<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.860> trophy

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
offensively difference now this trophy

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.020 
offensively difference now this trophy
calls<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.210> Colin<00:01:15.600> every<00:01:15.890> offensive

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
calls for you to Colin every offensive

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.030 
calls for you to Colin every offensive
but<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.350> 600

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
but to do that you have to get 600

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.320 
but to do that you have to get 600
points<00:01:20.960> which<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.229> almost<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.549> equivalent<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
points which is almost the equivalent to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.499 
points which is almost the equivalent to
getting<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.869> an<00:01:25.470> EMP<00:01:26.369> maybe<00:01:26.729> I'd<00:01:27.000> say<00:01:27.270> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
getting like an EMP maybe I'd say and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.890 
getting like an EMP maybe I'd say and
call<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.110> duty<00:01:28.409> modern<00:01:28.590> warfare<00:01:29.009> 2<00:01:29.780> but<00:01:30.780> of

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
call of duty modern warfare 2 but of

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.230 
call of duty modern warfare 2 but of
course<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.380> gameplay<00:01:31.680> isn't<00:01:32.310> call<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.909> duty

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
course this gameplay isn't call of duty

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.819 
course this gameplay isn't call of duty
this<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.540> more<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.990> battlefield<00:01:34.200> game

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
this is more like a battlefield game

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.219 
this is more like a battlefield game
despite<00:01:35.310> what<00:01:35.490> people<00:01:35.520> say<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.900> plays<00:01:37.200> just

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
despite what people say it plays just

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.160 
despite what people say it plays just
like<00:01:37.710> any<00:01:38.009> other<00:01:38.100> dice<00:01:38.520> game<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.360> staying<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
like any other dice game so staying on a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.140 
like any other dice game so staying on a
killstreak<00:01:40.680> staying<00:01:41.280> alive<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.820> very

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
killstreak staying alive is very

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.170 
killstreak staying alive is very
difficult<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.869> do<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.490> you'll<00:01:44.490> actually<00:01:44.729> hear

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
difficult to do and you'll actually hear

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.530 
difficult to do and you'll actually hear
a<00:01:45.240> lot<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.600> people<00:01:45.930> boosting<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.829> trophy

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
a lot of people boosting this trophy

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.929 
a lot of people boosting this trophy
which<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:49.200> wouldn't<00:01:50.159> necessarily<00:01:50.399> recommend

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
which I wouldn't necessarily recommend

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.510 
which I wouldn't necessarily recommend
boosting<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.439> know<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.009> feel<00:01:53.250> compelled

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
boosting you know if you feel compelled

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.850 
boosting you know if you feel compelled
to<00:01:53.850> get<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> trophy<00:01:54.420> then<00:01:54.930> by<00:01:55.170> all<00:01:55.200> means<00:01:55.320> go

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
to get the trophy then by all means go

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.690 
to get the trophy then by all means go
boosted<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:57.259> but<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.740> boost<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.430> game

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
boosted I but the boost in this game

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.690 
boosted I but the boost in this game
requires<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.390> many<00:02:00.570> people<00:02:01.079> and

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
requires so many people and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.999 
requires so many people and
being<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.149> pain<00:02:02.329> in<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.509> ass<00:02:02.719> but<00:02:03.110> that's

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
being a pain in the ass but that's

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.920 
being a pain in the ass but that's
probably<00:02:04.399> what<00:02:04.640> I'd<00:02:04.759> say<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.119> hardest<00:02:05.509> trophy

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
probably what I'd say the hardest trophy

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.779 
probably what I'd say the hardest trophy
is<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.200> get<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:06.469> this<00:02:06.590> camp<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.130> if<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:07.369> if<00:02:07.579> you

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
is to get in this camp so if you if you

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.699 
is to get in this camp so if you if you
got<00:02:08.000> every<00:02:08.420> offensive<00:02:08.750> support<00:02:09.110> action

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 
moderate difficulty because it requires

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.520 
moderate difficulty because it requires
