00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.149 
a great video showing you guys how to do
a<00:01:39.180> rocket<00:01:39.570> jump<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.869> get<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.110> there<00:01:40.290> which<00:01:40.860> if

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
a rocket jump to get in there which if

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.950 
a rocket jump to get in there which if
you<00:01:41.310> guys<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.729> master<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> lot

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you guys can master that is a lot

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.530 
you guys can master that is a lot
quicker<00:01:43.200> than<00:01:43.380> my<00:01:43.680> method<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.399> having<00:01:45.360> said

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
quicker than my method but having said

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.749 
quicker than my method but having said
that<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.960> can't<00:01:46.500> master<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> rocket<00:01:47.340> jump<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
that I can't master the rocket jump so I

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.639 
that I can't master the rocket jump so I
like<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.420> basically<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.350> run<00:01:49.500> over

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
like to do this basically just run over

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.960 
like to do this basically just run over
here<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.100> how<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.430> can't<00:01:50.700> go<00:01:50.820> any

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
here and see how and you can't go any

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.880 
here and see how and you can't go any
further<00:01:51.180> than<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.600> point<00:01:51.869> from<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.649> point

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
further than this point from that point

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.789 
further than this point from that point
to<00:01:53.009> strafe<00:01:53.399> over<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.729> your<00:01:53.880> left<00:01:54.030> now<00:01:54.960> turn<00:01:55.439> and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
to strafe over to your left now turn and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.050 
to strafe over to your left now turn and
look<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.299> see<00:01:58.170> how<00:01:58.350> there's<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:59.060> like

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
doesn't have to be perfect but in this

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.150 
doesn't have to be perfect but in this
general<00:02:09.539> vicinity<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.739> start<00:02:10.950> jumping

big<00:02:18.370> square<00:02:18.700> chunk<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.180> iridium<00:02:19.390> just<00:02:20.200> look<00:02:20.379> at

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
big square chunk of iridium just look at

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.130 
big square chunk of iridium just look at
that<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:20.950> just<00:02:21.220> keep<00:02:21.400> jumping<00:02:21.670> make<00:02:22.480> sure<00:02:22.870> you

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
using a controller PC guys I don't know

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.319 
using a controller PC guys I don't know
what<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.409> tell<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.799> about<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.250> just<00:02:34.060> don't

right<00:02:36.489> forward<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.959> can<00:02:38.109> use<00:02:38.260> your

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
right forward you can use your

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.880 
right forward you can use your
directional<00:02:38.739> looking<00:02:39.659> stick<00:02:40.659> which<00:02:41.650> would<00:02:41.769> be

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
directional looking stick which would be

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.410 
directional looking stick which would be
right<00:02:42.099> stick<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.519> a<00:02:42.549> controller<00:02:42.909> I'm<00:02:43.060> not<00:02:43.209> sure

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
right stick on a controller I'm not sure

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.680 
right stick on a controller I'm not sure
PC<00:02:44.079> was<00:02:44.349> what<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.799> is<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.250> use<00:02:45.909> a<00:02:45.940> PC<00:02:46.389> but<00:02:46.569> I

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
PC was what that is I use a PC but I

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.759 
PC was what that is I use a PC but I
still<00:02:47.260> use<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.470> controller<00:02:47.889> um<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:49.480> know

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
still use a controller um you know

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.780 
still use a controller um you know
old-fashioned<00:02:50.769> I<00:02:50.920> guess<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.459> don't<00:02:51.579> know<00:02:51.730> I

can't<00:02:52.329> seem<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.750> master<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.680> idea<00:02:54.129> of<00:02:54.310> like

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
can't seem to master the idea of like

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.270 
can't seem to master the idea of like
remembering<00:02:55.299> 27<00:02:56.049> different<00:02:56.200> keys<00:02:56.620> when<00:02:57.250> I

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
remembering 27 different keys when I

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.399 
remembering 27 different keys when I
have<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.459> controller<00:02:57.909> -<00:02:58.239> yeah<00:02:58.750> makes<00:02:59.109> my<00:02:59.230> life

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
have a controller - yeah makes my life

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.449 
have a controller - yeah makes my life
easy<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.980> don't<00:03:00.040> know

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459
