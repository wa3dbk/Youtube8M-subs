00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.680
 hello kitchens welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:10.860
 from laura I am Laura and this is my 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.390
 kitchen today we're going to cook scrambled from 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.880
 waters 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:23.250
 the ingredients are medium cooked beans 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.210
 onion 4 eggs olive oil and a 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.210
 little salt 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.190
 chop the onion into pieces 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.190
 little ones 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.609
 to 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:41.979
 we light the fire we put it not very 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:45.000
 We put the frying pan and add 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:49.750
 oil that covers the bottom of the pan 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.350
 just cover the bottom of the pan 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.800
 when the oil is hot 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.270
 we will add the onion is chopped 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.270
 pretty small pieces 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.760
 when the oil is hot we add 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.000
 the onion and stir with the spoon 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.000
 wood 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.300
 and let it be done for six u 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.300
 eight minutes 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.510
 when the onion is transparent and 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.450
 start to pick up a little bit of color 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:33.150
 we add the beans and leave them together 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:37.100
 about three or four minutes so 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.100
 the flavors are mixing 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.119
 we look for the eggs 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.649
 one 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.980
 4 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.380
 we put a little salt 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:09.460
 and we started stirring with the spoon 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.460
 while the egg is curdling I know 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.159
 and this already because to the point that you 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.650
 you want to give the egg if you want 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.349
 cook more or less 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:27.319
 or if what you want little curdled or very 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.319
 that's already how you like it 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.370
 good cookers I think this egg 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:37.120
 already has the right consistency and does not 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.270
 I want it to set more so I turned off the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.980
 fire and I say goodbye to you as 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.980
 always good profit
