00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
port was recklessness coming in I was

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.969 
port was recklessness coming in I was
concerned<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.119> was<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> close<00:01:21.630> fight

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
concerned that if this was a close fight

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.070 
concerned that if this was a close fight
that<00:01:23.180> Kell<00:01:24.180> Brook<00:01:24.210> would<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.780> get<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
that Kell Brook would not get the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.649 
that Kell Brook would not get the
decision<00:01:25.350> from<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.830> judges<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.420> thought<00:01:27.420> that

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
decision from the judges I thought that

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.270 
decision from the judges I thought that
being<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.500> Shawn<00:01:29.070> Porter's<00:01:29.520> home<00:01:29.970> country<00:01:31.280> it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
being in Shawn Porter's home country it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.770 
being in Shawn Porter's home country it
would<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.520> very<00:01:32.700> unlikely<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.390> kill<00:01:33.570> port

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
would be very unlikely to kill port

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.120 
would be very unlikely to kill port
would<00:01:33.869> get<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> decision<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.619> he<00:01:34.770> did<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
would get a decision but he did get the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.740 
would get a decision but he did get the
decision<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.000> you've<00:01:36.119> got<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> big<00:01:36.479> up<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
decision so you've got a big up the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
decision so you've got a big up the
judges<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:38.840> Kell<00:01:39.840> Brook<00:01:39.869> done<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> man<00:01:40.530> he
