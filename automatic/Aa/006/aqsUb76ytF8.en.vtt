00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.719
 we could go back a little we knew that 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.340
 I was going if a simple game I think what 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.070
 we ended up being the single at the end 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.450
 us but good very happy for the 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.950
 triumph and good to return to the goal and 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.140
 these three goals good you take the 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.369
 ball are three goals you are a forward 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.930
 that is always helping your team 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.580
 but no doubt a forward lives the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.740
 romance with the networks is undoubtedly the 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.390
 truth today comes to me like water in full 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.960
 desert the truth needed the goals 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.620
 beyond that as I was saying 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.150
 trying to do what's best for him 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.730
 team but the forward nursery goal and 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.070
 good by the way luckily today as 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.479
 it says as it says it opened to me long today 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.030
 the sporting of kansas city that you 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.619
 it seemed like eliminator in the first leg very 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.720
 other than the return duel yes I believe 

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:53.059
 that is a hard rival runs a lot gets 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.830
 much we by and we knew that the 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.420
 height was going to cost also I think that 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.769
 it was key that two goals of entry that 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.110
 we did it beyond that we did not 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.729
 makes a goal 2 to 1 and then 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.040
 of the second time again we hit 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.510
 entrance and when leaving that they would feel the 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.860
 tiredness where we take advantage of 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.140
 space we made the goals really 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.090
 alone the rival is the truth a rival that 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.619
 we know very well difficult in a field 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.240
 difficult is surely going to be a 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.330
 eliminator very couple happiness 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.180
 mariana thank you very much 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.860
 Gerardo a round night of communion 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.710
 with the hobby and semi-final ballot and 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.100
 the round team holiday 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.170
 he never lost his cool we were up 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.610
 of the marker we continue proposing the 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.320
 party and we wanted to expand it and 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.140
 we got 5 very good goals the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.880
 forcefulness the key to the party if 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.320
 part of the key I do not think that the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.530
 good working collective work 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.180
 the sacrifice and the demand we believe 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.890
 who is going to have that party and the team 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.360
 it has behaved height not for your 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.100
 great news team 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.780

 well those big for three of the cow 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.439
 science is a 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.240
 a fairly large team that has 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.189
 a lot of quality coach for 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.840
 have options and that's very good for 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.200
 internal competition that appears alone 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.729
 as a rival and based on a match a 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.979
 very nice match a very even match 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.530
