and everything so first I start with the
face<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.480> do<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.859> long<00:00:17.850> line<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.720> then<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
face I do a long line here and then the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.820 
face I do a long line here and then the
cheek<00:00:19.410> going<00:00:20.130> into<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.490> chin<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.289> I<00:00:22.289> go<00:00:22.590> up

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
cheek going into the chin and I go up

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.650 
cheek going into the chin and I go up
and<00:00:23.359> according<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.689> angle<00:00:25.109> i<00:00:25.430> see<00:00:26.430> how<00:00:27.390> far

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
and according to the angle i see how far

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.480 
and according to the angle i see how far
the<00:00:27.810> chin<00:00:28.050> would<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.590> center<00:00:28.800> or<00:00:29.220> off

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.640 

sparkles

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.640 

the<00:01:37.650> bottom<00:01:37.980> really

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
for them lately I've been liking to add

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.470 
for them lately I've been liking to add
a<00:01:44.600> pupil<00:01:45.080> because<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.740> makes<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.070> look<00:01:46.220> more

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
sparkly and she looks kind of crazy

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.370 
sparkly and she looks kind of crazy
right<00:01:51.320> now<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:51.830> I'm<00:01:52.190> just<00:01:52.550> gonna<00:01:52.870> keep<00:01:53.870> shading

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
right now so I'm just gonna keep shading

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.990 
right now so I'm just gonna keep shading
it<00:01:54.500> in<00:01:54.650> do<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.190> pupils<00:01:55.610> really<00:01:55.940> dark<00:01:56.150> and<00:02:01.000> then

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
it in do the pupils really dark and then

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.300 
it in do the pupils really dark and then
I<00:02:02.030> shade<00:02:02.420> in<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.720> outside<00:02:03.110> of<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:03.320> eye<00:02:03.350> with<00:02:04.280> a

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
I shade in the outside of the eye with a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:13.300 
I shade in the outside of the eye with a
lighter<00:02:04.580> shading

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.309 

and<00:02:14.310> then<00:02:14.549> I<00:02:14.640> go<00:02:14.819> over<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.209> my<00:02:15.330> pencil<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:16.019> i

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
and then I go over with my pencil and i

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.000 
and then I go over with my pencil and i
erase<00:02:16.680> some<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.940> make<00:02:18.269> it<00:02:18.390> even<00:02:18.540> more<00:02:19.010> like

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
erase some to make it even more like

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.110 
erase some to make it even more like
there's<00:02:20.220> light<00:02:20.459> reflecting<00:02:21.209> on<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.700> then<00:02:24.090> I

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
there's light reflecting on and then I

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.380 
there's light reflecting on and then I
move<00:02:24.390> up<00:02:24.599> to<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.840> eyes<00:02:25.049> I<00:02:28.730> did<00:02:29.730> her<00:02:29.879> eyelids

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
move up to the eyes I did her eyelids

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.470 
move up to the eyes I did her eyelids
which<00:02:30.959> adds<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.620> motion<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.819> can<00:02:32.849> do<00:02:33.299> them

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
which adds to the motion you can do them

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.789 
which adds to the motion you can do them
slant<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.049> if<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.260> want<00:02:34.440> them<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> look

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
slant it if you want them to look

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.970 
slant it if you want them to look
worried<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.459> then<00:02:36.420> I'm<00:02:36.540> shading<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:37.829> add

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
worried and then I'm shading to add

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.240 
worried and then I'm shading to add
depth<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:39.319> then<00:02:40.319> now<00:02:40.500> I'm<00:02:40.620> going<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.950> add<00:02:41.069> the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
depth and then now I'm going to add the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.339 
depth and then now I'm going to add the
eyelashes<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:42.900> fan<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.230> out<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:45.170> keep<00:02:46.170> going
