00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.280 
middle of my head that needs to be
braided<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:05.189> every<00:01:05.790> time<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.390> my<00:01:06.750> hair<00:01:07.049> when

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
braided so every time I do my hair when

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.039 
braided so every time I do my hair when
I<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.439> my<00:01:07.799> yarn<00:01:08.159> braids<00:01:08.610> or<00:01:08.909> my<00:01:09.299> zillion<00:01:09.810> braids

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
I do my yarn braids or my zillion braids

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.109 
I do my yarn braids or my zillion braids
or<00:01:10.229> single<00:01:10.650> braids<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.130> want<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.880> make<00:01:12.090> sure

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
or single braids I want to make sure

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.600 
or single braids I want to make sure
that<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.600> make<00:01:13.080> sure<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.619> completely<00:01:14.159> around

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
that I make sure to go completely around

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.219 
that I make sure to go completely around
the<00:01:14.970> perimeter<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> my<00:01:15.630> head

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the perimeter of my head

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.679 
the perimeter of my head
with<00:01:16.770> enough<00:01:17.159> braids<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.700> cover<00:01:17.939> up<00:01:18.119> my<00:01:18.180> hair

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
with enough braids to cover up my hair

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.460 
with enough braids to cover up my hair
so<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.470> probably<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.460> about<00:01:21.119> 4<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.840> 5<00:01:21.869> braids

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
so I probably have about 4 to 5 braids

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.070 
so I probably have about 4 to 5 braids
around<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.009> entire<00:01:23.340> perimeter<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
around the entire perimeter and you

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.499 
around the entire perimeter and you
don't<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.799> braid<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.400> lot<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.090> actually

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
don't have to braid a lot I actually

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.260 
don't have to braid a lot I actually
have<00:01:28.170> about<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.650> poem<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> half<00:01:29.729> size<00:01:30.090> of

no one would ever be able to tell that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.730 
no one would ever be able to tell that
your<00:01:38.490> hair<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.940> not<00:01:39.150> finish<00:01:39.570> braided<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:40.290> you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
your hair is not finish braided if you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.890 
your hair is not finish braided if you
braid<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.190> enough<00:01:41.640> around<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.120> perimeter<00:01:42.660> to

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
braid it enough around the perimeter to

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.500 
braid it enough around the perimeter to
cover<00:01:43.200> up<00:01:43.470> your<00:01:43.740> hair<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.700> depending<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.300> how

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
cover up your hair so depending on how

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
thick your yarn braids are you can

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.550 
thick your yarn braids are you can
probably<00:01:47.820> get<00:01:48.270> away<00:01:48.300> with<00:01:48.600> three<00:01:49.170> braids

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
probably get away with three braids
