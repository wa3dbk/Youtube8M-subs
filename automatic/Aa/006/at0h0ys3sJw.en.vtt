see<00:00:22.199> I've<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:22.410> started<00:00:22.590> ableton<00:00:23.220> live<00:00:23.400> this

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
see I've just started ableton live this

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.599 
see I've just started ableton live this
time<00:00:23.670> I've<00:00:23.939> got<00:00:24.090> some<00:00:25.010> audio<00:00:26.010> tracks<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.519> I

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
time I've got some audio tracks that I

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.490 
time I've got some audio tracks that I
previously<00:00:26.849> recorded<00:00:27.420> I've<00:00:27.750> kept<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.230> fairly

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
previously recorded I've kept it fairly

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.169 
previously recorded I've kept it fairly
lean<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.189> can<00:00:29.310> hear<00:00:29.429> what's<00:00:29.609> going<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:30.000> in

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
lean so you can hear what's going on in

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.200 
lean so you can hear what's going on in
the<00:00:30.240> modular<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.669> the<00:00:33.050> gated<00:00:34.489> vocoder<00:00:35.489> pad<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
the modular and the gated vocoder pad is

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.600 
the modular and the gated vocoder pad is
basically<00:00:36.960> all<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.230> playing<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.890> open

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
basically all it's playing in that open

there's<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> sink<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.850> 2ls<00:00:42.780> module<00:00:43.290> that's

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
there's the sink in 2ls module that's

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.900 
there's the sink in 2ls module that's
some<00:00:44.610> firing<00:00:45.180> all<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.960> rhythmic<00:00:46.320> triggers<00:00:46.910> in

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
time with Ableton and as you can see

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.229
