00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.080 

I've<00:01:18.770> got<00:01:18.979> a<00:01:19.009> lot<00:01:19.189> of<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.340> graphics<00:01:19.759> turned

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.390 
I've got a lot of the graphics turned
down<00:01:20.570> I<00:01:20.600> think<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.560> you<00:01:21.619> might<00:01:21.890> not<00:01:22.040> see<00:01:22.100> the

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
down I think so you might not see the

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.179 
down I think so you might not see the
beautiful<00:01:22.790> water<00:01:23.150> effects<00:01:23.799> though<00:01:24.799> that

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
beautiful water effects though that

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:32.859 
beautiful water effects though that
otherwise<00:01:25.580> coming<00:01:26.119> up<00:01:26.299> I<00:01:31.479> used<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.630> have<00:01:32.720> his

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
otherwise coming up I used to have his

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.499 
otherwise coming up I used to have his
bound<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.409> a<00:01:33.439> key<00:01:34.600> so<00:01:35.600> I<00:01:35.630> could<00:01:35.780> just<00:01:37.450> hit<00:01:38.450> a

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
bound to a key so I could just hit a

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.370 
bound to a key so I could just hit a
button<00:01:38.780> on
