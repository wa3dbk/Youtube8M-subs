00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.230
 good afternoon who is watching me and so am i 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.269
 I want to tell you today how to make 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.740
 fast knife or fast bayonet and without 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.910
 Vidaru Bart Vysi 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:26.220
 without cheats namely macross for macro 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:29.609
 you need an oscar for the mouse and everything 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.969
 go in the oscar and choose the button i 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.730
 I suggest a button on number 5 as it is 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.579
 more located in the thumb more 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.219
 comfortable well you yourself have finite networks 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.399
 grape vine but I suggest min again 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.399
 and so choose any macro 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.739
 write here anything to your soul 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:59.270
 you can just Civic 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.530
 then the stars enter again macro manager 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.769
 malakor brand opened 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.140
 so we see macrame up here 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.790
 some magician hand write us this 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.000
 question with all we press record 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:21.479
 f1 2012 window is displayed 1 start to 12 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:27.270
 go to the warface click f11 then 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:31.950
 Hit the hit you pressed then the f12 window 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.880
 should close automatically 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:40.280
 curled up here we see the record but here 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.930
 see exactly pause-pause 212 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.299
 milliseconds this is a very huge pause then 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.350
 is there in the game if you missed the first 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.290
 once a second time they will kill you for sure 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.009
 that help is not important to be so long 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.890
 macross we completely remove too much 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.600
 delete delete delete delete it 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.689
 make up 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:12.050
 Here the chip in which we press any keys on 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:16.350
 laptop on the computer click any 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:27.120
 see each other 4 leaving the forehead the rest 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:33.380
 and thereby we cut we cut 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:37.860
 macross so-so Save Save 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.709
 Sphere we slept for only 64 microseconds in 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.150
 difference from 300 we reduced it 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.360
 more than four times here's a tip to think 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:55.110
 so here 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:59.250
 close the merge button now 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:03.000
 the difference is punch usually pressed in 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:13.829
 i click a few one-time see for yourself 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:19.410
 and now macro button put huskies 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.850
