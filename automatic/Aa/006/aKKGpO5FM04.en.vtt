00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.280 
from the manuka honey so when this dries
it<00:02:32.360> should<00:02:32.570> not<00:02:32.750> feel<00:02:33.170> sticky<00:02:33.740> it<00:02:34.250> should<00:02:34.850> feel

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
it should not feel sticky it should feel

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.650 
it should not feel sticky it should feel
dry<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.970> that's<00:02:37.970> how<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.240> know<00:02:38.480> you've

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.820 
dry and that's how you know you've
applied<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.050> properly

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
applied it properly

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.140 
applied it properly
so<00:02:40.780> what<00:02:41.780> manuka<00:02:42.290> honey<00:02:42.370> will<00:02:43.370> also<00:02:44.290> do<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:46.150> it

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
so what manuka honey will also do is it

for 10 to 20 minutes and it'll work
great<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.310> can<00:03:10.489> still<00:03:10.850> see<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.480> oxygen

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
great you can still see that the oxygen

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.880 
great you can still see that the oxygen
is<00:03:12.200> working<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.989> this<00:03:14.989> hand<00:03:15.350> you<00:03:15.709> can

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
is working and this hand you can

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.620 
is working and this hand you can
actually<00:03:16.100> see<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.880> veins<00:03:20.180> are<00:03:20.600> a

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
actually see that the the veins are a

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.780 
actually see that the the veins are a
lot<00:03:20.840> less<00:03:21.080> noticeable<00:03:21.680> because<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.220> oxygen

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
lot less noticeable because the oxygen

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.479 
lot less noticeable because the oxygen
is<00:03:22.940> flushed<00:03:23.330> all<00:03:23.630> of<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.019> blood<00:03:24.290> out<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:25.130> the

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
is flushed all of the blood out of the

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.240 
is flushed all of the blood out of the
veins<00:03:25.700> which<00:03:26.060> is<00:03:26.239> part<00:03:26.510> of<00:03:26.600> what<00:03:26.830> detox<00:03:27.830> is<00:03:28.070> the

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
veins which is part of what detox is the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.949 
veins which is part of what detox is the
skin<00:03:28.549> so<00:03:29.950> also<00:03:31.150> there<00:03:32.150> have<00:03:32.269> been<00:03:32.450> side<00:03:32.720> by

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
skin so also there have been side by

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.800 
skin so also there have been side by
side<00:03:33.230> studies<00:03:33.830> done<00:03:34.130> of<00:03:34.630> benzoyl<00:03:35.630> peroxide

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
side studies done of benzoyl peroxide

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.090 
side studies done of benzoyl peroxide
and<00:03:36.910> tea<00:03:37.910> tree<00:03:37.940> oil<00:03:38.540> manuka<00:03:39.410> honey<00:03:39.440> is<00:03:39.830> in<00:03:40.010> the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
and tea tree oil manuka honey is in the

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.160 
and tea tree oil manuka honey is in the
tea<00:03:40.310> tree<00:03:40.580> family<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:41.299> if<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.600> have<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.840> tea

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
tea tree family so if you have a tea

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.500 
tea tree family so if you have a tea
tree<00:03:42.470> allergy<00:03:43.070> you<00:03:43.340> want<00:03:43.519> a<00:03:43.610> patch<00:03:43.820> test<00:03:44.239> your

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
tree allergy you want a patch test your

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.600 
tree allergy you want a patch test your
skin<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.019> make<00:03:45.140> sure<00:03:45.380> you're<00:03:46.130> not<00:03:46.160> also

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
skin and make sure you're not also

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.160 
skin and make sure you're not also
allergic<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.630> manuka<00:03:48.140> so<00:03:49.150> manuka<00:03:50.150> oil<00:03:50.450> has

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
allergic to manuka so manuka oil has

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.070 
allergic to manuka so manuka oil has
been<00:03:51.440> found<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:51.860> be<00:03:52.010> 33<00:03:52.459> times<00:03:53.000> stronger<00:03:53.540> than

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
been found to be 33 times stronger than

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.180 
been found to be 33 times stronger than
tea<00:03:54.650> tree<00:03:54.980> tea<00:03:55.970> tree<00:03:56.330> was<00:03:56.810> found<00:03:57.140> in<00:03:57.530> studies

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
tea tree tea tree was found in studies

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.400 
tea tree tea tree was found in studies
to<00:03:58.519> be<00:03:58.640> just<00:03:59.060> as<00:03:59.269> effective<00:03:59.420> as<00:03:59.989> benzoyl

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
to be just as effective as benzoyl

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.800 
to be just as effective as benzoyl
peroxide<00:04:01.040> which<00:04:01.760> is<00:04:01.940> really<00:04:02.239> exciting

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
peroxide which is really exciting

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.210 
peroxide which is really exciting
because<00:04:02.900> benzoyl<00:04:03.440> peroxide<00:04:03.590> is<00:04:04.160> toxic<00:04:04.730> so

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
because benzoyl peroxide is toxic so

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.620 
because benzoyl peroxide is toxic so
benzoyl<00:04:07.220> peroxide<00:04:07.370> is<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.150> active

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
benzoyl peroxide is the active

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.210 
benzoyl peroxide is the active
ingredient<00:04:08.720> in<00:04:09.440> Proactiv<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:11.870> found<00:04:12.769> that

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
ingredient in Proactiv and I found that

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.340 
ingredient in Proactiv and I found that
Proactiv<00:04:14.090> works<00:04:14.360> really<00:04:14.660> well<00:04:14.900> for<00:04:14.959> my

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
Proactiv works really well for my

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.250 
Proactiv works really well for my
clients<00:04:15.920> for<00:04:16.220> one<00:04:16.790> to<00:04:17.060> three<00:04:17.090> months<00:04:17.450> and<00:04:17.900> then

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
clients for one to three months and then

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.780 
clients for one to three months and then
this

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
this

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.370 
this
then<00:04:18.910> it<00:04:19.030> kind<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.300> stopped<00:04:19.540> working<00:04:20.170> I

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
then it kind of stopped working I

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.430 
then it kind of stopped working I
believe<00:04:21.340> it's<00:04:21.670> because<00:04:21.960> toxicity<00:04:22.960> builds<00:04:23.290> up

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
believe it's because toxicity builds up

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.310 
believe it's because toxicity builds up
in<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.710> skin<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:25.150> toxicity<00:04:25.600> actually

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
in the skin and the toxicity actually

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.180 
in the skin and the toxicity actually
causes<00:04:26.920> an<00:04:27.100> acne<00:04:27.490> breakout<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:29.350> highly

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
causes an acne breakout so I highly

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.680 
causes an acne breakout so I highly
recommend<00:04:30.660> using<00:04:31.660> all-natural<00:04:32.470> non-toxic

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690
