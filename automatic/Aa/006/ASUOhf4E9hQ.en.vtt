 water resources are becoming scarce 

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:11.889
 agriculture is the world's largest consumer of gold 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.590
 if the arid areas of the planet are not paying attention their agriculture is going

 drip the crops really started well not too much we 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.160
 have saved on the leading edge the seven ranks 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.620
 with their new system 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.960

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 we will master the aspect and marketing

 but now we are very satisfied with this project because we 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.079
 make big savings 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.249
