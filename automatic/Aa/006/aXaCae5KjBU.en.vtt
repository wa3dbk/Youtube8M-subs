00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.930
 silicone cases 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.640

 behave the same as at low temperatures 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.460

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:45.809
 the phone looks 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:53.430
 transparent case is inserted enough 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:56.329
 tightly the phone does not slip out so 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.329
 the way he sits down 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:06.030

 volume rocker looks like this 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.130
 case if the phone put the screen 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.600
 down then the screen is it so touch to the table 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.600
 would n't you crown in rough 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.009
 surfaces here is such a special rim 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.869
 on the screen basically so he looks 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.909
 sitting tight not fire and speak out 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.640

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.140

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.140

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.780
 high quality artificial book 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:51.810

 The same can be to answer the call and there 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.210
 for the dynamics of a spoken fiesta that is 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.320
 you can raise nerds and talk when 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.820
