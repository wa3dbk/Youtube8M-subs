00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 after spending so much time on 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.809
 torments like time the gathering is temple 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.250
 run 2 that some of you will remember 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.450
 I was looking for something quick and immediate 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.070
 in other words to commit the time of one 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.789
 crap 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.789
 here's how it went with me 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.890
 7 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.749
 coffee 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.719
 one of the titles he managed to overcome 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.019
 the tough selection for the specification 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:07.810
 function that will have to fulfill and gold 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.670
 diggers gold diggers looks like this 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.500
 immediate and simple quick 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.060
 before starting the game there 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.130
 will be asked if we want to use the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.040
 standard definition and high version 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.750
 definition and which would indicate that 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.330
 can safely run on every 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.700
 device available on android and ios 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.070
 made our choice the menu yes 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.780
 presents thus starting from the top we will have 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.690
 the button to access the google area 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.479
 play for our cm and the button for the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.789
 multi player with some sort of ranking 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.770
 between players and the chance to challenge each other 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.660
 with other players even if it is 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.030
 a simple race for those who arrive the most 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.429
 far without any kind of interaction 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.440
 between the two players nor a ghost 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.360
 which shows us the opponent's record 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.149
 at the bottom left the key for le 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.369
 social sharing and settings for 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.649
 removing music and game audio 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.509
 the button for the shop the one for the 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.460
 there are three drivers change at ours 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.140
 available and the key to access 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.210
 to other software house products 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.320
 on the big screen our 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.179
 machinery or gadget that dir 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.950
 you want us to try to take you to 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.590
 center of the earth in despair 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.540
 search for gold on the right at each 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.730
 our departure will be visible ours 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.980
 best record and the game is reduced to 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.780
 this is a frantic race towards the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.790
 center of the earth where we can 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.519
 uniquely move horizontally 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.860
 in our shuttle and we will have to dodge 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.320
 obstacles of rock barriers of little or 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.870
 vermons that will meet us every 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.940
 also meters we will have to change 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.280
 earth layer and therefore we will find ourselves 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.650
 within other scenarios such as 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.750
 mines bound on the tracks o 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.000
 inside of terrestrial cavities full of 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.070
 lava that we can still cross 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.770
 passing the vehicle too long e 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.710
 will begin to give in and we will lose wagons 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.200
 but if you want to call them about every two 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.180
 zone will touch us instead to escape from a 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.460
 mega vermon that this time will come 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.650
 from above as we will do using gods 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.080
 small turbo slots that will give us 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.800
 that extra push to make it through 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.930
 path 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.390
 we will collect not only gold but also 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.790
 tokens for the end run and even bonus 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.320
 the tokens for a temporary baff that is 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.120
 we will have the opportunity to shoot at 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.070
 obstacles and we will have a sort of barrier 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.600
 which will protect us in the event of a collision 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.670
 above 2000 meters 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.470
 we will also find additional lives at 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.540
 end of the run we will have the mode 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.970
 bonus that will see us forced to click 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.680
 better to repeatedly press on a 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.540
 gold block to collect as much as possible 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.550
 gold a possible bonus on our time 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.860
 provision will be equivalent to 2 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.780
 seconds for each coin collected if 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.220
 you don't care you can avoid the game 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.870
 receiving an average value of 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.970
 change but so you will lose the 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.930
 chance to win some bonuses with 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.760
 end ral bonus 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.320
 we will check if we have passed one or 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.500
 more than the three assigned mini-missions 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.820
 so as to have a few right goals 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.830
 returning to the shop we will have the 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.380
 ability to buy useful gadgets for 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.450
 upgrade the vehicle as a turbo or 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.050
 magnets for their investments 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.390
 additional 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.250
 we can also unlock the other two 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.900
 pilots who have exclusive bonuses 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.280
 compared to the basic one and not 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.990
 let us forget that we can 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.750
 completely customize the shuttle 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.120
 changing both the various carriages and the 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.790
 drill itself and look at that 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.280
 some nice alternatives offer us some 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.290
 quite unthinkable others with parisi 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.350
 references to the world of the years like 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.940
 this one in particular like no one 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.970
 breaking through the skies 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.420
 the game is simply this one one 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.500
 run at the bottom is the right time for a h 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.500
 we understood each other no 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.500
 stuck point you're finished
