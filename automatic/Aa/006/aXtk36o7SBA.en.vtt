 bass guinea it's me I use everything 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.599
 first then to have a material that we 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:35.750
 will use cutting pliers - a 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:39.320
 pliers for ceret will be so small and 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.790
 aul who will squeeze the son who is going 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.070
 allow instead to do one and their 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.330
 wish 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:52.280
 it's going to be a cert-body and does not rule 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:56.000
 to measure at staples also 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:01.370
 needs and where only its details 0 this 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.059
 which is well down there it is a fact it is 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.340
 a kit of kevlar balding when I know 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:13.939
 not if you will see on the video 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:16.369
 this is the dollar thier that's what 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.409
 resists well to the teeth of the big oak and 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.429
 there is the small the little trick for 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.310
 crimp with they are provided so here 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.439
 that a resistance 2 7 kg and two 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.249
 doctors that I believe it costs 14 70 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:35.630
 the right struggle as his strength marc 

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:41.630
 waiting for suffixes so dragon his 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.729
 marks and what is this 1 for if that you 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.729
 interested 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.729
 here 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:58.590
 and vinci immersions number 10 is 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:03.480
 death that is a resistance of 10 kg which 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.930
 finally that is enough for a type of 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:11.580
 fishing so then first to dawn 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:15.630
 a hymn and rays that's me I cut 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:19.370
 in pieces of kevlar of 30 cm there I 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.140
 introduces small time as in series 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:27.540
 so now we're going to take 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:30.720
 imÃ©rien the meeting there we will move in 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:38.130
 a hedge you from him but nothing we're going 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:40.700
 board girls in a make 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.810
 come out on the other side 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:50.540
 here we are going to squeeze for once 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.540
 it's done that we'll take the clip 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.260
 come and tighten 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.590
 Here comes back 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.710
 so 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.870
 the little ones 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.379
 so it must be well served also 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:25.719
 because it is not necessary that what moves 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:27.189
 what is it working better so he 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:30.879
 should not be tight on the sides because 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:34.769
 otherwise or multiple uses it 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.769
 your risks and perils of cutting and was 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:45.790
 even with the mans teeth in these 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:48.090
 incompetent there so it will always have to 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.090
 not 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:04:01.370
 there it starts half inserted so the 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:03.019
 so here we have one side and so have 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.830
 do the same for the other side so 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.569
 I think that you have seen so 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.299
 now that next to do 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.640
 normally you will have to do should 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.079
 succeed in doing the other side so to 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.900
 the town hall square have of course this 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:23.030
 will be the graph and so thank you

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.419
