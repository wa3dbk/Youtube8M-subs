can see that it really is quite a snug
fit<00:00:31.470> which<00:00:31.890> isn't<00:00:32.040> necessarily<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.550> bad<00:00:32.790> thing

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
fit which isn't necessarily a bad thing

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.080 
fit which isn't necessarily a bad thing
for<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.750> particular<00:00:33.989> laptop<00:00:34.520> but<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:35.820> this

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
for this particular laptop but it's this

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.240 
for this particular laptop but it's this
is<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.239> 13-inch<00:00:36.809> model<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> 14

is the 13-inch model so if you have a 14

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.910 
is the 13-inch model so if you have a 14
inch<00:00:38.280> Windows<00:00:39.149> machine<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.780> might<00:00:40.680> want<00:00:40.860> to

inch Windows machine you might want to
check<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.370> dimensions<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.940> make<00:00:41.969> sure<00:00:42.210> it's

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
check the dimensions to make sure it's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.580 
check the dimensions to make sure it's
really<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> fit<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:43.320> this

really going to fit in here because this
is<00:00:43.770> quite<00:00:44.640> snug<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.469> advised<00:00:46.739> about

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770

is<00:00:48.570> they<00:00:48.719> give<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.050> separate<00:00:49.469> pouch<00:00:49.710> for

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
is they give you a separate pouch for

is they give you a separate pouch for
the<00:00:50.280> iPad<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.940> it'll<00:00:51.510> largely<00:00:51.870> stay<00:00:52.199> put<00:00:52.530> where

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the iPad so it'll largely stay put where

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.290 
the iPad so it'll largely stay put where
it<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.250> another<00:00:53.460> bag<00:00:53.699> where<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> used<00:00:54.180> to

it is I have another bag where I used to
just<00:00:54.539> kind<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.809> throw<00:00:54.930> things<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.500> there<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
just kind of throw things in there and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.279 
just kind of throw things in there and
and<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> didn't<00:00:57.270> really<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> secure<00:00:58.109> place

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289

have<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> piece<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.000> hard<00:01:33.329> plastic<00:01:33.360> here<00:01:34.079> so

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
have a piece of hard plastic here so

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.520 
have a piece of hard plastic here so
this<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.220> fabric<00:01:35.670> catch<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.140> at

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
this is just a fabric catch here but at

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.460 
this is just a fabric catch here but at
the<00:01:37.650> same<00:01:37.829> time<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.310> you're<00:01:38.460> using<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.479> iPad<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the same time if you're using a iPad and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.050 
the same time if you're using a iPad and
maybe<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.829> MacBook<00:01:41.250> Air<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.640> what<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.790> usually

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
maybe a MacBook Air like what I usually

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.670 
maybe a MacBook Air like what I usually
travel<00:01:42.240> around<00:01:42.600> with<00:01:42.810> you're<00:01:43.320> looking<00:01:43.560> at

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
travel around with you're looking at

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.219 
travel around with you're looking at
maybe<00:01:43.829> three<00:01:44.220> or<00:01:44.310> four<00:01:44.490> pounds<00:01:44.700> tops<00:01:45.270> for

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
maybe three or four pounds tops for

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.130 
maybe three or four pounds tops for
weight<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.970> perhaps<00:01:47.970> that's<00:01:48.299> probably<00:01:48.930> why

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
weight so perhaps that's probably why

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.389 
weight so perhaps that's probably why
they<00:01:49.320> made<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.500> decision<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.280> not

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
they made that decision and not

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.700 
they made that decision and not
something<00:01:50.790> sturdier<00:01:51.180> there<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:51.689> beyond<00:01:52.649> that

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
something sturdier there but beyond that

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.020 
something sturdier there but beyond that
I<00:01:52.829> can<00:01:53.009> see<00:01:53.130> that's<00:01:53.250> working<00:01:53.460> out<00:01:53.700> quite<00:01:53.909> well

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
I can see that's working out quite well

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.510 
I can see that's working out quite well
I've<00:01:54.360> actually<00:01:54.570> used<00:01:54.990> Case<00:01:55.530> Logic<00:01:55.560> bags

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
I've actually used Case Logic bags

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.670 
I've actually used Case Logic bags
before<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.390> I've<00:01:57.450> had<00:01:57.750> good<00:01:58.049> success<00:01:58.320> with

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
before and I've had good success with

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.709 
before and I've had good success with
them<00:01:58.829> although<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.130> tend<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.399> beat<00:02:00.060> my<00:02:00.210> stuff<00:02:00.509> up

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
them although I tend to beat my stuff up

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.359 
them although I tend to beat my stuff up
a<00:02:01.259> little<00:02:01.500> bit<00:02:01.619> more<00:02:01.740> heavily<00:02:01.979> than<00:02:02.040> others

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
a little bit more heavily than others

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.490 
a little bit more heavily than others
might<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.420> overall<00:02:03.719> it's<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> nice<00:02:04.020> case<00:02:04.079> I

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
might but overall it's a nice case I

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.780 
might but overall it's a nice case I
would<00:02:04.680> recommend<00:02:05.159> though<00:02:05.280> checking<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
would recommend though checking the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.010 
would recommend though checking the
dimensions<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.360> make<00:02:06.509> sure<00:02:06.659> things<00:02:06.869> fit

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
dimensions to make sure things fit

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.580 
dimensions to make sure things fit
properly

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
properly

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.619 
properly
I<00:02:07.710> use<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> MacBook<00:02:08.729> Air<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.239> know<00:02:09.330> I'm<00:02:09.509> going

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
I use a MacBook Air so I know I'm going

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.660 
I use a MacBook Air so I know I'm going
to<00:02:09.660> be<00:02:09.780> fine<00:02:10.020> but<00:02:10.289> here<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.160> see<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.520> is

run-of-the-mill laptop that really has
about<00:02:15.040> an<00:02:15.130> inch<00:02:15.310> smaller<00:02:15.700> than<00:02:16.180> what<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.960> bag

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
about an inch smaller than what the bag

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.840 
about an inch smaller than what the bag
states<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:17.950> can<00:02:18.040> hold<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.520> it's<00:02:18.640> really

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
states it can hold and it's really

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.820 
states it can hold and it's really
really<00:02:18.970> snug<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:19.840> be<00:02:19.930> sure<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.650> make<00:02:20.800> sure
