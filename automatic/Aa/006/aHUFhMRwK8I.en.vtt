take grinds well the only problem they

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.400 
take grinds well the only problem they
don't<00:03:51.060> have<00:03:51.150> an<00:03:51.269> edge<00:03:51.510> bottom<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.079> keep<00:03:52.230> it

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
from sliding but you guys just solve

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.369

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
sticky whatever you want to use and to

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.119 
sticky whatever you want to use and to
set<00:04:04.940> you<00:04:05.940> know<00:04:08.390> actually<00:04:09.390> adds<00:04:09.599> to<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.129> that's

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
set you know actually adds to it that's

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.690 
set you know actually adds to it that's
why<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:11.640> wouldn't<00:04:12.379> my<00:04:13.379> opinion<00:04:13.890> I<00:04:13.980> went<00:04:14.250> get<00:04:14.489> the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
why I wouldn't my opinion I went get the

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.039 
why I wouldn't my opinion I went get the
one<00:04:15.629> that's<00:04:15.660> just<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.199> box<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:17.690> say<00:04:18.690> it's<00:04:18.870> not

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.909 
one that's just the box I say it's not
worth<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:23.600> yeah<00:04:24.600> it's<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.900> very<00:04:25.080> nice<00:04:25.440> it

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919
