00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
through this existing hole here but it's

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.689 
through this existing hole here but it's
not<00:00:28.859> wide<00:00:29.070> enough<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.429> we're<00:00:29.519> going<00:00:29.609> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
not wide enough so we're going to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.099 
not wide enough so we're going to
actually<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.150> make<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> little<00:00:30.720> wider<00:00:30.900> so

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
actually have to make a little wider so

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.810 
actually have to make a little wider so
our<00:00:31.170> arch<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.710> fit<00:00:31.859> through<00:00:32.070> we're<00:00:32.700> just

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
our arch can fit through we're just

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.979 
our arch can fit through we're just
going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:32.969> use<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.239> hammer<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.410> chisel<00:00:35.989> I'm

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
going to use a hammer and a chisel I'm

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.450 
going to use a hammer and a chisel I'm
going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> check<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.680> see<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:37.860> our<00:00:37.920> block<00:00:38.190> fits

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
going to check to see if our block fits

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.860 
going to check to see if our block fits
through<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.910> seems<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.480> does<00:00:39.629> so

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
through and it seems like it does so

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.319 
through and it seems like it does so
that's<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.590> good<00:00:40.710> sign<00:00:40.920> now<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.760> order<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.059> take
