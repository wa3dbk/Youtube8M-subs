there's anything that I wanted to try

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.799 
there's anything that I wanted to try
and<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.350> thought<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.739> Milani<00:00:53.039> had<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
and I thought that Milani had a

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.090 
and I thought that Milani had a
universal<00:00:54.809> lip<00:00:54.930> liner<00:00:55.140> as<00:00:55.379> well<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
universal lip liner as well but for a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.470 
universal lip liner as well but for a
fraction<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.699> price<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> was<00:00:57.329> like

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
fraction of the price and I was like

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.990 
fraction of the price and I was like
okay<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> really<00:00:59.309> interesting<00:00:59.789> so<00:00:59.820> I

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
okay so this is really interesting so I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.819 
okay so this is really interesting so I
went<00:01:00.180> ahead<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.570> purchased<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:01.379> so

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
went ahead and I purchased that one so

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.529 
went ahead and I purchased that one so
with<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.190> thought<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.640> could<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> review

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
with that I thought I could do a review

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.200 
with that I thought I could do a review
such<00:01:03.750> comparison<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.619> higher-end<00:01:05.210> version

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
such comparison of a higher-end version

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.210 
such comparison of a higher-end version
and<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.720> lower-end<00:01:07.020> version<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> same<00:01:07.920> kind

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and a lower-end version of the same kind

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.250 
and a lower-end version of the same kind
of<00:01:08.280> product<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.390> what<00:01:09.510> they<00:01:09.600> look<00:01:09.810> like

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.039

differences of these products so let's

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.460 
differences of these products so let's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
talk about the Sephora one first the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.510 
talk about the Sephora one first the
Sephora<00:01:52.860> one<00:01:53.360> costs<00:01:54.360> about<00:01:54.560> $12<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.860> their

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.300 
Sephora one costs about $12 on their
website<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.180> if<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.229> wrong<00:01:58.530> I'll<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.070> put

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
website and if it is wrong I'll just put

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.819 
website and if it is wrong I'll just put
a<00:01:59.340> notation<00:01:59.700> down<00:02:00.030> below<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.630> price<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
a notation down below of the price the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.910 
a notation down below of the price the
wax<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.520> one<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.969> quite<00:02:03.570> hard<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.380> so

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
wax on this one is quite hard and so

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.560 
wax on this one is quite hard and so
which<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> good<00:02:05.969> thing<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.420> can

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
which is can be a good thing and it can

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.480 
which is can be a good thing and it can
be<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> bad<00:02:06.930> thing

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
be a bad thing

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.700 
be a bad thing
the<00:02:08.090> Plus<00:02:08.330> about<00:02:08.509> that<00:02:08.869> is<00:02:09.140> that<00:02:09.170> when<00:02:09.530> you're

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
the Plus about that is that when you're

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.350 
the Plus about that is that when you're
lining<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.250> outside<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.759> your<00:02:10.850> lips<00:02:11.090> it's

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
really good at holding its shape so it's

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.630 
really good at holding its shape so it's
not<00:02:13.370> going<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.790> give<00:02:14.620> whereas<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.980> Milani<00:02:16.340> one

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
recommend for other people to purchase

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.870 
recommend for other people to purchase
and<00:03:31.989> in<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.440> long<00:03:33.620> run<00:03:33.890> I<00:03:34.100> think<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.549> I<00:03:34.580> would

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
and in the long run I think that I would

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.800 
and in the long run I think that I would
recommend<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:36.830> Milani<00:03:37.430> one<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.060> just

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
recommend the Milani one and just

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.430 
recommend the Milani one and just
because<00:03:39.200> even<00:03:40.070> though<00:03:40.160> it's<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.489> softer<00:03:40.970> wax

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
because even though it's a softer wax

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.930 
because even though it's a softer wax
not<00:03:42.440> only<00:03:42.739> is<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:43.130> really<00:03:43.430> great<00:03:43.640> price

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
not only is it a really great price

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.470 
not only is it a really great price
point<00:03:44.440> but<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:45.500> feel<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.000> my<00:03:47.000> lipstick

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
point but I feel that my lipstick

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.310 
point but I feel that my lipstick
actually<00:03:48.110> does<00:03:48.560> not<00:03:48.799> feather<00:03:49.630> with<00:03:50.630> that<00:03:51.019> lip

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
actually does not feather with that lip

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.350 
actually does not feather with that lip
liner<00:03:51.560> now<00:03:51.980> I've<00:03:52.100> used<00:03:52.370> both<00:03:52.579> over<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.060> period

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
liner now I've used both over a period

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.660 
liner now I've used both over a period
of<00:03:53.570> time<00:03:53.780> at<00:03:53.989> least<00:03:54.140> for<00:03:54.350> four<00:03:54.709> weeks<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:55.220> I've

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
of time at least for four weeks and I've

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.130 
of time at least for four weeks and I've
noticed<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.150> with<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.360> Sephora<00:03:56.720> one<00:03:56.989> the

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
noticed that with the Sephora one the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.920 
noticed that with the Sephora one the
other<00:03:57.290> day<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:57.590> was<00:03:57.769> wearing<00:03:58.130> it<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:59.060> noticed

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
other day I was wearing it and I noticed

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.710 
other day I was wearing it and I noticed
that<00:04:00.049> my<00:04:00.260> lipstick<00:04:00.680> was<00:04:00.890> feathering<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:01.720> that

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
that my lipstick was feathering and that

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.890 
that my lipstick was feathering and that
was<00:04:02.840> really<00:04:03.140> really<00:04:03.590> odd<00:04:03.890> I<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:05.269> felt<00:04:05.720> like<00:04:05.810> it

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
was really really odd I I felt like it

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.420 
was really really odd I I felt like it
was<00:04:05.989> really<00:04:06.230> strange<00:04:06.530> because<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.860> put<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.250> on

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
was really strange because I put it on

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.390 
was really strange because I put it on
very<00:04:07.670> carefully<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:08.780> only<00:04:09.410> used<00:04:10.100> it<00:04:10.250> to

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
very carefully and I only used it to

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.600 
very carefully and I only used it to
line<00:04:10.610> my<00:04:10.820> lips

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
line my lips

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.450 
line my lips
and<00:04:11.700> within<00:04:12.210> maybe<00:04:12.780> 20<00:04:13.350> minutes<00:04:13.470> I<00:04:13.890> looked<00:04:14.340> in

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
and within maybe 20 minutes I looked in

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.650 
and within maybe 20 minutes I looked in
the<00:04:14.520> mirror<00:04:14.550> and<00:04:14.970> my<00:04:15.180> lipstick<00:04:15.510> was

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
the mirror and my lipstick was

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.330 
the mirror and my lipstick was
feathering<00:04:15.930> right<00:04:16.410> up<00:04:16.560> here<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.160> inner

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
feathering right up here and the inner

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.520 
feathering right up here and the inner
or<00:04:18.000> right<00:04:18.209> outside<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.630> my<00:04:18.780> Cupid's<00:04:19.260> bow<00:04:19.380> on

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
or right outside of my Cupid's bow on

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.240 
or right outside of my Cupid's bow on
this<00:04:19.650> side<00:04:19.829> of<00:04:19.950> my<00:04:20.070> mouth

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
this side of my mouth

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.830 
this side of my mouth
and<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.489> was<00:04:20.579> like<00:04:20.700> what<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.030> Frick<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.480> I

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
and I was like what the Frick and I

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.840 
and I was like what the Frick and I
don't<00:04:21.900> remember<00:04:22.230> like<00:04:22.620> smearing<00:04:23.400> my<00:04:23.550> mouth

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
don't remember like smearing my mouth

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.450 
don't remember like smearing my mouth
with<00:04:24.150> anything<00:04:24.570> or<00:04:24.750> with<00:04:24.840> my<00:04:24.960> fingers<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:25.650> I

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
with anything or with my fingers so I

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.910 
with anything or with my fingers so I
was<00:04:26.640> like<00:04:26.820> if<00:04:27.300> I'm<00:04:27.510> gonna<00:04:27.630> pay<00:04:27.930> 12<00:04:28.680> some

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
was like if I'm gonna pay 12 some

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.700 
was like if I'm gonna pay 12 some
dollars<00:04:29.250> for<00:04:29.610> pencil<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.780> better<00:04:31.020> work<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:31.590> it

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
dollars for pencil it better work and it

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.800 
dollars for pencil it better work and it
better<00:04:31.800> work<00:04:31.890> well<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.240> I've<00:04:33.570> noticed

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
better work well so and I've noticed

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.930 
better work well so and I've noticed
that<00:04:34.050> with<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:34.260> Milani<00:04:34.560> one<00:04:34.890> though<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:35.730> does

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
that with the Milani one though it does

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.940 
that with the Milani one though it does
go<00:04:36.180> duller<00:04:36.390> faster<00:04:36.960> just<00:04:37.170> because<00:04:37.500> it's<00:04:37.830> such

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
go duller faster just because it's such

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.730 
go duller faster just because it's such
a<00:04:37.980> softer<00:04:38.520> wax<00:04:38.730> if<00:04:39.150> I<00:04:39.690> allow<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.140> to<00:04:40.350> stay

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
a softer wax if I allow it to stay

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.160 
a softer wax if I allow it to stay
pretty<00:04:41.100> well<00:04:41.280> I<00:04:41.580> put<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:42.360> on<00:04:42.450> before<00:04:42.600> I<00:04:42.810> did

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
pretty well I put it on before I did

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.500 
pretty well I put it on before I did
this<00:04:43.290> video<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.890> I<00:04:43.919> think<00:04:43.980> that<00:04:44.310> my<00:04:44.430> lips<00:04:44.700> my

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
this video and I think that my lips my

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.390 
this video and I think that my lips my
lipstick<00:04:46.050> looks<00:04:46.320> really<00:04:46.680> good<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.830> don't<00:04:47.010> see

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
lipstick looks really good I don't see

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.970 
lipstick looks really good I don't see
any<00:04:47.700> feathering<00:04:48.120> at<00:04:48.780> all<00:04:50.870> see<00:04:51.870> ya<00:04:52.230> I<00:04:52.470> don't<00:04:52.800> see

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
any feathering at all see ya I don't see

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.980 
any feathering at all see ya I don't see
any<00:04:53.190> feathering<00:04:53.610> whatsoever<00:04:54.390> and<00:04:54.780> I've<00:04:54.870> been

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
any feathering whatsoever and I've been

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.490 
any feathering whatsoever and I've been
wearing<00:04:55.110> this<00:04:55.320> lipstick<00:04:55.650> for<00:04:55.890> a<00:04:55.919> good<00:04:57.500> 2530

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
wearing this lipstick for a good 2530

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.710 
wearing this lipstick for a good 2530
minutes<00:04:58.740> which<00:04:59.490> I<00:04:59.880> know<00:05:00.060> it's<00:05:00.330> not<00:05:00.419> a<00:05:00.480> long

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
minutes which I know it's not a long

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.960 
minutes which I know it's not a long
time<00:05:01.050> but<00:05:01.470> and<00:05:01.680> conversely<00:05:02.280> with<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.610> Sephora

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
time but and conversely with the Sephora

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.390 
time but and conversely with the Sephora
wine<00:05:03.270> I<00:05:03.510> felt<00:05:03.810> like<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.500> should<00:05:04.530> not<00:05:05.100> have<00:05:05.250> done

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
wine I felt like it should not have done

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.880 
wine I felt like it should not have done
that<00:05:05.430> at<00:05:05.730> all<00:05:05.850> so<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.660> really<00:05:07.560> interesting

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
that at all so a really interesting

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.010 
that at all so a really interesting
product<00:05:08.550> do<00:05:08.820> you<00:05:08.910> need<00:05:09.270> these<00:05:09.480> in<00:05:09.690> your<00:05:09.810> lives

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
product do you need these in your lives

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.140 
product do you need these in your lives
not<00:05:10.410> necessarily<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:11.190> think<00:05:11.460> regular<00:05:11.640> lip

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
not necessarily I think regular lip

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.940 
not necessarily I think regular lip
liners<00:05:12.510> are<00:05:12.690> really<00:05:12.900> great<00:05:13.140> but<00:05:13.680> if<00:05:13.800> you

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
liners are really great but if you

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.620 
liners are really great but if you
wanted<00:05:14.220> to<00:05:14.340> have<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.520> universal<00:05:15.180> one<00:05:15.300> just<00:05:15.540> to

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
wanted to have a universal one just to

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.930 
wanted to have a universal one just to
