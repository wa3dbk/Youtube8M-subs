changed<00:01:21.530> these<00:01:21.650> since<00:01:21.950> like<00:01:22.130> two<00:01:22.400> or<00:01:22.850> three

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
changed these since like two or three

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.520 
changed these since like two or three
setup<00:01:23.270> videos<00:01:23.540> ago<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.050> these<00:01:24.230> are<00:01:24.350> just<00:01:24.410> the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
setup videos ago so these are just the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.860 
setup videos ago so these are just the
standard<00:01:24.770> Thunder<00:01:25.430> highs<00:01:25.610> I<00:01:26.120> used<00:01:26.690> to<00:01:26.780> have

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
standard Thunder highs I used to have

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.320 
standard Thunder highs I used to have
thunder<00:01:27.170> hollow<00:01:27.380> lights<00:01:27.740> but<00:01:28.700> these<00:01:28.820> are<00:01:29.210> not

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
thunder hollow lights but these are not

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.300 
thunder hollow lights but these are not
hollow<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:30.740> don't<00:01:30.890> really<00:01:31.040> notice<00:01:31.130> a

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
hollow and I don't really notice a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.350 
hollow and I don't really notice a
difference<00:01:31.340> on<00:01:31.700> this<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:31.940> there<00:01:32.090> may<00:01:32.210> be<00:01:32.240> a

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
difference on this so there may be a

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.840 
difference on this so there may be a
little<00:01:32.690> heavier<00:01:32.960> but<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:34.340> main<00:01:34.490> thing<00:01:34.670> that<00:01:34.700> I

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
little heavier but the main thing that I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.850 
little heavier but the main thing that I
noticed<00:01:35.150> is<00:01:35.300> that<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:35.810> switched<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.170> highs<00:01:36.320> so

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
noticed is that I switched the highs so

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.170 
noticed is that I switched the highs so
obviously<00:01:37.370> my<00:01:37.520> board<00:01:37.729> is<00:01:37.790> going<00:01:37.910> to<00:01:37.970> be<00:01:38.030> higher

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
obviously my board is going to be higher

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.430 
obviously my board is going to be higher
from<00:01:38.300> the<00:01:38.420> ground<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.840> don't<00:01:39.050> get<00:01:39.170> really

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
from the ground and I don't get really

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.120 
from the ground and I don't get really
so<00:01:39.620> that<00:01:39.770> rocks<00:01:40.330> wheels<00:01:41.330> funny<00:01:42.320> story<00:01:42.619> George
