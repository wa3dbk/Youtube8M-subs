00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.560
 everyone today I'm doing the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.560
 review of frankenstein version scotchant 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.269
 so for starters I show you the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.519
 difference between the American box and 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.900
 the European box 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.490
 so at the level of the facade we have the logo 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.490
 so the same on each side 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.880
 pichon 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.750
 this level so logo 14 logos here the 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.240
 american version 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.730
 it is indicated and of course the version 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.960
 open they removed the title just have 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.989
 keep drawing 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.020
 otherwise the drawing of francs which remains the 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.780
 same as it's the same place here it is 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:03.579
 there is no change because if not at 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.140
 level of the back of the box one has a 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.650
 very little difference 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.740
 the american version ahl bio text 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.130
 this bio bio bio monster and there we did not 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.270
 not in the American version we have a 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.270
 francky text 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.189
 and in the European version 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.520
 we have several languages ​​so there is no 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:34.149
 the place of all m and we do not have 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.219
 francky's text instead we have seven 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.219
 it gives me goosebumps that's all 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.659
 we 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.990
 one has this little text and more 10 island 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.350
 crips of color night out of me so 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.619
 this he removed me all colors but 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.430
 darmayan we know the differences between 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.159
 the two boxes 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.789
 now i'm going to d box is the version 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.110
 European for the shown closer 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.190
 so 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.190
 if boxes and 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.300
 so 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.550
 we can see that she is all black 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.550
 and white no color 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.720
 actually it's like version 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.300
 francky basic one that was out in 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.940
 2010 so they 'll have you made a 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.970
 black and white edition bonk comicon 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.620
 san diego on the other hand so not possible 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.620
 to find it elsewhere than there 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.320
 so 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.420
 very happy version of this nightmare of 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.069
 francky so a black and white version 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.709
 to start 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.200
 sure and it's a square I'm squared 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.609
 with one side further right side more 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.609
 long as the left side 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.330
 always 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.330
 with black and white locks 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.090
 so at level 2 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.900
 so we have a bagri makeup like 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.750
 it's black and white 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.709
 there is not much choice the red 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.709
 lipstick and gray 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.099
 we always have 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.099
 ball-shaped earrings 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.980
 very healthy 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.980
 made 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.659
 then we do not have 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.330
 around the neck on the other hand a bracelet 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.690
 all saints here a little transparent form 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.690
 costs 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.900
 so 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.220
 in a swimsuit 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:49.500
 a one-piece bikini with a 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.190
 a ring in the center 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.680
 she has a little 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.780
 réau over here that can remove 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.420
 modes 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.569
 it's clouds 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.980
 with lightning 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.959
 all silver 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.959
 in the same thing above 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.170
 so it concerns 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.540
 it's a thing 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.290
 / - are quite simple as it is at the 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.810
 beach but she is so form 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:33.540
 discover the front is the same 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.350
 written by often done 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.670
 here is the review is super fast this 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.890
 which does not have many elements 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.110
 this doll she is simple but she 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.450
 is very pretty I really like 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.160
 this version 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.870
 we have no 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.170
 card as in other versions 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.900
 school strength like the laguna map 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.490
 for example or that of rupture which 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.640
 is a pity a little black card and 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.010
 very cool white we do not have a brush no 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.100
 more it's all the time the excluded 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.690
 toys'r'us there is never a brush or 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.810
 sorges still missing elements 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.910
 good there we have a base anyway 7 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.300
 minimum actually this is no brush 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.150
 it's a shame but good considering the price 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.130
 it's a bit normal I had it at 15 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.540
 euros and some at launch it's 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.810
 really cheap for a doll my 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:28.470

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.240
