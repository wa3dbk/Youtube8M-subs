00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.850
 We will have to accept accepting 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.850

 A) Yes 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.850

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.259
 questions and answers if we do not know 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.590

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.400
 zip code I think that 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:23.930
 so phone to enter a number 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.930
 first touch the phone code 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:31.430
 so here we will put 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.060
 the prefix that is like the three numbers 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.060
 initials 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.650
 the initial number we have 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.540
 this 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:52.860
 so we put the number 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:52.860
 which is my number number that I'm going to put 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.270

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.170

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.520
 the code our zip code should 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.520
 have 5 discs 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:26.229
 there is an email sent 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:29.229

 here he asks me to introduce the idea to 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:07:02.060
 download my application and so we will 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.630
