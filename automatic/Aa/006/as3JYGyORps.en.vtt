00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.029 
shelter management this whole thing
sounds<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:24.509> page<00:01:24.750> from<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.110> spy<00:01:25.409> novel<00:01:25.679> and

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
sounds like a page from a spy novel and

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.649 
sounds like a page from a spy novel and
the<00:01:26.220> government<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.179> construct<00:01:27.569> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the government can construct the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.109 
the government can construct the
facility<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.289> this<00:01:28.409> size<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:29.130> plain<00:01:29.399> sight<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
facility of this size in plain sight and

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.540 
facility of this size in plain sight and
that<00:01:30.450> would<00:01:30.569> be<00:01:30.659> completely<00:01:31.009> covered<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.280> I

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
that would be completely covered up I

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.850 
that would be completely covered up I
guess<00:01:33.360> there's<00:01:33.569> a<00:01:33.659> possibility<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
guess there's a possibility that and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.999 
guess there's a possibility that and
Dulce<00:01:35.550> New<00:01:35.670> Mexico<00:01:36.440> something<00:01:37.440> similar<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:37.979> a

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
much larger scale to happen even it's in

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:40.870 
much larger scale to happen even it's in
the<00:01:40.050> middle<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.319> nowhere

facility is 112 thousand square feet and
based<00:02:41.170> on<00:02:41.290> what<00:02:41.470> we<00:02:41.500> learned<00:02:41.770> about<00:02:41.890> the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
based on what we learned about the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.770 
based on what we learned about the
secret<00:02:42.430> base<00:02:42.580> in<00:02:42.610> Dulce<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.390> some

secret base in Dulce and some

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.480 
secret base in Dulce and some
calculations<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.620> did<00:02:44.830> actually<00:02:45.100> learned

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
calculations that I did actually learned

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.030 
calculations that I did actually learned
that<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.700> could<00:02:45.820> be<00:02:45.910> over<00:02:46.350> 3,000<00:02:47.350> times<00:02:47.800> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
that it could be over 3,000 times the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.340 
that it could be over 3,000 times the
size<00:02:48.250> of<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.880> facility<00:02:49.330> at<00:02:49.390> Greenbrier<00:02:49.720> we<00:02:50.230> know

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
size of a facility at Greenbrier we know

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.020 
size of a facility at Greenbrier we know
the<00:02:50.470> Greenbrier<00:02:50.920> took<00:02:51.190> three<00:02:51.550> years<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.910> build

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
the Greenbrier took three years to build

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.270 
the Greenbrier took three years to build
so<00:02:52.630> we<00:02:52.720> could<00:02:52.840> have<00:02:52.930> taken<00:02:53.080> ten<00:02:53.590> years<00:02:53.620> decades

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
so we could have taken ten years decades

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.430 
so we could have taken ten years decades
to<00:02:54.730> construct<00:02:55.180> any<00:02:55.420> kind<00:02:55.690> of<00:02:55.750> face<00:02:55.930> at<00:02:56.110> Dulce

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
to construct any kind of face at Dulce

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.050 
to construct any kind of face at Dulce
and<00:02:56.590> there's<00:02:57.040> not<00:02:57.160> even<00:02:57.190> any<00:02:57.490> evidence<00:02:57.580> that

and there's not even any evidence that
it<00:02:58.150> was<00:02:58.209> ever<00:02:58.270> built<00:02:58.720> in<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.840> first<00:02:59.050> place<00:03:00.420> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
it was ever built in the first place the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.870 
it was ever built in the first place the
people<00:03:01.630> who<00:03:01.959> built<00:03:02.320> Dulce<00:03:02.890> could<00:03:03.610> have<00:03:03.700> built

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
people who built Dulce could have built

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.640 
people who built Dulce could have built
it<00:03:04.030> for<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.240> variety<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.930> reasons<00:03:05.440> with<00:03:05.620> a

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.020 
building it on reservation land
nobody's<00:03:11.200> gonna<00:03:11.350> question<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.430> even<00:03:12.910> if
