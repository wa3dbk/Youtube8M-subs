00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
exact duplicate carb debt and this float

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.370 
exact duplicate carb debt and this float
ball<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.519> taken<00:01:05.670> off<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.689> float<00:01:06.990> bowl<00:01:07.170> is

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
ball is taken off this float bowl is

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.560 
ball is taken off this float bowl is
full<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.159> varnish<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
full of varnish as you can see it's a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.310 
full of varnish as you can see it's a
sprout<00:01:09.900> gunky<00:01:10.409> crap<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.049> see<00:01:13.229> the

sprout gunky crap and you can see the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.960 
sprout gunky crap and you can see the
float<00:01:14.360> exact<00:01:15.360> duplicate<00:01:16.520> from<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.939> I

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
float exact duplicate from the one I

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.560 
float exact duplicate from the one I
take<00:01:18.210> apart<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.439> moves<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.040> down

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
take apart and it moves up and down

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.500 
take apart and it moves up and down
and<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> pan<00:01:22.800> that<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.980> take<00:01:23.250> out

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
and this is the pan that you take out

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.900 
and this is the pan that you take out
you<00:01:24.510> slide<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.930> pin<00:01:25.140> out<00:01:25.460> when<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> take<00:01:26.730> the

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
you slide this pin out when you take the

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.050 
you slide this pin out when you take the
float<00:01:27.120> off<00:01:28.220> okay<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.400> very<00:01:29.610> careful<00:01:29.910> not<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
float off okay be very careful not to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.030 
float off okay be very careful not to
bend<00:01:30.330> any<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:31.080> this<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.680> float<00:01:31.890> is

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
bend any of this because the float is

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.220 
bend any of this because the float is
set<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.400> certain<00:01:32.670> height<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.810> go<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.050> and

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
set at a certain height to go up and

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.010 
set at a certain height to go up and
down<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.470> don't<00:01:34.650> want<00:01:34.770> too<00:01:34.890> high<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.130> too<00:01:35.220> low

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
pilot is here these are after their left

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.130 
pilot is here these are after their left
or<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.890> year<00:02:05.580> they<00:02:06.180> tend<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.540> get<00:02:06.630> clogged<00:02:06.930> up

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
or a year they tend to get clogged up

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.230 
or a year they tend to get clogged up
with<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.440> nice<00:02:07.710> little<00:02:07.770> varnished<00:02:08.399> crap<00:02:08.700> as

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
with this nice little varnished crap as

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.400 
with this nice little varnished crap as
you<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.570> see<00:02:10.310> so<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.640> use<00:02:12.630> um<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:14.989> really<00:02:15.989> good

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
you can see so you use um a really good

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.020 
you can see so you use um a really good
screwdriver<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.040> take<00:02:17.160> these<00:02:17.340> out<00:02:17.580> okay

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
screwdriver to take these out okay

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.750 
screwdriver to take these out okay
they're<00:02:18.360> made<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.660> brass<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.170> they<00:02:19.320> can<00:02:19.760> make

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
they're made of brass and they can make

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.820 
they're made of brass and they can make
it<00:02:20.940> now
