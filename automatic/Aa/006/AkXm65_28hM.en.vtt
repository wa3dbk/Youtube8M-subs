00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.580
 succeeded about two years ago for this 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.290
 song if there are several versions on 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.840
 internet and searching among the easiest and 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.210
 even among the most handy ones I have 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.360
 found a version that is approaching by 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.700
 more precisely to the original version 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.410
 let's start immediately with the introduction first 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.720
 he seems oblivious but I wanted to 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.809
 advertising a channel is called 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.179

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.260
 of friends who make videos 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.300
 really funny anti originals 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.519
 I really recommend you give 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.379
 look at their channel because i am 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.780
 I often enjoy going into 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.670
 the latter and watch their videos 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.230
 in the introduction the agreements are 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.300
 simply 3 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.180
 we have the greatest yes that is done 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.670
 putting the index all over again in the 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.560
 second button and with other companies 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.869
 instead we will do the major then 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.909
 we will press the short button with the little finger 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.790
 of the second rope with the ring finger the 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.860
 short key of the third string and with the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.570
 half the fourth key of the fourth string 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.570
 and we all play if the strings 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.500
 this they greater 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.490
 the second chord is a minor sharp fa 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.670
 the fa minor minor just leave 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.460
 the index here and press with medium ring finger 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.570
 or nothing in the videos the fourth key of the 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.570
 fourth and fifth string 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.560
 the third and last agreement instead the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.140
 the more I get older we have to do it 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.060
 by pressing the first key with the index 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.640
 of the third string with the ring finger 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.700
 we will press the second button of the fourth 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.990
 rope and with the medium instead the second 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.990
 step of the fifth string 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.649
 now how could you have noticed the agreements 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.590
 they are simply 3 while the song 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.130
 a four quarters so we'll do two 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.920
 beats of the major yes 1 of the F sharp 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.400
 minor is one of the major the picking 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.400
 it's this one 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.390
 these agreements will be repeated both 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.540
 in the verse that in the refrain since 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.940
 just the song in the other action 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.750
 refrain page uses these three 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.120
 agreements 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.000
 let's move on to the variation in the 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.550
 variation instead we find the C sharp 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.430
 minor that is done by putting the index 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.290
 again button in the fourth button and with le 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.420
 other companies we have to make a minor 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.300
 so with the middle we will press the fifth 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.570
 second string button and then 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.010
 ring and little finger the sixth key of the 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.010
 third and fourth string 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:26.510
 the second agreement they make is greater 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.510
 minor sharp 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.350
 having been born is this 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.960
 so this is the series of agreements that 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.300
 will be repeated in the variation but 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.760
 attention last time then 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.500
 in the last sentence of the variation 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.290
 when we do minor sharp yes 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.390
 major does shar minor from the fantasies 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.610
 minor we will have to move on to renewal 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.610
 years older then 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:19.269
 from here if you know the song well yes 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:23.139
 then returns to the refrain from 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:26.380
 here now we pass to the final when 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.870
 precisely the agreements change we find the 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.389
 which is done by pressing with three fingers 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.770
 then from the index to the ring finger or from the 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.050
 medium to little finger 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.680
 the second key of the second third e 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.680
 fourth string 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.250
 the second agreement is greater 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.900
 and then yes greater 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
 then 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.990
 obviously it repeats itself twice if 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.180
 you know the song well, of course 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.700
 in the last part you will always have to 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.550
 slow down a few more notes 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.490
 song is about to end as it says this 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:21.980
 slow down of the tutorial time 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.980
 of today ends here and the next video
