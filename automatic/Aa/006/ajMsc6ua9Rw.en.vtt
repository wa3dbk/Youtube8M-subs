sound<00:04:08.219> with<00:04:08.370> plastic<00:04:08.819> plastic<00:04:09.629> is<00:04:10.139> pretty

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
sound with plastic plastic is pretty

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.180 
sound with plastic plastic is pretty
much<00:04:10.500> just<00:04:10.620> like<00:04:10.739> a<00:04:10.799> muffler<00:04:11.219> I<00:04:11.810> just<00:04:12.810> think

three part video today hopefully I can
get<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.150> new<00:04:38.380> couplet<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:39.590> driveline

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
get the new couplet and driveline

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.040 
get the new couplet and driveline
tonight<00:04:40.729> and<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.180> will<00:04:41.330> have<00:04:41.479> it<00:04:41.660> everything

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
tonight and I will have it everything

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.840 
tonight and I will have it everything
back<00:04:42.229> together<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:42.800> I<00:04:43.009> will<00:04:43.250> get<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.610> footage

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
back together and I will get the footage

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.320 
back together and I will get the footage
tonight<00:04:44.650> if<00:04:45.650> it's<00:04:46.160> not<00:04:46.430> too<00:04:46.610> dark<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:47.150> not

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
now so a lot of videos up so with Josh

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.570 
now so a lot of videos up so with Josh
one<00:04:59.840> of<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.020> on<00:05:00.259> the<00:05:00.380> men<00:05:00.530> even<00:05:00.770> in<00:05:01.099> this<00:05:01.220> video

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
one of the on the men even in this video

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.779 
one of the on the men even in this video
is<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.330> have<00:05:02.720> a<00:05:02.750> vantage<00:05:03.139> peak<00:05:04.070> racing<00:05:04.520> motor

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
is I have a vantage peak racing motor

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.499 
is I have a vantage peak racing motor
it's<00:05:05.030> brand-new<00:05:05.690> never<00:05:06.020> used<00:05:06.199> I<00:05:07.270> picked<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.419> up

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
it's brand-new never used I picked it up

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.339 
it's brand-new never used I picked it up
for<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:09.160> Tamiya<00:05:10.160> but<00:05:11.120> I<00:05:11.419> decided<00:05:11.870> to<00:05:12.080> do

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
for the Tamiya but I decided to do

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.730 
for the Tamiya but I decided to do
brushless<00:05:12.620> instead<00:05:13.280> of<00:05:13.820> this<00:05:14.449> so<00:05:14.960> it's<00:05:15.680> a

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
brushless instead of this so it's a

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.950 
brushless instead of this so it's a
brand<00:05:16.009> new<00:05:16.099> i<00:05:16.490> pays<00:05:16.759> it<00:05:16.910> out<00:05:17.000> for<00:05:17.180> 90<00:05:17.479> bucks<00:05:17.509> so

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
brand new i pays it out for 90 bucks so

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.040 
brand new i pays it out for 90 bucks so
salt<00:05:18.260> for<00:05:18.470> 50<00:05:19.000> if<00:05:20.000> anyone's<00:05:20.360> interested<00:05:20.539> let

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
salt for 50 if anyone's interested let

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.879 
salt for 50 if anyone's interested let
me<00:05:21.169> know<00:05:21.320> it<00:05:21.530> comes<00:05:21.770> with<00:05:21.949> the<00:05:22.159> manual<00:05:23.889> I'll

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
a brushless esc as you might think it is

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.909 
a brushless esc as you might think it is
from<00:05:52.250> only<00:05:52.490> the<00:05:52.610> 3<00:05:52.849> LS<00:05:53.000> it's<00:05:53.330> not<00:05:53.539> so<00:05:54.470> don't<00:05:54.710> you

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
just run a brushless motor you'll blow

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.770 
just run a brushless motor you'll blow
up<00:05:56.509> the<00:05:56.659> LLL<00:05:56.840> blow<00:05:57.139> of<00:05:57.320> the<00:05:57.440> SC<00:05:58.509> so<00:05:59.509> yeah<00:05:59.630> this

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
up the LLL blow of the SC so yeah this

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.480 
up the LLL blow of the SC so yeah this
will<00:05:59.960> sell<00:06:00.199> for<00:06:01.210> 35<00:06:02.210> bucks<00:06:02.419> if<00:06:03.259> you<00:06:03.740> want<00:06:03.889> but

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
running get up soon of the MT - the

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.359 
running get up soon of the MT - the
brushless<00:06:18.659> hopefully<00:06:19.349> I<00:06:19.379> can<00:06:19.469> get<00:06:19.769> soon<00:06:20.039> for

00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:20.369 
brushless hopefully I can get soon for

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:24.289 
brushless hopefully I can get soon for
the<00:06:21.709> media<00:06:22.709> I<00:06:22.769> just<00:06:22.979> have<00:06:23.129> to<00:06:23.309> sell<00:06:23.729> these<00:06:23.909> so<00:06:24.239> I

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:24.299 
the media I just have to sell these so I

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:27.949 
the media I just have to sell these so I
can<00:06:24.989> get<00:06:25.549> the<00:06:26.549> sliders<00:06:26.969> also<00:06:27.360> comes<00:06:27.599> with<00:06:27.719> the

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:27.959 
can get the sliders also comes with the

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:30.709 
can get the sliders also comes with the
ESC<00:06:28.319> also<00:06:28.559> comes<00:06:28.769> with<00:06:28.889> the<00:06:29.189> manual<00:06:29.699> so<00:06:30.599> yeah

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:30.719
