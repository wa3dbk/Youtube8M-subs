00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.280
 hello to all in this video i'm going 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.590
 present you a montage of cameras 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.700
 for indicative and I will thank 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.600
 a promoted who take me for that I 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.980
 can make this video this crash 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.990
 is made by Swiss put the 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.130
 distribute by cybergun and for the tariff 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.779
 we are at 36 euros 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.070
 that's the price at the time of shooting 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.990
 on the site crapahute for the packaging 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.670
 we have something very simple a bag 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.860
 made of plastic on a plate made of 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.500
 cardboard on it you will have the logo 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.190
 from the manufacturer that of the distributor his 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.350
 address 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.670
 and then the name of the accessory you 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.050
 do not have assembly instructions for 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.470
 the information that's a little bit 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.809
 pity 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.790
 a small scheme even success would not be 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.280
 badly then for the constitution of the pack 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.110
 you have the installation board a 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.820
 rubber stamp and then for the 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.980
 clamping for fixing a device 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.960
 video you have a metal plate and 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.370
 then a small screw to install this 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.780
 accessory on a replica it will take 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.879
 simply that they are equipped with 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.810
 interface rails for mounting this is 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.850
 really easy 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.100
 you have a stirrup so it's really 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.140
 standard you high schools a little 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.690
 hand wheel you have a jaw 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.819
 that they loosen you place on your 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.470
 interface role and you will tighten if 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:20.479
 you want to adjust the tightening you have 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.860
 four holes in the small knob so 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.080
 there you can use a little rod 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.450
 to leverage to squeeze like you 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.310
 so want it after positioning 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.140
 down there it's going to be following the equipment 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.630
 that you have installed on this board 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.220
 editing with your videos 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.569
 also you will be able to really 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.539
 in every sense so that's 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:43.700
 really handy on this device 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.590
 you will be able to adapt any 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.720
 what kind of camera shots 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.940
 cameras or camcorders or 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.619
 so sports cameras for them 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.330
 cameras and camcorders though 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.399
 often you will already have the screw of 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.080
 fixation that will be inserted in body 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.759
 of the device itself class with 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.349
 very easy no need to add 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.390
 something to be directly 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.310
 installed your device on the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.720
 device for sports cameras 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.920
 it's a little more complex than 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.840
 those following the manufacturers you will not have 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.250
 not necessarily the little adapter that 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.230
 will be provided in the starting pack so 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.480
 it will be up to you to buy it more or 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.010
 then to make it for the bo pro it 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.510
 I'll have to get it myself 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.760
 personally I had made myself 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.340
 a device that will be compatible 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.780
 with a small metal plate on 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.040
 which I had installed one of 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.450
 self-adhesive decks so it's me 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.129
 served for something else finally that 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.750
 can also serve for that so there 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.110
 down just simply fix 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.420
 this little adapter on the device in 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.659
 himself and then once it's done 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.200
 after becoming clip and the gopro 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:44.030
 directly on the device 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.950
 and there is the bo that is ready to be 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.180
 used we can put that in all 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.540
 sense there on there really is no 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.359
 worry 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.310
 and then with the provision so of the 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:55.719
 platinum on the replica we can really 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.719
 do any kind of shooting 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.120
 for this accessory I have an opinion that 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.530
 is most positive we have something 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.239
 who is very well finished who is well 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.370
 design and for the weight I have not 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.599
 spoke 77 grams so it's not okay 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.090
 unbalance the reply 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.920
 if in addition very versatile you can 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.409
 as well installed the cameras of 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.849
 sport like the gopro that devices 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.489
 more conventional like camcorders 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.500
 or so cameras that's it 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.299
 something that all the accessories 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.799
 of fixation do not very often they 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.340
 are really specific to a type 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.260
 device 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.209
 this one he really has this more 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.370
 to be versatile so that's for the 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.410
 presentation of this accessory a 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.100
 mounting cameras for alpiq a tiny 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.720
