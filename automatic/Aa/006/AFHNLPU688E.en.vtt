00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
not all that bad you see a load detail

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.550 
not all that bad you see a load detail
okay<00:03:32.570> and<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.690> do<00:03:33.810> want<00:03:34.020> to<00:03:34.080> make<00:03:34.200> sure<00:03:34.410> that

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560

and<00:03:42.620> 1080<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.800> think<00:03:45.830> if<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:47.070> don't<00:03:47.220> do<00:03:47.460> that

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
and 1080 I think if you don't do that

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.520 
and 1080 I think if you don't do that
it'll<00:03:47.910> have<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.300> black<00:03:48.510> screen<00:03:48.960> just<00:03:49.290> like

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
it'll have the black screen just like

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.310 
it'll have the black screen just like
with<00:03:49.770> PlayStation<00:03:50.610> games<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.900> now<00:03:55.020> that<00:03:55.080> we're

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
with PlayStation games so now that we're

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.260 
with PlayStation games so now that we're
into<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.770> game<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.370> can<00:03:56.880> only<00:03:57.030> use<00:03:57.240> the

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
into the game I can only use the

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.150 
into the game I can only use the
controller<00:03:57.840> now<00:03:58.080> it<00:03:58.260> thinks<00:03:58.410> that<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.740> has<00:03:58.950> an

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
controller now it thinks that it has an

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.260 
controller now it thinks that it has an
Xbox<00:03:59.550> controller<00:03:59.670> plugged<00:04:00.360> in<00:04:01.460> this<00:04:02.460> no

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
Xbox controller plugged in this no

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:24.720 
Xbox controller plugged in this no
longer<00:04:03.480> works

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:32.180 

okay

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.770 

now<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.250> little<00:04:33.580> time<00:04:33.849> here<00:04:34.150> is<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.360> little

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
now the little time here is a little

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.529 
now the little time here is a little
long<00:04:34.990> but<00:04:35.949> do<00:04:36.310> remember<00:04:36.340> it's<00:04:36.879> playing<00:04:37.150> off<00:04:37.389> an

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
long but do remember it's playing off an

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.010 
long but do remember it's playing off an
SD<00:04:37.930> card<00:04:38.190> which<00:04:39.190> leaves<00:04:39.520> your<00:04:39.819> hard<00:04:40.210> drive<00:04:40.569> in

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
SD card which leaves your hard drive in

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:53.969 
SD card which leaves your hard drive in
the<00:04:41.319> device<00:04:41.650> full<00:04:43.319> or<00:04:44.610> free<00:04:45.610> I<00:04:45.639> suppose

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:30.940 

okay

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.360 

so<00:05:33.020> yeah<00:05:34.020> that's<00:05:34.260> pretty<00:05:34.380> much<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.950> gist<00:05:35.130> of

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
so yeah that's pretty much the gist of

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.000 
so yeah that's pretty much the gist of
it<00:05:35.490> it<00:05:35.610> works<00:05:35.760> pretty<00:05:35.940> well<00:05:36.680> you<00:05:37.680> can<00:05:37.800> see<00:05:37.980> it

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
it it works pretty well you can see it

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:44.500 
it it works pretty well you can see it
looks<00:05:38.220> rather<00:05:38.730> nice<00:05:39.860> look<00:05:40.860> at<00:05:41.010> this<00:05:41.160> guy<00:05:41.370> and

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.490 

as<00:05:45.510> you<00:05:45.660> can<00:05:45.780> see<00:05:45.960> using<00:05:46.230> the<00:05:46.530> controller<00:05:47.270> and

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
as you can see using the controller and

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.080 
as you can see using the controller and
I<00:05:49.500> can<00:05:49.830> make<00:05:50.220> a<00:05:50.250> new<00:05:50.490> save<00:05:50.760> if<00:05:50.910> I<00:05:51.060> want<00:05:51.270> to<00:05:53.090> easy

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
I can make a new save if I want to easy

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:05.210 
I can make a new save if I want to easy
as<00:05:54.360> that<00:06:00.620> that's<00:06:01.620> it<00:06:02.120> all<00:06:03.120> right
