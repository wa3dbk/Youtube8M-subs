00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
have adjustable strap on only thing I

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.949 
have adjustable strap on only thing I
think<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:22.489> too<00:02:22.819> thin<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.420> wish<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.870> was

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
think it's too thin I wish it was

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.229 
think it's too thin I wish it was
thicker<00:02:24.370> if<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.489> was<00:02:25.610> thicker<00:02:25.849> would<00:02:26.150> have

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
thicker if it was thicker would have

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.289 
thicker if it was thicker would have
been<00:02:26.360> better<00:02:26.599> so<00:02:27.140> it's<00:02:27.349> very<00:02:28.040> lightweight<00:02:28.400> but
