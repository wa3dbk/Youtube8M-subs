00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.680
 hello friends how are we good as you 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.380
 I said yesterday in the in the video games and 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.140
 Free applications many web pages 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.060
 they were putting that siri predicts the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.830
 end of the good world because it predicts the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.500
 end of the world if we ask siri 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.960
 what will happen or what day is the 27th of 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.120
 July will answer us that they open 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.820
 the gates of hell let's try 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.820
 what day is July 27 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.030
 It will be Sunday July 27, 2014 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.760
 opening of the gates of hell 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.699
 Well tell us this because it has a 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.100
 religious explanation and is due to cause 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.049
 of Ramadan 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.689
 Ramadan is a sacred month for 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.549
 Muslims because during this time 

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:03.820
 devote to the daily fast is not 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.979
 allowed to drink or have sex 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.780
 during the day according to the 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.580
 belief the last day of the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.950
 celebrations when it starts to open 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.190
 again the gates of hell already 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.100
 close paradise and that's why they give 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.369
 this name now if we ask 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.950
 siri what day falls or what day is 3 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.869
 September will answer us that 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.770
 they close the doors of hell we are going to 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:32.350
 try out 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.350
 what day is September 3 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.150
 will be Wednesday, September 13, 2014 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.310
 close the gates of hell as 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.620
 we can see then all this is due to a 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.900
 religious belief and you can go and be 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.090
 adapts very well to all these things well 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.470
 What good friends, my only one 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.180
 recommendation in this case then is that 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.220
 play more consider since you already know 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.619
 that has a lot of weird things too 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.530
 this as a little informative note 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.960
 we just summarized the video of 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.670
 the rover tank since all these 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.979
 youtube policies and all this that we 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.770
 is bringing crazy media to some 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.500
 I had to summarize the video because I 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.060
 they gave out a notification has me 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.610
 nothing more than this time for me 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.739
 I said nothing more for me copyright 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.230
 they said that I had to go down directly 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.120
 the video had to be summarized without the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.520
 faults that according to them had a 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.100
 song but it does not have copyright is what 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.020
 weirder but good and I 'm going to take 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.819
 a lot of fighting with youtube so 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.590
 directly it down and returned to 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.870
