00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.600
 the ingredients and materials that we go 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.510
 to use are these men 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:33.020
 how 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:33.020
 a little bottom with a mold 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.670
 butter to put the mold 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.340
 The first thing we are going to do is take 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.340
 the whys 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.580
 very well 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.340
 the next step is to hydrate our 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.560
 our coconut fit in your case if you use 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.350
 chocolate can melt only one 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.020
 little nothing more if it is that as it remains 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.850
 very liquid you throw more like powder 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.420
 for example my very liquid mixture 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.820
 too much and can lower more 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.119
 we are going to use around a cup and 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.119
 half 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.760
 the next thing is to put our mix of 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.760
 chocolate 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.560
 our 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.200
 with cheese 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.200
 with the help of a spatula on the head 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.320
 the musician we are going to take everything 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.310
 This does not leave anything normal with what you 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.720
 tell the doctor to keep me in the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.140
 comments how is it that they tell us the 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.140
 doctor 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:20.480
 22 The word that I tell you is because 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:22.920
 there are not so many comments are super 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.390
 Super good 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.390
 so everyone knows 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.950
 I'm not going to be giving back is that 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.990
 as it does not integrate then what 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:39.190
 let's use is our little hands 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.190
 three creative handyman 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.410
 we clean 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.810
 it feels something like more bland plus area 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.840
 super good, we're almost going to end up if 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.040
 you see that like the spa is missing 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.880
 a little more chocolate were made 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.800
 as you go look and calculate 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.220
 as I did in the in the name this video 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.510
 this is a recipe without a oven because I 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.970
 I know that you love the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.190
 recipes without microwave ovens and nothing 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:28.990
 those things just some to a refrigerator 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.990
 good they had created goods 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.630
 and we go with the next step 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:43.170
 and finally, what we are going to do 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:46.370
 is to pass our container mix in 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.370
 which we did 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.120
 the mold that has previously been 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.290
 you want you can also use paper 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.310
 waxed it seems easier to me only that 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.590
 I found 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.590
 good to defer superbien 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.910
 it does not matter if it's too short 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.240
 you can not be seeing percent you 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:16.190
 you can do more you can duplicate the 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.190
 quantities of each ingredient 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.420
 he wants to postpone so that 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.960
 same 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:41.420
 and let's do our mild 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.330
 as for two hours but as not 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:47.700
 I also follow the recipe to work all the 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.800
 night and good to die 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.570
