00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.510
 if a real boy 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.760
 60 years ago the incredible pinocho ribbon 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.980
 he taught us that when we asked him for a 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.380
 I wish to a star the dreams are 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:23.060
 can become reality and the man that 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.980
 he dreamed it was walt disney in 1937 world 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.349
 he created something that nobody had ever seen 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.480
 before the first long movie 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.849
 animated duration snow white and 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.130
 seven dwarfs surprised the public of 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.530
 however everyone had words 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.179
 now a problem to do next 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.340
 people in the movie business 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:42.710
 They asked to repeat the formula give 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.960
 more dwarves said but walt disney was 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.519
 too original to do that in your 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.410
 place found a story in a 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.820
 serial magazine the story of a puppet 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.820
 I wanted to be a real boy 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.270
 the blue fairy gave him life with a touch of 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.640
 your magic wand what is progress 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.540
 but creating an imaginary world was a lot 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.540
 more complicated 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.960
 the production of pinocho lasted more than two 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.420
 years and it required more than 700 artists and 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.310
 technical many new techniques were 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.080
 developed during the creation of 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.810
 pinocho while cartoonists 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.850
 they faced new challenges by 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.810
 example how to create the effect of being 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.700
 underwater the solution was to use 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.259
 a piece of corrugated glass over the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.940
 animation cells creating the effect 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.940
 wavy inside the water 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.860
 in fact the underwater sequences in 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.810
 pinocho established a new style of 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.580
 production that gave rise to many works 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.830
 teachers that would come later 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.350
 including the little mermaid 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.080
 in the imagination the world the world of 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.120
 the illusion was very real in insisting on 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.280
 that animation should imitate life 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.280
 above all the illusion had to be 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.619
 credible 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.690
 he had three-dimensional models of 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.430
 cucu and pinocho watches so that 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.549
 the artists could study their 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.549
 movements 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.190
 the model of the carriage was even 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.350
 provided with shock absorbers for 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.820
 make sure the character will jump with 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.820
 every pothole on the road 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.510
 besides the use of models they were 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.910
 one step further to draw the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.350
 characters studied their faces in front 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.670
 to mirrors so that they could 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.980
 capture an extensive range of expressions 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.959
 one of the key animators was word 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.550
 quimbo the director of animation of pepe 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.830
 cricket war disney was a great actor of 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.430
 soon he got up and let himself be carried away 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.280
 for the characters he took pinocho and 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.920
 the scene acted as described by the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.580
 we saw and our mouths were 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.860
 open 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.560
 Bolt was a great perfectionist he took 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.330
 12 different animators and 18 months for 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.930
 create a pinocho that obtained its 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.330
 approval in 8 but bolt knew that he 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.650
 it needed something more a faithful friend and 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.180
 counselor called me cricket nugget ring 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.700
 when word told me that I was a 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.590
 cricket charge I thought that will be easy 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.360
 I'll see what a journal looks like in truth and I 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.630
 I started to eliminate all the parts 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.390
 unpleasant those teeth 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.570
 and legs and arms and I followed him 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.160
 doing until I told myself that's fine 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.930
 pepegrillo became the first 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.420
 a long tradition of assistants from 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.490
 disney world like timothy sebastiÃ¡n and 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.070
 another very famous shine creek and mul 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.960
 arq through the good several years 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.030
 actors have lent their talents to the 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.770
 classic Disney ribbons for paper 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.130
 from pinocho world hired the actor 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.190
 infantil big and jones sometimes 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.040
 approached with a camera and photographed 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.320
 our nose , mouth and jaw while 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.630
 that we read the dialogues and so the 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.910
 animators could see how our nose 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.240
 behaved or how our mouths were 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.960
 moved with different words and tell me 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.450
 who are you with and will I tell you who you are 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.390
 in the case of pepe cricket trip edwards 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.810
 who made the voice had that 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.150
 personality had his way of speaking to him 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.670
 to pinocho 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.370
 is what you're going to tell him you can not go to 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.889
 theater is grateful to you it's just like 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.979
 next but you must go to school 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.560
 so we just draw in agreement 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:26.470
 to the voice and this became his 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.169
 personality was a fortunate union of 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:34.020
 visual design and sound of this 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.020
 friendly all without grace 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.439
 After 60 years Pinocchio continues 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.229
