00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
let's try that to account leaders we're

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.330 
let's try that to account leaders we're
going<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.450> push<00:02:11.810> leading<00:02:12.530> our<00:02:12.680> partner<00:02:13.069> back

out as you progress with this movement

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.140 
out as you progress with this movement
the<00:02:30.500> speed<00:02:30.860> will<00:02:31.070> actually<00:02:31.400> increase<00:02:31.700> and

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
the speed will actually increase and

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.330 
the speed will actually increase and
what<00:02:32.630> we're<00:02:32.780> looking<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.200> achieve<00:02:33.770> is<00:02:34.040> that

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
what we're looking to achieve is that

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.170 
what we're looking to achieve is that
flow<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.000> movement<00:02:36.130> continuous<00:02:37.130> as<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:38.000> go

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
flow of movement continuous as you go

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.170 
flow of movement continuous as you go
through<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:39.440> end<00:02:39.620> up<00:02:39.860> on<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.190> end<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:41.150> let's

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
through to end up on the end so let's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.660 
through to end up on the end so let's
try<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.660> nice<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:41.960> slowly<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:43.040> music<00:02:43.400> on<00:02:43.520> its

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
try it nice and slowly to music on its

00:02:43.670 --> 00:03:01.610 
try it nice and slowly to music on its
own

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.680
