00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
need of course is a mechanical pencil

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.379 
need of course is a mechanical pencil
now<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.769> can<00:00:11.130> find<00:00:11.370> these<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.519> virtually<00:00:12.269> any

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
now you can find these in virtually any

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.209 
now you can find these in virtually any
office<00:00:12.750> supply<00:00:13.019> store<00:00:13.320> but<00:00:13.950> what<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> would

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
office supply store but what I would

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.490 
office supply store but what I would
recommend<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:15.089> try<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.360> find<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.900> harder<00:00:16.260> lead

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
recommend is try to find a harder lead

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.750 
recommend is try to find a harder lead
the<00:00:16.890> reason<00:00:17.190> for<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.460> while<00:00:17.730> you're

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the reason for that is while you're

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.400 
the reason for that is while you're
drawing<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.300> pool<00:00:18.510> your<00:00:18.990> hands<00:00:19.170> going<00:00:19.320> to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
drawing the pool your hands going to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.050 
drawing the pool your hands going to
brush<00:00:19.560> over<00:00:19.680> areas<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.279> you've<00:00:20.369> previously

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
brush over areas that you've previously

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.849 
brush over areas that you've previously
drawn<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.930> you'll<00:00:22.529> get<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.680> lot<00:00:22.830> of

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
drawn on and you'll get a lot of

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.620 
drawn on and you'll get a lot of
smudging<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.850> if<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.000> have<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.150> harder<00:00:24.420> lead

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
smudging but if you have a harder lead

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.650 
smudging but if you have a harder lead
where's<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.289> left<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:27.330> next<00:00:27.539> thing

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
where's the left of that the next thing

this<00:01:04.199> type<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.470> circle<00:01:04.949> template<00:01:05.250> was

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
this type of circle template was

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.710 
this type of circle template was
designed<00:01:05.729> by<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.909> friend<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.390> they're<00:01:06.510> really

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
designed by a friend so they're really

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.170 
designed by a friend so they're really
hard<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> find<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:08.159> basically<00:01:08.340> what<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.880> is

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
hard to find and basically what it is is

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.490 
hard to find and basically what it is is
it's<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.420> series<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.810> different<00:01:10.049> circle

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
it's a series of different circle

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.929 
it's a series of different circle
attempt<00:01:10.830> templates<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.490> were<00:01:11.670> put<00:01:11.820> together

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
attempt templates that were put together

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.359 
attempt templates that were put together
on<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.590> find<00:01:13.830> these<00:01:13.950> various

on one but you can find these various

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.570 
on one but you can find these various
circle<00:01:14.700> templates<00:01:15.140> in<00:01:16.460> virtually<00:01:17.460> any

can find these anywhere these are what

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.539 
can find these anywhere these are what
many<00:01:26.970> people<00:01:27.119> use<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.860> design<00:01:29.520> of

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
many people use in the in the design of

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.850 
many people use in the in the design of
swimming<00:01:30.090> pools<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
swimming pools but if you can get a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.350 
swimming pools but if you can get a
mixture<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.520> circle<00:01:32.880> templates<00:01:33.240> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
mixture of the circle templates and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.120 
mixture of the circle templates and
these<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.290> come<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.590> some<00:01:34.710> amazing

going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> need<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.860> t-square<00:01:41.960> for<00:01:42.960> your

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
going to need a t-square for your

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.289 
going to need a t-square for your
drafting<00:01:43.439> table<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.030> get<00:01:45.270> a

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.920 

this<00:02:34.370> one's<00:02:34.580> made<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:34.910> Germany<00:02:35.300> it's<00:02:35.750> pretty

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
this one's made in Germany it's pretty

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.220 
this one's made in Germany it's pretty
old<00:02:36.080> but<00:02:36.860> basically<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:38.570> do<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.810> same<00:02:38.989> thing

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
old but basically you do the same thing

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.110 
old but basically you do the same thing
with<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:39.650> set<00:02:39.830> this<00:02:39.980> up<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.760> trace

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
with it you set this up and you trace

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.180 
with it you set this up and you trace
the<00:02:41.150> outline<00:02:41.989> of<00:02:42.230> your<00:02:42.320> swimming<00:02:42.709> pool<00:02:42.830> and

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
the outline of your swimming pool and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.100 
the outline of your swimming pool and
then<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.940> number<00:02:44.239> you<00:02:44.420> get<00:02:44.570> on<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.930> reading

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
then that number you get on the reading

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.400 
then that number you get on the reading
here<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:45.920> times<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.340> by<00:02:46.660> 64<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.260> gives

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
here you times that by 64 and it gives

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.700 
here you times that by 64 and it gives
you<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.620> exact<00:02:49.069> square<00:02:49.310> footage
