running record but I'm anticipating this

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.790 
running record but I'm anticipating this
game<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.239> be<00:02:09.270> better<00:02:09.599> than<00:02:09.899> black<00:02:10.319> ops<00:02:10.560> was

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.970 
game to be better than black ops was
then<00:02:11.520> model

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
then model

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.000 
then model
three<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:12.519> and<00:02:13.050> I'm<00:02:14.050> expecting<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.830> be<00:02:14.860> the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
three is and I'm expecting it to be the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.140 
three is and I'm expecting it to be the
new<00:02:15.129> one<00:02:15.310> because<00:02:15.430> if<00:02:15.640> they<00:02:15.790> can<00:02:15.970> actually

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
new one because if they can actually

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.670 
new one because if they can actually
match<00:02:16.540> those<00:02:16.810> other<00:02:17.019> ones<00:02:17.140> because<00:02:17.379> because

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
match those other ones because because

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.589 
match those other ones because because
they<00:02:17.920> did<00:02:18.099> a<00:02:18.129> pretty<00:02:18.220> decent<00:02:18.610> job<00:02:18.849> at<00:02:19.209> fixing

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
they did a pretty decent job at fixing

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.509 
they did a pretty decent job at fixing
some<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.959> problems<00:02:20.200> they<00:02:21.069> went<00:02:21.310> around

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
some of the problems they went around

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.630 
some of the problems they went around
and<00:02:21.730> they<00:02:21.849> did<00:02:22.030> what<00:02:22.180> they<00:02:22.209> need<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:23.549> when<00:02:24.549> it

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
and they did what they need to when it

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.729 
and they did what they need to when it
came<00:02:24.819> down<00:02:24.849> to<00:02:25.269> like<00:02:25.810> fixing<00:02:26.140> things<00:02:26.290> like<00:02:26.530> the

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
came down to like fixing things like the

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.770 
came down to like fixing things like the
aks-74u<00:02:27.280> rapid<00:02:27.909> fire<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.330> was<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.690> was

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
aks-74u rapid fire that was that was

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.440 
aks-74u rapid fire that was that was
patch<00:02:29.019> you<00:02:29.620> had<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.860> famas<00:02:30.190> was<00:02:30.519> patch<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:31.000> mean

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
patch you had the famas was patch I mean

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.330 
patch you had the famas was patch I mean
it<00:02:31.540> wasn't<00:02:31.660> like<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:32.110> major<00:02:32.410> major<00:02:32.769> to<00:02:33.250> the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
it wasn't like a major major to the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.800 
it wasn't like a major major to the
point<00:02:33.519> where<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.760> wasn't<00:02:34.000> useful<00:02:34.209> gun<00:02:34.569> anymore

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
point where it wasn't useful gun anymore

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.270 
point where it wasn't useful gun anymore
the<00:02:35.019> famas<00:02:35.290> was<00:02:35.470> still<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.769> best<00:02:35.950> gun<00:02:36.099> in<00:02:36.129> the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
the famas was still the best gun in the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.839 
the famas was still the best gun in the
game<00:02:36.660> but<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.959> was<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.920> was<00:02:39.310> an<00:02:39.430> incredible

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
game but it was it was an incredible

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.220 
game but it was it was an incredible
thing<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.269> was<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.629> was<00:02:40.750> really<00:02:41.019> an<00:02:41.110> incredible

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
thing it was it was really an incredible

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.720 
thing it was it was really an incredible
thing<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.829> they<00:02:41.980> were<00:02:42.040> actually<00:02:42.370> paying

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
thing that they were actually paying

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.190 
thing that they were actually paying
attention<00:02:42.879> and<00:02:43.329> fixing<00:02:43.659> some<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.959> things

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
attention and fixing some of the things

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.690 
attention and fixing some of the things
I<00:02:44.410> mean<00:02:44.920> do<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.099> remember<00:02:45.340> when<00:02:45.489> black<00:02:45.670> ops

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
I mean do you remember when black ops

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.460 
I mean do you remember when black ops
started<00:02:46.209> out<00:02:46.329> and<00:02:46.569> they<00:02:46.690> tried<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.170> actually

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
started out and they tried to actually

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.979 
started out and they tried to actually
make<00:02:47.890> quickscoping<00:02:48.760> challenging<00:02:49.329> the<00:02:49.840> whole

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
make quickscoping challenging the whole

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.960 
make quickscoping challenging the whole
community<00:02:50.560> bitched<00:02:50.799> about<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.489> then<00:02:51.879> they

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
community bitched about it and then they

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.020 
community bitched about it and then they
finally<00:02:52.209> brought<00:02:52.569> back<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:53.500> level<00:02:54.370> area<00:02:54.700> level

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
finally brought back a level area level

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.150 
finally brought back a level area level
ground<00:02:55.209> where<00:02:55.569> it's<00:02:55.959> not<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.500> easiest<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:57.069> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
ground where it's not the easiest in the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.940 
ground where it's not the easiest in the
world<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.459> quick<00:02:57.609> scope<00:02:58.109> but<00:02:59.109> it's<00:02:59.680> still

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
world a quick scope but it's still

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.220 
world a quick scope but it's still
effective<00:03:00.489> so<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:01.180> know<00:03:01.329> they<00:03:01.540> try<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.049> do

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
what they do to stick to the roots but

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.920 
what they do to stick to the roots but
