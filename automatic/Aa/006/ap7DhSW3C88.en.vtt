you saw earlier I have a Petzl shunt on
my<00:01:00.300> line<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.219> may<00:01:02.219> ask<00:01:02.600> what<00:01:03.600> are<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:03.840> doing

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
my line you may ask what are we doing

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.289 
my line you may ask what are we doing
with<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.470> thing<00:01:05.450> well<00:01:06.590> as<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.939> shunt

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
with this thing well as we see the shunt

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.770 
with this thing well as we see the shunt
moves<00:01:09.780> freely<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.530> both<00:01:10.950> directions<00:01:11.780> forward

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
moves freely in both directions forward

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.899 
moves freely in both directions forward
and<00:01:13.080> back<00:01:14.060> nice<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.330> smooth<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:17.250> as<00:01:17.490> they

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and back nice and smooth it is as they

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.160 
and back nice and smooth it is as they
say<00:01:18.180> m.i.a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
say m.i.a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.179 
say m.i.a
or<00:01:19.500> midline<00:01:20.340> attachable<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.590> at<00:01:22.920> any<00:01:23.070> point

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
or midline attachable so at any point

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.580 
or midline attachable so at any point
you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.820> take<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.810> off<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.439> your

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
you can take it on and off of your

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.190 
you can take it on and off of your
system

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
system

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.130 
system
now<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.409> I've<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.860> figured<00:01:29.130> out<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:30.020> lot<00:01:31.020> of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
now what I've just figured out a lot of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.109 
now what I've just figured out a lot of
people<00:01:31.380> use<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.860> for<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.509> basic<00:01:35.119> back

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
people use it for is just a basic back

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.950 
people use it for is just a basic back
up<00:01:36.360> breaking<00:01:37.430> now<00:01:38.570> with<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> small

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
up breaking now with a small

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.929 
up breaking now with a small
modification<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:41.070> could<00:01:41.250> use<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> carabiner

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
modification you could use a carabiner

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.429 
modification you could use a carabiner
but<00:01:42.329> I'm<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.570> gonna<00:01:42.720> run<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.200> Rope<00:01:43.409> through

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
but I'm just gonna run the Rope through

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:51.380 
but I'm just gonna run the Rope through
the<00:01:43.710> eyelet<00:01:44.390> for<00:01:45.439> example<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:48.290> show<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:50.390> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
the eyelet for example and show you the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.800 
the eyelet for example and show you the
concept<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.020> I've<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.380> come<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.829> with

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
concept that I've just come up with

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.240 
concept that I've just come up with
running<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.020> tail<00:01:55.409> through<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.040> eyelet<00:01:58.250> now

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
running the tail through the eyelet now

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.520 
running the tail through the eyelet now
we<00:01:59.759> see<00:02:00.799> smooth<00:02:01.799> flow<00:02:02.210> alright<00:02:03.350> now<00:02:04.350> I've

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
we see smooth flow alright now I've

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.230 
we see smooth flow alright now I've
changed<00:02:04.770> out<00:02:05.070> my<00:02:05.189> hand<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.759> I'm<00:02:05.820> using<00:02:06.030> my

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
changed out my hand so I'm using my

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.979 
changed out my hand so I'm using my
braking<00:02:06.689> hand<00:02:06.990> I'm<00:02:07.649> applying<00:02:08.250> force

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
braking hand I'm applying force

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.350 
braking hand I'm applying force
increasing<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.229> shunts<00:02:10.849> grabbing<00:02:11.849> ability

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
increasing the shunts grabbing ability

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
increasing the shunts grabbing ability
now<00:02:14.070> again<00:02:15.090> forgive<00:02:16.090> me<00:02:16.270> for<00:02:16.450> releasing<00:02:16.930> my
