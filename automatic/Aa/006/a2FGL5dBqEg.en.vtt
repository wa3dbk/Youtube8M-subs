00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.059
 many women and some men dye 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.460
 look at your hair for your natural color 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.650
 to vary around gray or white hair 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.499
 to cover or just because it is them 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.780
 I like to dye hair 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.610
 two very different methods 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.980
 Dry hair dye like the ones in the 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:28.700
 Most hairdresser is applied and the 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:30.500
 Plant hair color of Lucona if you have 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.329
 Go to a hairdresser to get her 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.770
 hair dyeing then happens 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.690
 following on her head the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.850
 synthetic dyes penetrate into the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.769
 hair shaft, a first makes the per 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.289
 oxidation for the shed 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:46.670
 open wide and every single hair 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:48.379
 the couple is decolorized the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.269
 natural pigments in her hair 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.260
 The hair will be much lighter 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:56.120
 until the platinum blond afterwards 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.280
 inner hair of her hair several chemical 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.379
 reactions to the formation of the 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.210
 new color with synthetic pigments 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.829
 to lead 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.810
 this method is aggressive for that 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.850
 Hair first has to have its natural structure 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.570
 lose to the chemical reaction in 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.490
 to enable his inner 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.710
 the more chemical stains iaa 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.079
 had to endure the more fragile and 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.299
 it gets brittle the hair loses its 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.670
 shine the silky grip his 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.560
 elasticity when it is still on the beach 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.100
 with lots of sun and salt water in 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.680
 it gets calmer all the time 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.689
 with a plant hair color of lucona 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.600
 that can not happen to them 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.690
 the logona plant has been made 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.940
 pure vegetable color pigments these 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.220
 Pigments have a natural affinity 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.220
 with the keratin from which he got 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.320
 the pigments do not penetrate into the interior 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.299
 your hair one but lay down like 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.870
 a protective coat around each one 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.180
 hair 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.250
 the logona plant hair color is one 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.320
 proper hair care the quality 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.720
 her hair improves with everyone 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.090
 application gains your hair in volume 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:12.190
 elasticity and gloss many 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.410
 benefits of plant hair color 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.600
 but also a small disadvantage of it 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.940
 needs a little more patience a heat 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.170
 hood or an ozone hood at the hairdresser 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.760
 can speed up the application 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.530
 The result is different than one 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.810
 Dry hair dye your new one 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.030
 Hair color is livelier her hair 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.630
 have been respected that's us 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.630
 already worth it
