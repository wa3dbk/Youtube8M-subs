 chrysler today part of fiat 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.890
 The interesting thing about this model is that

 also told how you think if 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.739
 let's try and take a look for 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.739
 first time to the new chrysler 200 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.829
 ah 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.810
 the union between the Italian brand of fiat 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.450
 with everything that is fashion and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.299
 sophistication on board along with the brand 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.000
 American chrysler is giving 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.810
 fruits and in this opportunity we bring you 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.750
 the chrysler 200 will not be a charger with 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.390
 gm v8 nor will it be a dodge durango 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.220
 to load seven passengers 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.590
 this car enters one of the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.960
 more competitive segments than one 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.720
 could enter the market of 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.509
 cars there is going to be hard against 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.179
 the Japanese against the Americans 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.060
 the whole market is ready to see that 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.330
 can make a car like the kaiser 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.690
 Two hundred front and trade amounts in the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.679
 heart of this car is that engine 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.709
 pentastar v6 and is also docked to 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:08.970
 a gearbox you want to have 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:12.989
 nine speeds the penta starter 3.6 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.140
 liters v6 produces 295 horses no 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.920
 you need so much for this car 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.670
 enough with this one 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.980
 have the four cylinders in line 2.4 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.450
 liters that they call tiger shark 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:30.390
 Multiair 2 enough with 184 horses 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.209
 of strength and a very good consumption of 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.160
 fuel let's start on the outside if one 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.770
 see the outside on the part 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.670
 front is a mask that gives you a 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:45.349
 dna gives you a sophisticated grid 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.420
 clean is a line that they have achieved 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.269
 attract and you have to see it well so that 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.500
 you see how everything is coming together especially 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.350
 with those new headlights 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.230
 ld is back where I like in the part 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.060
 of the pillar towards the back is 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.910
 a sophisticated line that follows until the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.549
 part of where 22 escapes are by 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.830
 down very well achieved is inside 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.250
 where the car has everything one 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.680
 want there are thousands thousands thousands of 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.739
 add-ons to start everything is 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.970
 connected by computers if the 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.060
 initial computer is the 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.830
 assisted power steering that indicates 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.770
 when you are changing when you are 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.530
 folding the steering wheel tells you where it is 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.800
 and computers already prepare what is 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.320
 the transmission the perfect change the 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.930
 engine and also what are the 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.200
 suspensions that's where the algorithms 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.200
 they enter the accelerator that also 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.540
 sends other signals and other sensors to 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.000
 the nine-speed box has 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.400
 back-up cameras the panel 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.340
 instruments with seven inches and 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.280
 that you can program it from the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.220
 you can program it and also 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.650
 with the system that has chrysler's 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.130
 connect that now has in center 8 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.100
 point 4 inches and it's a touch ring 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:16.299
 touch and you can read messages from 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.400
 text aloud leather seats already 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.530
 does not have a shift lever in the 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.090
 center console neither does it have a 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.990
 gear lever in the column of 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.290
 address 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.480
 now has one that is rotating the best 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.780
 that one can choose to be able 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.980
 more space sophistication and feel that 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.700
 you are in a luxury car the chrysler 200 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.700
 imported from detroit 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.930
 so there they had it in 90 200 has 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:52.200
 lines that go like those new coupe 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:55.410
 It has stylized mirrors 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.230
 He has the mask that you see and in 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.200
 principle you think is normal and if 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.800
 he manages to see it has enough to him 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.930
 they call close thing in terms of designs 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.500
 for all of you in jorge that clean 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.500
 presents
