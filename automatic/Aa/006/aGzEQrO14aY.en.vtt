100<00:00:20.949> 200<00:00:21.570> 300<00:00:22.570> 400<00:00:23.490> 500<00:00:24.490> pounds<00:00:24.899> on<00:00:25.899> a<00:00:25.930> railgun

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.009 

lost<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.610> typical<00:00:34.089> railgun<00:00:34.449> only<00:00:34.660> has<00:00:34.809> about

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
lost the typical railgun only has about

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:44.189 
lost the typical railgun only has about
150<00:00:35.650> pounds<00:00:36.100> on<00:00:36.220> it<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:37.750> is<00:00:37.809> 150<00:00:38.440> pounds<00:00:43.199> lost

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
150 pounds on it this is 150 pounds lost

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.579 
150 pounds on it this is 150 pounds lost
so<00:00:44.980> we<00:00:45.100> test<00:00:45.309> the<00:00:45.430> whole<00:00:45.519> back<00:00:45.730> end<00:00:45.909> okay<00:00:46.870> so<00:00:46.930> on

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
so we test the whole back end okay so on

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.979 
so we test the whole back end okay so on
this<00:00:47.769> one<00:00:47.980> although<00:00:48.550> we<00:00:48.820> only<00:00:48.850> test<00:00:49.330> a<00:00:49.479> 500

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
this one although we only test a 500

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.350 
this one although we only test a 500
pounds<00:00:50.320> we<00:00:51.159> figure<00:00:51.460> we<00:00:51.610> would<00:00:51.729> do<00:00:51.879> a<00:00:51.909> test<00:00:52.239> a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
pounds we figure we would do a test a

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.880 
pounds we figure we would do a test a
little<00:00:52.570> bit<00:00:52.689> higher<00:00:52.869> so<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.260> gauge<00:00:53.439> goes<00:00:53.739> up

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
little bit higher so the gauge goes up

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.460 
little bit higher so the gauge goes up
to<00:00:54.010> 800<00:00:54.460> pounds<00:00:54.729> of<00:00:54.820> force<00:00:55.030> so<00:00:55.299> let's<00:00:56.049> see

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.999 

that's<00:00:59.470> 800<00:01:00.070> pounds<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.379> pull<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:02.680> trigger

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:03.009 
that's 800 pounds and pull the trigger

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.480 
that's 800 pounds and pull the trigger
18<00:01:03.339> times<00:01:04.530> let's<00:01:05.530> make<00:01:05.710> sure<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.979> fire<00:01:06.189> let's

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
18 times let's make sure it fire let's

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.230 
18 times let's make sure it fire let's
make<00:01:06.670> sure<00:01:06.700> it<00:01:06.909> fires

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
make sure it fires

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:15.569 
make sure it fires
well<00:01:08.140> again<00:01:08.380> back<00:01:08.650> at<00:01:08.860> 150<00:01:13.770> that's<00:01:14.770> 150<00:01:15.189> right

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
well again back at 150 that's 150 right

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.730 
well again back at 150 that's 150 right
there

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
there

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.630 
there
just<00:01:17.740> as<00:01:17.890> easy<00:01:18.040> as<00:01:18.189> it<00:01:18.400> was<00:01:19.710> reloading<00:01:20.710> I'm

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
just as easy as it was reloading I'm

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.340 
just as easy as it was reloading I'm
here<00:01:21.880> at<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.030> iron<00:01:22.150> rod<00:01:22.420> testing<00:01:22.870> facility

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
here at the iron rod testing facility

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.690 
here at the iron rod testing facility
where<00:01:23.500> Rick<00:01:23.740> is<00:01:23.860> gonna<00:01:23.920> take<00:01:24.190> us<00:01:24.310> through<00:01:24.490> some

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
where Rick is gonna take us through some

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.610 
where Rick is gonna take us through some
of<00:01:24.730> the<00:01:24.880> very<00:01:25.180> highly<00:01:25.720> technical<00:01:26.020> ways<00:01:26.470> he

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
of the very highly technical ways he

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.890 
of the very highly technical ways he
tests<00:01:26.980> his<00:01:27.070> gun<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:28.150> Rick<00:01:28.300> tell<00:01:28.570> me<00:01:28.630> about<00:01:28.750> the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
tests his gun so Rick tell me about the

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.950 
tests his gun so Rick tell me about the
bowel<00:01:29.080> flex<00:01:29.409> these<00:01:29.620> cabins<00:01:30.240> well<00:01:31.240> this

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
bowel flex these cabins well this

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.130 
bowel flex these cabins well this
particular<00:01:32.190> barrel<00:01:33.190> is<00:01:33.280> super<00:01:33.850> venom<00:01:34.150> and<00:01:34.720> we

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
particular barrel is super venom and we

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.140 
particular barrel is super venom and we
made<00:01:35.320> it<00:01:35.500> extra<00:01:36.040> heavy-duty<00:01:36.340> so<00:01:36.850> that<00:01:37.060> it

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
made it extra heavy-duty so that it

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.399 
made it extra heavy-duty so that it
could<00:01:37.270> shoot<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.570> seven<00:01:38.260> and<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.380> half

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
could shoot a seven and a half

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.560 
could shoot a seven and a half
millimeter<00:01:38.860> shaft<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:39.820> we<00:01:40.210> can<00:01:40.360> shoot<00:01:40.479> them

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
millimeter shaft and we can shoot them

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.810 
millimeter shaft and we can shoot them
at<00:01:40.720> a<00:01:40.750> 140<00:01:41.320> and<00:01:41.560> maybe<00:01:41.770> some<00:01:42.370> day<00:01:42.520> maybe<00:01:42.670> even

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
at a 140 and maybe some day maybe even

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.539 
at a 140 and maybe some day maybe even
longer<00:01:43.180> so<00:01:43.540> uh<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.590> know<00:01:44.680> we've<00:01:45.040> derived<00:01:45.310> a

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
longer so uh you know we've derived a

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.940 
longer so uh you know we've derived a
bunch<00:01:45.760> of<00:01:45.909> high-tech<00:01:46.390> ways<00:01:46.600> of<00:01:46.930> testing<00:01:47.560> but

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
bunch of high-tech ways of testing but

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.500 
bunch of high-tech ways of testing but
this<00:01:48.130> is<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.370> plastic<00:01:48.640> way<00:01:49.060> that<00:01:49.270> we<00:01:49.360> know

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
this is the plastic way that we know

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.460 
this is the plastic way that we know
right<00:01:49.720> now<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.720> we're<00:01:52.870> just<00:01:52.900> gonna<00:01:53.080> set<00:01:53.350> it

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
right now so we're just gonna set it

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:25.930 
right now so we're just gonna set it
right<00:01:53.500> there

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.150 

that's<00:02:26.940> 200<00:02:27.420> pounds<00:02:27.480> think<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.680> if<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.070> gets

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
that's 200 pounds think of it if it gets

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.880 
that's 200 pounds think of it if it gets
surprised<00:02:29.780> survive<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.020> aunt<00:02:31.260> Nesta<00:02:31.590> can

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
surprised survive it aunt Nesta can

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:42.950 
surprised survive it aunt Nesta can
survive<00:02:32.160> any<00:02:32.400> test

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.020 

you
