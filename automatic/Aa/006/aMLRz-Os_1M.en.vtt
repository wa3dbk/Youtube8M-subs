I'm<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.049> sort<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.530> thing<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> hope<00:01:35.310> they

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
I'm that sort of thing so I hope they

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.520 
I'm that sort of thing so I hope they
fix<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.060> aspect<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.659> entrances<00:01:37.110> being<00:01:37.350> in

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
fix that aspect of entrances being in

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.190 
fix that aspect of entrances being in
full<00:01:37.740> length<00:01:38.009> I'm<00:01:38.450> not<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.630> acne<00:01:39.930> perhaps

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
full length I'm not just acne perhaps

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.749 
full length I'm not just acne perhaps
the<00:01:40.320> animations<00:01:40.950> being<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.400> little<00:01:41.579> bit<00:01:41.670> more

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the animations being a little bit more

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.120 
the animations being a little bit more
fluid<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.479> lot<00:01:42.630> better<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.140> all<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.100> that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
fluid just a lot better and all of that

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.399 
fluid just a lot better and all of that
sort<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.549> thing<00:01:44.610> also<00:01:45.450> Pyro's<00:01:45.899> perhaps<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
sort of thing also Pyro's perhaps the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.410 
sort of thing also Pyro's perhaps the
things<00:01:46.590> actually<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.640> show<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.180> pyro

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
things actually that show the pyro

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.300 
things actually that show the pyro
actually<00:01:48.899> come<00:01:49.079> up<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:50.009> sort<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> thing

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
actually come up and that sort of thing

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.770 
actually come up and that sort of thing
so<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> think<00:01:50.759> entrances<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.540> really

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
so I think entrances can be really

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.499 
so I think entrances can be really
improved<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.290> know<00:01:52.409> 2k<00:01:52.860> sports<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:54.210> NBA

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
improved and I know 2k sports with NBA

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.090 
improved and I know 2k sports with NBA
obviously<00:01:55.049> their<00:01:55.170> presentation<00:01:55.710> aspect

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
obviously their presentation aspect

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.459 
obviously their presentation aspect
maybe<00:01:56.310> what<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.790> might<00:01:56.909> help<00:01:57.149> how<00:01:57.689> things<00:01:57.960> go

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
maybe what that might help how things go

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.800 
maybe what that might help how things go
with<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.189> now<00:01:59.969> moving<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> actual

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
with that now moving on to the actual

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.510 
with that now moving on to the actual
presentation<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> game<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.369> got

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
presentation of the game now we got

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.709 
presentation of the game now we got
universe<00:02:02.880> mode<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.329> could<00:02:03.540> show<00:02:03.659> some

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
universe mode that could show some

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.149 
universe mode that could show some
presentation<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.500> guess<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:04.890> use<00:02:05.009> that

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
presentation and I guess we can use that

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.059 
presentation and I guess we can use that
as<00:02:05.280> an<00:02:05.399> example<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:06.060> I'll<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:07.469> universe<00:02:07.829> mode

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
as an example so I'll do universe mode

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.410 
as an example so I'll do universe mode
on<00:02:08.220> my<00:02:08.369> channel<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.030> future<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.360> is

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
whole universe mode thing on my own but

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.759 
whole universe mode thing on my own but
I<00:02:16.930> want<00:02:17.049> to<00:02:17.109> talk<00:02:17.200> about<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.469> actual

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
I want to talk about the actual

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.949 
I want to talk about the actual
presentation<00:02:18.400> aspect<00:02:18.999> of<00:02:19.120> universe<00:02:19.480> mode<00:02:19.689> so

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
presentation aspect of universe mode so

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.679 
presentation aspect of universe mode so
basically<00:02:20.889> let's<00:02:21.099> say<00:02:21.249> we<00:02:21.430> go<00:02:21.609> we<00:02:22.329> fill<00:02:22.540> out

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
basically let's say we go we fill out

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:23.849 
basically let's say we go we fill out
our<00:02:22.719> card<00:02:23.049> there<00:02:23.319> shouldn't<00:02:23.590> we<00:02:23.799> shouldn't

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859 
our card there shouldn't we shouldn't

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:24.929 
our card there shouldn't we shouldn't
have<00:02:24.159> to<00:02:24.219> go<00:02:24.280> into<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.459> first<00:02:24.670> match<00:02:24.849> we

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
have to go into the first match we

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.940 
have to go into the first match we
should<00:02:25.090> be<00:02:25.150> able<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.329> click<00:02:25.480> begin<00:02:25.930> show<00:02:26.379> then

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
should be able to click begin show then

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.649 
should be able to click begin show then
you<00:02:27.099> know<00:02:27.219> if<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:27.459> Monday<00:02:27.700> Night<00:02:27.879> Raw<00:02:27.909> the

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
you know if it's Monday Night Raw the

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.020 
you know if it's Monday Night Raw the
Pyro's<00:02:29.049> go<00:02:29.290> off<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:30.489> know<00:02:30.609> that<00:02:30.639> sort<00:02:30.969> of

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
Pyro's go off you know that sort of

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.129 
Pyro's go off you know that sort of
thing<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.269> then<00:02:31.389> perhaps<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.840> cuts<00:02:32.019> two

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:32.139 
thing and then perhaps it cuts two

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:33.979 
thing and then perhaps it cuts two
commentators<00:02:32.590> where<00:02:33.069> they<00:02:33.189> have<00:02:33.370> either

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
commentators where they have either

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.240 
commentators where they have either
voiceovers<00:02:34.989> themselves<00:02:35.650> like<00:02:35.829> welcome<00:02:36.129> to

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
voiceovers themselves like welcome to

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.920 
voiceovers themselves like welcome to
Monday<00:02:36.459> Night<00:02:36.489> Raw<00:02:36.639> so<00:02:37.359> now<00:02:37.480> we<00:02:37.569> have<00:02:37.599> a<00:02:37.689> huge

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.869 
Monday Night Raw so now we have a huge

those lines that sort of thing like

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.000 
those lines that sort of thing like

over the lineups like they can discuss

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.629 
over the lineups like they can discuss
the<00:02:58.359> match<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:59.469> sort<00:02:59.709> of<00:02:59.769> thing<00:02:59.829> like<00:03:00.219> I
