the<00:00:32.730> side<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> glass<00:00:33.390> I'll<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.079> try<00:00:34.290> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the side of the glass I'll just try to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.639 
the side of the glass I'll just try to
be<00:00:34.790> really<00:00:35.790> calm<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.480> not<00:00:36.840> poor<00:00:37.320> too

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
be really calm with it not poor too

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.470 
be really calm with it not poor too
aggressively<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:38.879> don't<00:00:39.030> get<00:00:39.120> too<00:00:39.300> much

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
aggressively so we don't get too much

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.299 
aggressively so we don't get too much
head<00:00:42.290> looks<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> carbonation<00:00:44.219> has

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
head looks like the carbonation has

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.660 
head looks like the carbonation has
finally<00:00:44.640> come<00:00:44.789> around<00:00:46.100> when<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.219> were<00:00:47.280> popping

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
finally come around when we were popping

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.310 
finally come around when we were popping
earlier<00:00:48.000> bottles<00:00:51.020> carbonation<00:00:52.020> was<00:00:52.140> not

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
earlier bottles carbonation was not

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.100 
earlier bottles carbonation was not
quite<00:00:52.590> where<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.800> should<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.120> at<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.180> time<00:00:54.449> we

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
quite where it should be at the time we

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.490 
quite where it should be at the time we
think<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:56.430> might<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:57.030> had<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.989> bit<00:00:58.320> too

up<00:02:09.590> there<00:02:09.770> somewhere<00:02:10.090> marek<00:02:11.090> I've<00:02:11.270> I<00:02:12.130> think

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
up there somewhere marek I've I think

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.470 
up there somewhere marek I've I think
it's<00:02:13.220> called<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.580> last<00:02:13.790> bottle<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.270> Irish

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
it's called the last bottle of Irish

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.780 
it's called the last bottle of Irish
stout<00:02:14.840> or<00:02:15.080> something<00:02:15.350> like<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:16.640> yeah

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
stout or something like that but yeah

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.580 
stout or something like that but yeah
the<00:02:16.850> aroma<00:02:17.150> here<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.480> not<00:02:17.630> quite<00:02:17.930> as<00:02:18.140> good<00:02:18.530> as

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
the aroma here is not quite as good as

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.670 
the aroma here is not quite as good as
it<00:02:18.830> was<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:20.120> time<00:02:20.300> around<00:02:20.570> again<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.320> think<00:02:21.380> we

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
it was that time around again I think we

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.240

yeah it's not bad so we're going to go
right<00:02:45.530> into<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.800> taste<00:02:46.010> now

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:07.530 

hmm

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.260 

very<00:03:08.540> dry<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:10.120> very<00:03:11.120> dry<00:03:11.450> rosti<00:03:12.140> tastes<00:03:13.270> almost

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
very dry a very dry rosti tastes almost

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.440 
very dry a very dry rosti tastes almost
sort<00:03:14.600> of<00:03:14.690> like<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:15.580> charcoal<00:03:16.580> briquette<00:03:16.820> kind

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
sort of like a charcoal briquette kind

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:25.990 
sort of like a charcoal briquette kind
of<00:03:17.510> kind<00:03:18.320> of<00:03:18.410> tastes<00:03:24.370> almost<00:03:25.370> tastes<00:03:25.730> burnt

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
of kind of tastes almost tastes burnt

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.680 
of kind of tastes almost tastes burnt
instead<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:26.540> roasted

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.500 

you<00:03:36.320> have<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.500> problem<00:03:36.800> of<00:03:36.830> this<00:03:36.980> one<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:37.510> we

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
you have the problem of this one is we

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.150 
you have the problem of this one is we
probably<00:03:38.750> under<00:03:39.110> sugared<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.530> bottles<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:39.980> bit

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
probably under sugared the bottles a bit

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.490 
probably under sugared the bottles a bit
so<00:03:42.460> and<00:03:43.460> I<00:03:44.030> think<00:03:44.690> there's<00:03:45.020> a<00:03:45.080> bit<00:03:45.230> too<00:03:45.320> much

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
so and I think there's a bit too much

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.370 
so and I think there's a bit too much
water<00:03:45.740> it<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.040> kind<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.460> watery<00:03:46.820> and<00:03:46.970> thin

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
water it is kind of watery and thin

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:55.570 
water it is kind of watery and thin
first<00:03:48.380> out<00:03:52.420> but<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:53.510> doesn't<00:03:53.750> taste<00:03:53.900> bad<00:03:54.580> it

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
first out but it doesn't taste bad it

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.240 
first out but it doesn't taste bad it
actually<00:03:55.700> tastes<00:03:56.120> pretty<00:03:56.150> good<00:03:56.360> it's<00:03:57.250> it's

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
actually tastes pretty good it's it's

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.030 
actually tastes pretty good it's it's
it's<00:03:58.870> quite<00:03:59.870> drinkable<00:04:00.140> quite<00:04:00.860> drinkable

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
it's quite drinkable quite drinkable

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.240 
it's quite drinkable quite drinkable
yeah<00:04:02.050> actually<00:04:03.050> people<00:04:03.470> not<00:04:03.620> used<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.980> stouts

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
yeah actually people not used to stouts

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.130 
yeah actually people not used to stouts
might<00:04:04.550> actually<00:04:04.760> find<00:04:05.120> this<00:04:05.330> easier<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.960> drink

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
might actually find this easier to drink

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.410 
might actually find this easier to drink
and<00:04:06.800> if<00:04:07.040> they<00:04:07.310> were<00:04:07.430> just<00:04:07.610> given<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:07.910> full-blown

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790
