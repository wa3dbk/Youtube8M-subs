was going to put ketchup but then it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.290 
was going to put ketchup but then it
would<00:02:31.740> just<00:02:31.830> be<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.010> same<00:02:32.310> color<00:02:32.970> as<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.150> hot

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
dog so that wouldn't really make any

I'd<00:05:37.440> like<00:05:37.860> I<00:05:37.950> wanted<00:05:38.220> to<00:05:38.370> sell<00:05:38.550> them<00:05:38.730> for<00:05:38.940> two

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
I'd like I wanted to sell them for two

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.180 
I'd like I wanted to sell them for two
dollars<00:05:39.330> and<00:05:39.870> she<00:05:40.470> said<00:05:40.650> that<00:05:40.800> was<00:05:40.950> a<00:05:41.010> little

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
dollars and she said that was a little

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.560 
dollars and she said that was a little
bit<00:05:41.400> too<00:05:41.640> cheap<00:05:41.880> but<00:05:42.060> I<00:05:42.090> guess<00:05:42.270> it<00:05:42.390> kind<00:05:42.540> of

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
bit too cheap but I guess it kind of

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.790 
bit too cheap but I guess it kind of
makes<00:05:42.720> sense<00:05:42.870> because<00:05:43.080> it<00:05:43.290> does<00:05:43.410> take<00:05:43.590> a

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
makes sense because it does take a

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.220 
makes sense because it does take a
little<00:05:44.490> bit<00:05:44.640> of<00:05:44.760> work<00:05:45.000> to<00:05:45.030> create<00:05:45.420> them<00:05:45.750> but<00:05:46.020> I

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
little bit of work to create them but I

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.140 
little bit of work to create them but I
don't<00:05:47.130> know<00:05:47.370> so<00:05:47.580> just<00:05:47.610> answer<00:05:47.910> those
