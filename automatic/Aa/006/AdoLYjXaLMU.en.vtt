want<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.119> much<00:01:54.299> air<00:01:54.600> flow<00:01:54.810> through<00:01:54.840> there<00:01:55.290> as

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
want as much air flow through there as

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.280 
want as much air flow through there as
possible<00:01:56.250> same<00:01:56.880> thing<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.420> exhaust

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
possible same thing with the exhaust

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.770 
possible same thing with the exhaust
vents<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.829> exhaust<00:01:59.340> vents<00:01:59.700> are<00:01:59.820> extremely

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
vents the exhaust vents are extremely

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.020 
vents the exhaust vents are extremely
important<00:02:01.320> because<00:02:01.680> they<00:02:01.979> help<00:02:02.009> pull<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.880> air

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
important because they help pull the air

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.240 
important because they help pull the air
through<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.390> helmet<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.439> when<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.799> happens

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
through the helmet so when that happens

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.950 
through the helmet so when that happens
again<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.850> get<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> lot<00:02:06.299> more<00:02:06.329> air<00:02:06.719> flow

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
again you get a lot more air flow

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
again you get a lot more air flow
through<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.380> helmet<00:02:07.740> every<00:02:07.920> one<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.670> our

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
through the helmet every one of our

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.840 
through the helmet every one of our
vents<00:02:09.149> has

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
vents has

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.330 
vents has
steel<00:02:10.150> mesh<00:02:10.540> protection<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:11.800> if<00:02:11.950> there's<00:02:12.190> any

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
steel mesh protection so if there's any

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.210 
steel mesh protection so if there's any
type<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.640> debris<00:02:13.420> rocks<00:02:13.900> flying<00:02:14.260> it'll<00:02:15.070> keep

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
type of debris rocks flying it'll keep

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.740 
type of debris rocks flying it'll keep
it<00:02:15.370> from<00:02:15.430> getting<00:02:15.820> caught<00:02:16.150> up<00:02:16.210> in<00:02:16.510> the
