00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.269 
tutorial
aimed<00:00:03.750> at<00:00:03.990> around<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.380> level<00:00:04.529> standard<00:00:05.069> and

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
aimed at around a level standard and

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.690 
aimed at around a level standard and
it's<00:00:05.640> an<00:00:05.730> equilibrium<00:00:06.060> question<00:00:07.220> it<00:00:08.220> says<00:00:08.460> a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
it's an equilibrium question it says a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.520 
it's an equilibrium question it says a
mixture<00:00:09.000> was<00:00:09.240> prepared<00:00:09.719> using<00:00:09.900> two<00:00:10.200> mol<00:00:10.380> of

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
mixture was prepared using two mol of

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.980 
mixture was prepared using two mol of
propanoic<00:00:10.980> acid<00:00:11.070> form<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.179> ethanol<00:00:12.330> form<00:00:12.870> all

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
propanoic acid form of ethanol form all

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.900 
propanoic acid form of ethanol form all
of<00:00:13.019> water<00:00:13.349> mixture<00:00:14.280> was<00:00:14.370> allowed<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.730> come<00:00:14.880> to

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
of water mixture was allowed to come to

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.410 
of water mixture was allowed to come to
equilibrium<00:00:15.089> according<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.139> equation

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
equilibrium according to this equation

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.179 
equilibrium according to this equation
and<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.570> equilibrium<00:00:18.869> makes<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.890> contained

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
and the equilibrium makes it contained

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.490 
and the equilibrium makes it contained
1.4<00:00:20.820> mole<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.180> propanoic<00:00:21.630> acid<00:00:21.800> calculate<00:00:22.800> KC

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
1.4 mole of propanoic acid calculate KC

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.710 
1.4 mole of propanoic acid calculate KC
so<00:00:25.500> let's<00:00:26.099> define<00:00:26.310> KC<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.119> define<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
so let's define KC and define the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.800 
so let's define KC and define the
problem<00:00:28.019> KC<00:00:28.590> concentration<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.970> product

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
problem KC concentration of the product

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.560 
problem KC concentration of the product
over<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.140> reactants<00:00:31.920> but<00:00:32.700> we're<00:00:32.880> only<00:00:33.120> given

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
over the reactants but we're only given

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.450 
over the reactants but we're only given
the<00:00:33.660> equilibrium<00:00:34.290> amount<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
the equilibrium amount of one of the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.979 
the equilibrium amount of one of the
things<00:00:35.700> we're<00:00:36.030> only<00:00:36.120> given<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.450> equilibrium

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
things we're only given the equilibrium

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.100 
things we're only given the equilibrium
out<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.600> so<00:00:39.600> if<00:00:39.719> we<00:00:39.840> look<00:00:39.989> at<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
out of that one so if we look at the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.299 
out of that one so if we look at the
data<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.440> give<00:00:40.710> them<00:00:40.800> we're<00:00:41.010> told<00:00:41.190> that

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
data we give them we're told that

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.580 
data we give them we're told that
initially<00:00:41.969> we've<00:00:42.450> got<00:00:42.780> two<00:00:43.170> moles<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
initially we've got two moles of the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.310 
initially we've got two moles of the
propanoic<00:00:44.070> acid<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.360> ethanol<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
propanoic acid for the ethanol for the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.200 
propanoic acid for the ethanol for the
water<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.039> will<00:00:47.190> presume<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.640> there's<00:00:48.059> none

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
water and will presume that there's none

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.209 
water and will presume that there's none
of<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.360> formed<00:00:48.930> yet<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.710> he<00:00:49.800> told<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
of that formed yet and he told that a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
of that formed yet and he told that a
tekwar<00:00:50.430> libram<00:00:50.850> you've<00:00:50.969> got<00:00:51.210> one<00:00:51.420> point<00:00:51.600> form

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
tekwar libram you've got one point form

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.290 
tekwar libram you've got one point form
all<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.280> these<00:00:53.520> three<00:00:54.000> things

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
all of that but it's these three things

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.939 
all of that but it's these three things
here<00:00:54.690> which<00:00:55.110> we're<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> need<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.800> work

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
here which we're going to need to work

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.840 
here which we're going to need to work
out<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:57.289> to<00:00:58.289> do<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.829> need<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.039> ask<00:00:59.460> how

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
out and to do that we need to ask how

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.750 
out and to do that we need to ask how
much<00:01:00.329> propanoic<00:01:01.020> acid<00:01:01.140> has<00:01:01.770> reacted<00:01:02.370> we've

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
much propanoic acid has reacted we've

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.719 
much propanoic acid has reacted we've
got<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> change<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.780> from<00:01:04.650> 2<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.189> 1.4

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
got the change here so from 2 to 1.4

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.149 
got the change here so from 2 to 1.4
that's<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.090> reduction<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.510> 0.6<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:07.830> means

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that's a reduction of 0.6 which means

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.800 
that's a reduction of 0.6 which means
that<00:01:08.580> because<00:01:08.820> everything's<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.450> 1<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> 1

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that because everything's in a 1 to 1

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.490 
that because everything's in a 1 to 1
ratio

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
ratio

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.620 
ratio
nor<00:01:10.979> point<00:01:11.250> 6<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> ethanol<00:01:12.180> will<00:01:12.510> have

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
nor point 6 of the ethanol will have

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.810 
nor point 6 of the ethanol will have
reacted<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> naught<00:01:13.920> point<00:01:14.130> six<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.729> the

ethyl<00:01:15.090> propionate<00:01:15.570> will<00:01:15.930> form<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.950> same

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
ethyl propionate will form and the same

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.640 
ethyl propionate will form and the same
water<00:01:17.520> will<00:01:17.820> form<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.170> doing<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> bit<00:01:19.560> of

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
water will form so just doing a bit of

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.370 
water will form so just doing a bit of
maths<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.270> work<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
maths here you can work out the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.330 
maths here you can work out the
equilibrium<00:01:22.710> amounts<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.740> once<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.130> worked

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
equilibrium amounts and once we worked

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.219 
equilibrium amounts and once we worked
out<00:01:29.520> those<00:01:29.670> equilibrium<00:01:30.270> amounts<00:01:30.900> put<00:01:31.079> them

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
out those equilibrium amounts put them

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.050 
out those equilibrium amounts put them
in<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> definition<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.310> kc<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.729> that's

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
in for the definition of kc so that's

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.219 
in for the definition of kc so that's
the<00:01:33.180> things<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.540> right-hand<00:01:33.720> side<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the things on the right-hand side of the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.929 
the things on the right-hand side of the
equation<00:01:34.710> divided<00:01:35.189> by<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.430> things<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
equation divided by the things on the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.749 
equation divided by the things on the
left<00:01:36.060> comes<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.020> 6.7<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.950> there's<00:01:38.610> the

left comes out of 6.7 and there's the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.660 
left comes out of 6.7 and there's the
answer<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.150> question<00:01:39.979> slightly<00:01:40.979> less

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
answer to the question slightly less

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.880 
answer to the question slightly less
straightforward<00:01:42.240> cases<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.439> ratio<00:01:43.829> of

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
straightforward cases if the ratio of

to one to two to one same data otherwise
we<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.390> still<00:01:51.570> say<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.960> change<00:01:52.290> here<00:01:52.530> is

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
we can still say that the change here is

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.030 
we can still say that the change here is
minus<00:01:53.579> point<00:01:53.850> six<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.990> B<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.770> this

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
minus point six but for the B in this

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.580 
minus point six but for the B in this
case<00:01:56.310> only<00:01:56.939> half<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:57.869> much<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.290> would

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
case only half as much of that would

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.700 
case only half as much of that would
have<00:01:58.799> reacted<00:01:59.719> that's<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.899> two<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.290> two<00:02:01.469> for

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
have reacted that's in two to two for

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.830 
have reacted that's in two to two for
the<00:02:01.829> siste<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.340> would<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.820> same<00:02:03.570> amount

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the siste that would be the same amount

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.449 
the siste that would be the same amount
of<00:02:04.320> C<00:02:04.740> was<00:02:05.369> formed<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.360> used<00:02:06.600> up<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.459> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
of C was formed as a was used up and the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.010 
of C was formed as a was used up and the
D<00:02:08.700> that's<00:02:09.030> two<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.420> once<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.780> half<00:02:10.050> again

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
D that's two to once a half again

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.360 
D that's two to once a half again
can<00:02:13.020> carry<00:02:13.260> on<00:02:13.410> with<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.650> maths<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.040> work<00:02:14.160> out

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
can carry on with the maths and work out

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.100 
can carry on with the maths and work out
the<00:02:14.490> equilibrium<00:02:14.730> amount<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.510> they're<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
the equilibrium amount so they're the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.990 
the equilibrium amount so they're the
key<00:02:16.290> thing<00:02:16.500> here<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.130> change<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.970> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
key thing here is that the change in the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.900 
key thing here is that the change in the
number<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.420> moles<00:02:18.840> must<00:02:19.320> match<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.950> ratio<00:02:20.310> so

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
number of moles must match the ratio so

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.780 
number of moles must match the ratio so
2<00:02:20.970> -<00:02:21.270> 1<00:02:21.450> -<00:02:21.570> 2<00:02:21.600> -<00:02:21.840> 1<00:02:21.870> matches<00:02:22.680> 6<00:02:23.130> -<00:02:23.310> 3<00:02:23.340> -<00:02:23.790> 6<00:02:24.000> -<00:02:24.270> 3

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
2 - 1 - 2 - 1 matches 6 - 3 - 6 - 3

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.670 
2 - 1 - 2 - 1 matches 6 - 3 - 6 - 3
ok<00:02:26.790> thanks<00:02:27.150> for<00:02:27.240> watching<00:02:27.630> here's<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.140> little

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
ok thanks for watching here's a little

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.410 
ok thanks for watching here's a little
problem<00:02:29.070> for<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.490> in<00:02:29.730> which<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:29.970> should<00:02:30.300> be

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
problem for you in which you should be

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.940 
problem for you in which you should be
able<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.600> work<00:02:30.720> out<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.020> equilibrium<00:02:31.620> amounts

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
able to work out the equilibrium amounts

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.450 
able to work out the equilibrium amounts
ok<00:02:32.850> bye<00:02:33.270> for<00:02:33.420> now
