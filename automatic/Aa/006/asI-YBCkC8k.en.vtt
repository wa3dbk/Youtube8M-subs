00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
will look like what exactly okay so the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.670 
will look like what exactly okay so the
bus<00:01:33.450> service<00:01:33.690> has<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.990> slightly<00:01:34.409> different

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
bus service has a slightly different

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.040 
bus service has a slightly different
route<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.490> will<00:01:35.640> go<00:01:35.790> up<00:01:36.000> Greenwood<00:01:36.480> along

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
route it will go up Greenwood along

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.170 
route it will go up Greenwood along
Dundas<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.740> then<00:01:38.190> down<00:01:38.430> Joan<00:01:38.760> so<00:01:38.940> it's<00:01:39.060> a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
Dundas and then down Joan so it's a

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.870 
Dundas and then down Joan so it's a
shorter<00:01:39.690> diversion<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.980> actual<00:01:41.520> overall

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
shorter diversion so the actual overall

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.910 
shorter diversion so the actual overall

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
right down and that's because of the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.050 
right down and that's because of the
state<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.380> concrete<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.430> track<00:03:14.730> it's

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
all right Andy so this closure of this

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.920 
all right Andy so this closure of this
intersection<00:03:23.670> will<00:03:24.120> necessitate<00:03:24.300> a

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
intersection will necessitate a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.020 
intersection will necessitate a
diversion<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.920> 501<00:03:26.280> Queen<00:03:26.700> what<00:03:26.910> will

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.629 
we need to divert so let's start with a
501<00:04:28.660> Queen<00:04:29.620> Street<00:04:29.889> car<00:04:30.070> what<00:04:30.310> will<00:04:30.460> that

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
501 Queen Street car what will that

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.730 
501 Queen Street car what will that
diversion<00:04:31.030> look<00:04:31.419> like<00:04:31.630> then<00:04:31.840> on<00:04:31.990> Queen<00:04:32.229> okay

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
diversion look like then on Queen okay

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.590 
diversion look like then on Queen okay
so<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:33.040> diversion<00:04:33.520> will<00:04:33.639> come<00:04:33.820> off<00:04:33.970> Queen<00:04:34.240> up
