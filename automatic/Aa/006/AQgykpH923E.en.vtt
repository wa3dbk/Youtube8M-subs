00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.030
 passed border control only 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.760

 no one knew why the system worked 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.600
 we left the detachment information 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.429
 Dobkin system failure is refuted however 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.350

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.759
 meanwhile the ex-governor himself goes 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.560

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.150
 official website of the department appears 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.190
 information that is really open 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.590
 Proceedings against 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.100
 territorial integrity of Ukraine 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.530
 authorities 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.390
 however, about what exactly the ex-governor 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.880
 Kharkiv suspicion announced 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.739
 a word it is a question only of the official in 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.140
 warning to refrain from 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.420
 illegal actions of the prosecutor's office and Dobkin 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.850
 also not arrested after which he goes 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.739
 to the airport take the passport however in 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.500
 vip-hall as with the governor affably 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.940
 include only attendants 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.220
 ordinary representatives of the frontier service and 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.079
 vahagna is ridden before the head of department says 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.600
 dobkin he managed to get through on the way 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.549
 then you advised to go to the airport but 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.890
 then no one does not give clear answers and 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.739
 the telephone number of the head of the border service is no longer 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.720

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.400
 governing bodies 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.290
 I generally regard the return of my 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.870
 passports as a violation of my rights to 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.090

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.310

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.939
 apply for registration 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.250
 however, without a passport it will be 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.170
 problematic on the question why dabke but 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.879

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.069
