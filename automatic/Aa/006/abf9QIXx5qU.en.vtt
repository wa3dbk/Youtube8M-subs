00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:22.940 
whole lot different it just looks a
whole<00:02:09.570> lot<00:02:09.600> cleaner<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.530> me

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.340 

so<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.190> guess<00:02:24.670> we<00:02:24.850> will<00:02:25.000> start<00:02:25.300> right<00:02:25.720> here<00:02:26.140> I

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
so I guess we will start right here I

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.130 
so I guess we will start right here I
have<00:02:26.740> this<00:02:27.190> flip-flop<00:02:28.030> organizer<00:02:28.720> which<00:02:29.020> i

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
have this flip-flop organizer which i

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.950 
have this flip-flop organizer which i
think<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.500> amazing<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.030> from<00:02:31.660> The

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
think is amazing and it is from The

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.870 
think is amazing and it is from The

Container Store and it holds a lot of
pairs<00:02:34.030> of<00:02:34.180> flip-flops<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.810> just<00:02:35.110> slide

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
pairs of flip-flops and you just slide

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.550 
pairs of flip-flops and you just slide
them<00:02:35.620> on<00:02:35.770> like<00:02:35.950> that<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.400> then<00:02:37.360> right<00:02:37.870> here<00:02:37.900> I

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
double them up because I have so many

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.030 
double them up because I have so many

Target and it is actually three shoe

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.250 
Target and it is actually three shoe
racks<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:17.340> one<00:03:18.340> stops<00:03:19.060> there<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.840> other<00:03:20.020> one

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
racks so one stops there the other one

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.920 
racks so one stops there the other one
goes<00:03:20.470> till<00:03:20.740> there<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.880> then<00:03:22.510> this<00:03:22.600> is<00:03:22.780> another

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
goes till there and then this is another

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.340 
goes till there and then this is another
mini<00:03:23.530> one<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.030> like<00:03:25.330> to<00:03:25.450> organize<00:03:25.570> my<00:03:25.810> shoes

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
mini one so I like to organize my shoes

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.400 
mini one so I like to organize my shoes
by<00:03:27.100> having<00:03:27.550> one<00:03:28.150> shoe<00:03:28.420> facing<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:28.960> front<00:03:29.110> and

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
by having one shoe facing the front and

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.530 
by having one shoe facing the front and
one<00:03:29.590> shoe<00:03:29.860> facing<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.610> back<00:03:30.790> just<00:03:31.210> so<00:03:31.360> that

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
one shoe facing the back just so that

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.840 
one shoe facing the back just so that
you<00:03:31.660> can<00:03:31.780> see<00:03:32.110> everything<00:03:32.830> better<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.700> only

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
you can see everything better the only

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.150 
you can see everything better the only
thing<00:03:34.150> about<00:03:34.270> this<00:03:34.600> shoe<00:03:35.020> rack<00:03:35.230> is<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:36.040> you

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
thing about this shoe rack is that you

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.190 
thing about this shoe rack is that you
can't<00:03:36.520> really<00:03:36.940> store<00:03:37.330> heels<00:03:37.660> on<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.080> have

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
can't really store heels on it you have

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.710 
can't really store heels on it you have
to<00:03:38.260> store<00:03:38.530> them<00:03:38.620> on<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.710> top<00:03:39.000> okay<00:03:40.000> why<00:03:40.270> I<00:03:40.300> have

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
to store them on the top okay why I have

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.200 
to store them on the top okay why I have
heels<00:03:40.990> in<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.140> bottom<00:03:41.680> um<00:03:42.130> but<00:03:42.910> other<00:03:43.030> than

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
heels in the bottom um but other than

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.640 
heels in the bottom um but other than
that<00:03:43.300> I<00:03:43.570> really<00:03:43.600> like<00:03:44.140> it

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
that I really like it

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.330 
that I really like it
so<00:03:45.310> then<00:03:45.460> down<00:03:45.850> here<00:03:46.360> I<00:03:46.540> have<00:03:47.110> I<00:03:47.620> just<00:03:47.710> struggle

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
so then down here I have I just struggle

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.380 
so then down here I have I just struggle
with<00:03:49.950> organizing<00:03:50.950> my<00:03:51.150> sandals<00:03:52.150> because

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
with organizing my sandals because

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.540 
with organizing my sandals because
obviously<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.260> figured<00:03:53.890> out<00:03:53.980> how<00:03:54.100> to<00:03:54.130> organize

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
obviously I figured out how to organize

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.500 
obviously I figured out how to organize
my<00:03:56.520> flip-flops<00:03:57.520> and<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:57.850> could<00:03:58.060> do<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.330> same

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
my flip-flops and I could do the same

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.540 
my flip-flops and I could do the same
with<00:03:58.690> my<00:03:58.840> sandals<00:03:59.290> I<00:03:59.470> don't<00:03:59.770> know<00:04:00.130> why<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.370> don't

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
with my sandals I don't know why I don't

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.480 
with my sandals I don't know why I don't
but<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:01.270> don't<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:01.930> so<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:02.680> just<00:04:03.010> have<00:04:03.220> it<00:04:03.370> this

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
but I don't and so I just have it this

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.640 
but I don't and so I just have it this
big<00:04:03.850> clear<00:04:04.360> container<00:04:04.930> from<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.260> Container

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
big clear container from the Container

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.180 
big clear container from the Container
Store<00:04:05.740> where<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:07.000> just<00:04:07.710> have<00:04:08.710> almost<00:04:09.010> flip

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
Store where I just have almost flip

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.360 
Store where I just have almost flip
flops<00:04:09.430> or<00:04:09.790> my<00:04:09.940> sandals<00:04:10.360> in<00:04:10.540> so<00:04:11.200> they<00:04:11.530> just<00:04:11.770> they

flops or my sandals in so they just they

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.010 
flops or my sandals in so they just they
looked<00:04:12.580> prettier<00:04:13.060> when<00:04:13.240> I<00:04:13.270> first<00:04:13.570> organized

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
looked prettier when I first organized

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.930 
looked prettier when I first organized
them<00:04:14.290> but<00:04:14.620> this<00:04:14.950> is<00:04:15.010> what<00:04:15.190> they<00:04:15.459> look<00:04:15.610> like<00:04:15.640> now

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
them but this is what they look like now

as you go up you can see I have a bunch

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.330 
as you go up you can see I have a bunch
of<00:04:18.580> clear<00:04:18.790> boxes<00:04:19.299> for<00:04:19.510> organization<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.410> they

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
of clear boxes for organization and they
