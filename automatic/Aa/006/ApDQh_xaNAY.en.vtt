00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.450
 hello guys we come back with a new 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.459
 tutorial on windows 8 and that is that when 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.680
 a problem causes windows can not 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.109
 boot correctly or a virus does not 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.820
 allows us to delete the files in 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.310
 those who stay because we 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.220
 literally prohibits closing processes 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.710
 of system that keeps them occupied the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.050
 most immediate solution is to enter 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.909
 windows in safe mode and carry out 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.790
 the relevant actions 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:37.310
 however when you want or need 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.220
 enter windows 8 safe mode 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.580
 you will see that the typical option of pressing 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.440
 efe 8 serves us for such a task as 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.100
 this mode is not activated by default 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.710
 in windows 8 so in the tutorial of 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.410
 Today we are going to teach you how to enable or 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.080
 activate the safe mode allowing 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.460
 always be available for use in 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.460
 case of necessity 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.530
 inside windows 8 opening the menu 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.420
 search we write cmt and we click 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.330
 right to activate the options 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.890
 advanced from which we will execute 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:20.020
 said command as administrator now 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.210
 that we have the symbol of the system 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.160
 to copy the load structure of 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.430
 files and windows 8 boot 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:32.050
 through a simple and fast line of 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:36.400
 commands we wrote the following b / c's 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.320
 edit bar in a bar v with this 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.450
 command we order to show the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.570
 properties and bootloader information 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.729
 of windows 8 as we want to copy the one that 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.830
 we have to apply later 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.680
 a boot configuration in mode 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.290
 sure we will copy the identifier of the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.350
 way that we see and we will include it in a 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.290
 new command line that we show you 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.770
 now we write 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.520
 from edith barr copy we paste the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.330
 identifier of open quotes mode 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.900
 safe space space script facebook and 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.830
 we close quotes now press center 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.870
 and we write the ms config command from 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.210
 which through the tab start 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.210
 activate in the safe mode option 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.350
 we will also activate in the box to 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.870
 keep options active and if 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.569
 we want to lower the waiting time of 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.840
 default load of windows 8 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.470
 now click on apply accept and 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.470
 we restart 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.830
 by doing this our windows 8 will start 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.220
 to start and it will show a blue screen 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.890
 with two load options the normal and the 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.450
 boot windows in safe mode 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.640
 way that at any time that 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.319
 we have to use it be available and 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.439
 no more problems 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.439
 yes 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.780
 Now, if our team allows us 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.670
 enter the system without problems there is a 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.340
 option that we can use temporarily 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.680
 to enable safe mode the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.290
 problem of using this method is that only 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.260
 is valid if we have access because if not 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.420
 it's like that there will be no way of doing it but of 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.239
 we will show you how to 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.160
 carries out we will access the panel of 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.989
 control from the metro interface and 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.610
 we will select the option to change 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.610
 pc configuration 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.910
 inside we will go to general use and press 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.910
 on start to advanced 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.920
 we will see a blue screen where 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.019
 we can click several options which 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.989
 today concerns us is the solver of 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.750
 problems so we press and choose 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.019
 advanced options of the three possible 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.019
 options 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.510
 Now let's click on settings 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.370
 start and we will click on restart what 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.370
 what we do is activate the menu that 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.859
 activate before in windows xp vista or 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.560
 windows 7 when pressing the key 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.330
 Efe 8 during the start therefore 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.820
 we restart and follow the 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.210
 menu instructions by clicking on the 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.610
 number 4 5 or 6 depending on the 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.550
 needs that we have when activating the 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.550
 safe mode remember that this option 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.800
 It only works for once and you can only 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.800
 activate from within windows 8
