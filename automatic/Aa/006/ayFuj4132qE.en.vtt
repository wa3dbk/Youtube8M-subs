what else has explosives what else has
power<00:00:33.540> what<00:00:33.960> else<00:00:34.110> has<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:35.130> know<00:00:35.570> disaster

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
power what else has you know disaster

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:57.620 
power what else has you know disaster
written<00:00:36.750> all<00:00:36.899> over<00:00:36.960> it

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.900 

so<00:00:58.630> we<00:00:58.750> had<00:00:58.930> our<00:00:58.960> rocket<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.740> USS<00:01:00.310> tippy<00:01:00.760> and

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
so we had our rocket the USS tippy and

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.720 
so we had our rocket the USS tippy and
we<00:01:01.540> knew<00:01:01.720> as<00:01:01.870> a<00:01:01.900> fly<00:01:02.290> but<00:01:03.190> now<00:01:03.400> we<00:01:03.460> are

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
we knew as a fly but now we are

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.140 
we knew as a fly but now we are
attaching<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.740> iPhones<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:06.100> cases<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:07.000> it

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
attaching to iPhones and cases to it

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.260 
attaching to iPhones and cases to it
with<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.860> weighs<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.100> million<00:01:12.610> thousand<00:01:13.090> tons

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
with this weighs a million thousand tons

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:25.170 
with this weighs a million thousand tons
is<00:01:14.170> it<00:01:14.380> going<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.560> fly<00:01:20.310> find<00:01:21.310> out<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:24.490> it<00:01:24.670> did<00:01:24.910> we

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
is it going to fly find out if it did we

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.900 
is it going to fly find out if it did we
had<00:01:25.270> other<00:01:25.450> problems<00:01:25.930> trees<00:01:26.320> lights<00:01:27.040> angry

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
had other problems trees lights angry

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.060 
had other problems trees lights angry
locals<00:01:28.090> with<00:01:28.420> bats<00:01:28.660> or<00:01:29.229> they<00:01:29.410> could<00:01:29.619> fall<00:01:29.860> off

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
locals with bats or they could fall off

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:54.600 
locals with bats or they could fall off
and<00:01:30.340> just<00:01:30.490> land<00:01:30.759> in<00:01:30.970> traffic<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.369> it<00:01:54.460> was

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
and just land in traffic and so it was

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.940 
and just land in traffic and so it was
back<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.060> lab<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.990> create<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.830> mark<00:01:57.130> to

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:17.880 

okay<00:02:02.950> go<00:02:03.220> no<00:02:03.490> no<00:02:03.760> no<00:02:14.880> failure<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.150> launch<00:02:16.890> I

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
okay go no no no failure to launch I

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.590 
okay go no no no failure to launch I
thought<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.520> best<00:02:18.640> part<00:02:18.970> was<00:02:19.000> actually<00:02:19.240> at

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
thought the best part was actually at

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.270 
thought the best part was actually at
the<00:02:19.720> end<00:02:19.870> when<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.380> rocket<00:02:20.740> just<00:02:20.770> went<00:02:21.100> down

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
the end when the rocket just went down

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.270 
the end when the rocket just went down
and<00:02:21.640> then<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.090> chute<00:02:22.780> pops<00:02:23.050> yeah<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.980> Atlas

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
and then the chute pops yeah the Atlas

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.820 
and then the chute pops yeah the Atlas
that<00:02:24.490> was<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.670> hash<00:02:24.880> failed<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.510> our<00:02:25.600> little

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
that was a hash failed to our little

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.770 
that was a hash failed to our little
experience<00:02:26.830> EPO<00:02:27.160> bomb-proof<00:02:27.730> nor<00:02:28.480> the

experience EPO bomb-proof nor the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.420 
experience EPO bomb-proof nor the
otterbox<00:02:29.110> defender<00:02:29.170> could<00:02:29.680> protect<00:02:30.040> us<00:02:30.220> from

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
otterbox defender could protect us from

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.630 
otterbox defender could protect us from
making<00:02:30.790> fools<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.240> ourselves

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.490 

did<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:33.880> add<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.120> be<00:02:34.270> for<00:02:34.420> next<00:02:34.510> time<00:02:34.690> yeah

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
did you add that be for next time yeah
