00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.569
 as it caused too much commotion 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.840

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.150
 video for you is nothing more than one 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.330
 fabric that transforms any vegetable 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.580
 in pasta that same you that you love 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.170
 eating pasta more worries about 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.420
 amount of carbohydrate 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.869
 I come to show you this new 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.519
 intensive in today's demo I 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.099
 I'll use zucchini but you can use 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.430
 also cucumber the two replied that I had 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.880
 good results so just spin spin 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.500
 rotate has no difficulty is 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.809
 on one side that is for the noodles 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.030
 thick and has a side that noodles 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.030
 Finer I 'm using thin side 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.050
 and it looks because more precious information 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.690
 four cups of common noodles has 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.530
 more than 800 calories and 160 grams of 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.140
 carbohydrate 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.080
 but the same portion of this folder 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.460
 zucchini has only 60 calories and eight 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.170
 grams of carbohydrate 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.950
 so it's good for you there too 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.110
 Look how incredible it looks is 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.790
 recommended cut into four pieces 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.890
 after you go around running 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.650
 running because it gets so endless 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.920
 people feel very interesting when 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.530

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.240
 frying oil which is 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.500
 Cooking okay 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.600

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.720

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:57.390
 cover with a pump as the top and 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.800
 wait to poke the spot you like 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.020
 then after the manufacturer has a 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.600
 point you like just add the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.330
