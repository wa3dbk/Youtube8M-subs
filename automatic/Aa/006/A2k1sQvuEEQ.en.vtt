and other environmental factors and this
can<00:01:54.080> lead<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.350> like<00:01:54.710> I<00:01:54.800> said<00:01:54.980> before<00:01:55.070> in<00:01:55.370> the<00:01:55.460> in

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
can lead to like I said before in the in

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.090 
can lead to like I said before in the in
the<00:01:55.640> video<00:01:55.940> too<00:01:56.570> tangled<00:01:56.930> hair<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.470> dry<00:01:57.620> hair

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
the video too tangled hair to dry hair

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.610 
the video too tangled hair to dry hair
to<00:01:58.610> loss<00:01:58.880> of<00:01:59.150> elasticity<00:01:59.660> in<00:02:00.080> our<00:02:00.200> hair<00:02:00.410> which

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
to loss of elasticity in our hair which

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.440 
to loss of elasticity in our hair which
can<00:02:00.770> lead<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:00.890> breakage<00:02:01.430> damage<00:02:01.970> things<00:02:02.270> that

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
can lead to breakage damage things that

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.610 
can lead to breakage damage things that
we<00:02:02.570> do<00:02:02.690> not<00:02:02.840> want

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
we do not want

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.320 
we do not want
and<00:02:03.770> if<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.310> really<00:02:04.490> think<00:02:04.730> about<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.030> even

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
and if you really think about it even

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.570 
and if you really think about it even
though<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.600> am<00:02:05.720> relaxed<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:06.980> is<00:02:07.130> kind<00:02:07.370> of<00:02:07.430> how

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
though I am relaxed this is kind of how

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.850 
though I am relaxed this is kind of how
relaxes<00:02:08.150> work<00:02:08.360> okay<00:02:09.050> now<00:02:09.260> relaxers

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
relaxes work okay now relaxers

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.560 
relaxes work okay now relaxers
especially<00:02:10.280> live<00:02:10.490> relaxes<00:02:10.940> have<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.120> really

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
especially live relaxes have a really

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.490 
especially live relaxes have a really
high<00:02:12.340> basic<00:02:13.340> ph<00:02:13.640> between<00:02:14.360> 12-13<00:02:15.020> you<00:02:15.380> know

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
high basic ph between 12-13 you know

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.190 
high basic ph between 12-13 you know
live<00:02:15.800> some<00:02:16.160> hydroxide<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.090> what<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:17.990> does

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
live some hydroxide and what that does

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.490 
live some hydroxide and what that does
is<00:02:18.260> designed<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.250> open<00:02:19.580> up<00:02:19.760> our<00:02:19.910> cuticle

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
is designed to open up our cuticle

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.290 
is designed to open up our cuticle
that's<00:02:21.500> why<00:02:21.740> it's<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:21.980> high<00:02:22.310> in<00:02:22.610> PA<00:02:22.850> that's<00:02:23.150> why

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
that's why it's so high in PA that's why

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.690 
that's why it's so high in PA that's why
it's<00:02:23.570> so<00:02:23.660> basic<00:02:23.960> is<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.040> can<00:02:25.160> open<00:02:25.310> up<00:02:25.520> that

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
it's so basic is so it can open up that

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.340 
it's so basic is so it can open up that
cuticle<00:02:26.030> because<00:02:26.540> what's<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:26.930> cuticle<00:02:27.170> is

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
cuticle because what's that cuticle is

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.410 
cuticle because what's that cuticle is
open<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:28.160> relaxer<00:02:28.610> can<00:02:28.760> get<00:02:28.940> straight<00:02:29.300> into

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
open the relaxer can get straight into

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.840 
open the relaxer can get straight into
the<00:02:29.540> cortex<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:31.040> is<00:02:31.250> pretty<00:02:31.520> much<00:02:31.670> what

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
the cortex and that is pretty much what

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.690 
the cortex and that is pretty much what
permanently<00:02:32.770> changes<00:02:33.770> our<00:02:33.950> curl<00:02:34.310> pattern

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
permanently changes our curl pattern

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.610 
permanently changes our curl pattern
making<00:02:34.940> our<00:02:35.180> crow<00:02:35.420> pattern<00:02:35.780> straight<00:02:36.260> it

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
making our crow pattern straight it

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.350 
making our crow pattern straight it
changes<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:37.280> permanently<00:02:37.790> because<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.180> gets

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
changes it permanently because it gets

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.270 
changes it permanently because it gets
straight<00:02:38.690> into<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.020> core<00:02:39.320> where<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:40.010> needs<00:02:40.190> to

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
straight into the core where it needs to

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.570 
straight into the core where it needs to
go<00:02:40.400> now<00:02:41.620> when<00:02:42.620> we<00:02:42.770> use<00:02:42.950> products<00:02:43.430> like

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
go now when we use products like

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.420 
go now when we use products like
relaxers<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.390> even<00:02:44.810> shampoos<00:02:45.290> yes<00:02:45.920> shampoos

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
relaxers and even shampoos yes shampoos

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.710 
relaxers and even shampoos yes shampoos
can<00:02:46.610> be<00:02:46.700> very<00:02:46.940> high<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:48.200> know<00:02:48.320> basic

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
can be very high and you know basic

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.240 
can be very high and you know basic
conditioners<00:02:50.720> can<00:02:50.900> be<00:02:50.990> basic<00:02:51.350> as<00:02:51.470> well<00:02:51.680> that's

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
conditioners can be basic as well that's

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.010 
conditioners can be basic as well that's
why<00:02:52.430> it's<00:02:52.580> so<00:02:52.640> important<00:02:53.210> to<00:02:53.360> just<00:02:53.630> figure<00:02:53.900> out

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
why it's so important to just figure out

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.720 
why it's so important to just figure out
what<00:02:54.560> works<00:02:54.800> for<00:02:54.980> us<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.340> will<00:02:55.490> talk<00:02:55.610> about

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
what works for us and I will talk about

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.700 
what works for us and I will talk about
that<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:56.330> little<00:02:56.600> bit<00:02:56.810> later<00:02:57.020> on<00:02:57.110> but<00:02:57.500> what<00:02:57.620> I'm

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
that a little bit later on but what I'm

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.040 
that a little bit later on but what I'm
saying<00:02:58.040> now<00:02:58.280> is<00:02:58.310> when<00:02:59.120> we<00:02:59.210> use<00:02:59.450> products<00:02:59.960> that

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
saying now is when we use products that

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.920 
saying now is when we use products that
have<00:03:00.320> high<00:03:00.710> pH<00:03:01.070> or<00:03:01.190> products<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.850> take<00:03:02.810> us

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
have high pH or products that take us

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.410 
have high pH or products that take us
out<00:03:03.140> of<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.350> ideal<00:03:03.980> PH<00:03:04.520> range<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:05.000> we<00:03:05.030> want

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
out of that ideal PH range that we want

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.210 
out of that ideal PH range that we want
to<00:03:05.570> have<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.870> have<00:03:05.960> healthy<00:03:06.320> hair<00:03:06.350> this<00:03:06.980> is<00:03:07.070> our

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
to have to have healthy hair this is our

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.340 
to have to have healthy hair this is our
job<00:03:07.520> to<00:03:07.580> get<00:03:07.820> it<00:03:07.880> back<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.660> normal<00:03:09.050> it's<00:03:09.170> our

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
job to get it back to normal it's our

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.949 
job to get it back to normal it's our
