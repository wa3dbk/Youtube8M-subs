light 30 and wasting 21 and wastin will
advance<00:01:01.559> now<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.420> Wayson<00:01:03.420> loses<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.320> match

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
there'll be one and two and the trick

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.510 
there'll be one and two and the trick
then<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:09.409> light<00:01:10.409> beats<00:01:10.770> virus<00:01:11.310> and

then is that if light beats virus and
not<00:01:11.640> instance<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:13.670> Wayson<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.299> july<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
not instance then Wayson and july and

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.539 
not instance then Wayson and july and
iris<00:01:18.479> will<00:01:18.659> all<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.350> two<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.890> i'm<00:01:20.189> not

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
iris will all be one and two and i'm not

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.950 
iris will all be one and two and i'm not
really<00:01:20.759> sure<00:01:20.850> how<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.270> works<00:01:21.360> honestly<00:01:21.840> but

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
really sure how that works honestly but

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.179 
really sure how that works honestly but
i<00:01:22.049> think<00:01:22.290> they'll<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.500> some<00:01:22.830> kind<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
i think they'll have some kind of a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.600 
i think they'll have some kind of a
runoff<00:01:23.460> match<00:01:24.380> matches<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:26.280> figure<00:01:26.520> out

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
runoff match matches to to figure out

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.539 
runoff match matches to to figure out
who<00:01:26.729> actually<00:01:26.850> gets<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.360> other<00:01:28.070> spot<00:01:29.070> from

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
who actually gets that other spot from

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.649 
who actually gets that other spot from
this<00:01:29.729> group<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:31.159> either<00:01:32.159> way<00:01:32.520> first<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.630> all

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
this group so either way first of all

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.260 
this group so either way first of all
this<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.020> july<00:01:34.770> Zergs<00:01:35.100> only<00:01:35.640> chance<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
this is july Zergs only chance of

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.480 
this is july Zergs only chance of
continuing<00:01:37.079> because<00:01:37.530> he<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.130> then<00:01:38.369> he

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
continuing because he was this then he

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.719 
continuing because he was this then he
zone<00:01:38.700> 3<00:01:39.030> there's<00:01:39.240> no<00:01:39.360> chance<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.869> on

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
zone 3 there's no chance of going on

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.950 
zone 3 there's no chance of going on
although<00:01:41.729> honestly<00:01:41.939> july<00:01:42.509> zerk<00:01:42.720> really

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
although honestly july zerk really

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.319 
although honestly july zerk really
doesn't<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> chance<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.799> hillsboro<00:01:44.329> even

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
doesn't have a chance in hillsboro even

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.020 
doesn't have a chance in hillsboro even
if<00:01:45.450> he<00:01:45.570> does<00:01:45.810> win<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.259> match<00:01:46.579> it<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:47.729> still

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
if he does win this match it was still

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.160 
if he does win this match it was still
likely<00:01:48.689> he<00:01:48.960> won't<00:01:49.079> feel<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> event

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
likely he won't feel the event

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.510 
likely he won't feel the event
unfortunately<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.710> haven't<00:01:53.250> really

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
unfortunately I haven't really

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.450 
unfortunately I haven't really
fertilizer<00:01:54.090> lately<00:01:54.659> he<00:01:55.590> played<00:01:56.189> really<00:01:56.369> well

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
fertilizer lately he played really well

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.370 
fertilizer lately he played really well
for<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.909> little<00:01:57.090> while<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.540> then<00:01:57.630> he<00:01:58.049> started

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
for a little while and then he started

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.030 
for a little while and then he started
sucking<00:01:58.799> and

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
sucking and

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.660 
sucking and
playing<00:02:01.610> you<00:02:02.090> know<00:02:02.180> up<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.300> what<00:02:02.690> he<00:02:02.780> could<00:02:03.020> and

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
playing you know up to what he could and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.030 
playing you know up to what he could and
so<00:02:04.900> if<00:02:05.900> he's<00:02:06.050> plays<00:02:06.290> like<00:02:06.590> he<00:02:06.620> has<00:02:06.860> been

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
so if he's plays like he has been

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.680 
so if he's plays like he has been
recently<00:02:07.430> I<00:02:07.520> don't<00:02:07.820> expect<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.300> really<00:02:08.509> doing

that's<00:04:45.530> one<00:04:45.710> of<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.830> reasons<00:04:46.130> why<00:04:46.250> they<00:04:46.550> get

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
that's one of the reasons why they get

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.129 
that's one of the reasons why they get
that<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:48.580> Factory<00:04:49.580> early<00:04:50.120> on<00:04:50.240> in<00:04:50.539> this<00:04:50.930> case

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
that that Factory early on in this case

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.659 
that that Factory early on in this case
what's<00:04:51.380> going<00:04:51.590> on<00:04:51.710> is<00:04:51.800> wasted<00:04:52.160> is<00:04:52.250> getting<00:04:52.520> a

what's going on is wasted is getting a
some<00:04:53.270> siege<00:04:53.479> tanks<00:04:53.810> and<00:04:53.990> probably<00:04:54.740> what<00:04:54.919> is

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
some siege tanks and probably what is

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.129 
some siege tanks and probably what is

going to be doing is well maybe siege

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.480 
going to be doing is well maybe siege
tanks<00:04:57.440> I<00:04:57.500> thought<00:04:57.680> upgrading<00:04:58.039> seen<00:04:58.190> him<00:04:58.310> over

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
tanks I thought upgrading seen him over

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.580 
tanks I thought upgrading seen him over
anything<00:04:58.639> like<00:04:58.910> that<00:04:58.970> but<00:04:59.600> um<00:04:59.810> often<00:05:00.500> what

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
anything like that but um often what

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
anything like that but um often what
you'll<00:05:00.620> see<00:05:00.919> is<00:05:01.070> they'll<00:05:01.220> get<00:05:01.340> a<00:05:01.370> group<00:05:01.550> of

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.339 
you'll see is they'll get a group of
Marines<00:05:02.090> and<00:05:02.300> then<00:05:02.479> it's<00:05:02.660> hard<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.990> push<00:05:03.169> off

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.950 
Marines and then it's hard to push off
because<00:05:04.210> desert<00:05:05.210> players<00:05:05.450> will<00:05:05.630> put<00:05:05.810> down<00:05:05.930> a

bit separated there he does have the

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.120 
bit separated there he does have the
medics<00:06:25.440> next<00:06:25.650> to<00:06:25.710> it<00:06:25.800> but<00:06:25.890> it<00:06:25.950> looks<00:06:26.100> like

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
medics next to it but it looks like

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.590

those<00:06:26.340> tanks<00:06:26.640> are<00:06:26.700> going<00:06:26.850> to<00:06:26.910> go<00:06:27.000> down<00:06:27.180> the

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
those tanks are going to go down the

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.210 
those tanks are going to go down the
fire<00:06:27.630> bats<00:06:28.110> are<00:06:28.290> basically<00:06:28.650> what<00:06:28.860> one<00:06:29.040> that

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
fire bats are basically what one that

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.750 
fire bats are basically what one that
that<00:06:30.120> uh<00:06:30.150> that<00:06:30.720> battle<00:06:31.260> therefore<00:06:31.680> wasted<00:06:32.460> and

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
that uh that battle therefore wasted and

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.550 
that uh that battle therefore wasted and
without<00:06:33.060> those<00:06:33.210> firebats<00:06:33.600> I<00:06:33.720> think<00:06:33.930> it<00:06:34.380> would

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
without those firebats I think it would

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.050 
without those firebats I think it would
have<00:06:34.650> gone<00:06:34.680> down<00:06:34.920> the<00:06:35.280> fire<00:06:35.490> bats<00:06:35.730> are<00:06:35.880> going

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
have gone down the fire bats are going

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.920 
have gone down the fire bats are going
