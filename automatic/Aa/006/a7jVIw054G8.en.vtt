00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.799
 they are all guys who are also talking and 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.990
 welcome to this brand new video 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.059
 this today finally after so long 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.099
 and I have to believe this video had a little 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.629
 of unforeseen however also the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.460
 uploading videos you can see that 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.650
 there have been many slowdowns 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.160
 however let's say I don't waste time 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.200
 I bring my album of soccer players already po 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.390
 all the figures stuck to make you 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.340
 to see precisely which cartens are missing 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.000
 in fact, what figures do I miss as I have the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.000
 my point, in short, a bit of this in 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.550
 now I don't know one in the video 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.260
 window with if you click on it 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.089
 you will appear in the video of my doubles 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.329
 in fact I intend to do for example 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.489
 I miss this card, but not any other 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.589
 various you see that I miss 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.089
 ok, sail marked or otherwise 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.100
 I will then write my name below 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.629
 in description where to see the video 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.519
 in short, we see some of the double 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.979
 to exchange for a short time 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:03.059
 announcement before starting exchange 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.830
 only from 10 upwards 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.900
 figurines because otherwise it would not have 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.930
 meaning that I would go and lose here 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.210
 so i'd say we can win with 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.040
 the ok album you see here the ones I got 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.310
 they are missing, however, I will put in 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.160
 description as in a case moon will put 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.890
 in description the numbers of the 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.410
 cards that I miss so maybe it is also 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.270
 faster, however, more settled here 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.740
 therefore I must say that I am put 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.140
 quite well with some teams 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.440
 even some I'm almost finishing it 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.930
 like now the rome the parma lacks me 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.790
 very few of these, really 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.310
 a few really few this year 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.510
 to complete it album because I like it 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.610
 really so much that in case I do n't know 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.770
 stopped the video you see a little that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.460
 that I miss or just like I already have 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.290
 said go see in description 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.030
 I would also like to apologize for the fact that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.850
 I am no longer uploading video of openings 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.290
 pokÃ©mon thing that I'm sorry enough 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.650
 much but I'm having some problems 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.140
 that 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.140
 I saw here saying but I think anyway 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.420
 that maybe with the new expansion 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.840
 some opening videos maybe so 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:25.380
 I get to something that is not there 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:29.100
 worry that I hope it's not much 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.030
 along the video stop then there is the 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.000
 palermo more than a beautiful beautiful shield 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:40.980
 like not missing 3 here is a little bit 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.890
 also on the second the parma and look 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.600
 the team is missing only the championship 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.220
 I finished it all and miss it 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.310
 never sees and the figure kwikwick but here in 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.270
 rome also coach championship then here 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.270
 all full third shirt is cool here 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:04.440
 here because I call it here serving cool 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.350
 quiz or more here but that alone makes a 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:15.420
 focus mode between very bad a tad 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:18.600
 bad turin we do not say here ends the 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.640
 series but these are then not involved 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.500
 nothing for now making alloy go 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.140
 spring with fines throughout the group c 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.880
 as not with a little but we come 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.090
 I hope to do so many exchanges 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.060
 obviously with the exchanges then we see a 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.070
 case for those who do not give the first five I think 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.430
 to send to the other side before 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.070
 in series b I sent I sent ho 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.320
 only a team finished such 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:51.900
 they lack the writer's bond to finish them all 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:55.880
 and you only trust the catania 5 a 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.880
 and series b are put on pretty well 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:06.200
 even if there is a livorno it brings them here 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:08.840
 it's not a bit that the way 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.840
 look like it's called the panini tour 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.050
 and arriving in palermo data also make me 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.840
 a nice favor 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.730
 yes because I think I go there a case that 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.430
 every year helped me anyway 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:27.950
 exchange a lot of cards here because 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:32.830
 don't go the goats or I'm put 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:37.820
 quite good at the costumino even here 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:42.080
 it is known if this which one will come has 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.870
 look carefully that I found ours 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.210
 go and okay i'm not even put off 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.770
 so bad here just look and then 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.020
 finish doing right for Italy 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.800
 it will lose so there is nothing left 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.000
 well guys i hope you contact me in 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.640
 many give us 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.110
 you asked for a nice album and nothing 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.710
 story a good act is sitting at 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.710
 rosina day
