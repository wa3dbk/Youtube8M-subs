AI there's a bit of an issue with the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.389 
AI there's a bit of an issue with the
play-calling<00:00:51.469> apparently<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.680> computer

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
play-calling apparently this computer

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.430 
play-calling apparently this computer
controlled<00:00:53.760> teams<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.600> play<00:00:54.809> calling<00:00:55.170> is

controlled teams that play calling is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.400 
controlled teams that play calling is
just<00:00:55.739> atrocious<00:00:56.219> I've<00:00:56.699> noticed<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.239> too<00:00:57.449> for

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
just atrocious I've noticed it too for

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.080 
just atrocious I've noticed it too for
example<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> Saints<00:00:59.309> were<00:00:59.399> running<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> ball

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
example the Saints were running the ball

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.580 
example the Saints were running the ball
more<00:01:00.329> than<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.629> were<00:01:00.690> passing<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:01.469> would

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
more than they were passing they would

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.500 
more than they were passing they would
run<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.890> ball<00:01:02.039> first<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.640> second<00:01:03.090> down<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
run the ball first and second down and

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.329 
run the ball first and second down and
they<00:01:03.899> wouldn't<00:01:04.140> start<00:01:04.409> passing<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:05.070> until

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
they wouldn't start passing it until

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.179 
they wouldn't start passing it until
they<00:01:05.489> were<00:01:05.610> down<00:01:05.820> by<00:01:05.850> more<00:01:06.270> than<00:01:06.619> 14<00:01:07.619> points

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
they were down by more than 14 points

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.070 
they were down by more than 14 points
the<00:01:08.610> same<00:01:08.790> thing<00:01:09.000> with<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.150> Colts<00:01:09.600> they<00:01:10.020> were

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the same thing with the Colts they were

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.690 
the same thing with the Colts they were
just<00:01:10.290> running<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.799> non-stop<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.549> could

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
just running it non-stop you could

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.580 
just running it non-stop you could
barely<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.090> any<00:01:12.299> run<00:01:12.630> game<00:01:12.869> by<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.049> CPU

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
barely get any run game by the CPU

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.480 
barely get any run game by the CPU
offense<00:01:14.070> even<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:14.939> sliders<00:01:15.450> adjusted<00:01:16.049> so

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
offense even with sliders adjusted so

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.980 
offense even with sliders adjusted so
yeah<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.700> basically<00:01:18.060> broken<00:01:18.420> hopefully

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
yeah it's basically broken hopefully

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.320 
yeah it's basically broken hopefully
we'll<00:01:19.409> fix<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> patch<00:01:20.189> I'll<00:01:20.909> run

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
we'll fix with the patch I'll run

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.179 
we'll fix with the patch I'll run
