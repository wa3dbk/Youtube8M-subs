 of this specific object while I was 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.460
 looking at a little bit on e bay like

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.080
 internet of course the memory card and then 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.830
 I'll talk about manuals I do without 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.500
 to let you see it are the classic things 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.979
 introductory we are not interested in more than 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.619
 much 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.159
 below there are other manuals that do not 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.650
 estragon even while I show you 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.650
 the no cards of augmented reality 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.439
 very useful thing that in fact has 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:32.400
 used times type 0 times more or less 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:38.240
 and that probably a sero in the future 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:41.310
 the manuals are therefore never finished 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.869
 we see a small detail of the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:50.250
 box in here that there are others 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:54.320
 written in English maybe it goes well there 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.240
 interested we close the package that 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.430
 god loves me 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.430
 okay, we take the packaging away 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.299
 the charger let's see a lot 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.030
 to the fast charger that it was 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.099
 including we find this block between 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.349

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.450
 had just entered into the life and 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.830
 this thorn was contained here 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.500

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.140

 is very solid very robust that yes 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.900
 inspired by military packaging not for 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.810

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.420

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.010
 always a double analogue film 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:34.470

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:38.560

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.130
 savona reflection of so perfect so 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.050
 perfect 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.980
 in addition to this obviously 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.480
 littlebigplanet that contains a code 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.160
 so I don't show you the 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.890
 booklet skin of the booklet diskette 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.190
 if then, by the way, it is a version 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.930
 strange because already described water type 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:30.380
 however, they are almost the only ones 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.820
 conditions however the code is here 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.950
 script, however, the game in Italian then 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.610
 actually therefore no kind of 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.810
 problem 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:44.550
 obviously could not miss uncharted 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.410
 golden abyss game of which among other things the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.840
 box contains only the card of 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.450
 play not the booklet because get them 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.020
 to pay like 50 euros to do is get in it 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.040
 a booklet no and last but not least 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.090
 assassin's creed liberation 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.840

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.570

 well bought part obviously then 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.010
 I play the booklet until finally 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:18.230
 a booklet will be four pages 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:21.110
 because the letters are short booklet 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:25.650
 ridiculous though at least there is the booklet 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:28.140
 nothing I have concluded I hope there is 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.010

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:34.169
