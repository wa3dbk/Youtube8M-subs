and I you know I've learned a lot over

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.359 
and I you know I've learned a lot over
the<00:00:18.539> years<00:00:18.570> about<00:00:19.080> how<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.289> go<00:00:19.529> after<00:00:19.740> personal

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
the years about how to go after personal

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.150 
the years about how to go after personal
bests<00:00:20.789> I've<00:00:21.000> tried<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.750> many<00:00:21.990> times<00:00:22.560> different

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
bests I've tried it many times different

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.859 
bests I've tried it many times different
mental<00:00:23.519> approaches<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.359> into<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> race

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
mental approaches going into the race

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.660 
mental approaches going into the race
and<00:00:25.230> for<00:00:25.650> me<00:00:25.800> what<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.010> found<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.490> most

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and for me what I found is most

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.529 
and for me what I found is most
effective<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.570> take<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> pressure<00:00:28.140> off<00:00:28.400> by

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
effective is to take the pressure off by

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.359 
effective is to take the pressure off by
going<00:00:30.539> into<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> open<00:00:31.199> mind<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.949> you

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
going into it with the open mind of you

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.360 
going into it with the open mind of you
know<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.730> pacing<00:00:33.360> could<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.899> sporadic<00:00:34.380> we

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
know the pacing could be sporadic we

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.459 
know the pacing could be sporadic we
could<00:00:35.579> come<00:00:35.790> through<00:00:35.820> halfway<00:00:36.180> slower<00:00:36.719> just

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
could come through halfway slower just

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.049 
could come through halfway slower just
go<00:00:37.739> into<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.129> race<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.579> general

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
go into the race with this general

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.420 
go into the race with this general
feeling<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.079> yeah<00:00:40.320> I'm<00:00:40.469> gonna<00:00:40.620> run<00:00:40.800> fast<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
feeling of yeah I'm gonna run fast and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.979 
feeling of yeah I'm gonna run fast and
yeah<00:00:41.520> I'm<00:00:41.640> gonna<00:00:41.760> put<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.059> out<00:00:42.180> there<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.899> I'm

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
yeah I'm gonna put it out there but I'm

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.660 
yeah I'm gonna put it out there but I'm
just<00:00:43.020> gonna<00:00:43.230> let<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.530> kind<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.860> flow<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.430> me

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
just gonna let it kind of flow out of me

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.130 
just gonna let it kind of flow out of me
rather<00:00:45.090> than<00:00:45.539> trying<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.289> force<00:00:46.760> my<00:00:47.760> face<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
rather than trying to force my face and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.750 
rather than trying to force my face and
trying<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> force<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.890> effort<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.280> come<00:00:50.550> out

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
trying to force the effort to come out

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.250 
trying to force the effort to come out
and<00:00:51.059> going<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> race<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.199> this

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and going into the race for this

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.170 
and going into the race for this
mentality<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.920> i'ma<00:00:53.280> run<00:00:53.550> harder<00:00:53.940> than<00:00:54.090> I've

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
mentality of i'ma run harder than I've

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.299 
mentality of i'ma run harder than I've
ever<00:00:54.390> run<00:00:54.510> before<00:00:54.680> whenever<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.770> go<00:00:55.949> into<00:00:56.100> race

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
ever run before whenever I go into race

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.160 
ever run before whenever I go into race
with<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.640> mentality<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.270> tend<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:57.989> be

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
with that mentality I tend to not be

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.439 
with that mentality I tend to not be
able<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> run<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.800> hard<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.399> could<00:00:59.940> otherwise

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
able to run as hard as I could otherwise

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.840 
able to run as hard as I could otherwise
because<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> tense<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.680> because<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.609> this

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
because I tense up because of this

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.549 
because I tense up because of this
expectation<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.930> I'm<00:01:04.229> gonna<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.530> going

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
expectation that I'm gonna be going

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.929 
expectation that I'm gonna be going
through<00:01:04.830> something<00:01:05.129> harder<00:01:05.670> than<00:01:05.760> I've<00:01:05.850> ever

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
through something harder than I've ever

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.000 
through something harder than I've ever
done<00:01:06.180> before<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:07.080> rather<00:01:07.260> than<00:01:07.530> having<00:01:07.920> that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
done before so rather than having that

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.100 
done before so rather than having that
mentality<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.360> go<00:01:09.659> into<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> race

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
mentality I just go into the race

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.620 
mentality I just go into the race

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
gonna let this flow out of me I'm not

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.190 
gonna let this flow out of me I'm not
expecting<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.909> feel<00:01:15.090> easy<00:01:15.330> I'm<00:01:15.630> expecting

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
it to be a battle but it's something

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.450 
it to be a battle but it's something
that's<00:01:18.150> gonna<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.570> very<00:01:18.810> organic<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.799> it's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that's gonna be very organic and it's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.859 
that's gonna be very organic and it's
something<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:20.850> gonna<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.090> fun<00:01:21.360> with<00:01:21.540> that's

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
something I'm gonna have fun with that's

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.380 
something I'm gonna have fun with that's
another<00:01:22.259> way<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.009> my<00:01:23.369> body<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.790> relax

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
another way that I get my body to relax

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.359 
another way that I get my body to relax
because<00:01:24.900> your<00:01:25.080> body<00:01:25.259> certainly<00:01:25.650> performs

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
because your body certainly performs

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.490 
because your body certainly performs
better<00:01:26.580> when<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:27.210> relaxed<00:01:27.780> compared<00:01:28.200> doing

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
better when it's relaxed compared doing

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.260 
better when it's relaxed compared doing
they're<00:01:28.650> tense<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.640> any<00:01:29.820> thoughts<00:01:29.909> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
they're tense up so any thoughts that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
they're tense up so any thoughts that
you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.689> think<00:01:30.930> during<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.380> race<00:01:31.560> or<00:01:31.920> before

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you can think during the race or before

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.280 
you can think during the race or before
the<00:01:32.460> race<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> starting<00:01:33.329> line<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.869> help<00:01:34.079> your

body<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.860> stay<00:01:35.640> totally<00:01:36.000> relaxed<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:37.079> gonna

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
body to stay totally relaxed it's gonna
