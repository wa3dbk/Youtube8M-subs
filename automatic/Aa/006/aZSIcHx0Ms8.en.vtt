00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Hi guys, how are you today, then? 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.750
 he answered a tag that the music tag 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.059
 classical literature 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.849
 who invented this tag was jefferson and 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.700
 juliana from romeu and julieta channel and I will 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.619
 leave the link proposals there 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.960
 below and it's a land they try 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.170
 relate classic songs that they 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.140
 like then we expect a climate 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.640
 of these songs and ask us to point 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.130
 a book that also has a climate 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.689
 similar and they also made a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.669
 playlist with the songs they 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.399
 they chose already, I'll leave the link 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.079
 underneath very cool and were themselves 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.450
 who guided me then boy that thanks 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.760
 by invitation here is the answer to 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.789
 The first question concerns the four 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.270
 stations and is a book with 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.550
 lots of plot swings and good I go 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.219
 choose the flu my tears said the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.120
 The police officer's tip is a very 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:01.020
 very crazy and finally is a guy who 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.969
 wake up and he says he's not in the world 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.119
 him singing his world just that 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.939
 people do not know that 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.460
 he was a famous person and nobody 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.509
 acknowledges he is without document is 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.630
 no name is finally rolling in the world 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.780
 strange and even we really 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.840
 find out what happened to this guy 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.570
 a lot happens and it's a book that I 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.829
 I tell you, it's okay, but it's a 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.979
 very cool book 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.170
 Bossi, a lot of questions are about sonata. 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.409
 in the moonlight of beethoven and the question is a 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.140
 book that left the stretch the melancholic 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.689
 I do not know if I've already shown this book 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.350
 here on the channel I did not video this 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.500
 I'm sure but it's bone in me and in cff 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.280
 dave cliff 's glass memory is 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.850
 son of his turn and in this book he goes 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.990
 talk about the mother's death process 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.710
 his is basically she died of cancer 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.020
 in 2004 and spent a lot of time 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.300
 time dealing with 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.510
 This is very sad. 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.060
 It's very sad to know everything that she 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.560
 and it's very sad to see the reactions 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.450
 anyway it's a tight fit so it's worth 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.190
 worth it especially if you like the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.590
 your accounts 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.350
 The third question is the attempt before 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.970
 French a book that you are afraid of 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.490
 read or re-read good fear fear so I 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.340
 I think I do not have it but I do not 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.050
 choosing the sustainable lightness the right 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.960
 do not give 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.570
 It's a book that I should do to you. 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.150
 eight years or so 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.660
 I do not remember so much of him but I 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.250
 I remember liking it very well and I 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.040
 I want to reread 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.790
 but I'm a little afraid of changing 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.360
 much to my my feeling with him 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.110
 so I'm afraid I do not like him anymore 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.810
 now 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.560
 but it must be a re-reading of 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.660
 brief a music question 4 the mass 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:21.580
 manatim I was part of mendelssohn 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:24.280
 book with an inspirational couple is I did 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.830
 skin and I think it was a while ago. 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.190
 last year's Valentine's Day on 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.440
 couples of literature ok i leave linck 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.780
 below if you want to see more couples 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.060
 It's but I have a tremendous difficulty. 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.709
 to find books with my mates 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.730
 shelf most couples who 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.489
 They end up dying like that, but I 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.660
 I chose the jack london logo that 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:53.020
 has the rampage and I think it was another 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.690
 her name is a cool couple they are a 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.400
 couple who are very fond of each other and who 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.060
 a rather 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.580
 unexpected right 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.610
 anyway it's a pretty cool book enough 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.650
 He will leave the link below. 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:14.800
 after that, question number 5 is 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:17.160
 flight of the ovi bomb is a book or 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.900
 a reading and tanks 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.340
 I could not the book that I'm going to show 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.830
 not only of us but there is one thing 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.370
 Special 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.189
 in it's book is the truth about the case 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.370
 herberth of the game indicates 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:34.949
 I do not like this book because I think 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.909
 That has to turn me around. 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.569
 irritates 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:43.110
 he has two layers of history that 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:46.139
 happened in the past and involved death 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.430
 of a person and one that happens in the 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:53.360
 future after many years when this 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.030
 death begins to be investigated back 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.710
 I really like this old core 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.050
 when we find out what in fact 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.340
 happened the story is very very very 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.069
 beautiful 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.159
 I do not like this part of the future. 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:11.639
 because the police investigation has to 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:13.530
 turn turns over more and more 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.710
 It irritated me when I was reading from 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:20.009
 panel again us so that 's why it is 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.110
 annoying but it is a special command 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.289
 I do not like that much special calls 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:30.029
 so maybe because of this 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:32.190
 write good hoff 6 requiring mozart one 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:34.949
 book that you have not completed and 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.199
 sorry yet I still want to finish 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.900
 Today I plan to start back but year 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:43.560
 last I started reading the moby honey dick 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.919
 and it was cool reading was not bad 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:51.750
 not great the tables sometimes not 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:56.729
 excite future plan to slow but this 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.589
 I still regret it because I 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.650
 I saw a video of a girl I'll leave the 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:03.419
 link underneath is called chance on her 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.360
 speaks very well on the scheme of the best 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.190
 her readings last year is me 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.659
 I was very excited to get him 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:16.020
 for law back a 7 harmony question 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:18.379
 adwords green gold a book with a 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.180
 nice atmosphere 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:24.569
 I found it difficult also the pomegranates 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.240
 Nice on the pizza but I ended up 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.219
 choosing or reading this year 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.659
 including that some neighborhood berlinda 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:34.649
 I'm happy to kick 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:35.270
 and it 's a book he talks about the city 

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:37.700
 in 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.920
 the two wars coming close to 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.900
 second World War 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.390
 and then you have a little yes about the 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.750
 emergence of Nazism as a financier 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:50.600
 came to power and such but has a lot of 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.210
 as the city is charming and of things 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.550
 interesting and that's why it has 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.520
 Such a nice climate for me I love 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.340
 view favorite advertising line and is 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.320
 and it's interesting to know what the hell is like 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.590
 that she was me I'd love to run away 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.940
 berlin at that time then so the 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.820
 pleasant weather 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:13.630

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:35.510
 about children's books 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:39.050
 so they show that books can 

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:44.810
 doing for you and reading is a 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:46.600
 cool thing I love the pictures and a
