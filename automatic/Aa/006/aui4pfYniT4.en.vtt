00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.770
 good let's start is first of all 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.910
 pick up the mold to make the markings on the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.460
 folder 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.950
 I'll use the aesthetics I used 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.870
 in the pole it was from here but you can 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.039
 use the covenant as I said later 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.189
 others 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:26.849
 Anything else that you can brand you 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:29.279
 He'll stick it on the cake and you'll 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:36.050
 will mark it on top 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.050
 and the line image here 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.670
 of the accumulated country to do the same 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.670
 thing 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.579
 i 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.390
 You can see people I put the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.770
 Mass here impromptu she's not okay 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.940
 It's okay when you go and if this 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.500
 It is made 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.200
 You have to be pretty, my love. 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.630
 cup has to pass quite the straightener 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.630
 so that a skirt of the same size 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:42.220
 that does not leave they do not all do not 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:46.690
 fills in is very coming jury I do not 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:51.369
 fills all is seeing that the folder has 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.170
 group walking naked on the right styrofoam not 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.720
 fills all styrofoam because otherwise 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.720
 mars is not so much pasta 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.580
 Hi 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.950
 so is the science that the folder does not 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.069
 good campaign in the fourth handle on the pitch 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.180
 Come here, it's not to eat, you're to eat. 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.180
 my daughter isabella 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.040
 So the idea is we've done all the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.260
 the markings above and below us not 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.090
 It's perfect but it will work for you. 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.420
 understand how it does 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.550
 We'll get a ruler, I'll start. 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.349
 here the second one is not going to start 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.640
 first we'll make a mark 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:44.709
 we will not score neither in the lower law 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.640
 on the side we'll mark on the previous 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:51.280
 as if there were a month here, 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.390
 It starts coming down here. I 'm not going to dial. 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:59.620
 neither on the bottom nor on the side I'm going 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.770
 score after the third or the low 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.900
 nor on the side on the third do not make 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.900
 marking will do 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.010
 I messed up the hole but she the direction of the 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:24.870
 hole I'm going next or not at the bottom 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:26.489
 nor in the second in the third where I am 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.730
 Wrong because I have to make 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:38.280
 side not seeing right but it is well on 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:41.030
 direction of the hole is marking 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.030
 slowly 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.780
 the folder is all crazy that gives us 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.459
 for you understand is seeing 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.459
 we mark the first side 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.379
 to make the complete diamond then what 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:13.670
 We're going to do not do the same thing. 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:17.340
 Only now, from here to here and have the 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.229
 first here neither the first nor the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.520
 from below on the third 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:26.610
 to start with the one here and in the 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.490
 down without losing under it is this 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.630
 here we suppose I would have here 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.870
 then it will start here begins this 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.870
 on here 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:14.180
 good and that's how the capitonÃª effect came about 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:18.440
 right there where where now do not use me 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.180
 aesthetics again where it has the 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.240
 I'll make one 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.130
 I'm going to score or I can do the sun 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.650
 always present customer is you going 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.770
 decide but I did so I was a 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.500
 bit even this fine paste work 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.540
 too much she 's ripping saw country and 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.229
 mark a ball 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:47.200
 I'll get a ball pearl can 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:49.940
 be of paste can be of pearl 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.729
 edible can be shocked ball that the 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.729
 people who use paint are hit 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.370
 Do not need me too, I pressed a 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.100
 a little strength we have to be 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.440
 you need so much strength you sign and 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.150
 There you go and make the ball and put 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.060
 that I have no other color than 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.520
 folder to put I do not have at the moment 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.690
 another one of another type of paste dyed to 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:18.729
 put one make an example for the ball 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.729
 How I used the cake, did I do the ball? 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:30.550
 He made a nest movement where there caught 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:33.140
 it was the junction and the plate 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.660
 where was the junction and kicked in 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.639
 case of isabella cake was yellow with 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.039
 the red motorcycle balls will stay 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.289
 creativity, or do not need to find 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:47.960
 you can put your border in the 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:50.360
 skin to skin so you can there 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.620
 use that show 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:58.090
 ball dyed does not personal use or own 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:01.850
 folder cuts well all the same size 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.950
 That's the way it looks when we do it. 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.169
 rounded up stay gets harder 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:09.080
 That's why I find them there. 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:12.410
 You go with the company of cmc, who says 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.129
 mc with water and look there goes with the brush 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.589
 and 

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:19.309
 Sticks I can not make it stick 

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:24.169
 so paste the cmc, it's okay guys 

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:26.360

 I think we learn we have 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:34.759

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:37.249
 biscuit and I'm splitting so that 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:41.409
