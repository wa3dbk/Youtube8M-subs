00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
go ahead and put the figure thing back

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.679 
go ahead and put the figure thing back
on<00:01:14.260> it<00:01:14.670> let's<00:01:15.670> look<00:01:15.790> at<00:01:15.939> some<00:01:16.060> of<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.240> details

on it let's look at some of the details
on<00:01:16.869> this<00:01:16.990> figure<00:01:17.260> I<00:01:17.290> mean<00:01:17.530> just<00:01:17.740> look<00:01:17.920> at<00:01:17.979> the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
on this figure I mean just look at the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.290 
on this figure I mean just look at the
eyes<00:01:18.250> and<00:01:18.760> detailing<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.600> scales<00:01:21.300> really

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
eyes and detailing of the scales really

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.500 
eyes and detailing of the scales really
nice<00:01:22.540> molded<00:01:23.230> scales<00:01:23.650> pattern<00:01:24.610> on<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:25.090> entire

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
nice molded scales pattern on the entire

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.470 
nice molded scales pattern on the entire
toy<00:01:28.510> I<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:30.670> know<00:01:30.760> if<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:30.910> can<00:01:31.030> see<00:01:31.270> some<00:01:31.450> of

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
toy I don't know if you can see some of

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.690 
toy I don't know if you can see some of
these<00:01:31.630> scalings<00:01:32.140> even<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:32.890> detail<00:01:33.280> work<00:01:33.310> on

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
these scalings even the detail work on

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.600 
these scalings even the detail work on
the<00:01:34.030> harness<00:01:34.300> that<00:01:34.960> hiccup<00:01:35.350> made<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.860> little

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
the harness that hiccup made a little

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.930 
the harness that hiccup made a little
bit<00:01:36.700> more<00:01:36.790> likely<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.330> help<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:39.310> harness

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
bit more likely to help the harness

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.789 
bit more likely to help the harness
hiccup<00:01:40.390> made<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:42.340> he<00:01:42.490> could<00:01:42.670> write<00:01:42.880> toothless

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.819 

which<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.979> pretty<00:01:47.219> cool<00:01:47.719> I<00:01:48.719> have<00:01:49.289> it<00:01:49.409> off<00:01:49.560> right

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
which is pretty cool I have it off right

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.560 
which is pretty cool I have it off right
now<00:01:50.039> so<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.579> show<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.789> some<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> action

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
now so I can show you some of the action

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.020 
now so I can show you some of the action
figures<00:01:51.960> features<00:01:52.439> one<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> features<00:01:53.880> is

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
figures features one of the features is

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.719 
figures features one of the features is
if<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.299> squeeze<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> back<00:01:54.869> legs<00:01:55.579> don't<00:01:56.579> know

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
if you squeeze the back legs don't know

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.419 
if you squeeze the back legs don't know
if<00:01:56.789> you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:56.970> see<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:59.719> the<00:02:00.719> wings<00:02:01.130> will<00:02:02.130> fold

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
in and that comes to an attack mode it

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.210 
in and that comes to an attack mode it
does<00:02:06.479> have<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.720> try<00:02:06.929> me<00:02:07.110> feature<00:02:07.350> which<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.890> the
