there's<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> lot<00:00:09.299> of<00:00:09.330> differences<00:00:09.930> that<00:00:10.110> make

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
there's a lot of differences that make

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.709 
there's a lot of differences that make
this<00:00:10.469> woman<00:00:11.070> specific<00:00:11.580> running<00:00:11.850> shoe<00:00:12.000> first

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
this woman specific running shoe first

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.180 
this woman specific running shoe first
and<00:00:12.959> probably<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.260> most<00:00:13.410> important<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.920> fit

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
and probably the most important is fit

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.129 
and probably the most important is fit
it's<00:00:14.760> built<00:00:15.059> on<00:00:15.240> what's<00:00:15.510> called<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.840> woman

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
it's built on what's called a woman

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.589 
it's built on what's called a woman
specific<00:00:16.590> last<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.190> last<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:18.089> a<00:00:18.210> kind<00:00:18.480> of

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:18.599 
specific last and last is just a kind of

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.659 
specific last and last is just a kind of
a<00:00:18.689> stand-in<00:00:19.080> for<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.349> foot<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:20.070> we<00:00:20.250> use<00:00:20.460> when

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
a stand-in for the foot that we use when

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:22.759 
a stand-in for the foot that we use when
we're<00:00:20.939> making<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.300> shoe<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.410> last<00:00:22.560> is

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
we're making a shoe and the last is

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.230 
we're making a shoe and the last is
important<00:00:23.160> because<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.580> pretty<00:00:24.089> much

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
important because it pretty much

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.700 
important because it pretty much
determines<00:00:24.720> how<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.080> she<00:00:25.199> was<00:00:25.289> going<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.499> fit

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
determines how that she was going to fit

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.980 
determines how that she was going to fit
so<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.580> women's<00:00:26.999> lunarglide<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.599> built<00:00:27.839> on<00:00:27.929> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
so the women's lunarglide is built on a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.450 
so the women's lunarglide is built on a
last<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.529> different<00:00:28.829> from<00:00:28.919> the<00:00:29.009> men's<00:00:29.249> to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
last it's different from the men's to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.609 
last it's different from the men's to
provide<00:00:29.730> what<00:00:29.970> fit<00:00:30.419> that's<00:00:30.630> specific<00:00:31.169> to<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
provide what fit that's specific to the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.319 
provide what fit that's specific to the
shape<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.070> woman's<00:00:32.340> foot<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.120> that's<00:00:33.239> very

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
shape of a woman's foot so that's very

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.049 
shape of a woman's foot so that's very
important<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.710> next<00:00:34.980> one<00:00:35.129> is<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.550> heel

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
important the next one is this heel

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
we know is that women's heels vary

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.930 
we know is that women's heels vary
tremendously<00:00:49.199> in<00:00:49.829> shape<00:00:50.129> much<00:00:50.579> more<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:50.789> than

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
tremendously in shape much more so than

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.479 
tremendously in shape much more so than
men<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.530> heel<00:00:52.739> Connor<00:00:52.980> allows<00:00:53.250> us

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
men so what this heel Connor allows us

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.950 
men so what this heel Connor allows us
to<00:00:53.670> provide<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.179> support<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.629> women<00:00:54.929> need

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
to provide the support that women need

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.709 
to provide the support that women need
by<00:00:55.199> framing<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> heel<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.940> material<00:00:57.510> in

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
by framing the heel but this material in

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.329 
by framing the heel but this material in
the<00:00:57.929> center<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.260> actually<00:00:58.590> soft<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.070> if<00:00:59.219> you

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
the center is actually soft so if you

a key difference is that on the loomis

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.780 
a key difference is that on the loomis
you<00:01:16.260> we<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:16.950> call<00:01:17.160> an<00:01:17.310> arch<00:01:17.520> fit

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
you we have what we call an arch fit

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.690 
you we have what we call an arch fit
strap<00:01:18.090> which<00:01:18.690> is<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> piece<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.140> soft

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700

strap which is a piece of soft
microfiber<00:01:20.700> synthetic<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.930> allows<00:01:22.710> her<00:01:22.920> to

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
microfiber synthetic that allows her to

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.800 
microfiber synthetic that allows her to
get<00:01:23.190> added<00:01:23.670> support<00:01:23.820> around<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> arch<00:01:24.540> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
get added support around the arch and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.830 
get added support around the arch and
then<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.770> strap<00:01:26.490> also<00:01:26.820> has<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.150> added<00:01:27.690> row

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
then this strap also has this added row

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.300 
then this strap also has this added row
of<00:01:27.960> islets<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.620> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.010> bit<00:01:29.160> of<00:01:29.190> a

of islets so that you can get a bit of a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.190 
of islets so that you can get a bit of a
custom<00:01:29.730> fit<00:01:29.850> around<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.180> arch<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.600> well<00:01:30.780> just

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
custom fit around that arch as well just

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.780 
custom fit around that arch as well just
ahead<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> arch<00:01:31.860> fit<00:01:32.070> strap<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
ahead of the arch fit strap we have this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.210 
ahead of the arch fit strap we have this
dynamic<00:01:33.330> fit<00:01:33.540> expansion<00:01:34.170> window<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:34.590> that's

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
dynamic fit expansion window and that's

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.680 
dynamic fit expansion window and that's
there<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:35.580> we<00:01:35.910> know<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.090> women's<00:01:36.510> feet

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
there because we know that women's feet

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.600 
there because we know that women's feet
are<00:01:36.810> different<00:01:37.260> it<00:01:37.650> done<00:01:37.950> men's<00:01:38.190> in<00:01:38.340> terms<00:01:38.520> of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
are different it done men's in terms of

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.680 
are different it done men's in terms of
the<00:01:38.700> shape<00:01:38.910> and<00:01:39.090> one<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.360> key<00:01:39.510> differences

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
the shape and one of the key differences

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.990 
the shape and one of the key differences
is<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.620> the<00:01:40.710> forefoot<00:01:41.160> where<00:01:41.340> women<00:01:41.640> tend<00:01:41.940> to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
is in the forefoot where women tend to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.970 
is in the forefoot where women tend to
have<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> little<00:01:42.330> bit<00:01:42.480> wider<00:01:42.720> foot<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.710> this

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
have a little bit wider foot so this

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.040 
have a little bit wider foot so this
window<00:01:44.340> has<00:01:44.730> a<00:01:44.790> stretchy<00:01:45.360> material<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.900> here

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
window has a stretchy material in here

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.720 
window has a stretchy material in here
that<00:01:46.230> and<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.500> allows<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.950> upper<00:01:47.190> to<00:01:47.280> expand

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
that and that allows the upper to expand

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.460 
that and that allows the upper to expand
so<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.690> you<00:01:48.810> do<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.110> little<00:01:49.290> bit<00:01:49.440> of

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
so that if you do have a little bit of

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.440 
so that if you do have a little bit of
water<00:01:49.680> foot<00:01:50.040> or<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.310> maybe<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.910> issues<00:01:51.240> with

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
water foot or you maybe have issues with

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.630 
water foot or you maybe have issues with
bunions<00:01:51.720> then<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.560> upper<00:01:52.800> can<00:01:52.980> conform<00:01:53.400> to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
bunions then the upper can conform to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.920 
bunions then the upper can conform to
the<00:01:53.730> shape<00:01:53.760> of<00:01:54.060> your<00:01:54.150> foot<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.540> that's<00:01:54.720> another

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the shape of your foot so that's another

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.110 
the shape of your foot so that's another
key<00:01:55.140> difference<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:56.010> sock<00:01:56.310> liner<00:01:56.580> itself<00:01:56.910> is

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
key difference the sock liner itself is

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.520 
key difference the sock liner itself is
actually<00:01:57.240> also<00:01:57.570> different<00:01:58.080> in<00:01:58.140> shaping<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
actually also different in shaping the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.760 
actually also different in shaping the
women's<00:01:58.860> shoe<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.570> it's<00:02:00.570> done<00:02:00.870> well<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
women's shoe and it's done well the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.960 
women's shoe and it's done well the
difference<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.160> essentially<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.730> there's<00:02:02.910> a

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
difference is essentially that there's a

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.360 
difference is essentially that there's a
little<00:02:03.120> bit<00:02:03.300> more<00:02:03.510> of<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.690> scoop<00:02:04.230> or<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.500> cup<00:02:04.830> so

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
little bit more of a scoop or a cup so

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.920 
little bit more of a scoop or a cup so
that<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.610> get<00:02:05.730> added<00:02:06.150> cushioning<00:02:06.540> from<00:02:06.750> your

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
that you get added cushioning from your

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.839 
that you get added cushioning from your
heal<00:02:07.080> itself<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:07.710> actually<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.369> fat<00:02:08.610> pad

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
heal itself that actually that fat pad

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.539 
heal itself that actually that fat pad
built<00:02:09.030> into<00:02:09.390> your<00:02:09.509> heel<00:02:09.719> is<00:02:10.189> allowed<00:02:11.189> to<00:02:11.370> do<00:02:11.519> a

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
built into your heel is allowed to do a

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:12.740 
built into your heel is allowed to do a
little<00:02:11.790> bit<00:02:11.879> more<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.209> terms<00:02:12.329> of<00:02:12.480> providing

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
little bit more in terms of providing

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.050 
little bit more in terms of providing
Christine<00:02:13.170> for<00:02:13.319> your<00:02:13.439> foot

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
Christine for your foot

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.000 
Christine for your foot
down<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.420> midsole<00:02:15.960> one<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.830> key

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
down in the midsole one of the key

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.920 
down in the midsole one of the key
differences<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.060> heel<00:02:18.330> area<00:02:18.360> where

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
differences is in the heel area where

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.660 
differences is in the heel area where
the<00:02:19.080> women's<00:02:19.410> nike<00:02:19.590> lunarglide<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> little

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
the women's nike lunarglide is a little

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.180 
the women's nike lunarglide is a little
bit<00:02:20.760> more<00:02:20.880> rounded<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.130> a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
bit more rounded so that you get a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.830 
bit more rounded so that you get a
smoother<00:02:23.790> transition<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.480> that's<00:02:24.600> because

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
smoother transition and that's because

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.830 
smoother transition and that's because
we<00:02:24.959> found<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.319> women<00:02:25.620> have<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.160> tendency<00:02:26.310> to

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
we found that women have a tendency to

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.059 
we found that women have a tendency to
land<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.990> little<00:02:28.110> bit<00:02:28.350> more<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.740> outside

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
land a little bit more on the outside

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.890 
land a little bit more on the outside
edge<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.520> foot<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.360> allows<00:02:30.540> them<00:02:30.840> to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
edge of the foot so this allows them to

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.530 
edge of the foot so this allows them to
get<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> really<00:02:31.350> nice<00:02:31.470> smooth<00:02:31.770> transition<00:02:32.540> down

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
get a really nice smooth transition down

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.040 
get a really nice smooth transition down
below<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.500> also<00:02:34.680> have<00:02:35.450> added<00:02:36.450> flexibility

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
below we also have added flexibility

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.930 
below we also have added flexibility
because<00:02:37.260> women<00:02:37.770> weigh<00:02:37.950> less<00:02:38.160> than<00:02:38.220> men<00:02:38.580> them

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
because women weigh less than men them

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.090 
because women weigh less than men them
on<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.240> same<00:02:39.420> size<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.800> means<00:02:40.980> they

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
on the same size and so that means they

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.770 
on the same size and so that means they
have<00:02:41.190> less<00:02:41.370> mass<00:02:41.640> with<00:02:42.000> which<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.390> flex<00:02:42.600> issue

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
have less mass with which the flex issue

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.120 
have less mass with which the flex issue
so<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.230> allows<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.650> shoe<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.890> be<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> little

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
so this allows the shoe to be a little

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.410 
so this allows the shoe to be a little
bit<00:02:44.280> more<00:02:44.430> flexible<00:02:44.790> even<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.150> she<00:02:45.239> weighs<00:02:45.390> a

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
bit more flexible even if she weighs a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.660 
bit more flexible even if she weighs a
little<00:02:45.540> bit<00:02:45.720> less<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.130> finally<00:02:47.130> we<00:02:47.280> have<00:02:47.459> a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
little bit less and finally we have a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.750 
little bit less and finally we have a
women's<00:02:48.540> specific<00:02:49.190> construction<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.370> this

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
women's specific construction in this

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.520 
women's specific construction in this
arch<00:02:51.000> bridge<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.780> wraps<00:02:52.019> up<00:02:52.170> along<00:02:52.410> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
arch bridge that wraps up along the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.590 
arch bridge that wraps up along the
midsole<00:02:52.739> provide<00:02:53.100> added<00:02:53.400> support<00:02:53.519> because<00:02:54.180> we

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
midsole provide added support because we

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.780 
midsole provide added support because we
know<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.750> women<00:02:55.110> have<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.459> somewhat<00:02:56.459> greater

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
know that women have a somewhat greater

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.090 
know that women have a somewhat greater
predisposition<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.690> over<00:02:57.930> pronate<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.830> is

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
predisposition to over pronate this is

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.380 
predisposition to over pronate this is
designed<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.670> give<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.820> little<00:03:00.060> bit<00:03:00.180> more

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
designed to give a little bit more

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.210 
designed to give a little bit more
support<00:03:00.750> than<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.080> men's<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:05.070> unique

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
support than in the men's you the unique

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.070 
support than in the men's you the unique
thing<00:03:05.489> about<00:03:05.519> Nike<00:03:05.880> running<00:03:06.120> i<00:03:06.390> think<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:06.900> our

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
thing about Nike running i think is our

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.780 
thing about Nike running i think is our
ability<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.560> bring<00:03:07.769> performance<00:03:08.280> innovation

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
ability to bring performance innovation

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.100 
ability to bring performance innovation
to<00:03:08.910> be<00:03:09.060> honest<00:03:09.239> that's<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.900> thing<00:03:10.080> that
