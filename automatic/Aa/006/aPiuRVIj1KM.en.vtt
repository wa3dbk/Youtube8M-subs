00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:04.980 
this lovely fruit so let's move on to
the<00:01:52.560> video<00:01:52.770> shall<00:01:53.040> we

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.630 

first<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.200> all<00:02:06.350> I'm<00:02:06.590> using<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:07.040> basic<00:02:07.460> kitchen

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
first of all I'm using a basic kitchen

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.430 
first of all I'm using a basic kitchen
knife<00:02:07.910> there<00:02:08.210> is<00:02:08.330> nothing<00:02:08.750> special<00:02:09.020> about<00:02:09.230> it

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
knife there is nothing special about it

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.760 
knife there is nothing special about it
it<00:02:09.710> costs<00:02:10.040> 30<00:02:10.220> rupees<00:02:10.430> at<00:02:10.850> best<00:02:11.320> first<00:02:12.320> the

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
it costs 30 rupees at best first the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.470 
it costs 30 rupees at best first the
wrong<00:02:12.980> way<00:02:13.190> usually<00:02:13.820> starts<00:02:14.150> with<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.360> right

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
wrong way usually starts with the right

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.390 
wrong way usually starts with the right
step<00:02:14.840> which<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.500> cut<00:02:15.650> straight<00:02:15.950> down<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
step which is to cut straight down the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.120 
step which is to cut straight down the
middle<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.320> when<00:02:18.500> things<00:02:18.530> get<00:02:19.070> a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
middle and this is when things get a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.220 
middle and this is when things get a
little<00:02:19.340> mental<00:02:19.880> for<00:02:20.180> me<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:20.480> people<00:02:20.780> dissect

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
little mental for me so people dissect

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.930 
little mental for me so people dissect
the<00:02:21.410> Apple<00:02:21.800> in<00:02:21.920> whichever<00:02:22.220> way<00:02:22.370> willy-nilly

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
the Apple in whichever way willy-nilly

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.180 
the Apple in whichever way willy-nilly
and<00:02:23.360> then<00:02:23.510> they<00:02:23.660> pick<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.110> up<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.500> they<00:02:24.770> carve

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
and then they pick it up and they carve

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.770 
and then they pick it up and they carve
out<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.760> core<00:02:26.560> why<00:02:27.560> would<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.760> cut<00:02:29.090> like<00:02:29.390> this

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
out the core why would you cut like this

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.690 
out the core why would you cut like this
you<00:02:30.050> could<00:02:30.200> easily<00:02:30.500> Knick<00:02:30.920> your<00:02:31.100> thumb<00:02:31.400> if<00:02:31.580> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
you could easily Knick your thumb if the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.100 
you could easily Knick your thumb if the
knife<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.120> sharp<00:02:32.420> it's<00:02:32.690> not<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.960> most

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
knife is sharp it's not the most

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.590 
knife is sharp it's not the most
efficient<00:02:33.560> way<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.710> do<00:02:34.070> it<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.490> even<00:02:35.360> the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
efficient way to do it and even the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.390 
efficient way to do it and even the
other<00:02:35.690> pieces<00:02:36.200> you're<00:02:36.380> not<00:02:36.530> cleaning<00:02:36.830> out<00:02:37.130> the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
other pieces you're not cleaning out the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.780 
other pieces you're not cleaning out the
dirtiest<00:02:37.820> part<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.210> the<00:02:38.330> Apple<00:02:39.550> I'm<00:02:40.550> just

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
dirtiest part of the Apple I'm just

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.040 
dirtiest part of the Apple I'm just
going<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.030> show<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:41.330> method<00:02:41.510> behind<00:02:41.810> the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
going to show you the method behind the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.230 
going to show you the method behind the
madness<00:02:42.250> now<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.310> part<00:02:43.610> about<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.030> core

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
madness now the part about the core

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.240 
madness now the part about the core
where<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.630> stem<00:02:44.900> sits<00:02:45.260> as<00:02:45.500> well<00:02:45.890> as<00:02:46.070> the

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
where the stem sits as well as the

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.550 
where the stem sits as well as the
bottom<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:47.030> where<00:02:47.270> all<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.660> yup<00:02:47.960> conjunct

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
bottom is where all the yup conjunct

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.290 
bottom is where all the yup conjunct
collects<00:02:49.250> it's<00:02:49.430> sort<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.790> like<00:02:49.970> an<00:02:50.120> awkward

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
collects it's sort of like an awkward

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.750 
collects it's sort of like an awkward
belly<00:02:50.720> button<00:02:51.050> so<00:02:51.710> when<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:51.950> cut<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.370> Apple

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
belly button so when you cut the Apple

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.070 
belly button so when you cut the Apple
you're<00:02:52.910> going<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.060> remove<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.540> core<00:02:53.810> and

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
you're going to remove the core and

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.800 
you're going to remove the core and
these<00:02:54.500> two<00:02:54.770> edges<00:02:55.280> also<00:02:56.060> this<00:02:56.240> way<00:02:56.450> your

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
these two edges also this way your

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.630 
these two edges also this way your
fingers<00:02:57.140> don't<00:02:57.530> come<00:02:57.800> into<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.220> way<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.550> the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
fingers don't come into the way of the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.340 
fingers don't come into the way of the
knife<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.660> way<00:02:59.870> you<00:02:59.930> don't<00:03:00.050> have<00:03:00.260> to

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
knife and that way you don't have to

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.900 
knife and that way you don't have to
pick<00:03:00.530> up<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.770> Apple<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.310> carve<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:01.730> like<00:03:01.760> a

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
pick up the Apple and carve it like a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.830 
pick up the Apple and carve it like a
pleb<00:03:03.520> take<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.670> other<00:03:04.790> half<00:03:05.150> of<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.510> Apple

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
pleb take the other half of the Apple

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.420 
pleb take the other half of the Apple
and<00:03:05.959> no<00:03:06.020> matter<00:03:06.170> how<00:03:06.440> thinly<00:03:06.770> you<00:03:07.040> want<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.280> cut

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
and no matter how thinly you want to cut

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.790 
and no matter how thinly you want to cut
the<00:03:07.550> slices<00:03:07.850> just<00:03:08.270> remember<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.110> aim<00:03:09.260> for<00:03:09.380> the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
the slices just remember to aim for the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.370 
the slices just remember to aim for the
center<00:03:10.450> because<00:03:11.450> when<00:03:11.600> you<00:03:11.690> do<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:12.050> it'll<00:03:12.290> be

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
center because when you do this it'll be

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.290 
center because when you do this it'll be
much<00:03:12.680> easier<00:03:12.709> for<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.580> remove<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.000> core

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
much easier for you to remove the core

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.180 
much easier for you to remove the core
and<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.840> yucky<00:03:15.230> belly<00:03:15.500> button<00:03:15.890> that<00:03:16.040> we

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
and the yucky belly button that we

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.430 
and the yucky belly button that we
mentioned<00:03:16.580> earlier<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:20.080> for<00:03:21.080> those<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.230> you

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
mentioned earlier and for those of you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.900 
mentioned earlier and for those of you
who<00:03:21.560> think<00:03:21.770> this<00:03:21.920> is<00:03:22.070> a<00:03:22.100> wasteful<00:03:22.489> method<00:03:22.820> you

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
who think this is a wasteful method you

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.870 
who think this is a wasteful method you
can't<00:03:23.150> eat<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:24.680> can't<00:03:24.950> eat<00:03:25.190> that<00:03:25.220> you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
can't eat that you can't eat that you

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.150 
can't eat that you can't eat that you
can't<00:03:26.150> eat<00:03:26.420> that<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:27.230> basically<00:03:27.440> what<00:03:28.010> you're
