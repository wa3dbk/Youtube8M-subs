00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.080
 source of strength is needed for 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.990
 body trace elements but it 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.700
 no more than a delusion 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.469
 anyone even starting somewhere will tell you that 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.720

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.590
 trace elements needed 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.260
 the body has no one 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.619
 most would understand indisputable 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.460
 leader in all indicators

 are legumes and dairy products 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.679
 subsequently normal nutrition 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.970
 a person becomes more than 8 cents on 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.420
 share of well-being 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.890
 very rarely

 especially endurance average 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.780
 Asia conducted such an experiment 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.850
 famous drac 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.850
 calculated led the group 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.260
 vegetarians who committed 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.090
 desert crossing 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.620
 and parallel he man rub a 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.490
 we are with an agent 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.830
 in fact, the business environment did not reach the end 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.200
 no one all fizzled out 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.309
 Here and percent of intervention reached in 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.890

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.060
 plant food 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.810
 many follow the same way 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.480
 other athletes in the Soviet Union 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.550
 the nutrition doctrine was developed so 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.700
 way that delivered scary 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.510
 however even in those times if 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.500
 very high-class athletes can 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.930
 it was still the case the result to him 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.500
 will be reckoned 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.940
 I recommend a reaction to me not 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.470
 I want to eat a lot for 10 years 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.540
 as if 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.810
 when once 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.630
 first time he knew 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.290

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.400
 I immediately recognized him can be said on 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.210
 the second day I just understood it all depends on 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.740
 the mind as if the sensor is aware of the monologue 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.670
 stops but drink smoke eat meat 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.060
 I don't deny myself much 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.910
 fruits a lot of vegetables 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.770
 many beans and investigating this for 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.640
 do not commit themselves so simply 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.810
 That I do not eat too much structure and then 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.540
 came such food 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.650
 For everyone 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.029
 very good 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.740
 all these things that 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.429
