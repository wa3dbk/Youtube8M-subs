00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.559
 hello in this tutorial I'm going to show you 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.780
 how to make this nice candy bar that 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.250
 we can give it to the person who 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.920
 we want to surprise in some detail 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.439
 Nice made by ourselves can 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.199
 be your mom to a friend to your boyfriend or 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.939
 girlfriend to a teacher or anyone 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.039
 that you want to surprise with a 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.419
 nice detail so well I'm going to 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.220
 show the materials that we are going to 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.710
 need 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.149
 we will take an appointment like this one which 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.370
 I showed you how to do in the tutorial 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.899
 last I leave a link in the box 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.020
 of the description in case you do not 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.059
 have seen likewise we will occupy foamy already 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.710
 either pink or red to perform 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.150
 a heart 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.250
 chocolates or any other sweet that 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.010
 you choose to put it blue zero 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.600
 a glass or plastic container 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.710
 that you have at hand and that you 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.430
 like 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.730
 also to your liking and the 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.880
 colors that you decide to do and 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.800
 we are going to occupy acrylic paints or 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.550
 markers to make some 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.070
 details about the background 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.050
 It will also be necessary cold silicone or 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.350
 hot or any other glue that 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.990
 you have as well as scissors so 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.610
 well let's start as the ones 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.040
 I mentioned in the previous tutorial 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.710
 I showed how to make this teddy bear like this 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.440
 way and to now do our 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.050
 nice candy we are going to put it on a 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.230
 base foami also so that we stay 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.230
 A) Yes 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.689
 and the only thing we will have to do is 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.450
 put it on the foam and that we 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.240
 choose in a color that contrasts with 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.920
 color bear and a centimeter 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.649
 We are going to mark the distance 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.409
 skewer stick all around 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.040
 of the little bear like I did here and 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.060
 subsequently cut it 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:04.410
 here to this com and I made some brands 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.830
 with the pyrography soldering iron so that 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.930
 stay like this and look a little more 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.760
 can you do it this way or 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.250
 simply leave it like that too 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.910
 pretty good once we have this 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.770
 part we're going to cut out a heart like 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.250
 I mentioned them either in red or 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.250
 pink 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.500
 to put it on this part and wear 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.340
 here the message either I love you happy mom 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.830
 birthday 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.730
 finally the message that you want 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.220
 here I already made one in red tone I put 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.110
 some little flowers so I'm going now 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.540
 to do in pink for you to choose 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.300
 the one that you like the most for it I'm going to 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.930
 occupy the markers since it's a lot 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.959
 faster 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.810
 I will only use so much acrylic paint 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.909
 white to put some points that I 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.909
 they will serve as the center of the flowers 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.120
 we'll put a little separate 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.099
 that the other points that I'm going to 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.099
 use to form some flowers 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.030
 now with pink marker or it can be 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.940
 with acrylic paint in magenta 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.430
 let's put some dots too 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.700
 about five or six around the point 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.700
 White 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.060
 now with acrylic paint in color 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.540
 green or well marker let's do 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.870
 some lines so that they simulate being the 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.870
 leaves 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.600
 look and in this way we will have 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.600
 finished the decoration of the little heart 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.990
 let's wait now to dry 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.810
 Now the next thing is to decorate the base on 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.380
 vial with the container where we go to 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:34.680
 place the candy we are going to put 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.760
 the lace that we have chosen around 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.310
 we measure like this 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.020
 we cut it and put a little bit of 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.020
 hot or cold silicone 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.200
 and we are left like this, I am going to place this 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:55.790
 another ribbon since it gives much more sight 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.790
 I'll also put it like that 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.789
 and here in front I'm going to do a 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.789
 beautiful 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.189
 we just give you a little bit of 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:19.849
 volume here to the monkey and we cut in 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:21.860
 diagonal the ends of here from the ribbon 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.809
 if we have a lighter at hand 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.420
 we can also burn them so that 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:28.670
 more are going to fray 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.130
 now finally let's paste the 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:34.160
 little heart in the bear previously 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.920
 we can paint a message in the center 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.950
 of the heart or in a bit of foami 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.230
 apart with the name of the person to 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.080
 who is going to give it away or the message 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.210
 that they have chosen so that if 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.400
 wrong when painting the name or 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.710
 they do not like it because they do not spoil all 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.650
 the piece with the beautiful decoration that 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.740
 have done that's why I decided 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.139
 put it that way apart here previously already 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.509
 I stuck it 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:04.199
 and you just have to add a bit of 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.199
 cold sylicon 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.630
 to put it here 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.440
 Now you just have to add a bit of 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.889
 silicon more in this part 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:22.419
 to be able to place it 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.419
 here in a the sweet 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.950
 we hold it like this for about two minutes 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.150
 so that it is completely dry or 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.919
 if they are going to do it with silicone 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.919
 hot, that's much faster 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:47.470
 if the teddy bear does not fit 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:51.810
 to the bottle can you put a 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.810
 bit of straw 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:58.770
 like this one and a base of these that sell 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.229
 for the balloons they put it like this and they 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.029
 they can put it in the center and nothing else 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:04.889
 they introduce it through the middle of the bear and 

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:07.439
 that way they would be stuck 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.999
 here in the middle part in case 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:12.479
 you decide to make them center of 

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:13.710
 table or they want it a little bit higher and 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:16.439
 this is how it is completely 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.120
 finished our bakery then 

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:20.490
 I leave some images for you 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.139
 can appreciate the best good friends 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.060
 I hope that this craft has 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:26.129
 been to your liking if it was so do not forget 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.749
 share it give you little finger up and we 

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:29.900
 we see in the following tutorial up 

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:29.900
 then
