that's<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:40.579> one<00:00:40.730> rep<00:00:40.940> max<00:00:42.039> the<00:00:43.039> child<00:00:43.520> is<00:00:43.670> with

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
that's a one rep max the child is with

that's a one rep max the child is with
trying<00:00:44.149> to<00:00:44.210> lift<00:00:44.329> their<00:00:44.480> body<00:00:44.660> weight<00:00:44.870> can<00:00:45.590> you

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
trying to lift their body weight can you

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.260 
trying to lift their body weight can you
do<00:00:45.920> it<00:00:46.010> for<00:00:46.130> one<00:00:46.190> time<00:00:46.460> they<00:00:46.579> try<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:46.910> try<00:00:47.210> it

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
do it for one time they try to try it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.110 
do it for one time they try to try it
right<00:00:47.390> now<00:00:47.710> you<00:00:49.989> see<00:00:50.989> children<00:00:51.230> on<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:51.590> swings

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
right now you see children on the swings

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.120 
right now you see children on the swings
those<00:00:53.120> are<00:00:53.300> all<00:00:53.420> weight<00:00:53.960> trained<00:00:54.290> they're

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
those are all weight trained they're

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.100 
those are all weight trained they're
using<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.430> body<00:00:55.670> weight<00:00:55.940> but<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:56.840> still<00:00:57.079> a

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
using the body weight but is still a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.690 
using the body weight but is still a
former<00:00:57.470> weight<00:00:57.620> training<00:00:58.930> thing<00:00:59.930> with<00:01:00.700> 12

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700

year<00:01:01.910> olds<00:01:02.239> a<00:01:02.450> lot<00:01:03.079> a<00:01:03.110> lot<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.530> those<00:01:03.649> you<00:01:03.950> know

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
year olds a lot a lot of those you know

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.709 
year olds a lot a lot of those you know
that<00:01:04.250> is<00:01:04.430> they<00:01:04.640> don't<00:01:04.820> have<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.269> hormones

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:05.719 
that is they don't have the hormones

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.780 
that is they don't have the hormones
that<00:01:06.020> are<00:01:06.140> going<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.350> produce<00:01:06.520> me<00:01:07.520> they<00:01:07.640> can

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
that are going to produce me they can

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.880 
that are going to produce me they can
get<00:01:07.880> stronger<00:01:08.329> your<00:01:08.810> logic<00:01:09.259> but<00:01:10.270> physically

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
get stronger your logic but physically

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.230 
get stronger your logic but physically
they're<00:01:12.890> starting

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
they're starting

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.810 
they're starting
-<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:20.410> fonts<00:01:20.740> it's<00:01:20.860> unsafe<00:01:21.250> but<00:01:21.430> they<00:01:21.520> do<00:01:21.580> that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
- the fonts it's unsafe but they do that

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.580 
- the fonts it's unsafe but they do that
all<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.000> time<00:01:22.120> I<00:01:22.510> mean<00:01:22.660> even<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.230> kids<00:01:23.410> in<00:01:23.500> the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
all the time I mean even the kids in the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.830 
all the time I mean even the kids in the
schoolyard<00:01:26.910> but<00:01:27.910> you<00:01:28.030> watch<00:01:28.180> a<00:01:28.330> child<00:01:28.570> on<00:01:28.810> a

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
schoolyard but you watch a child on a

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.730 
schoolyard but you watch a child on a
swing<00:01:29.310> swing<00:01:30.310> swing<00:01:30.340> swing<00:01:30.580> jump<00:01:31.090> off<00:01:34.740> there's

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
swing swing swing swing jump off there's

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.240 
swing swing swing swing jump off there's
a<00:01:35.830> ton<00:01:36.100> of<00:01:36.130> force<00:01:36.760> that's<00:01:37.479> ground<00:01:38.410> forces<00:01:38.830> when

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
a ton of force that's ground forces when

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:47.370 
a ton of force that's ground forces when
they<00:01:39.370> land<00:01:40.890> shooting<00:01:41.890> kids<00:01:42.580> go<00:01:43.740> bowling<00:01:46.380> but

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
they land shooting kids go bowling but

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.700 
they land shooting kids go bowling but
we<00:01:47.470> don't<00:01:47.619> think<00:01:47.740> twice<00:01:47.920> but<00:01:48.850> that's<00:01:49.479> okay<00:01:49.900> but

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
we don't think twice but that's okay but

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.990 
we don't think twice but that's okay but
if<00:01:50.830> we<00:01:50.860> put<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.340> in<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.580> shape<00:01:51.790> of<00:01:51.880> a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
if we put that in the shape of a

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.680 
if we put that in the shape of a
dumbbell

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
dumbbell

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.540 
dumbbell
I'll<00:01:52.869> let<00:01:53.140> seem<00:01:53.290> like<00:01:53.440> whoa<00:01:53.560> wait<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:53.920> second

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
I'll let seem like whoa wait a second

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.070 
I'll let seem like whoa wait a second
that's<00:01:54.790> what's<00:01:55.060> wrong<00:01:55.300> you'll<00:01:55.540> hurt<00:01:55.660> yourself

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
that's what's wrong you'll hurt yourself

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.730 
that's what's wrong you'll hurt yourself
so<00:01:57.030> probably<00:01:58.030> doing<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.360> lot<00:01:58.600> of<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.960> but<00:01:59.649> he

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
so probably doing a lot of it but he

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.719 
so probably doing a lot of it but he
wants<00:01:59.950> to<00:01:59.979> do<00:02:00.100> something<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:00.520> wants<00:02:00.700> to

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
wants to do something that wants to

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.670 
wants to do something that wants to
formalize<00:02:01.470> already<00:02:02.470> see<00:02:04.229> there's<00:02:05.229> a<00:02:05.290> lot<00:02:05.530> of

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
formalize already see there's a lot of

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.990 
formalize already see there's a lot of
things<00:02:05.920> that<00:02:06.070> they<00:02:06.190> can<00:02:06.250> still<00:02:06.610> do<00:02:06.850> which

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
things that they can still do which

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.050 
things that they can still do which
bodyweight<00:02:08.610> there's<00:02:09.610> nothing<00:02:09.910> wrong<00:02:10.000> with

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
bodyweight there's nothing wrong with

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.340 
bodyweight there's nothing wrong with
teaching<00:02:10.509> of<00:02:10.600> technique<00:02:11.020> because

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
teaching of technique because

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.500 
teaching of technique because
neurologically<00:02:12.040> it's<00:02:12.910> just<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.300> talk

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
neurologically it's just have to talk

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.380 
neurologically it's just have to talk
man<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.900> neurologically<00:02:15.060> that's<00:02:16.060> when

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
man that neurologically that's when

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.860 
man that neurologically that's when
they're<00:02:16.570> right<00:02:16.750> they<00:02:16.959> can<00:02:17.170> learn<00:02:17.320> technique

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.640 

like<00:02:20.870> riding<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.200> bike

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
like riding a bike

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.890 
like riding a bike
it's<00:02:21.890> why<00:02:22.010> can<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.220> ride<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:22.940> bike<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.900> same

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
it's why can you ride a bike the same

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.170 
it's why can you ride a bike the same
thing<00:02:27.200> with<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.650> lot<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:27.980> techniques<00:02:28.880> for

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
thing with a lot of techniques for

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.180 
thing with a lot of techniques for
exercise<00:02:29.720> they<00:02:30.410> could<00:02:30.830> learn<00:02:30.980> those

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
exercise they could learn those

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.800 
exercise they could learn those
techniques<00:02:33.610> growing<00:02:34.610> up<00:02:34.760> between<00:02:35.000> 6<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.600> 12

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
techniques growing up between 6 and 12

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.930 
techniques growing up between 6 and 12
they<00:02:36.650> don't<00:02:36.800> have<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:36.980> have<00:02:37.130> external<00:02:37.610> loads

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
they don't have to have external loads

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.000 
they don't have to have external loads
on<00:02:38.090> but<00:02:38.720> if<00:02:38.840> they<00:02:38.990> allow<00:02:39.200> them<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.500> have<00:02:39.770> the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
on but if they allow them to have the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.100 
on but if they allow them to have the
motor<00:02:40.460> pattern<00:02:40.910> down<00:02:41.060> so<00:02:41.360> when<00:02:41.570> they<00:02:41.690> start<00:02:42.050> to

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
motor pattern down so when they start to
