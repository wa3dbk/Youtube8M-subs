sixth set and close up the first the
heart

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.890 

so<00:03:54.990> repeat<00:03:55.380> this<00:03:55.410> step<00:03:56.280> four<00:03:57.240> more<00:03:57.420> times<00:03:57.570> to

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
so repeat this step four more times to

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.430 
so repeat this step four more times to
it<00:03:58.020> so<00:03:58.290> they<00:03:58.410> have<00:03:58.560> five<00:03:58.860> of<00:03:59.190> these<00:04:00.230> C<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.350> be

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
it so they have five of these C to be

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.120 
it so they have five of these C to be
exact<00:04:03.080> okay<00:04:04.080> so<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.320> have<00:04:04.710> done<00:04:05.460> for<00:04:06.210> five<00:04:07.130> sets

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
this out and now this time we cross at

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.900 
this out and now this time we cross at
the<00:04:31.530> pink<00:04:32.130> beat<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:33.450> we<00:04:33.900> first<00:04:34.580> strong
