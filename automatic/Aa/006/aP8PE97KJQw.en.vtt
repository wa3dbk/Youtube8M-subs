but I wanted to to demonstrate how it

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.680 
but I wanted to to demonstrate how it
looks<00:00:13.860> when<00:00:14.070> it's<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.490> hood<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.540> truck

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690

in this case it's a truck and you can

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.849 
in this case it's a truck and you can
see<00:00:18.390> that's<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.779> angle<00:00:19.109> right<00:00:19.350> there<00:00:19.650> that

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
see that's the angle right there that

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.130 
see that's the angle right there that
I've<00:00:19.949> got<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.369> with<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.449> angle<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.020> with

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
I've got it with this angle and with

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.070 
I've got it with this angle and with
this<00:00:22.320> mount<00:00:22.619> setup<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:24.029> GoPro<00:00:24.510> mount<00:00:24.779> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080

this mount setup of this GoPro mount I
don't<00:00:25.680> get<00:00:25.830> any<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> hood<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.210> just

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
don't get any of the hood and you just

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.670 
don't get any of the hood and you just
see<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> road<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.320> really<00:00:28.529> good

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
joke so to take it off all you do is

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.399 
joke so to take it off all you do is
lift<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.329> that's<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.020> locking

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
lift this up that's the locking

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.730 
lift this up that's the locking
mechanism<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:55.259> when<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.619> let<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.890> off

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
mechanism and then when you let that off

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.330 
mechanism and then when you let that off
you<00:01:58.740> should<00:01:59.009> then<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.189> able<00:01:59.340> to<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.890> remove<00:02:02.189> it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
you should then be able to to remove it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.800 
you should then be able to to remove it
and<00:02:02.460> see<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.640> removes<00:02:02.969> doesn't<00:02:03.390> damage<00:02:03.659> your

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
and see it removes doesn't damage your

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.050 
and see it removes doesn't damage your
vehicle<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:05.369> I'm<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.579> going<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.790> reattach

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
vehicle and I'm just going to reattach

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.760 
vehicle and I'm just going to reattach
it<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> align<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.530> time

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it I'm not going to align it this time

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.279 
it I'm not going to align it this time
but<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.250> demonstrate<00:02:08.429> how<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.030> attaches

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
but just to demonstrate how it attaches

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.420 
but just to demonstrate how it attaches
so<00:02:10.289> you've<00:02:10.410> got<00:02:10.560> your<00:02:10.709> clean<00:02:10.950> part<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.310> your

shape<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:18.400> next<00:02:18.670> step<00:02:18.879> is<00:02:19.060> actually<00:02:19.269> push<00:02:19.780> on

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
shape the next step is actually push on

this<00:02:20.470> button<00:02:20.530> here<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:22.110> creates

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
this button here and that creates

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.619 
this button here and that creates
suction<00:02:23.409> and<00:02:24.280> once<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.849> suction<00:02:25.209> is<00:02:25.269> created

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
suction and once that suction is created

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.930
