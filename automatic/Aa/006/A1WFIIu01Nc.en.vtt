00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.420 
guy and I pay my taxes I eat I do other
things<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.190> people<00:01:12.310> do<00:01:12.580> that's<00:01:12.820> normal<00:01:13.299> no<00:01:14.140> I

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
things that people do that's normal no I

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.930 
things that people do that's normal no I
I<00:01:15.750> think<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:16.930> way<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.080> do<00:01:17.350> if<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:18.460> don't<00:01:18.820> want

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
I think the way to do if you don't want

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.250 
I think the way to do if you don't want
to<00:01:19.000> get<00:01:19.090> mobbed<00:01:19.240> is<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.570> put<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:19.810> mask<00:01:19.990> on<00:01:20.200> I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
to get mobbed is to put a mask on I

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.930 
to get mobbed is to put a mask on I
think<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:20.890> might<00:01:21.070> just<00:01:21.400> about<00:01:21.580> happen

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
think that that might just about happen

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:39.539 
think that that might just about happen
at<00:01:22.030> some<00:01:22.180> point<00:01:37.500> how<00:01:38.500> much<00:01:38.650> fun<00:01:38.920> is<00:01:39.070> it<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.250> get

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
at some point how much fun is it to get

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.070 
at some point how much fun is it to get
everybody<00:01:40.090> in<00:01:40.270> one<00:01:40.450> place<00:01:41.760> here<00:01:42.760> now<00:01:43.080> well

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
they're almost like working on a sacred

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.309 
they're almost like working on a sacred
text<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.569> know<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:32.959> can<00:02:33.170> be<00:02:33.290> a

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
text and you know and that can be a

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.140 
text and you know and that can be a
little<00:02:33.620> bit<00:02:33.739> daunting<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.519> think<00:02:34.970> but<00:02:35.120> because

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
little bit daunting I think but because

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.089 
little bit daunting I think but because
Peter<00:02:35.660> if<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:35.900> look<00:02:36.050> at<00:02:36.140> his<00:02:36.230> really<00:02:36.800> really

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
Peter if you look at his really really

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.580 
Peter if you look at his really really
early<00:02:37.370> work<00:02:37.580> he's<00:02:38.269> really<00:02:38.810> daring<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.349> that<00:02:39.470> he

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
early work he's really daring in that he

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.520 
early work he's really daring in that he
understands<00:02:40.280> deep<00:02:40.760> deep<00:02:41.150> ugliness<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:41.989> so<00:02:42.500> I

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
understands deep deep ugliness and so I

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.470 
understands deep deep ugliness and so I
think<00:02:42.920> he's<00:02:43.099> brought<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.670> which<00:02:43.970> used<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.330> be

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
think he's brought that which used to be

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.539 
think he's brought that which used to be
his<00:02:44.690> sort<00:02:44.870> of<00:02:44.900> indie<00:02:45.290> aesthetic<00:02:45.830> he's<00:02:46.280> brought

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
his sort of indie aesthetic he's brought

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.300 
his sort of indie aesthetic he's brought
that<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.940> mainstream<00:02:47.630> cinema<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.130> he's

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
that to mainstream cinema and so he's

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.830 
that to mainstream cinema and so he's
fused<00:02:49.730> what<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.239> kind<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.450> almost<00:02:50.630> a

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
fused what is the kind of almost a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.839 
fused what is the kind of almost a
sacred<00:02:51.080> work<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.560> literature<00:02:51.830> with<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:52.610> kind

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
sacred work of literature with this kind

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.509 
sacred work of literature with this kind
of<00:02:52.940> inherent<00:02:53.510> ugly<00:02:53.930> side<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.230> humanity<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.370> so

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
of inherent ugly side of humanity and so

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.910 
of inherent ugly side of humanity and so
he's<00:02:55.640> created<00:02:56.090> something<00:02:56.420> utterly<00:02:56.599> unique<00:02:57.500> so

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920
