okay<00:00:00.450> so<00:00:00.510> I<00:00:00.630> have<00:00:00.870> a<00:00:00.900> Sony<00:00:01.589> Xperia<00:00:02.010> z3<00:00:02.460> here

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay so I have a Sony Xperia z3 here

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.460 
okay so I have a Sony Xperia z3 here
this<00:00:03.030> is<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.179> dual<00:00:03.419> SIM<00:00:03.689> model<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.290> big

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
this is the dual SIM model and the big

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.839 
this is the dual SIM model and the big
question<00:00:05.009> is<00:00:05.130> first<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.609> all<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.629> it<00:00:06.960> a

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849 
question is first of all is is it a

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.480 
question is first of all is is it a
active<00:00:08.849> dual<00:00:09.059> SIM<00:00:09.389> or<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.230> standby<00:00:11.010> dual

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
active dual SIM or is it a standby dual

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.570 
active dual SIM or is it a standby dual
SIM<00:00:11.849> now<00:00:12.059> what<00:00:12.300> exactly<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.080> difference

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
SIM now what exactly is the difference

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.220 
SIM now what exactly is the difference
well<00:00:14.580> first<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.000> all<00:00:15.150> if<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.199> a

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
well first of all if you have a a

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.529 
well first of all if you have a a
standby<00:00:19.230> dual<00:00:19.560> SIM<00:00:19.890> what<00:00:20.400> happens<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.150> if

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
standby dual SIM what happens is if

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.450 
standby dual SIM what happens is if
you're<00:00:21.930> talking<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.470> phone<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:23.100> sim

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
you're talking on the phone on one sim

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.220 
you're talking on the phone on one sim
and<00:00:23.699> somebody<00:00:24.449> calls<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> other<00:00:24.930> sim

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
and somebody calls the other sim

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.589 
and somebody calls the other sim
basically<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.220> guy<00:00:26.430> calling<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> other<00:00:27.210> sim

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
basically the guy calling the other sim

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.839 
basically the guy calling the other sim
will<00:00:27.930> get<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> message<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.949> cannot

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
will get a message that you cannot

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.910 
will get a message that you cannot
connect<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.420> at<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.840> time<00:00:31.369> with<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:33.920> z3

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
connect you at this time with the z3

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.910 
connect you at this time with the z3
here<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:36.120> actually<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.750> standby<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.800> what

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
here it is actually a standby and what

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.440 
here it is actually a standby and what
happens<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.550> when<00:00:38.730> you're<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> phone<00:00:39.239> once

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
happens is when you're on the phone once

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.700 
happens is when you're on the phone once
then<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:39.750> somebody<00:00:39.899> calls<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.290> other<00:00:40.379> sim

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
then if somebody calls the other sim

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.619 
then if somebody calls the other sim
it'll<00:00:41.399> say<00:00:41.520> you're<00:00:41.640> not<00:00:41.790> available<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.420> go

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
it'll say you're not available and go

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.690 
it'll say you're not available and go
directly<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.230> your<00:00:43.320> voicemail<00:00:43.950> once<00:00:44.579> they

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
directly to your voicemail once they

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.299 
directly to your voicemail once they
leave<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> voicemail<00:00:45.210> it'll<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:47.190> will

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
leave a voicemail it'll go and you will

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.010 
leave a voicemail it'll go and you will
be<00:00:47.399> able<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> retrieve<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> voicemail<00:00:48.539> now

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
be able to retrieve the voicemail now

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.150 
be able to retrieve the voicemail now
with<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.579> dual<00:00:50.840> active<00:00:51.840> sim<00:00:52.110> what<00:00:52.770> happens

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
with a dual active sim what happens

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.520 
with a dual active sim what happens
basically<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.730> you're<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.120> sim<00:00:54.530> talking

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
basically if you're on one sim talking

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.330 
basically if you're on one sim talking
to<00:00:55.590> someone<00:00:55.770> at<00:00:55.920> some<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.160> cost<00:00:56.309> you

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
to someone at some of the cost you

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.040 
to someone at some of the cost you
another<00:00:56.430> sim<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.329> number<00:00:57.660> will<00:00:57.750> come<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:57.989> as

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
another sim that number will come up as

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.420 
another sim that number will come up as
well<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.500> pick<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.920> line<00:00:59.190> and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
well and you can pick up that line and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.490 
well and you can pick up that line and
you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.730> talk<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.000> either<00:01:00.149> or<00:01:00.480> however<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you can talk to either or however on a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.590 
you can talk to either or however on a
standby<00:01:01.890> symbol<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.579> also<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.420> well

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
standby symbol you can also do as well

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.580 
standby symbol you can also do as well
as<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.019> forward<00:01:06.049> one<00:01:07.049> sim<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> other

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
as you can forward one sim to the other

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.100 
as you can forward one sim to the other
ones<00:01:07.799> other<00:01:08.010> sim<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.790> example<00:01:09.210> if<00:01:09.330> I'm<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.600> sim

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
ones other sim for example if I'm on sim

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.500 
ones other sim for example if I'm on sim
one<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.619> somebody<00:01:11.310> calls<00:01:11.580> me<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.880> sim<00:01:12.210> two

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
one and somebody calls me on sim two

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.410 
one and somebody calls me on sim two
what<00:01:13.290> happens<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.430> sim<00:01:14.700> two<00:01:14.909> we'll

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
what happens is that the sim two we'll

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749 
what happens is that the sim two we'll
go<00:01:15.689> ahead<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:17.009> sim<00:01:17.220> two<00:01:17.340> card<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.640> can

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
go ahead and the sim two card you can

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.490 
go ahead and the sim two card you can
forward<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> sim<00:01:18.659> one<00:01:18.990> card<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
forward that to the sim one card and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.140 
forward that to the sim one card and
then<00:01:19.920> number<00:01:20.159> will<00:01:20.369> pop<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.670> saying<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.030> have

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
then number will pop up saying you have

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.020 
then number will pop up saying you have
another<00:01:21.390> another<00:01:22.340> phone<00:01:23.340> call<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:23.729> I'll<00:01:23.850> say

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
another another phone call but I'll say

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.749 
another another phone call but I'll say
it<00:01:24.119> was<00:01:24.210> coming<00:01:24.450> from<00:01:24.540> sim<00:01:24.900> one<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.670> me

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it was coming from sim one so for me

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:27.920 
it was coming from sim one so for me
it's<00:01:26.909> really<00:01:27.000> no<00:01:27.180> big<00:01:27.360> deal<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.630> let<00:01:27.750> me<00:01:27.810> show

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
it's really no big deal but let me show

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.440 
it's really no big deal but let me show
you<00:01:27.990> how<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.229> works<00:01:28.409> okay<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.090> again<00:01:30.090> this

you how this works okay and again this
is<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:32.060> standby<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.540> big<00:01:34.170> discussion<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:34.920> it's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
is a standby as big discussion if it's

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.520 
is a standby as big discussion if it's
an<00:01:35.250> active<00:01:35.820> dual<00:01:36.299> sim<00:01:36.600> or<00:01:36.750> standby<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.500> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
an active dual sim or standby it is a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.620 
an active dual sim or standby it is a
stand<00:01:37.950> by<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.939> let<00:01:38.970> me<00:01:39.119> show<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.299> exactly<00:01:39.509> how
