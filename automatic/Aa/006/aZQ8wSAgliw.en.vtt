00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:30.480
 [music] 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.600
 we can catch almost any 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.130
 spinning bait appropriate 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.030
 their size or which you 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.059
 going to catch 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.820
 but in principle the most universal and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.920
 the best-performing regiment is not 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.150
 are two types of spinning baits 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.400
 This is primarily a turntable and jack in 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.620
 Basically, these two lures can be said 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.080
 equivalent and in certain conditions 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.270
 fishing and at certain times of the year is better 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.860
 are working 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.470
 spinner and in certain conditions better 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.260
 does the jack so in order to 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.580
 thoroughly understand each of 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.909
 spinning bait 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.310
 we will look at each one individually 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.170
 first of all we will talk about turntables 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.680
 I must say that in turntables 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.729
 it can be said the most versatile 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.640
 spinning bait for perch fishing 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.990
 because on the turntable catch a perch 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.120
 the easiest and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.190
 you need the least skills that is 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.800
 novice fisherman can go shop 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.080
 buy a little turntable from 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.600
 catching a perch but in order to good 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.580
 Catch the perch on the turntable first. 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.340
 as it were very good to understand themselves 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.100
 spinner in how they work like them 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.260
 arranged in what conditions works best 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.620
 one turntable in which conditions 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.660
 another spinner and generally to 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.710
 good catch on the turntable on even very 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.590
 know a lot and be able to 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.410
 and for any will have to like in part 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.050
 some turntables you make yourself 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.970
 that is, you can do turntables from scratch 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.400
 you can just take a corporate disassemble 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.250
 reassemble them in order to improve 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.370
 quality turntables because in any 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.410
 the case of turntables can be divided into 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.870
 two classes are serial turntables and 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.700
 turntables homemade serial this 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.019
 all kinds of branded turntables it 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.099
 turntables which are generally good 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.830
 work which is already debugged and their already 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:36.269
 do in large batches and in general 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.609
 very high repeatability homemade 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.960
 turntables or turntables of some craftsmen 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.270
 who deal seriously 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.890
 making my turntables I must say 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.350
 that in some cases are not 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.030
 something worse branded turn out to be 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.810
 better branded so now 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.100
 dwell specifically on the turntables and 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.320
 consider all the most important nuances 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.910
 which are characteristic of turntables for fishing 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.560
 perch would consider turntables in 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.690
 In general, we can say that the most 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.790
 universal turntable on which you can 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.160
 basically catch any bass it 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.100
 there will be the smallest turntables so 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.560
 called turntables double 0 triple 0 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.960
 but serial samples are usually 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.720
 turntables still double 0 that's two 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.420
 branded and this is now in the right hand 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.270
 me this is a homemade little turntable 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.280
 it is also an analogue of double 0 so here it is 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.980
 Generally considered sports turntables 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.200
 because such a spinner can 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.720
 catch the smallest eye of her in 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.280
 principle if the hand is not on the pond then 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.590
 of course catch him on 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.020
 the smallest spinner is easiest and 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.440
 It is no secret that in many competitions 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.150
 fishing spinning 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.820
 athletes very often do the result 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.920
 it is on catching a perch and catching a perch or 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.810
 on microjig or micro turntable and 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.000
 often the turntables nicknames 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.760
 appear to be leading the pedestal 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.380
 of honor because well, like competitions 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.030
 pass, that is, you can catch in general 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.760
 a certain type of fish that is prearranged 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.670
 I say the rules of the competition can 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.100
 go to catch mainly perch example 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.900
 coastal coastal perch travian to 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.870
 so-called as can be done 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.810
 result on pike perch and pike or the same 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.940
 ruddies need to say that small 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.980
 spinner in general than she is good at she 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.470
 good that you can catch her 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.870
 a lot of species of fish and fish not 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.730
 only predatory but also peaceful therefore 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.800
 Generally it is not only ok I have it 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.330
 lure micro spinner is in general then 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.810
 pretty universal bait 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.940
 if how to move away from the moment 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.150
 competitive and look at 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.940
 fishing in terms of trophies and from the point 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.950
 view as if success more or less 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.200
 decent because all the same small 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.419
 perch what to do with it salt it only 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.280
 In general, it is his and clean this complicated and 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.430
 ungrateful this occupation 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.530
 so, as it were, turntables can also 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.470
 divided into so-called sports 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.200
 turntables is a turntable there 2 0 3 0 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.780
 quads 0 and there is even a turntable and how 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.630
 would such amateur amateur 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.390
 turntables is already somewhere around 1 2 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.330
 numbers turntables in this situation speaking 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.250
 We like to base our rooms 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.390
 company classification mepps 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.390
 because this is the most
