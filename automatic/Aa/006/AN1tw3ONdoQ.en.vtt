00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.610 

so<00:00:01.790> let's<00:00:02.790> go<00:00:03.030> about<00:00:03.330> that<00:00:03.689> all-important

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
so let's go about that all-important

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.550 
so let's go about that all-important
mirroring<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.490> step<00:00:05.790> so<00:00:06.120> we<00:00:06.270> get<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.779> left

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
mirroring of the step so we get a left

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.490 
mirroring of the step so we get a left
and<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:08.250> right<00:00:08.280> step<00:00:08.910> forward<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.719> those<00:00:10.260> will

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
and a right step forward and those will

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.129 
and a right step forward and those will
be<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.980> two<00:00:11.670> building<00:00:12.059> blocks<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.780> we<00:00:12.900> need

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
be the two building blocks that we need

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.060 
be the two building blocks that we need
to<00:00:13.710> get<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.160> cycling<00:00:14.849> action<00:00:15.360> going<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.440> for<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
to get a cycling action going on for the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.790 
to get a cycling action going on for the
walk<00:00:17.279> now<00:00:18.270> before<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.720> start<00:00:18.779> I'm<00:00:19.350> going<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.680> do

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
walk now before we start I'm going to do

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.429 
walk now before we start I'm going to do
a<00:00:19.830> really<00:00:20.369> evil<00:00:20.880> trick<00:00:21.300> which<00:00:21.600> isn't<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
a really evil trick which isn't a

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.980 
a really evil trick which isn't a
hundred<00:00:22.800> percent<00:00:22.949> necessary<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.570> I'm<00:00:24.689> doing

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
hundred percent necessary but I'm doing

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.720 
hundred percent necessary but I'm doing
it<00:00:25.109> right<00:00:25.320> now<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.800> we<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.099> do<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.640> a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
it right now so we can do this in a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.669 
it right now so we can do this in a
completely<00:00:27.029> simple<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:30.199> I<00:00:31.199> won't<00:00:31.500> say

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
completely simple and I won't say

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.229 
completely simple and I won't say
brain-dead<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.610> way<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.059> won't

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
brain-dead but in a way that we won't

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.510 
brain-dead but in a way that we won't
have<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.600> think<00:00:33.899> too<00:00:34.110> much<00:00:34.350> about<00:00:34.680> what<00:00:35.370> we're

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
have to think too much about what we're

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.819 
have to think too much about what we're
doing<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.969> we're<00:00:36.180> copying<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.649> to

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
doing is we're copying and that is to

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.650 
doing is we're copying and that is to
key<00:00:37.980> every<00:00:38.370> single<00:00:38.790> one<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.000> these<00:00:39.270> channels

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
key every single one of these channels

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.280 
key every single one of these channels
on<00:00:40.110> each<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.160> key<00:00:41.399> poses<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> have

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
on each of the key poses that I have

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.060 
on each of the key poses that I have
made<00:00:43.530> for<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> walk<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:45.239> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.690> key

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
made for the walk so I'm going to key

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.190 
made for the walk so I'm going to key
unavailable<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.420> then<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.020> left

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
unavailable so I and then it's left

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.290 
unavailable so I and then it's left
available<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.940> all<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> bones<00:00:51.629> I

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
available and for all of the bones I

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.569 
available and for all of the bones I
notice<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.449> selected<00:00:54.960> them<00:00:55.230> by<00:00:55.890> hovering<00:00:56.340> over

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
notice I selected them by hovering over

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.400 
notice I selected them by hovering over
the<00:00:56.670> left<00:00:56.879> side<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> action<00:00:57.809> window<00:00:58.170> and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the left side of the action window and

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.799 
the left side of the action window and
hitting<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.890> once<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.430> twice<00:00:59.670> until<00:01:00.059> all<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
hitting a once or twice until all the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.030 
hitting a once or twice until all the
channels<00:01:01.170> were<00:01:01.320> selected<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:03.860> what<00:01:04.860> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
channels were selected and what that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.070 
channels were selected and what that
does<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.489> makes<00:01:05.880> sure<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.180> everything

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
does it just makes sure that everything

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.080 
does it just makes sure that everything
is<00:01:07.229> keyed<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.560> when<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.070> go<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> pace<00:01:08.580> mirrored

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
is keyed so when we go a pace mirrored

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.310 
is keyed so when we go a pace mirrored
we<00:01:09.900> won't<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.350> any<00:01:10.590> surprises<00:01:11.280> at<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:12.320> it's

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
we won't have any surprises at all it's

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.469 
we won't have any surprises at all it's
you<00:01:13.619> actually<00:01:13.979> won't<00:01:14.220> get<00:01:14.430> many<00:01:14.700> surprises

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
you actually won't get many surprises

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.690 
you actually won't get many surprises
and<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.350> feel<00:01:16.590> confident<00:01:17.189> enough<00:01:17.490> you

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and so if you feel confident enough you

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.999 
and so if you feel confident enough you
don't<00:01:17.820> need<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.570> step<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.830> is

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
don't need to do this step but this is

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.990 
don't need to do this step but this is
just<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:21.350> things<00:01:22.350> go<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:22.979> smoothly<00:01:23.549> as

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
just so that things go as smoothly as

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.710 
just so that things go as smoothly as
possible

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
possible

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.749 
possible
and<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.320> shouldn't<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:25.890> change<00:01:26.430> anything

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
and it shouldn't really change anything

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.240 
and it shouldn't really change anything
about<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.360> walks<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.470> key<00:01:28.680> things<00:01:29.040> in

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
about the walks and just key things in

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.010 
about the walks and just key things in
the<00:01:29.340> positions<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.000> they<00:01:30.210> were<00:01:30.270> already<00:01:30.540> in

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.170 

so<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:36.150> first<00:01:36.420> thing<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:38.180> is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
so the first thing you have to do is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.940 
so the first thing you have to do is
work<00:01:39.509> with<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.780> first<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.320> last<00:01:40.439> pose<00:01:40.740> so

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
work with the first and last pose so

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.490 
work with the first and last pose so
we'll<00:01:41.100> copy<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.670> first<00:01:41.939> pose<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.659> then

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
we'll copy that first pose and then

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.429 
we'll copy that first pose and then
we'll<00:01:43.680> paste<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.369> way<00:01:45.180> at<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.509> end<00:01:45.720> after<00:01:46.079> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
we'll paste it way at the end after the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.800 
we'll paste it way at the end after the
second<00:01:46.950> cycle<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> same<00:01:48.299> foot<00:01:48.630> will

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
second cycle because the same foot will

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.539 
second cycle because the same foot will
be<00:01:48.960> forward<00:01:49.439> at<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> beginning<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> end

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
be forward at the beginning and the end

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.420 
be forward at the beginning and the end
they'll<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.090> identical<00:01:51.720> poses<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.250> had

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
they'll be identical poses so we had

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.520 
they'll be identical poses so we had
gone<00:01:53.700> 12<00:01:54.030> frames<00:01:54.329> forward<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.079> beginning

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
gone 12 frames forward in the beginning

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.859 
gone 12 frames forward in the beginning
we<00:01:55.920> go<00:01:56.070> another<00:01:56.340> 12<00:01:56.700> frames<00:01:56.909> forward<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.659> frame

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
we go another 12 frames forward to frame

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.580 
we go another 12 frames forward to frame
25<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.939> then<00:01:59.939> now<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:00.149> just<00:02:00.509> paste<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:01.320> paste

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
25 and then now we just paste not paste

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.300 
25 and then now we just paste not paste
mirrored<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.310> paste<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
mirrored but paste and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.029 
mirrored but paste and
once<00:02:05.970> we<00:02:06.119> do<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.650> everything<00:02:07.650> jumps

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
once we do that everything jumps

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.910 
once we do that everything jumps
backwards<00:02:08.640> unfortunately<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.590> what<00:02:10.800> we

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
backwards unfortunately is not what we

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.340 
backwards unfortunately is not what we
want<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:12.270> character<00:02:12.450> should<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:12.900> moving

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
want the character should be moving

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.740 
want the character should be moving
forward<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.040> again<00:02:15.030> it's<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.480> matter<00:02:15.690> of

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
forward and again it's a matter of

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.840 
forward and again it's a matter of
selecting<00:02:16.350> those<00:02:16.500> three<00:02:16.860> bones<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.520> we<00:02:17.670> did

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
selecting those three bones like we did

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.650 
selecting those three bones like we did
earlier<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.569> offsetting<00:02:19.530> them<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
earlier and offsetting them so that the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.890 
earlier and offsetting them so that the
foot<00:02:21.930> that's<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.010> ground<00:02:23.300> stays<00:02:24.300> on<00:02:24.690> the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
foot that's on the ground stays on the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.270 
foot that's on the ground stays on the
ground<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.640> that<00:02:26.640> pose<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.650> now<00:02:28.830> let's<00:02:29.069> have<00:02:29.220> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
ground in that pose so now let's have a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.360 
ground in that pose so now let's have a
look<00:02:29.750> in<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> side<00:02:31.110> view<00:02:31.140> we<00:02:31.530> can<00:02:32.100> put<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
look in the side view we can put the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.059 
look in the side view we can put the
cursor<00:02:32.850> right<00:02:33.120> under<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.260> bone<00:02:34.440> just<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.800> sort

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
cursor right under the bone just to sort

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.120 
cursor right under the bone just to sort
of<00:02:35.130> marker<00:02:35.520> position<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.500> then<00:02:37.500> we'll<00:02:37.680> scrub

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
of marker position and then we'll scrub

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.280 
of marker position and then we'll scrub
forwards<00:02:38.730> that's<00:02:39.090> left<00:02:39.420> use<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.840> left<00:02:40.050> arrow

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
forwards that's left use the left arrow

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.740 
forwards that's left use the left arrow
left<00:02:40.650> mouse<00:02:41.220> button<00:02:41.250> by<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.790> way<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.090> drag<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
left mouse button by the way to drag the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.050 
left mouse button by the way to drag the
time<00:02:43.080> slider<00:02:43.110> forward<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.160> scrub<00:02:44.430> forward<00:02:44.730> on

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
time slider forward and scrub forward on

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.540 
time slider forward and scrub forward on
the<00:02:45.900> action<00:02:46.350> window<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.650> timeline<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.340> then<00:02:47.459> we

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
the action window a timeline and then we

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.850 
the action window a timeline and then we
move<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.970> three<00:02:48.570> bones<00:02:48.810> for<00:02:49.140> with<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.410> G<00:02:49.590> key

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
move that three bones for with the G key

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.520 
move that three bones for with the G key
with<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.850> ctrl<00:02:51.209> key<00:02:51.239> pressed<00:02:51.690> down<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.380> it's

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
with the ctrl key pressed down so it's

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.520 
with the ctrl key pressed down so it's
moving<00:02:52.739> on<00:02:52.980> integer<00:02:53.430> steps<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.720> we're<00:02:55.350> done

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
moving on integer steps and we're done

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.000 
moving on integer steps and we're done
and<00:02:55.910> now<00:02:56.910> we<00:02:56.970> have<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.300> step<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.500> simple

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
and now we have a step and that simple

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.330 
and now we have a step and that simple
slightly<00:02:59.700> thing<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.360> we<00:03:00.480> did<00:03:00.690> before<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.739> so

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
slightly thing that we did before the so

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.120 
slightly thing that we did before the so
a<00:03:02.370> step<00:03:02.790> skate<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.600> notice<00:03:04.530> I'm<00:03:04.650> leaving<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
a step skate and notice I'm leaving the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.410 
a step skate and notice I'm leaving the
cursor<00:03:05.519> in<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.880> position

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
cursor in that position

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.930 
cursor in that position
so<00:03:07.140> once<00:03:07.350> I've<00:03:07.530> marked<00:03:07.830> down<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.370> position<00:03:08.790> of

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
so once I've marked down the position of

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.060 
so once I've marked down the position of
the<00:03:09.090> heel<00:03:09.329> once<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:10.079> can<00:03:10.590> use<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.920> for

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
the heel once I can use it for

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.210 
the heel once I can use it for
references<00:03:11.760> for<00:03:12.269> referencing<00:03:12.870> for<00:03:13.769> each<00:03:13.920> time

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
references for referencing for each time

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.580 
references for referencing for each time
I<00:03:14.250> do<00:03:14.459> this<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.780> now<00:03:15.930> we'll<00:03:16.079> get<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.260> past

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
I do this so now we'll get the past

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.440 
I do this so now we'll get the past
position<00:03:16.829> over<00:03:17.400> there<00:03:17.610> we'll<00:03:18.090> go<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.299> the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
position over there we'll go to the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.229 
position over there we'll go to the
middle<00:03:18.690> here<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.230> we'll<00:03:19.980> paste<00:03:20.280> mirror<00:03:21.060> at

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
middle here and we'll paste mirror at

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.750 
middle here and we'll paste mirror at
this<00:03:21.540> time<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:23.010> just<00:03:23.190> drag<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.549> time<00:03:23.730> slider

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
this time so just drag the time slider

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.970 
this time so just drag the time slider
over<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.660> then<00:03:25.650> paste<00:03:25.950> mirrored<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:28.739> see

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
over and then paste mirrored and you see

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.780 
over and then paste mirrored and you see
how<00:03:29.160> things<00:03:29.489> jumped<00:03:30.180> backwards<00:03:31.579> so<00:03:32.579> let's

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
how things jumped backwards so let's

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.140 
how things jumped backwards so let's
select<00:03:33.000> our<00:03:33.329> three<00:03:33.600> bones<00:03:33.859> are<00:03:34.859> all<00:03:35.549> important

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
select our three bones are all important

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.949 
select our three bones are all important
three<00:03:36.450> bones<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:40.739> can<00:03:40.920> use<00:03:41.040> box<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.959> deselect

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
three bones you can use box and deselect

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.460 
three bones you can use box and deselect
that<00:03:43.549> extra<00:03:44.549> bone<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:44.970> picked<00:03:45.299> once<00:03:46.230> over

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
that extra bone that I picked once over

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.430 
that extra bone that I picked once over
we'll<00:03:46.620> drag<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.100> over<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.400> cursor<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:49.140> notice

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
we'll drag it over the cursor you notice

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.190 
we'll drag it over the cursor you notice
it's<00:03:49.590> moving<00:03:49.950> by<00:03:50.160> an<00:03:50.519> offset<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.480> two<00:03:51.810> each

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
it's moving by an offset of two each

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.289 
it's moving by an offset of two each
time<00:03:52.230> that's<00:03:52.980> going<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.220> be<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.370> constant<00:03:53.910> and

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
time that's going to be a constant and

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.180 
time that's going to be a constant and
that's<00:03:54.510> because<00:03:54.930> that's<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.769> amount<00:03:56.100> that

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
that's because that's the amount that

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.370 
that's because that's the amount that
the<00:03:56.400> feet<00:03:56.609> were<00:03:56.820> offset<00:03:57.329> from<00:03:57.540> each<00:03:57.660> other<00:03:58.079> on

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
the feet were offset from each other on

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.550 
the feet were offset from each other on
that<00:03:59.040> first<00:03:59.280> pose<00:03:59.730> so<00:04:00.660> if<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.079> remember<00:04:01.350> that

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
that first pose so if you remember that

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.380 
that first pose so if you remember that
that's<00:04:02.010> also<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.400> trick<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.060> can<00:04:03.239> use

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
that's also a trick and you can use

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.810 
that's also a trick and you can use
numerical<00:04:03.930> input<00:04:04.109> for<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.640> this<00:04:05.640> is

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
numerical input for that this is

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.750 
numerical input for that this is
starting<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.269> look<00:04:06.420> really<00:04:06.989> okay<00:04:07.560> we<00:04:08.549> just

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
starting to look really okay we just

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.120 
starting to look really okay we just
have<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:08.940> few<00:04:09.269> more<00:04:09.420> four<00:04:10.109> more<00:04:10.260> poses<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.859> copy

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
have a few more four more poses to copy

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.540 
have a few more four more poses to copy
and<00:04:11.400> we're<00:04:11.549> done<00:04:11.820> so<00:04:12.660> once<00:04:12.840> again<00:04:13.019> a<00:04:13.409> key<00:04:14.069> over

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
and we're done so once again a key over

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.229 
and we're done so once again a key over
the<00:04:14.640> left<00:04:14.849> side<00:04:14.940> of<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.330> action<00:04:15.720> error<00:04:16.010> copy

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
the left side of the action error copy

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.969 
the left side of the action error copy
then<00:04:18.359> we'll<00:04:18.509> move<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.959> equivalent<00:04:19.680> frame

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
then we'll move to the equivalent frame

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.370 
then we'll move to the equivalent frame
and<00:04:21.109> paste<00:04:22.109> nerd<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:23.630> now<00:04:24.630> we<00:04:24.690> have<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.110> drag

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
and paste nerd and now we have to drag

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.409 
and paste nerd and now we have to drag
the<00:04:25.560> three<00:04:25.800> bones<00:04:26.099> forward<00:04:26.789> so<00:04:27.030> we'll<00:04:27.210> select

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
the three bones forward so we'll select

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:35.839 
the three bones forward so we'll select
them<00:04:30.380> so<00:04:32.509> and<00:04:33.919> then<00:04:34.919> we'll<00:04:35.190> go<00:04:35.370> back<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.729> the

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
them so and then we'll go back to the

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.999 
them so and then we'll go back to the
side<00:04:36.090> view<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.389> move<00:04:36.810> them<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.770> heel

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
side view and move them so that the heel

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:43.480 
side view and move them so that the heel
is<00:04:38.310> over<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.000> cursor<00:04:40.789> see<00:04:41.789> that<00:04:41.970> front<00:04:42.240> heel

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
is over the cursor see that front heel

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.800 
is over the cursor see that front heel
should<00:04:44.490> be<00:04:44.669> over<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.060> cursor<00:04:45.449> because<00:04:45.630> that's

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
should be over the cursor because that's

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.589 
should be over the cursor because that's
the<00:04:45.930> foot<00:04:46.110> that's<00:04:46.259> on<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.620> ground<00:04:47.449> so<00:04:48.449> we'll

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
the foot that's on the ground so we'll

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.760 
the foot that's on the ground so we'll
just<00:04:48.870> go<00:04:50.599> so<00:04:51.599> we'll<00:04:51.750> just<00:04:51.900> make<00:04:52.080> sure<00:04:52.349> that<00:04:52.590> the

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
just go so we'll just make sure that the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.409 
just go so we'll just make sure that the
position<00:04:52.979> is<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.400> same<00:04:53.729> in<00:04:53.909> both<00:04:54.060> of<00:04:54.120> those

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
position is the same in both of those

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.559 
position is the same in both of those
frames<00:04:54.780> we'll<00:04:55.080> just<00:04:55.289> grab<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:56.449> with<00:04:57.449> the

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
frames we'll just grab it and with the

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.809 
frames we'll just grab it and with the
ctrl<00:04:57.930> key<00:04:58.110> pressed<00:04:58.139> and<00:04:58.860> we<00:04:59.280> can<00:04:59.430> middle<00:04:59.669> Mouse

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
ctrl key pressed and we can middle Mouse

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:01.969 
ctrl key pressed and we can middle Mouse
if<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.150> want<00:05:00.330> to<00:05:00.419> snap<00:05:00.690> to<00:05:00.900> one<00:05:00.930> axis<00:05:01.740> and

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
if you want to snap to one axis and

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.460 
if you want to snap to one axis and
click<00:05:02.310> there<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:02.789> that<00:05:03.750> we<00:05:03.870> have<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:04.229> nice

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
click there and that we have that nice

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.570 
click there and that we have that nice
and<00:05:04.770> easy<00:05:06.440> now<00:05:07.440> let's<00:05:07.620> go<00:05:07.800> back<00:05:08.009> to<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.340> pose

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
and easy now let's go back to the pose

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.110 
and easy now let's go back to the pose
after<00:05:08.909> that<00:05:09.979> that<00:05:10.979> extra<00:05:11.250> pose<00:05:11.550> we<00:05:11.789> added

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
after that that extra pose we added

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.939 
after that that extra pose we added
while<00:05:12.270> we<00:05:12.419> were<00:05:12.509> taking<00:05:12.720> select<00:05:13.560> all<00:05:13.800> the

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
while we were taking select all the

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.580 
while we were taking select all the
bones<00:05:13.979> and<00:05:14.669> then<00:05:15.270> copy<00:05:15.569> the<00:05:15.870> pose<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.110> the

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
bones and then copy the pose to the

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.309 
bones and then copy the pose to the
buffer<00:05:16.949> and<00:05:17.659> now<00:05:18.659> we'll<00:05:18.840> go<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.050> the

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
buffer and now we'll go to the

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.290 
buffer and now we'll go to the
equivalent<00:05:19.830> pose<00:05:20.039> and<00:05:20.430> we'll<00:05:20.580> paste<00:05:20.819> mirrored

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
equivalent pose and we'll paste mirrored

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.209 
equivalent pose and we'll paste mirrored
and<00:05:21.680> now<00:05:22.680> select<00:05:22.979> our<00:05:23.840> three<00:05:24.840> bones<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.740> left

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
and now select our three bones the left

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.800 
and now select our three bones the left
and<00:05:26.430> right<00:05:26.610> feet<00:05:26.880> in<00:05:27.090> the<00:05:27.180> torso<00:05:29.419> go<00:05:30.419> back<00:05:30.630> to

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
and right feet in the torso go back to

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.740 
and right feet in the torso go back to
the<00:05:30.930> side<00:05:31.139> view<00:05:31.699> this<00:05:32.699> is<00:05:32.909> getting<00:05:33.240> very

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
the side view this is getting very

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.350 
the side view this is getting very
familiar<00:05:34.050> by<00:05:34.530> now<00:05:34.740> isn't<00:05:35.009> it<00:05:35.280> and<00:05:35.520> then<00:05:36.449> I

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
familiar by now isn't it and then I

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.730 
familiar by now isn't it and then I
notice<00:05:39.360> yet<00:05:39.659> that<00:05:39.840> cursor<00:05:40.259> is<00:05:40.380> still<00:05:40.560> a

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
notice yet that cursor is still a

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.529 
notice yet that cursor is still a
valuable<00:05:41.219> guide<00:05:41.580> that's<00:05:41.909> always<00:05:42.120> where<00:05:42.509> the

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
valuable guide that's always where the

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.589 
valuable guide that's always where the
heel<00:05:43.080> of<00:05:43.289> that<00:05:44.099> foot<00:05:44.400> is<00:05:44.580> going<00:05:44.820> to<00:05:44.969> be<00:05:45.240> in<00:05:45.389> each

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
heel of that foot is going to be in each

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.920 
heel of that foot is going to be in each
pose<00:05:46.099> so<00:05:47.099> with<00:05:47.250> a<00:05:47.280> ctrl<00:05:47.729> key<00:05:47.969> pressed<00:05:48.000> drag<00:05:48.719> the

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
pose so with a ctrl key pressed drag the

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.499 
pose so with a ctrl key pressed drag the
bones<00:05:49.139> forward<00:05:49.680> and<00:05:50.280> we're<00:05:50.940> done<00:05:51.120> with<00:05:51.300> that

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
bones forward and we're done with that

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.209 
bones forward and we're done with that
now<00:05:51.719> we<00:05:51.780> just<00:05:51.990> have<00:05:52.139> to<00:05:52.259> do<00:05:52.409> those<00:05:52.710> two<00:05:52.949> poses

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:53.219 
now we just have to do those two poses

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:56.689 
now we just have to do those two poses
and<00:05:53.729> the<00:05:53.819> other<00:05:54.000> half<00:05:54.330> of<00:05:54.719> the<00:05:55.050> cycle<00:05:55.580> so<00:05:56.580> we

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
and the other half of the cycle so we

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:59.209 
and the other half of the cycle so we
have<00:05:56.849> to<00:05:56.940> do<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.270> up<00:05:57.509> and<00:05:57.810> then<00:05:58.740> that<00:05:58.949> extra

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.219 
have to do the up and then that extra

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:02.209 
have to do the up and then that extra
keyframe<00:05:59.819> we<00:05:59.969> added<00:06:00.300> in<00:06:00.389> the<00:06:00.509> middle<00:06:00.750> there<00:06:01.219> so

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:02.219 
keyframe we added in the middle there so

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:07.370 
keyframe we added in the middle there so
we<00:06:02.310> select<00:06:02.639> everything<00:06:03.590> copy

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.460 

copy<00:06:08.370> after<00:06:08.850> we<00:06:09.180> got<00:06:09.330> a<00:06:09.360> Keith<00:06:09.810> angled<00:06:10.260> and

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
copy after we got a Keith angled and

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.330 
copy after we got a Keith angled and
then<00:06:11.100> we<00:06:11.190> go<00:06:11.400> to<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.670> equivalent<00:06:12.180> frame<00:06:13.340> paste

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
then we go to the equivalent frame paste

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.850 
then we go to the equivalent frame paste
nerd<00:06:14.900> by<00:06:15.900> the<00:06:15.960> way<00:06:16.080> all<00:06:16.260> these<00:06:16.410> equivalent

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
nerd by the way all these equivalent

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.550 
nerd by the way all these equivalent
frames<00:06:17.520> are<00:06:18.060> a<00:06:19.160> cycle<00:06:20.160> ahead<00:06:20.780> from<00:06:21.780> the<00:06:22.440> other

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
frames are a cycle ahead from the other

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.150 
frames are a cycle ahead from the other
one<00:06:22.860> so<00:06:23.930> it<00:06:24.930> should<00:06:25.110> be<00:06:25.140> pretty<00:06:25.410> easy<00:06:25.500> to<00:06:25.980> find

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
one so it should be pretty easy to find

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.870 
one so it should be pretty easy to find
them<00:06:26.460> there

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
them there

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.080 
them there
I<00:06:26.910> guess<00:06:27.630> twelve<00:06:27.900> frames<00:06:28.170> ahead<00:06:28.940> because<00:06:29.940> we

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
I guess twelve frames ahead because we

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.080 
I guess twelve frames ahead because we
had<00:06:30.240> a<00:06:30.270> twelve<00:06:30.570> frame<00:06:30.780> cycle<00:06:31.290> for<00:06:31.500> our<00:06:31.530> walk<00:06:32.090> so

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
had a twelve frame cycle for our walk so

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.120 
had a twelve frame cycle for our walk so
you<00:06:33.180> can<00:06:33.480> visually<00:06:33.990> see<00:06:34.020> then<00:06:34.470> the<00:06:34.710> action

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
you can visually see then the action

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.860 
you can visually see then the action
editor<00:06:35.250> or<00:06:35.730> you<00:06:35.910> can<00:06:36.090> just<00:06:36.300> measure<00:06:36.480> twelve

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
editor or you can just measure twelve

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.710 
editor or you can just measure twelve
frames<00:06:37.080> ahead<00:06:37.350> each<00:06:38.160> time<00:06:38.550> so<00:06:39.330> let's<00:06:39.450> go<00:06:39.660> to

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
frames ahead each time so let's go to

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.650 
frames ahead each time so let's go to
the<00:06:39.930> next<00:06:40.080> one<00:06:40.440> this<00:06:41.430> is<00:06:41.490> the<00:06:41.760> last<00:06:41.790> pose<00:06:42.420> we're

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
the next one this is the last pose we're

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.160 
the next one this is the last pose we're
going<00:06:42.690> to<00:06:42.960> have<00:06:43.080> to<00:06:43.230> copy<00:06:43.640> we'll<00:06:44.640> copy<00:06:44.940> it<00:06:45.240> and

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.170 
going to have to copy we'll copy it and

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.830 
going to have to copy we'll copy it and
we'll<00:06:46.590> go<00:06:46.770> to<00:06:46.830> all<00:06:47.010> frames<00:06:47.280> ahead<00:06:47.840> pace

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
we'll go to all frames ahead pace

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.320 
we'll go to all frames ahead pace
mirrored<00:06:49.400> and<00:06:50.400> once<00:06:50.640> again<00:06:50.790> we<00:06:51.030> have<00:06:51.180> to

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
mirrored and once again we have to

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.770 
mirrored and once again we have to
select<00:06:51.720> these<00:06:51.900> three<00:06:52.680> bones<00:06:52.890> and<00:06:53.600> make<00:06:54.600> sure

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
select these three bones and make sure

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:03.620 
select these three bones and make sure
they're<00:06:54.990> in<00:06:55.020> the<00:06:55.230> right<00:06:55.260> spot<00:07:00.980> yeah<00:07:01.980> I<00:07:02.630> think

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630 
they're in the right spot yeah I think

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.510 
they're in the right spot yeah I think
the<00:07:03.900> zoom<00:07:04.110> is<00:07:04.290> important<00:07:04.800> that<00:07:04.950> you<00:07:05.100> can<00:07:05.250> see

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
the zoom is important that you can see

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.340 
the zoom is important that you can see
the<00:07:05.730> grid<00:07:05.970> when<00:07:06.510> you're<00:07:06.660> dragging<00:07:06.900> things

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
the grid when you're dragging things

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.220 
the grid when you're dragging things
with<00:07:07.530> the<00:07:07.650> ctrl<00:07:08.100> key<00:07:08.430> pressed<00:07:09.050> so<00:07:10.050> there's

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230 
with the ctrl key pressed so there's

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.430 
with the ctrl key pressed so there's
another<00:07:10.440> even<00:07:10.860> offset<00:07:11.510> and<00:07:12.510> now<00:07:13.170> we're

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 
another even offset and now we're

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.510 
another even offset and now we're
actually<00:07:13.620> done<00:07:14.220> having<00:07:15.120> our<00:07:15.450> forward<00:07:16.520> cycle

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 
actually done having our forward cycle

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.570 
actually done having our forward cycle
in<00:07:17.820> place<00:07:18.750> just<00:07:19.050> a<00:07:19.590> little<00:07:19.860> thing<00:07:20.070> we<00:07:20.220> can<00:07:20.400> do

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 
in place just a little thing we can do

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.960 
in place just a little thing we can do
is<00:07:20.790> change<00:07:21.090> the<00:07:21.330> end<00:07:21.480> free<00:07:21.900> Came<00:07:22.290> of<00:07:22.470> free

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:22.970 
is change the end free Came of free

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:28.280 
is change the end free Came of free
interim<00:07:23.970> of<00:07:24.090> the<00:07:24.180> animation<00:07:24.810> to<00:07:25.350> frame<00:07:25.590> 25<00:07:27.290> by

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.290 
interim of the animation to frame 25 by

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.800 
interim of the animation to frame 25 by
going<00:07:29.040> to<00:07:29.190> that<00:07:29.220> keyframe<00:07:29.910> and<00:07:30.180> hitting<00:07:30.480> in

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810 
going to that keyframe and hitting in

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.780 
going to that keyframe and hitting in
the<00:07:30.930> timeline<00:07:31.380> ever<00:07:31.590> and<00:07:32.360> now<00:07:33.360> we<00:07:33.420> have<00:07:33.660> it
