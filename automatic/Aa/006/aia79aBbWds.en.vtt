render render Animation now this may

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.350

take<00:04:42.050> different<00:04:42.320> periods<00:04:42.890> of<00:04:42.950> time<00:04:43.360> depending

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
take different periods of time depending

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.510 
take different periods of time depending
on<00:04:44.600> what<00:04:44.870> type<00:04:45.020> of<00:04:45.050> computer<00:04:45.380> you<00:04:45.590> have<00:04:45.620> and

on what type of computer you have and

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.480 
on what type of computer you have and
Max<00:04:47.090> is<00:04:47.300> usually<00:04:47.720> pretty<00:04:47.900> dang<00:04:48.140> fast<00:04:48.380> on<00:04:49.100> other

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
Max is usually pretty dang fast on other

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.880 
Max is usually pretty dang fast on other
computers<00:04:49.700> it<00:04:50.240> may<00:04:50.390> not<00:04:50.510> be<00:04:50.570> as<00:04:50.750> fast<00:04:50.990> but<00:04:51.410> the

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
computers it may not be as fast but the

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.340 
computers it may not be as fast but the
more<00:04:52.520> RAM<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.600> better<00:04:53.780> processor<00:04:54.260> you

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
more RAM and the better processor you

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.560 
more RAM and the better processor you
have<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:54.860> faster<00:04:55.340> it's<00:04:55.460> going<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:55.670> render<00:04:55.850> so

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
have the faster it's going to render so

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.960 
have the faster it's going to render so
we'll<00:04:56.960> wait<00:04:57.110> till<00:04:57.320> this<00:04:57.410> renders<00:04:57.800> and<00:04:58.100> I'll<00:04:58.610> be

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
we'll wait till this renders and I'll be

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.750 
we'll wait till this renders and I'll be
back<00:04:59.150> right<00:04:59.360> well<00:04:59.630> then<00:05:00.280> so<00:05:01.280> now<00:05:01.430> as<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:01.670> can

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
back right well then so now as you can

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.180 
back right well then so now as you can
see<00:05:01.820> i<00:05:02.030> have<00:05:02.240> finished<00:05:02.660> rendering<00:05:03.050> so<00:05:03.800> i'm

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
see i have finished rendering so i'm

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.250 
see i have finished rendering so i'm
just<00:05:04.220> going<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.550> go<00:05:04.640> ahead<00:05:04.790> and<00:05:05.150> say<00:05:05.600> this<00:05:05.870> just

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
just going to go ahead and say this just

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.500 
just going to go ahead and say this just
so<00:05:06.590> in<00:05:06.950> case<00:05:07.190> it<00:05:07.400> didn't<00:05:07.610> render<00:05:07.790> properly<00:05:08.090> and

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
so in case it didn't render properly and

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.160 
so in case it didn't render properly and
we<00:05:09.410> can<00:05:09.530> go<00:05:09.650> ahead<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:09.860> thus<00:05:10.550> now<00:05:10.700> for<00:05:11.480> now<00:05:11.570> and

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
we can go ahead and thus now for now and

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.070 
we can go ahead and thus now for now and
as<00:05:12.560> you<00:05:12.710> can<00:05:12.830> see<00:05:12.860> we<00:05:13.160> now<00:05:13.280> have<00:05:13.580> our<00:05:14.080> thing

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
as you can see we now have our thing

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.770 
as you can see we now have our thing
here<00:05:15.350> so<00:05:15.910> i'm<00:05:16.910> just<00:05:16.970> gonna<00:05:17.150> go<00:05:17.390> ahead<00:05:17.480> and<00:05:17.600> open

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
here so i'm just gonna go ahead and open

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.720 
here so i'm just gonna go ahead and open
up<00:05:18.020> you<00:05:18.260> can<00:05:18.410> see<00:05:20.260> now<00:05:21.260> sometimes<00:05:22.130> blender

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
up you can see now sometimes blender

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.300 
up you can see now sometimes blender
does<00:05:23.300> render<00:05:23.810> a<00:05:23.840> bit<00:05:24.260> fast<00:05:24.590> like<00:05:24.950> right<00:05:25.160> there

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
does render a bit fast like right there

if i put them together you can see if it

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.200 
if i put them together you can see if it
rendered<00:05:57.590> properly<00:05:57.830> it'll<00:05:58.280> be<00:05:58.460> perfectly<00:05:59.030> as

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210
