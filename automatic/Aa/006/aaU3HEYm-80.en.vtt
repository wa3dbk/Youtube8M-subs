00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
have it in there by now but as I was

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.340 
have it in there by now but as I was
doing<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.750> noticed<00:00:33.750> my<00:00:33.870> motor<00:00:34.110> was

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
doing this I noticed my motor was

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.190 
doing this I noticed my motor was
leaning<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:34.829> side<00:00:35.780> and<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.930> what<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
leaning to one side and this is what a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.920 
leaning to one side and this is what a
daily<00:00:37.559> driver<00:00:37.860> looks<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.370> all<00:00:39.210> greasy<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
daily driver looks like all greasy and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.260 
daily driver looks like all greasy and
nasty<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.500> junk<00:00:40.829> under<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> hood<00:00:44.270> but

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
nasty with junk under the hood but

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.910 
nasty with junk under the hood but
anyway<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.660> was<00:00:45.930> noticing<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.469> motor<00:00:46.680> was

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
anyway I was noticing the motor was

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.750 
anyway I was noticing the motor was
leaning<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:47.460> side<00:00:48.559> and<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.649> got<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.270 

exploring<00:00:53.760> wine<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.620> discovered<00:00:56.129> that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
exploring wine and I discovered that

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.220 
exploring wine and I discovered that
this<00:00:56.460> side<00:00:56.730> motor<00:00:57.059> mount<00:00:58.280> is<00:00:59.280> loose<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.230> know

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
this side motor mount is loose you know

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.640 
this side motor mount is loose you know
originally<00:01:01.649> they<00:01:01.800> had<00:01:01.949> these<00:01:02.070> old<00:01:02.250> peg<00:01:02.489> mounts

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
originally they had these old peg mounts

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.219 
originally they had these old peg mounts
well<00:01:04.650> when<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> put<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.220> 350<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.900> turbo

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
well when I put that 350 in and a turbo

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.300 
well when I put that 350 in and a turbo
350<00:01:07.560> trans<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:09.330> motor<00:01:09.680> rock<00:01:10.680> back<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.010> forth

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
350 trans the motor rock back and forth

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.520 
350 trans the motor rock back and forth
too<00:01:11.520> much<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> motor<00:01:12.720> installed<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.320> put

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
too much with the motor installed I put

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.219 
too much with the motor installed I put
these<00:01:13.710> Dan<00:01:14.130> Chuck<00:01:14.460> bounce<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.960> never

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
these Dan Chuck bounce in but I never

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.740 
these Dan Chuck bounce in but I never
did<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> very<00:01:16.740> good<00:01:16.979> weld<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.580> them<00:01:17.750> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
did get a very good weld on them and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.100 
did get a very good weld on them and
this<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.110> broke<00:01:19.350> loose<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.930> thought

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
this one broke loose and I thought

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.810 
this one broke loose and I thought
rather<00:01:22.439> than<00:01:22.680> try<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> weld<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
rather than try to weld it up with the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.100 
rather than try to weld it up with the
motor<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.180> there<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.750> see<00:01:24.810> it's

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
motor in there and as you can see it's

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.249 
motor in there and as you can see it's
quite<00:01:25.320> greasy<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.070> nasty<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.930> it's<00:01:27.930> probably

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
quite greasy and nasty and it's probably

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.210 
quite greasy and nasty and it's probably
gonna<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.560> fire<00:01:28.829> hazard<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:30.890> decided<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.100> go

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
gonna be a fire hazard I decided to go

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.649 
gonna be a fire hazard I decided to go
ahead<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.430> yank<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.729> motor<00:01:32.939> out<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
ahead and yank the motor out with the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.120 
ahead and yank the motor out with the
transmission<00:01:34.140> then<00:01:34.350> bolted<00:01:34.710> from<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> back

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
transmission then bolted from the back

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.010 
transmission then bolted from the back
of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.340> motor<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.790> not<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> whole<00:01:36.840> lot<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
of the motor it's not a whole lot to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.620 
of the motor it's not a whole lot to
pulling<00:01:37.500> these<00:01:37.590> motors<00:01:37.979> out<00:01:38.329> so<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.390> went<00:01:39.570> ahead

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
pulling these motors out so I went ahead

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.410 
pulling these motors out so I went ahead
and<00:01:39.780> pulled<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> motor<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:41.150> and<00:01:42.150> now<00:01:42.360> I'm

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and pulled the motor out and now I'm

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.999 
and pulled the motor out and now I'm
going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.630> clean<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.110> some<00:01:43.619> not<00:01:44.009> much<00:01:44.630> and

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
going to clean this up some not much and

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.490 
going to clean this up some not much and
weld<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.250> mount<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.880> correctly<00:01:48.659> same<00:01:49.290> thing

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500

I'll<00:01:49.770> weld<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.159> other<00:01:50.340> mount<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.850> much<00:01:51.299> better

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
I'll weld the other mount on much better

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.800 
I'll weld the other mount on much better
also

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.030
