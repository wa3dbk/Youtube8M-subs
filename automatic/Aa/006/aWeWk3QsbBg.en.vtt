00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.770
 flavonoid tender is actually a 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.960
 a little dark, let's say I'm one 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.340
 category of antioxidants a category 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.350
 very large is thought to be around 5,000 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.779
 antioxidant substances that are part 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.580
 of the flavonoid category and how 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.350
 all antioxidants their function 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.939
 is to dab the damage from 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.160
 free radicals are free radicals 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.460
 of the substances that are formed in 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.140
 but cellular metabolism but they have 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.630
 of negative properties towards 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.110
 of cells create real ones 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.309
 damage and are involved with 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.950
 aging and with a whole series 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.480
 of pathologies that emerge precisely with the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.390
 old age from the pathologies 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.320
 cardiovascular and cancer 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.030
 in the cardiocirculatory field e 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.340
 Flavonoids are quite known are 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.829
 also used as a therapy for the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.860
 vessel protection for these 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.289
 properties where they are but in the end 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.230
 can be found in so many foods you can 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.820
 certainly look for the food that comes from 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.670
 other part of the world full of 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.900
 flavonoids but actually 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.200
 the important thing is to eat lots of fruit 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.369
 so many vegetables and so many vegetables 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.630
 way you take mixtures of 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.330
 antioxidants that have an action 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.070
 synergistic in general more effective and more 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.610
 powerful than the one you get 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.110
 then focusing on just one molecule 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.759
 rather simple flavonoids reduce 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.549
 oxidative stress can be found in 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.740
 I know vegetable fruits will seem like one 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.590
 stupid reflections but it's crazy 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.299
 think that just being careful a 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.400
 eat plenty of fruit, lots of vegetables 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.079
 many vegetables can do everything 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.840
 this is for one's own well-being 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.939
 of your health 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.220
 yes but sometimes the most important things 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.619
 they come from things we interpret as 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.290
 trivial and wrong to do so well known 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.240
 but that are years and years that you fight 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.210
 on the consumption of fruit and vegetables but me 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.219
 results from expert sources in the sector who 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.450
 consumption is actually falling in the 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.890
 last years 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.320
 so the problem is that sometimes 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.299
 we look for miracle solutions very much 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.429
 distant and we forget that from 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.790
 small daily choices depends instead 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.180
 long-term health 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.180
 I believe it
