00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
here of 22,000 square feet started off

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.740 
here of 22,000 square feet started off
as<00:00:26.900> a<00:00:27.529> add<00:00:28.400> on<00:00:28.730> that<00:00:28.760> turned<00:00:29.270> into<00:00:29.720> a

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
as a add on that turned into a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.019 
as a add on that turned into a
full-blown<00:00:30.350> production<00:00:31.070> facility<00:00:31.550> now<00:00:31.730> where

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
as you bend it this blue machine here

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.930 
as you bend it this blue machine here
actually<00:01:06.409> allows<00:01:06.770> us<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.100> do<00:01:07.220> some<00:01:07.430> really

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
actually allows us to do some really

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.580 
actually allows us to do some really
tight<00:01:08.120> radius<00:01:08.390> bends<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:09.110> help<00:01:09.409> achieve

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
those really high exhaust systems on

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.180 
those really high exhaust systems on
those<00:01:13.070> Sidewinders<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:13.970> really<00:01:15.190> benefit

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
those Sidewinders that really benefit

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.650 
those Sidewinders that really benefit
the<00:01:16.310> consumers<00:01:16.850> when<00:01:17.000> they're<00:01:17.150> purchasing<00:01:17.540> a

the consumers when they're purchasing a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.029 
the consumers when they're purchasing a
pipe

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.639 

we<00:01:22.039> also<00:01:22.250> have<00:01:22.579> five<00:01:22.880> welding<00:01:23.420> stations<00:01:23.960> four

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
we also have five welding stations four

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.359 
we also have five welding stations four
of<00:01:24.859> them<00:01:25.070> consists<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:25.850> TIG<00:01:26.420> welding<00:01:26.929> and<00:01:27.369> one

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
of them consists of TIG welding and one

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.370 
of them consists of TIG welding and one
is<00:01:28.549> MIG<00:01:28.789> welding<00:01:29.299> and<00:01:29.450> then<00:01:29.539> we<00:01:29.659> also<00:01:29.840> have<00:01:29.990> one

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
is MIG welding and then we also have one

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.109 
is MIG welding and then we also have one
other<00:01:30.560> station<00:01:31.130> that<00:01:31.250> we<00:01:31.369> don't<00:01:31.490> run<00:01:31.759> all<00:01:32.000> the

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
other station that we don't run all the

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.440 
other station that we don't run all the
time<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:32.630> it's<00:01:32.659> sort<00:01:32.929> of<00:01:33.079> like<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.380> oddball

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
time so it's sort of like the oddball

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.730 
time so it's sort of like the oddball
welding<00:01:35.450> station<00:01:35.719> it's<00:01:36.079> whatever<00:01:36.469> you<00:01:36.590> need

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
welding station it's whatever you need

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.559 
welding station it's whatever you need
to<00:01:36.770> do<00:01:36.979> with<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.280> at<00:01:37.579> your<00:01:37.789> current<00:01:38.000> time<00:01:38.179> so

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
to do with the at your current time so

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.840 
to do with the at your current time so
there's<00:01:38.959> a<00:01:39.049> total<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.530> six<00:01:39.590> but<00:01:40.069> five<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.610> run

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
there's a total of six but five that run

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.029 
there's a total of six but five that run
all<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.329> time<00:01:43.479> on<00:01:44.479> your<00:01:45.170> right<00:01:45.380> hand<00:01:45.649> side<00:01:45.860> is

you're<00:01:48.229> done<00:01:48.319> forming<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:48.950> exhaust<00:01:49.340> and

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
you're done forming the exhaust and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.880 
you're done forming the exhaust and
getting<00:01:50.209> it<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.929> correct<00:01:51.200> shape<00:01:51.530> that<00:01:51.860> you
