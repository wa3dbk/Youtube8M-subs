there<00:00:48.260> are<00:00:48.350> three<00:00:48.559> takeaway<00:00:49.039> points<00:00:49.489> that

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
there are three takeaway points that

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.160 
there are three takeaway points that
folks<00:00:49.910> should<00:00:50.000> get<00:00:50.270> from<00:00:50.480> this<00:00:50.629> presentation

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
folks should get from this presentation

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.380 
folks should get from this presentation
it's<00:00:51.500> basically<00:00:51.920> a<00:00:52.070> picture<00:00:52.520> show<00:00:52.760> it's<00:00:53.300> a

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
it's basically a picture show it's a

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.479 
it's basically a picture show it's a
history<00:00:53.809> of<00:00:53.930> how<00:00:54.199> we<00:00:54.260> came<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:54.770> this<00:00:54.890> point<00:00:55.219> and

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
history of how we came to this point and

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.000 
history of how we came to this point and
the<00:00:55.940> pearls<00:00:56.239> of<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:57.320> system<00:00:57.710> that<00:00:57.739> we<00:00:57.980> have

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
the pearls of the system that we have

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.119 
the pearls of the system that we have
now<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:58.730> really<00:00:59.210> why<00:00:59.570> folks<00:00:59.930> should<00:01:00.289> adopt<00:01:00.800> a

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
now and really why folks should adopt a

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.570 
now and really why folks should adopt a
House<00:01:01.670> bill<00:01:01.840> 639<00:01:02.840> in<00:01:03.019> favor<00:01:03.289> of<00:01:03.500> sound<00:01:04.309> money

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
House bill 639 in favor of sound money

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.450 
House bill 639 in favor of sound money
and<00:01:04.879> so<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.600> first<00:01:05.840> takeaway<00:01:06.320> point<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:07.160> that

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
and so the first takeaway point is that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.060 
and so the first takeaway point is that
the<00:01:07.580> system<00:01:08.030> we<00:01:08.149> have<00:01:08.179> now<00:01:08.420> is<00:01:09.070> unauthorized

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
the system we have now is unauthorized

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.160 
the system we have now is unauthorized
by<00:01:10.369> our<00:01:10.490> Constitution<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:11.539> other<00:01:11.690> words<00:01:11.929> to

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
by our Constitution in other words to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.100 
by our Constitution in other words to
say<00:01:12.410> it<00:01:12.920> is<00:01:13.100> unlawful<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:14.390> second<00:01:14.810> takeaway

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
say it is unlawful the second takeaway

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.469 
say it is unlawful the second takeaway
point<00:01:15.649> then<00:01:15.890> very<00:01:16.130> importantly<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:17.149> I'm

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
point then very importantly and I'm

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.090 
point then very importantly and I'm
going<00:01:17.660> to<00:01:17.750> demonstrate<00:01:17.869> this<00:01:18.470> throughout<00:01:18.890> my

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
going to demonstrate this throughout my

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.400 
going to demonstrate this throughout my
presentation<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:20.360> present<00:01:20.840> system<00:01:21.020> is

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
presentation the present system is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.980 
presentation the present system is
dishonest<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.369> as<00:01:23.179> soon<00:01:23.360> as<00:01:23.479> you<00:01:23.599> know<00:01:23.780> that

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
dishonest and as soon as you know that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.139 
dishonest and as soon as you know that
if<00:01:24.080> system<00:01:24.410> is<00:01:24.560> dishonest<00:01:25.099> you<00:01:25.520> have<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:25.880> step

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
if system is dishonest you have to step

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.690 
if system is dishonest you have to step
aside<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:26.660> the<00:01:27.170> third<00:01:27.410> takeaway<00:01:27.950> point<00:01:28.340> is

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
aside and the third takeaway point is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.089 
aside and the third takeaway point is
that<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:29.240> entire<00:01:29.450> system<00:01:30.229> is<00:01:30.440> going<00:01:30.619> to<00:01:30.890> blow

00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:31.099 
that this entire system is going to blow

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.219 
that this entire system is going to blow
up<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:32.179> reason<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.690> can<00:01:32.869> be<00:01:32.989> absolutely

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
up and the reason you can be absolutely

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.949 
up and the reason you can be absolutely
certain<00:01:34.069> that<00:01:34.459> it's<00:01:34.729> going<00:01:34.910> to<00:01:35.060> blow<00:01:35.270> up<00:01:35.479> is

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:35.959 
certain that it's going to blow up is

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:37.540 
certain that it's going to blow up is
because<00:01:36.170> there<00:01:36.619> is<00:01:36.709> no<00:01:36.920> room<00:01:37.130> for<00:01:37.369> any

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
because there is no room for any

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.389 
because there is no room for any
market-based<00:01:38.349> self-correcting<00:01:39.349> mechanism

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
market-based self-correcting mechanism

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.339 
market-based self-correcting mechanism
for<00:01:40.399> increasing<00:01:40.910> financial<00:01:41.119> leverage<00:01:41.720> for

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:42.349 
for increasing financial leverage for

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.469 
for increasing financial leverage for
increasing<00:01:42.920> debt<00:01:43.160> and<00:01:43.399> increasing<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.360> money

increasing debt and increasing the money

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.960 
increasing debt and increasing the money
support<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.770> sciences<00:01:46.340> which<00:01:46.610> is<00:01:46.759> where

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
support and the sciences which is where

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.150 
support and the sciences which is where
I<00:01:47.000> come<00:01:47.300> from<00:01:47.360> originally<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:48.319> self-correcting

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
I come from originally a self-correcting

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.309 
I come from originally a self-correcting
mechanism<00:01:49.520> is<00:01:50.239> what<00:01:50.450> scientists<00:01:51.020> call<00:01:51.080> a

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
mechanism is what scientists call a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.100 
mechanism is what scientists call a
negative<00:01:51.920> feedback<00:01:52.069> loop<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.819> any<00:01:53.450> scientist

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
negative feedback loop and any scientist

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.070 
negative feedback loop and any scientist
any<00:01:54.380> engineer<00:01:55.239> cross-culture<00:01:56.239> first<00:01:56.810> time

any engineer cross-culture first time

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.440 
any engineer cross-culture first time
one<00:01:57.500> hundred<00:01:57.830> percent<00:01:57.860> will<00:01:58.670> confirm<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.270> you

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
one hundred percent will confirm to you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.600 
one hundred percent will confirm to you
that<00:01:59.690> any<00:02:00.200> system<00:02:00.770> without<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:01.099> negative

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
that any system without a negative

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.089 
that any system without a negative
feedback<00:02:01.759> loop<00:02:02.060> blows<00:02:02.690> up<00:02:02.959> so<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:03.619> is<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.950> be

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
feedback loop blows up so it is to be

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.359 
feedback loop blows up so it is to be
