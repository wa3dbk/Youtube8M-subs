pooping all over the place so this way
it<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.619> makes<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.829> easier<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.960> I'll<00:01:37.409> sort<00:01:37.530> of

and the lead said that she wasn't

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:06.689 
and the lead said that she wasn't
allowed<00:07:05.590> to<00:07:05.650> sell<00:07:05.949> it<00:07:06.069> to<00:07:06.189> me<00:07:06.219> until<00:07:06.490> the<00:07:06.550> hair

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:06.699 
allowed to sell it to me until the hair

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:08.279 
allowed to sell it to me until the hair
started<00:07:07.000> growing<00:07:07.030> back<00:07:07.240> she<00:07:07.990> said<00:07:08.139> it<00:07:08.259> could

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:08.289 
started growing back she said it could

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:09.510 
started growing back she said it could
take<00:07:08.500> a<00:07:08.530> couple<00:07:08.770> weeks<00:07:08.889> because<00:07:09.280> it<00:07:09.400> was

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
take a couple weeks because it was

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.580 
take a couple weeks because it was
shedding<00:07:09.870> okay<00:07:10.870> well<00:07:11.110> that's<00:07:11.259> just<00:07:11.319> another

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
shedding okay well that's just another

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.629 
shedding okay well that's just another
reason<00:07:11.860> why<00:07:11.949> you<00:07:12.009> don't<00:07:12.190> get<00:07:12.370> at<00:07:12.490> pet<00:07:12.610> stores

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 
reason why you don't get at pet stores

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:14.550 
reason why you don't get at pet stores
because<00:07:13.060> obviously<00:07:13.210> rabbits<00:07:14.199> don't<00:07:14.409> usually

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 
because obviously rabbits don't usually

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.320 
because obviously rabbits don't usually
lose<00:07:15.069> all<00:07:15.310> their<00:07:15.430> fur<00:07:15.699> when<00:07:15.909> you're<00:07:16.030> shedding

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330 
lose all their fur when you're shedding

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.659 
lose all their fur when you're shedding
so<00:07:17.020> definitely<00:07:17.650> it<00:07:17.979> was<00:07:18.190> not<00:07:18.490> shedding<00:07:18.960> so<00:07:20.669> she

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:21.669 
so definitely it was not shedding so she

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:22.980 
so definitely it was not shedding so she
said<00:07:21.879> will<00:07:22.000> you<00:07:22.030> wait<00:07:22.300> to<00:07:22.419> fur<00:07:22.569> it's<00:07:22.719> fur<00:07:22.870> to

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
said will you wait to fur it's fur to

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.270 
said will you wait to fur it's fur to
grow<00:07:23.110> back<00:07:23.229> but<00:07:23.409> the<00:07:23.500> problem<00:07:23.800> is<00:07:23.919> it<00:07:24.250> has

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280 
grow back but the problem is it has

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.189 
grow back but the problem is it has
mites<00:07:24.639> its<00:07:25.360> fur<00:07:25.629> won't<00:07:25.870> grow<00:07:25.990> back

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 
mites its fur won't grow back

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:29.339 
mites its fur won't grow back
so<00:07:27.009> we're<00:07:27.550> doing<00:07:28.090> with<00:07:28.180> that<00:07:28.300> and<00:07:28.599> if<00:07:28.990> she<00:07:29.229> left

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:29.349 
so we're doing with that and if she left

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:31.760 
so we're doing with that and if she left
me<00:07:29.530> take<00:07:29.710> in<00:07:29.889> or<00:07:30.460> her<00:07:30.940> I<00:07:30.969> think<00:07:31.270> it's<00:07:31.360> her
