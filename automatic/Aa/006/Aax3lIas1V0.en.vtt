00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.080 
so now we got well this is all pretty
much<00:02:01.530> easy<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.399> that's<00:02:02.549> kind<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.850> hardest

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
much easy but that's kind of the hardest

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.370 
much easy but that's kind of the hardest
part<00:02:03.180> because<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> rest<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.810> all<00:02:03.960> signing<00:02:04.200> in

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380

part because the rest is all signing in
green<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.860> black<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:06.420> anyways<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:07.619> top<00:02:07.829> of

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
green and black but anyways on top of

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.139 
green and black but anyways on top of
that<00:02:08.039> one<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.220> want<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.550> black<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:08.970> and

that one you want on a black one and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.729 
that one you want on a black one and
then<00:02:10.020> more<00:02:10.890> cyan<00:02:11.099> over<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.520> black

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
then more cyan over to black

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.180 
then more cyan over to black
and<00:02:14.739> oh<00:02:15.580> just<00:02:16.420> kidding<00:02:16.569> this<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.620> scion<00:02:17.920> and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
and oh just kidding this is a scion and

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.220 
and oh just kidding this is a scion and
then<00:02:18.629> two<00:02:19.629> blacks<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.260> then<00:02:20.830> more<00:02:20.980> cyan<00:02:22.230> you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
then two blacks and then more cyan you

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.410 
then two blacks and then more cyan you
could<00:02:23.349> also<00:02:23.470> substitute<00:02:23.739> for<00:02:24.160> light<00:02:24.310> blue<00:02:24.550> if

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
could also substitute for light blue if

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.800 
could also substitute for light blue if
you're<00:02:25.920> building<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.040> in<00:02:27.400> regular<00:02:28.030> mode<00:02:28.239> in

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
you're building this in regular mode in

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.990 
you're building this in regular mode in
survival<00:02:29.470> substitute<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.489> for<00:02:30.670> light<00:02:30.790> blue

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
survival substitute that for light blue

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.330 
survival substitute that for light blue
and<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.300> work<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.780> well<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.980> once<00:02:33.220> you've

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
and it work just as well so once you've

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.000 
and it work just as well so once you've
got<00:02:33.580> that<00:02:33.760> done<00:02:34.030> put<00:02:34.599> one<00:02:34.780> on<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.709> side<00:02:35.860> of

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
got that done put one on the side of

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.130 
got that done put one on the side of
this<00:02:36.069> one<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.670> right<00:02:37.150> there<00:02:37.330> on<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.989> side

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
this one and right there on the side

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.509 
this one and right there on the side
