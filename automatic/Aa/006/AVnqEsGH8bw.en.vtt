00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.720
 In Karaganda, I found a shop on 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.179
 illegal sausage making 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.340
 products there were processed in 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.740
 unsanitary conditions and expertise 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.900
 showed the presence in the product of harmful 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.609
 bacteria and despite the fact that no 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.380
 certificates for the finished product 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.330
 there were no large producers 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.869
 Karaganda supermarkets were selling 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.490
 underground sausage a few more days 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.430
 back in the dubious building on the outskirts 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.320
 Karaganda boiling work 40 pounds 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.210
 sausage production per day team 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.700
 albeit a small but set plan 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.149
 five people performed the seller stands on 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.770
 the floor 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.920
 that does not meet the conditions of storage 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.440
 food where they bought meat for processing 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.550
 no one can answer 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.559
 microbiological examination showed 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.190
 the presence of bacteria in the sausage group 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.940
 E. coli shop is on the water 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.219
 dust and dirt everywhere 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.710
 cobweb since now on and underway 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.299
 work on filing a lawsuit against 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.330
 official to the basis of this 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.729
 sausage shop according to prosecutors 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.530
 even sanitary records and admission to work 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.200
 not everyone from Sanepid 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.600
 workers of the shop last admit that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.460
 that worked in terrible conditions understood 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.860
 but here are some superfluous questions 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.950
 tried not to ask these were all 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.439
 normal work is not people 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.240
 every family needed work and 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.439
 so people work we mean then 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.469

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.549

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.360

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.250
 employment contracts with workers not 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.740

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.840
 one more law and that's not all in 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.180

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.330
 although the staff of the shop assure that 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.530
 Muslim sausage is not done here 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.470
