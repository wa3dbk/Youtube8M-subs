you

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:20.060 

you

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.170 

I<00:00:21.020> sort<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.279> had<00:00:23.279> an<00:00:23.430> idea<00:00:23.490> what<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.910> might<00:00:24.029> be

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
I sort of had an idea what it might be

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.210 
I sort of had an idea what it might be
like<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.660> car<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.840> very<00:00:25.710> very<00:00:26.039> well

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
like but this car is very very well

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.179 
like but this car is very very well
behaved<00:00:26.400> very<00:00:27.029> well<00:00:27.840> balanced<00:00:28.740> puts<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
behaved very well balanced puts the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.280 
behaved very well balanced puts the
power<00:00:29.340> down<00:00:29.550> really<00:00:29.759> well<00:00:30.349> and<00:00:31.579> is<00:00:33.290> incredibly

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
power down really well and is incredibly

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.610 
power down really well and is incredibly
fast<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.890> it's<00:00:35.220> deceptively<00:00:35.850> fast<00:00:36.059> because

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
fast and it's deceptively fast because

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
fast and it's deceptively fast because
being<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.940> turbocharged<00:00:38.940> motor<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.420> don't

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
being a turbocharged motor you don't

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.799 
being a turbocharged motor you don't
have<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.110> sort<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.500> visceral<00:00:41.449> kind<00:00:42.449> of<00:00:42.510> sound

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
have that sort of visceral kind of sound

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.509 
have that sort of visceral kind of sound
and<00:00:42.960> experience<00:00:43.470> like<00:00:43.589> you<00:00:43.739> would<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.949> normally

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
and experience like you would a normally

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.869 
and experience like you would a normally
aspirated<00:00:44.550> car<00:00:45.089> like<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.449> gt3<00:00:45.900> RS<00:00:46.580> so<00:00:47.580> your

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
aspirated car like the gt3 RS so your

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.590 
aspirated car like the gt3 RS so your
sensation<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> speed<00:00:48.839> is<00:00:49.730> somewhat<00:00:50.730> reduced

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
sensation to speed is somewhat reduced

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.470 
sensation to speed is somewhat reduced
but<00:00:52.050> there's<00:00:52.710> no<00:00:52.890> doubt<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.309> very<00:00:53.879> fast<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
but there's no doubt it's very fast and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
but there's no doubt it's very fast and
very<00:00:55.320> easy<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.190> control<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:57.360> was<00:00:57.840> would<00:00:58.350> go

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
very easy to control and I was would go

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.840 
very easy to control and I was would go
as<00:00:58.680> far<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.890> say<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.370> most<00:00:59.430> well-behaved

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
as far to say it's the most well-behaved

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.660 
as far to say it's the most well-behaved
911<00:01:00.660> I've<00:01:00.750> ever<00:01:00.899> good<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.190> hard<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.430> tell

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
911 I've ever good so it's hard to tell

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.860 
911 I've ever good so it's hard to tell
it<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.210> even<00:01:03.420> though<00:01:03.539> those<00:01:03.629> cars

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it you know even though those cars

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.590 
it you know even though those cars
100-something<00:01:04.619> horsepower<00:01:05.070> more<00:01:05.399> it<00:01:06.180> doesn't

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
100-something horsepower more it doesn't

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.960 
100-something horsepower more it doesn't
I<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:07.200> feel<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.280> hundred

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
I don't feel like it's hundred

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.620 
I don't feel like it's hundred
horsepower<00:01:09.180> faster<00:01:11.210> but<00:01:12.210> again<00:01:12.330> without

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
horsepower faster but again without

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.510 
horsepower faster but again without
doing<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.020> back-to-back<00:01:13.200> test<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.280> really

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
doing it back-to-back test it's really

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.580 
doing it back-to-back test it's really
hard<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.880> hard<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.539> know

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.020 

is<00:01:21.590> one<00:01:22.040> of<00:01:22.070> my<00:01:22.220> all-time<00:01:22.370> favorite<00:01:22.940> because

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
is one of my all-time favorite because

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.840 
is one of my all-time favorite because
it<00:01:23.210> feels<00:01:23.720> like<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.530> race<00:01:25.100> car<00:01:25.130> drives<00:01:25.640> like<00:01:25.790> a

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
it feels like a race car drives like a

it feels like a race car drives like a
race<00:01:26.090> car<00:01:26.120> it<00:01:26.960> feels<00:01:27.230> quite<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.010> bit<00:01:28.190> lighter

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
race car it feels quite a bit lighter

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.030 
race car it feels quite a bit lighter
than<00:01:28.760> the<00:01:29.090> gt2<00:01:29.420> RS<00:01:29.600> especially<00:01:30.530> in<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.860> rear

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
than the gt2 RS especially in the rear

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.080 
than the gt2 RS especially in the rear
of<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.190> car<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.650> motor<00:01:33.920> is<00:01:34.160> just<00:01:34.520> motor

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
of the car and the motor is just motor

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
runner your sensation of speed is so

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.800 
runner your sensation of speed is so
much<00:02:09.759> less<00:02:10.209> than<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.509> gt3<00:02:11.110> RS<00:02:11.550> then<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.970> thought

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
much less than the gt3 RS then I thought

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.440 
much less than the gt3 RS then I thought
myself<00:02:14.020> first<00:02:14.950> left<00:02:15.250> completely<00:02:15.940> blow

myself first left completely blow

myself first left completely blow
through<00:02:16.780> my<00:02:16.989> dreaded<00:02:17.319> points<00:02:17.770> just<00:02:17.950> because<00:02:18.190> I

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
through my dreaded points just because I

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.820 
through my dreaded points just because I
didn't<00:02:19.660> think<00:02:19.720> as<00:02:19.900> well<00:02:20.080> as<00:02:20.200> best<00:02:20.349> as<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.620> was

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
didn't think as well as best as I was

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.490 
didn't think as well as best as I was
then<00:02:21.790> second<00:02:22.239> lap<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.569> little<00:02:22.780> cleaner<00:02:23.019> and

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
then second lap is a little cleaner and

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.479 
then second lap is a little cleaner and
got<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.860> together<00:02:25.709> definitely<00:02:26.709> quite<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.250> bit

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
got that together definitely quite a bit

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.070 
got that together definitely quite a bit
of<00:02:27.580> lack<00:02:28.200> relative<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.349> the<00:02:29.470> gt3<00:02:29.920> RS

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
of lack relative to the gt3 RS

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.420 
of lack relative to the gt3 RS
especially<00:02:32.080> if<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:32.590> were

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.649 

more<00:02:38.430> time<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.760> be<00:02:38.849> now<00:02:39.000> by<00:02:39.209> rolling<00:02:39.510> into

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
more time to be now by rolling into

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.580 
more time to be now by rolling into
power<00:02:39.900> earlier<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:41.129> more<00:02:41.159> aggressively

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.509 

I'm<00:02:45.950> really<00:02:46.519> control<00:02:46.940> off<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.420> gt3<00:02:47.900> RS<00:02:48.200> and

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
I'm really control off the gt3 RS and

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.110 
I'm really control off the gt3 RS and
Jackson<00:02:49.519> troll<00:02:49.730> on<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.489> was<00:02:52.610> much<00:02:52.849> less

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
Jackson troll on and it was much less

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.530 
Jackson troll on and it was much less
invasive<00:02:53.840> in<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.290> gt3<00:02:54.769> RS<00:02:55.099> but<00:02:55.400> also<00:02:56.300> not

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
invasive in the gt3 RS but also not

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.040 
invasive in the gt3 RS but also not
surprising<00:02:57.080> considering<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.860> gt3<00:02:58.310> RS<00:02:59.050> has

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
surprising considering the gt3 RS has

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.670 
surprising considering the gt3 RS has
quite<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.470> bit<00:03:00.620> less<00:03:00.769> power<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:02.150> gt2<00:03:02.480> RS

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
quite a bit less power and the gt2 RS

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.570 
quite a bit less power and the gt2 RS
mid-corner<00:03:03.680> if<00:03:03.920> you<00:03:04.040> were<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.190> little<00:03:04.340> too

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
mid-corner if you were a little too

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.770 
mid-corner if you were a little too
greedy<00:03:04.849> with<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.120> power<00:03:05.299> you<00:03:05.660> could

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
greedy with the power you could

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.170 
greedy with the power you could
definitely<00:03:06.049> get<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.349> thing<00:03:06.610> sliding<00:03:07.610> whereas

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
definitely get the thing sliding whereas

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.980 
definitely get the thing sliding whereas
the<00:03:08.269> gt3<00:03:08.840> RS<00:03:09.310> not<00:03:10.310> unless<00:03:10.459> you<00:03:10.640> really

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990

corkscrew was the only place I felt that

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.400 
corkscrew was the only place I felt that
it<00:03:20.970> was<00:03:24.140> progress<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:26.940> last<00:03:27.390> lap<00:03:27.720> was<00:03:28.050> the
