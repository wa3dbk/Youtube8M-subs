on<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.549> hand<00:01:53.850> I'm<00:01:54.060> very<00:01:54.299> excited<00:01:54.750> about<00:01:54.899> being

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
on one hand I'm very excited about being

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.990 
on one hand I'm very excited about being
able<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.590> use<00:01:56.009> these<00:01:56.189> cards<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:56.969> been

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
able to use these cards that have been

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.580 
able to use these cards that have been
sitting<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.450> my<00:01:57.509> binders<00:01:57.990> collecting<00:01:58.380> dust

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
sitting in my binders collecting dust

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.160 
sitting in my binders collecting dust
for<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.460> long<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> other<00:02:00.659> hand<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
for so long but on the other hand the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.230 
for so long but on the other hand the
reason<00:02:01.469> why<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:01.890> might<00:02:02.159> really<00:02:02.520> want<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.939> use

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
reason why one might really want to use

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.660 
reason why one might really want to use
that<00:02:03.270> card<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.140> because<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.250> original

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
that card is because of the original

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.700 
that card is because of the original
effect<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.090> had<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.780> bringing<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.200> back<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:07.680> a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
effect it had so bringing it back with a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.919 
effect it had so bringing it back with a
much<00:02:07.979> different<00:02:08.550> effect<00:02:08.850> is<00:02:09.180> really<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.720> not

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
much different effect is really like not

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.990 
much different effect is really like not
getting<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.320> card<00:02:10.560> back<00:02:10.800> at<00:02:11.160> all<00:02:11.460> you're

cards would ever come off the list I

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.289 
cards would ever come off the list I
would<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:25.590> had<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.890> say<00:03:26.069> no<00:03:26.190> are<00:03:26.549> you<00:03:26.670> crazy

they<00:03:27.540> would<00:03:27.690> kill<00:03:28.349> whatever<00:03:28.650> meta<00:03:29.159> or<00:03:29.370> format

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
they would kill whatever meta or format

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.339 
they would kill whatever meta or format
that<00:03:29.909> they're<00:03:30.120> in<00:03:30.359> but<00:03:30.630> somehow<00:03:30.870> with<00:03:31.019> those

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
that they're in but somehow with those

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.379

cards<00:03:31.739> still<00:03:31.950> at<00:03:32.160> our<00:03:32.280> disposal<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:33.000> game

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389

seems<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.780> have<00:03:33.930> gone<00:03:34.079> on<00:03:34.260> just<00:03:35.010> fine<00:03:35.310> so

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
seems to have gone on just fine so

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.729 
seems to have gone on just fine so
eventually<00:03:36.180> all<00:03:36.419> the<00:03:36.870> cards<00:03:37.230> should<00:03:37.620> be

eventually all the cards should be

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.229 
eventually all the cards should be
returned<00:03:38.040> back<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.430> us<00:03:38.549> because<00:03:38.730> of<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.060> power

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239
