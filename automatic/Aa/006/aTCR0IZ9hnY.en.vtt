00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
maybe it's not the power and that's the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.609

but it's an example of what I want to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.020 
but it's an example of what I want to
talk<00:01:16.409> about<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.040> video<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.700> diesel

engine<00:01:18.509> swaps<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.290> that's<00:01:19.830> what<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.430> do

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
engine swaps and that's what can we do

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.060 
engine swaps and that's what can we do
to<00:01:21.570> improve<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:23.330> venerable<00:01:24.330> 123<00:01:25.290> 240<00:01:25.740> D<00:01:25.890> I

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
to improve the venerable 123 240 D I

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.740 
to improve the venerable 123 240 D I
have<00:01:26.520> owned<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:28.310> European<00:01:29.310> 300d<00:01:30.240> four-speed

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
have owned a European 300d four-speed

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.899 
have owned a European 300d four-speed
and<00:01:31.549> that<00:01:32.549> was<00:01:32.820> really<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.600> nice<00:01:33.900> car<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.439> mean

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
and that was really a nice car I mean

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.149 
and that was really a nice car I mean
having<00:01:35.909> everything<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> 240<00:01:37.439> D<00:01:37.619> had<00:01:37.860> but

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
having everything that the 240 D had but

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.480 
having everything that the 240 D had but
having<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.720> extra<00:01:39.720> cylinder<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.950> extra

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
having that extra cylinder that extra

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.880 
having that extra cylinder that extra
horsepower<00:01:42.049> really<00:01:43.049> made<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> difference<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
horsepower really made a difference and

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.850 
horsepower really made a difference and
over<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> years<00:01:44.520> I've<00:01:44.790> converted<00:01:45.299> about

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
over the years I've converted about

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.600 
over the years I've converted about
three<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.159> four<00:01:47.399> T<00:01:47.579> DS<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> 5<00:01:49.140> cylinder<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.890> non

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
three to four T DS to a 5 cylinder a non

three to four T DS to a 5 cylinder a non
turbo<00:01:50.939> engine<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.630> that's<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.079> subject<00:01:52.530> of

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
turbo engine so that's the subject of

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.560 
turbo engine so that's the subject of
this<00:01:52.799> video<00:01:53.159> we're<00:01:53.939> going<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.420> all

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
this video we're going to get you all

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.120 
this video we're going to get you all
involved<00:01:54.899> who've<00:01:55.290> done<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.680> conversion

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
involved who've done this conversion

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.160 
involved who've done this conversion
you're<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> let<00:01:56.850> us<00:01:57.000> hear<00:01:57.360> from<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
you're going to let us hear from you and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.679 
you're going to let us hear from you and
some<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.070> challenge<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.820> results<00:02:00.540> you've

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
some of the challenge and results you've

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.080 
some of the challenge and results you've
had<00:02:00.930> when<00:02:01.170> you've<00:02:01.320> attempted<00:02:01.680> such<00:02:02.130> an<00:02:02.369> engine

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
had when you've attempted such an engine

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.840 
had when you've attempted such an engine
swap<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.290> goal<00:02:04.829> here<00:02:04.860> would<00:02:05.280> be<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.490> take

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
swap so the goal here would be to take

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.020 
swap so the goal here would be to take
this<00:02:06.290> take<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.320> five<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.640> engine

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
this take this five so this this engine

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.630 
this take this five so this this engine
here<00:02:09.239> has<00:02:09.450> about<00:02:09.890> 90,000<00:02:10.890> miles<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.550> a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
here has about 90,000 miles on it's a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.520 
here has about 90,000 miles on it's a
beautiful<00:02:12.180> running<00:02:12.750> fie

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
beautiful running fie

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.920 
beautiful running fie
so<00:02:13.709> learn<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.040> turbo<00:02:14.520> engine<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.660> we're<00:02:15.810> going

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
so learn on turbo engine and we're going

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.300 
so learn on turbo engine and we're going
to<00:02:15.990> put<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.290> over<00:02:16.380> here<00:02:16.709> in<00:02:16.880> this<00:02:17.880> 240<00:02:19.310> d82

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
to put it over here in this 240 d82

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.850 
to put it over here in this 240 d82
model<00:02:20.900> okay<00:02:21.900> what<00:02:22.110> kind<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.350> problems<00:02:22.740> we're

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
model okay what kind of problems we're

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.160 
model okay what kind of problems we're
going<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.040> run<00:02:23.220> into<00:02:23.340> here<00:02:23.670> folks<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.240> this

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
going to run into here folks is this

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.730 
going to run into here folks is this
just<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.590> straight<00:02:26.130> drop<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:27.350> what<00:02:28.350> if<00:02:28.470> we<00:02:28.620> were

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
just a straight drop in what if we were

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.780 
just a straight drop in what if we were
to<00:02:28.890> put<00:02:29.100> this<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.780> 1977<00:02:30.780> 240<00:02:31.470> d<00:02:31.620> any<00:02:31.950> other

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
to put this in a 1977 240 d any other

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.430 
to put this in a 1977 240 d any other
issues<00:02:33.630> there<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:35.190> know<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.810> this<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:37.260> is

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
issues there you know so this this is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.220 
issues there you know so this this is
apparently<00:02:38.130> pretty<00:02:38.430> easy<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:39.480> there's<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.900> big

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
apparently pretty easy but there's a big

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.770 
apparently pretty easy but there's a big
butt<00:02:40.560> here<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.550> let's<00:02:41.790> take<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> closer<00:02:42.360> look<00:02:42.510> at

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
butt here so let's take a closer look at

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.920 
butt here so let's take a closer look at
these<00:02:42.959> two<00:02:43.230> engines<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.920> I'll<00:02:44.730> discuss<00:02:45.239> you

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
these two engines and I'll discuss you

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.979 
these two engines and I'll discuss you
know<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:47.400> possibility<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.630> may<00:02:48.780> run

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
know the possibility that you may run

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.630 
know the possibility that you may run
into<00:02:49.170> some<00:02:49.290> issues<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.010> want<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.340> hear<00:02:50.489> from

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
into some issues and I want to hear from

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.880 
into some issues and I want to hear from
you<00:02:50.970> particularly<00:02:51.570> those<00:02:51.780> who<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.709> who

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
you particularly those who of you who

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.940 
you particularly those who of you who
have<00:02:52.980> done<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.370> conversion<00:02:53.760> yourself<00:02:54.950> once

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
have done this conversion yourself once

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.860 
have done this conversion yourself once
again<00:02:56.220> let's<00:02:56.430> take<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.610> real<00:02:57.030> close<00:02:57.360> look<00:02:57.540> at

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
again let's take a real close look at

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.130 
again let's take a real close look at
this<00:02:58.019> 300<00:02:58.530> D<00:02:58.620> non<00:02:58.860> turbo<00:02:59.160> engine<00:03:00.140> thinking

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
this 300 D non turbo engine thinking

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.240 
this 300 D non turbo engine thinking
about<00:03:01.410> possibly<00:03:02.010> putting<00:03:02.459> this<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.150> 240<00:03:03.810> D

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
about possibly putting this in a 240 D

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.120 
about possibly putting this in a 240 D
and<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.340> want<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.910> think<00:03:06.120> about<00:03:06.300> what<00:03:07.130> you

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
and I want you to think about what you

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.160 
and I want you to think about what you
may<00:03:08.340> need<00:03:08.640> other<00:03:09.030> than<00:03:09.209> just<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.810> engine

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
may need other than just the engine

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.410 
may need other than just the engine
would<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.860> be<00:03:10.980> okay<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.370> just<00:03:11.819> go<00:03:12.000> out<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.390> a

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
would it be okay to just go out to a

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.520 
would it be okay to just go out to a
wrecking<00:03:12.840> yard<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.350> just<00:03:13.530> pick<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:15.350> 300<00:03:16.350> D

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
wrecking yard and just pick up a a 300 D

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.440 
wrecking yard and just pick up a a 300 D
non<00:03:16.890> turbo<00:03:17.160> engine<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:17.730> bring<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.120> home<00:03:18.269> and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
non turbo engine and bring it home and

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.590 
non turbo engine and bring it home and
put<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.720> in<00:03:18.810> your<00:03:18.900> 240<00:03:19.440> d<00:03:20.120> let's<00:03:21.120> hear<00:03:21.390> from

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
put it in your 240 d let's hear from

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.890 
put it in your 240 d let's hear from
those<00:03:22.140> of<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.530> who<00:03:22.680> have<00:03:22.769> tried<00:03:23.010> this<00:03:23.310> okay

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
those of you who have tried this okay

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.750 
those of you who have tried this okay
you<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.200> see<00:03:25.470> here<00:03:25.709> from<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.220> air<00:03:26.370> cleaner

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
you can see here from the air cleaner

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.560 
you can see here from the air cleaner
housing<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.660> these<00:03:27.900> engines<00:03:28.380> look<00:03:29.570> real

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
housing that these engines look real

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.990 
housing that these engines look real
similar<00:03:31.110> but<00:03:31.769> that's<00:03:32.340> about<00:03:32.610> where<00:03:32.850> the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
similar but that's about where the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.340 
similar but that's about where the
similarity<00:03:33.840> ends

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
similarity ends

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.560 
similarity ends
in<00:03:34.530> my<00:03:35.430> experience<00:03:36.090> I've<00:03:36.390> run<00:03:36.750> across<00:03:37.220> three<00:03:38.220> I

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
in my experience I've run across three I

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.050 
in my experience I've run across three I
wouldn't<00:03:39.570> call<00:03:39.810> them<00:03:40.079> major<00:03:40.530> issues<00:03:41.160> but<00:03:41.519> big

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
wouldn't call them major issues but big

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.479 
wouldn't call them major issues but big
issues<00:03:42.650> when<00:03:43.650> you're<00:03:43.920> thinking<00:03:44.250> about

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
issues when you're thinking about

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.810 
issues when you're thinking about
putting<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.150> five<00:03:45.420> cylinder<00:03:46.109> in<00:03:46.350> a<00:03:46.650> 240<00:03:47.370> D<00:03:47.549> like

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
putting a five cylinder in a 240 D like

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.690 
putting a five cylinder in a 240 D like
this<00:03:48.030> one<00:03:48.239> here<00:03:48.450> there<00:03:48.630> are<00:03:48.720> three<00:03:49.320> big<00:03:50.070> issues

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
this one here there are three big issues

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.390 
this one here there are three big issues
when<00:03:51.540> you're<00:03:51.660> jumping<00:03:52.200> from<00:03:52.230> one<00:03:53.010> particular

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
when you're jumping from one particular
