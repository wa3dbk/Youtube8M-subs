 to him and your name of your region is mine 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:44.459
 here is a region called for example radio 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.990
 it seems like the region is saved as a region 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.600
 Now I will start this region and I will not 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.030
 touch if you want to zaprivat 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.030

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.830
 dad block and you can just do here 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.369

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.369
 show you to eat 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.740
 So 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.630
 Here, for example, you need to lock in 30 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:26.410

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:35.690
 expand 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:41.950
 30 until you see the region expand 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:45.130
 it's 15 thousand blocks down it's good a 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.630

00:02:47.630 --> 00:03:01.060
