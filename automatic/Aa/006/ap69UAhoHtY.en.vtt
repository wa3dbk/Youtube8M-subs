going to show some of our spiral
stackers<00:01:24.580> and<00:01:24.880> these<00:01:25.330> are<00:01:25.510> brand<00:01:25.810> new<00:01:25.930> for

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
stackers and these are brand new for

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.590 
stackers and these are brand new for
2015<00:01:26.590> this<00:01:26.979> is<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.159> 10-inch<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:27.940> this<00:01:28.420> is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
2015 this is the 10-inch and this is

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.180 
2015 this is the 10-inch and this is
mounted<00:01:29.020> on<00:01:29.140> one<00:01:29.320> of<00:01:29.470> our<00:01:29.560> new<00:01:29.740> 10-inch

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
mounted on one of our new 10-inch

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.020 
mounted on one of our new 10-inch
Orientals<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.720> sounds<00:01:31.990> like<00:01:32.110> this

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.450 

so<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.120> has<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> very<00:01:36.630> short<00:01:36.990> gated<00:01:37.830> sound<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so it has a very short gated sound and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.800 
so it has a very short gated sound and
you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.450> some<00:01:39.660> different

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
you can see you can get some different

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.190 
you can see you can get some different
visual<00:01:40.320> effects<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:40.860> well<00:01:41.010> when<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> play<00:01:41.940> it

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
visual effects as well when you play it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.750 
visual effects as well when you play it
next<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.410> that<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.830> have<00:01:43.950> another<00:01:44.190> ten<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
next to that we have another ten and

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.630 
next to that we have another ten and
that's<00:01:45.060> mounted<00:01:45.510> on<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:46.170> 10<00:01:46.620> inch<00:01:46.800> trash<00:01:47.220> former

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that's mounted on a 10 inch trash former

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.790 
that's mounted on a 10 inch trash former
and<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.150> gives<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.480> really<00:01:48.840> cool<00:01:48.870> visual

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
and this gives a really cool visual

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.680 
and this gives a really cool visual
effect<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.730> like<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.060> gave<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
effect just like this so that gave a

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.480 
effect just like this so that gave a
little<00:01:58.140> bit<00:01:58.260> more<00:01:58.470> sustain<00:01:58.890> where<00:01:59.190> this<00:01:59.310> one

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
little bit more sustain where this one

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.800 
little bit more sustain where this one
was<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> little<00:01:59.910> shorter<00:02:02.300> so<00:02:03.300> as<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.510> can<00:02:03.630> see

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
was a little shorter so as you can see

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.600 
was a little shorter so as you can see
these<00:02:03.960> spiral<00:02:04.440> stackers<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:04.980> very<00:02:05.160> versatile

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
these spiral stackers are very versatile

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.320 
these spiral stackers are very versatile
and<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:05.880> use<00:02:06.090> them<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.300> different

situations<00:02:07.340> moving<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.580> right<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:08.940> 10

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
situations moving to the right of the 10

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.449 
situations moving to the right of the 10
we<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.990> 14<00:02:10.470> inch<00:02:10.500> trash<00:02:10.860> formal<00:02:11.280> with<00:02:11.370> the

12 inch spiral stacker on top of it and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:22.070 
12 inch spiral stacker on top of it and
that<00:02:13.950> sounds<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.490> this<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:20.750> again<00:02:21.750> we've

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
that sounds like this and again we've

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.530 
that sounds like this and again we've
mounted<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.980> 12<00:02:23.220> inch<00:02:23.400> spiral<00:02:23.700> stacker<00:02:24.150> on<00:02:24.480> a
