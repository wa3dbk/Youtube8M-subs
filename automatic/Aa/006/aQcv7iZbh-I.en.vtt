oh and he's flip that one over to talk
to<00:01:09.580> again<00:01:09.909> a<00:01:09.970> lakeside<00:01:10.270> boundary<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:12.159> short

one up

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.270

doesn't<00:01:14.200> matter<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.440> Ricky<00:01:14.950> Ponting<00:01:17.280> there's

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
doesn't matter to Ricky Ponting there's

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.639 
doesn't matter to Ricky Ponting there's
the<00:01:18.549> attempted<00:01:19.119> quicker<00:01:19.390> one<00:01:19.659> and<00:01:19.960> punting

one miss Ellen at 40 short for his

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.670 
one miss Ellen at 40 short for his
gamble

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
gamble

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.770 
gamble
I<00:01:26.710> think<00:01:27.520> he's<00:01:27.640> picked<00:01:27.940> that<00:01:28.119> slower<00:01:28.479> ball

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
I think he's picked that slower ball

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.170 
I think he's picked that slower ball
from<00:01:29.170> Jacques<00:01:29.470> Kallis<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.130> he's<00:01:30.670> gone<00:01:30.909> after

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
from Jacques Kallis and he's gone after

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.200 
from Jacques Kallis and he's gone after
the<00:01:31.539> short<00:01:31.810> boundary<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.560> that's<00:01:33.220> 20<00:01:33.970> rows

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
the short boundary and that's 20 rows

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.990 
the short boundary and that's 20 rows
back<00:01:37.380> that's<00:01:38.380> where<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:38.710> can't<00:01:38.979> go<00:01:39.190> that's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
back that's where you can't go that's

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.770 
back that's where you can't go that's
three<00:01:40.360> of<00:01:40.390> them<00:01:41.310> all<00:01:42.310> in<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.640> same<00:01:42.670> area<00:01:43.270> all

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
three of them all in the same area all

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.540 
three of them all in the same area all
to<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.319> same<00:01:44.560> type<00:01:44.830> of<00:01:44.860> delivery

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.249 

that's<00:01:51.550> much<00:01:51.819> better

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
that's much better

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.779 
that's much better
this<00:01:53.259> is<00:01:53.409> a<00:01:53.440> bit<00:01:53.649> more<00:01:53.830> luck<00:01:54.039> involved<00:01:54.429> in<00:01:54.700> this

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
this is a bit more luck involved in this

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.520 
this is a bit more luck involved in this
one<00:01:55.030> he<00:01:55.149> spliced<00:01:55.539> it<00:01:55.720> either<00:01:55.840> but<00:01:56.200> it's<00:01:56.350> still

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
one he spliced it either but it's still

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.520 
one he spliced it either but it's still
gone<00:01:56.740> for<00:01:56.950> forward<00:01:57.310> such<00:01:57.549> a<00:01:57.580> short<00:01:57.940> boundary

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
gone for forward such a short boundary

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.050 
gone for forward such a short boundary
that's<00:01:59.530> unlucky<00:02:00.039> for<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.250> ball<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:03.729> one

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
that's unlucky for the ball that one

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.960 
that's unlucky for the ball that one
he's<00:02:04.330> hit<00:02:04.569> in<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.930> air
