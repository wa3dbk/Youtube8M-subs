00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 This is Robson who speaks 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.379
 Welcome to the first video. 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.300
 channel gameplay and this video will be 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.530
 a challenge for the 10 o'clock group and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.719
 I 'll explain to you. 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.980
 after that vella beauty sticker is the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.750
 next, the challenge is more or less like this. 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.590
 each of the participants in this challenge 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.230
 have to make the highest possible score 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.949
 in five minutes of video can not be 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.230
 more can not be less then it is in the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.750
 moment I'm going to start from 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.270
 From here will roll a clock on the screen. 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.750
 counting the time and we'll see who goes 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.660
 get the best tip and let's go 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.260
 see who 's cock then we'll go there as soon as 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.090
 I stay here it will start 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:57.660
 Hi, next to the start of my record. 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.960
 Jack, we'll see who I want there 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 winning will do more 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.990
 if you can, it's because it's too bad to stay 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.830
 so much to stress now 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.260
 there breno 7 my best was 15 then the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.480
 person I'm going to challenge I'm going to talk 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.370
 at the end of this video and she has to do 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.720
 more than 15 or so of the score I 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:27.300
 I'm going to make a video 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:30.510
 Come on, it 's not too bad, it's too bad. 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.430
 do not know if he's going to hit up 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.140
 the whole problem is knocking on the top 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:45.590
 in the barrel of me and difficult to happen 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:49.830
 you have to concentrate a lot and almost 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:54.650
 josÃ© ramos - two less is good for 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.910
 eat with something to start the video like this 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.400
 let's see let's go 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.290
 The problem is that Amanda is very 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.290
 initial victory then probably she 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.880
 going to win is easy but let's see let's go 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:13.110
 see and hope he got into buying 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.840
 nice to hang out, I could talk 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.430
 because the track has 1 are here because the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:25.599
 iron extraction 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:28.689
 is a type now to a I will let 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.250
 lincon will leave the link for this game here 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:33.609
 in the description for you to play everything 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:39.969
 understand that the cellular network version 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:42.790
 hi was take in hadah from the application 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:46.689
 so you have to play on the computer 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.900
 I leave here a punishment, I do not think 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:57.669
 I'm going to tell us we've been very 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:03:02.280
 very very good the staff that went the 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:06.299
 password is very much addicted to this fiba 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.299
 You can not do this. 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:21.040
 Come on, it 's okay, this is it . 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:32.650
 start to get a plan bet a lot 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:34.120
 you lose a lot of principal is that 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.760
 I spoke of one will have to get well 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.979
 softly 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:51.340
 When you get so much at work, too. 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:54.299
 so I think I will not be able to 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.299
 up to 30 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:31.790
 until next day 21 in anger is very 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.010
 Bad I'm going to make the one I fit 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.190
 make a contraction greater than mine 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.530
 send me there twitter on a locked wheel 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.450
 in our link with the malaise in my 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.550
 twitter and send me there I want to see if 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.419
 you are good too 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.040
 as much as I think there should be some 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.520
 five minutes of recording 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.020
 I'll try to pass a few more times. 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:01.540
 seems like an attempt made more 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.540
 What song is very good to get 10,000 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:20.220
 there is a manifesto requiring much less than 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.520
 a good area is as difficult as the 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.520
 game 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:49.730
 beauty is going to try and deserve it here already 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.730
 should take 25 minutes then the concentration 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:02.910
 othon well guys I tried it out I 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:06.060
 I remember the biggest was 15 of that play then 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.640
 the person I'm going to challenge here 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.320
 chain will be human sport 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.030
 his channel will be here too 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.910
 under the inscription everything is already here 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.520
