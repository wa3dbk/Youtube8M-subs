note block is going to be 21 oh yeah and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.609 
note block is going to be 21 oh yeah and
as<00:01:05.479> you<00:01:05.570> can<00:01:05.659> see<00:01:05.719> a<00:01:05.780> number<00:01:05.929> popped<00:01:06.289> up<00:01:06.439> on<00:01:06.590> the

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
as you can see a number popped up on the

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.260 
as you can see a number popped up on the
left<00:01:06.829> hand<00:01:07.070> side<00:01:07.219> of<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.369> screen<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:08.000> reason

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
left hand side of the screen the reason

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.969 
left hand side of the screen the reason
why<00:01:08.390> I<00:01:08.420> do<00:01:08.630> this<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:09.380> could<00:01:09.560> pause<00:01:09.770> the

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
why I do this is so you could pause the

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.370 
why I do this is so you could pause the
video<00:01:10.219> and<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:11.000> know<00:01:11.119> click<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.630> no<00:01:11.810> block<00:01:12.079> as

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
video and you know click the no block as

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.230 
video and you know click the no block as
many<00:01:12.590> times<00:01:12.829> as<00:01:13.009> it<00:01:13.130> says<00:01:13.369> on<00:01:13.579> the<00:01:13.700> side<00:01:13.969> and

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
many times as it says on the side and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.789 
many times as it says on the side and
then<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:14.899> know<00:01:14.990> you<00:01:15.109> could<00:01:15.229> start<00:01:15.409> it<00:01:15.530> up<00:01:15.619> and

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
then you know you could start it up and

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.649 
then you know you could start it up and
all<00:01:15.890> that<00:01:15.920> good<00:01:16.070> stuff<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.979> two<00:01:18.979> ticks<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:19.659> you

I've been doing this a lot lately I
don't<00:01:23.390> want<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.780> but<00:01:24.079> a<00:01:24.109> lot<00:01:24.350> of<00:01:24.380> people<00:01:24.530> don't

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
don't want to but a lot of people don't

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.139 
don't want to but a lot of people don't
know<00:01:24.859> how<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:24.979> repeaters<00:01:25.369> work<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:25.939> when<00:01:26.060> you

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
know how to repeaters work so when you

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.130 
know how to repeaters work so when you
place<00:01:26.390> down<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.600> repeater

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
place down a repeater

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.830 
place down a repeater
that's<00:01:27.469> one<00:01:27.770> tick<00:01:28.039> without<00:01:28.490> touching<00:01:28.939> it<00:01:29.210> then

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
that's one tick without touching it then

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.230 
that's one tick without touching it then
when<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:30.109> click<00:01:30.319> it<00:01:30.499> that's<00:01:30.679> two<00:01:30.979> ticks<00:01:31.280> click

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
when you click it that's two ticks click

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.679 
when you click it that's two ticks click
it<00:01:32.359> again

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
it again

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.080 
it again
three<00:01:32.960> ticks<00:01:33.229> click<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.100> again<00:01:34.310> for<00:01:34.759> ticks

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
three ticks click it again for ticks

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.550 
three ticks click it again for ticks
that's<00:01:35.329> how<00:01:35.479> repeaters<00:01:35.960> work<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.350> then<00:01:36.439> when
