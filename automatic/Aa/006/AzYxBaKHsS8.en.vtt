00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.610
 we did not take another bmw karma to 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.340
 stain and then we go to a flat world 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.500
 to see it better, it's worth it and I'm going to 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.210
 this in a flat world you see and post here 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.539
 is the car look that real 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.850
 let's see it a little better web so look 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.660
 has carefully many details Yes 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.239
 look carefully these protrude yes yes 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.489
 I can get really good here you see 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.150
 You see, it stands out and that's why 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.400
 excels 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.980
 more is very well done has many 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.750
 details 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.460
 and I liked it very well 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.800
 own myths or are you Carlos the first 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.800
 version of all the first and well there 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.470
 two versions higher than this one is worth 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.180
 pos in the next versions we can not 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.430
 change the color putting us who have 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.870
 a right click is worth not in my case and 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.180
 Well, inside the car we can 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.820
 change the graph by pressing letter c 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.010
 we enter the car we press open opens see 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.690
 mail in my case I can but nothing 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.229
 more in my case because you can only drive 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.250
 it's worth it and it 's beige white and then 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.250
 snow looks pretty good 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.270
 highlights a little more well then the first 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.180
 What I have to do is press is 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.950
 options and controls here we have to 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.640
 change the controls to be able to 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.430
 drive it 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.430
 in my case opposite down left aritz that 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.740
 It's the little arrows of old games like 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.509
 the text those are not like flechitas 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.140
 from top to bottom, right to left 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.429
 here they are worth and therefore we here 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.560
 we can and nothing else 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.679
 in my case I have it and put it 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.890
 then right click and we control it 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:56.530
 really bad I do not know if it looks 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.510
 but then it moves and you see it going 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.950
 to see him in person 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.950
 so is 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.660
 do not put yourself that way but exactly the 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.660
 wheel move 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.610
 not here 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.590
 and if we move 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.900
 spin is very well done has 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.439
 delighted this way and then we have other 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.439
 you see 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:35.960

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:39.170
 we can all get to run 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.770

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:48.520
 time to load the world 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:51.210

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.170

 like the one you want even creative of 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.200
 that I think we're where you have to 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:55.560
 art or vale 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.560
 but it's a bit 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.800
 we open the inventory 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:07.409
 here is the compass and here 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:11.219

 we 'll post it clean michaels like that 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:19.349
 that the options are at null 61 and then 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:21.520
 accelerant for dante let's try 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:23.910
 only the vale 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.400
 to accelerate 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.520
 here is car and vice operated 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.520
 correctly 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.469
 I am 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:35.599
 I'm very well done I love there 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:38.959
 Well, if we can, this car has given a 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:41.839
 river or a sea has not given us any 

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:43.969
 water we will see that that water disappears 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:46.429
 the texture of the water is worth it 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:48.529
 it disappears, and in case we do not 

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:50.449
 we separate so the view works 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:53.239
 correctly if we look at the car a 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:59.360
 little water will be as transparent 

00:06:53.239 --> 00:07:01.099
 ok we enter we accelerate to see if not 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.389
 could the time and that I have not put 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:05.240

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:13.760
 go out 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:16.070
 you see here is the water book 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.170
 and then nothing else I hope that I have 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.970
 liked it a lot 6 like problems three 

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.800
 times and position we are in our 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.310
 Serial or other series ingredients 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.310
