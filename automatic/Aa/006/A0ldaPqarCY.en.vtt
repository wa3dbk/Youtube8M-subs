00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.280
 hello everyone here maxence rigaud tier 2 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.680
 log boursier.com so today I 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.230
 am with the podiatrist damian pages to 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.270
 hand in paris so if I did not know 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.660
 not daniel benjamin he is a specialist 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.580
 orthoses he is degrees in chiropody 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.920
 you have the university degree a little bit of 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.370
 Logic applied to sports certificate 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.410
 European medical podiatry so 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.480
 in a few moments we will see who 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.080
 appreciate a foot value this is a 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.420
 crowd and advocate actress I will leave 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.989
 in a few words to present next 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.310
 explain to us the case of this patient that 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.330
 there we will see in the video 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:16.659
 ah yeah i'm daniel base honor 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:19.240
 so a lot of sport also get 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.890
 a master of human mechanics all this 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.790
 who analyzes the walking movement 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.470
 romp all that they will be 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.840
 sent on a doctoral thesis 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.270
 in the same medium and so 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.530
 actually was contributing I'm doing that 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.140
 sportel entries of this optic nerve 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.300
 represent the diversity of my 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.230
 professional activity and so the turn 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.270
 a lot of athletes 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:46.060
 he said having a classic patient 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.590
 consultation of the very classic death 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.290
 diabolical hurry to have who has 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.970
 a bus Length everything we call 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.970
 the pronator warmth 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.190
 sporty so doing the bus drop is 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.550
 really what is it then the foundation 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.960
 hinny 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.880
 it's really the foot that shakes 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.440
 inside there because it stays like 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.280
 for example without promoting 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.200
 of my hand so the foot lying 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.390
 banugbis like that it's really a foot 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.950
 pronator so the foot on bottom of 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.080
 setbacks too excessively 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.180
 and too important when you run but 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.490
 so when you have to be careful 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.250
 everyone expects everything 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.380
 world but when you elect a little bit 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.150
 all that blocks running etc. 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.100
 there is a lot of nonsense in it and are 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.630
 everything is a poison a general feeling 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.690
 that the populations associated the group 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.590
 rotation to something bad 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.240
 whereas when you walk when you 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.680
 course you have to do approval 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.030
 you can not move forward what does not 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.520
 from pros nation we are now waiting 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.660
 it's instinctive natural face and foot 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.760
 is made for that to when the dock is 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.620
 did to make their launch 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.490
 Abbas, however, need to know it's going 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.990
 to be complicated is what you can 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.709
 comment because you are that in the 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.790
 secret not bad so normal what's 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.470
 pass and more it takes not the most in 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.030
 to leave and when we speak of a foot towards 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.660
 god suddenly hyper pronator foot so 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.940
 five teams too much progression is 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.760
 So what happens tonight is that 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.650
 this gentleman mail his foot collapses he 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.420
 is crazy the news preaches hatrize and 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.239
 so they shoot at these structures 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.420
 muscle and especially on a muscle of the 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.250
 tydos by the way all the great role and 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.739
 to train him to do a job 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.680
 eccentric braking slump the 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.720
 guide and so is what happens it's 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.850
 that this gentleman so the cause at 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.190
 centrism important if associative wings 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.450
 posterior who gets his keychain 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.640
 paris just now but politely 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.489
 logo leggings moment and the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.170
 so triggers filial periods that 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.110
 it's a very classic case 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.239
 blue of the sport and therefore must fight 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.740
 this crowd is super protective for 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.110
 limit excess traction 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.210
 is that he agrees which types of 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.830
 soles is recommended in my 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.500
 salary per draw 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.790
 dart type of insole types 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.470
 orthopedic that you will meet the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.850
 more frequently ordered a story 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.420
 be conditional term formula 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.960
 Tamil heat-sealed and these wasted 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.780
 in fact you take that you're going to heat 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.570
 in vacuum smoke and small 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.520
 cushions small cushions older 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.640
 blows without silicone and therefore you going 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.770
 take foot prints is molded 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.280
 intervention al sufi the patient in 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.570
 trying to him in fact suffered natal to 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.130
 the sole for the goal is your 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.950
 training 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.950
 because we are going through the thing 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.480
 before the generation according to his words 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.300
 that we use scanners in three 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.570
 dimensions and gloves of the summer when 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.820
 we start a numerically controlled robot 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.410
 of apple 15 mn on a maniac killer 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.330
 poetry that's what we take 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.070
 liscano products manceau the patient so 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.120
 we read the week it is the lie of the 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.650
 patient it's a thousandth of a millimeter 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.570
 do not know if it's useful s times their 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.430
 debt does not specify ours cezar case and 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.750
 So suddenly it is to grant internally 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:00.500
 of the same precision who work very 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:02.600
 long and that allows you to hesitate 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.690
 not watching right now the 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.900
 images for viewing at this type of 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.900
 foot 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.860
 so 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.990
 we have this patient so you see for example 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.040
 you are if you approach and you see 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.170
 it's antoine you'll see that these 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.580
 Borrowings are a little weird theme 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.380
 who lose support outside the 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.670
 quay okay it's because his foot 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.990
 were inside that's it 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.210
 typically what's called an ali son 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.980
 him be a pronator pinball and get 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.780
 pass york with his hyper pronator foot 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.370
 precisely he has clip periods that 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.950
 comes from that his son is going a lot 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.080
 too much to lie inside the shot he 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.610
 goes much too sought remembers 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.770
 especially the best possible a posteriori 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.660
 this is also to show this measure 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.830
 was going on particular on his backhand and that to 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.420
 do what I do and on time 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.740
 shoot at the bronze faith of 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.630
 air folks recovery and what will you 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.130
 find with ideal basics that 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.200
 are a beehive at this gentleman 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.420
 and you see that it's a classic case 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.270
 typical with the week of the country that we go 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.770
 force the foot to restructure itself for 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.450
 that he finds an hour a footprint 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.670
 physiological with support under the 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.440
 foot arch led the back foot and 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.910
 forefoot supination Lagaf ' 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.560
 belgian hammer and so suddenly 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.740
 typically sanaa can limit 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.690
 excessive traction at its level 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.100
 medoc and he's worth his back quay and 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.730
 to limit damage at the level of 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.730
 periods that there are 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.380
 they were rebuked sees his 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.300
 expects his dedication a lot towards 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.889
 inside and you have to level 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.810
 manner of load salim this contest 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.240
 give your feet up there's a lot going on 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.860
 layer and the interior already tested in 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.300
 internal with others 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.340
 at age 50 inside the foot support 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.160
 client plan and its tower has dominated this 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.199
 to sign repetitively and to 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.910
 way wrongly but it will accentuate the 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.740
 patient leaders and know the important 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.440
 service is not matter 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.520
 precisely these analyzes the cocoon stride to 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.259
 wheel on some war background 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.789
 people who find themselves after 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.220
 all the parameters of pressure and 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.660
 force who are also videos and killed 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.289
 by a body espacio also 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.449
 leaving is to see precisely if the 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:07.530
 particular runner to troubles decided 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:10.449
 have already had lead poisoning in his daughter 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.539
 we will be mistaken at this 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:12.539
 patient
