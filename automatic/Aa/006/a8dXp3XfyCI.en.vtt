00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.810
 good to all valid to a new lived 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.310
 forgive for the super half voice the 2 and 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.769
 28 dawn good to choose what 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.080
 I repeat evolutionary and leave the favorites 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.360
 it's a lot and it's true that it 's a fucking 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.009
 egg that although you do not think about these 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.080
 now you do not have a lot of encouragement with the 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.359
 comments of such good seems to be that 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.850
 redo has presented his new we have 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.910
 a christine project project and the 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.080
 truth is that it is quite interesting already 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.080
 I love myself I do not usually talk about the country 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.839
 because they are things I understand what 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.249
 they really get a little out of me from my 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:36.019
 areas is not that I understand a little 

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:37.579
 more than consoles more than more than 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.069
 fish but good I think that news 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.690
 say it is quite interesting because 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:44.359
 Well, it seems that this project 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.999
 of remaking then it becomes a kind of 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.399
 we can say modular pc and what good 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:51.170
 that the modules are easy to change 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.729
 and basically put so that you 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.530
 make an idea in the description you have 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.629
 You can watch a video to see it 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.670
 explains a little better 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.929
 what is this basically because we 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.850
 we will have a kind of tower in which 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.199
 we could the components 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.729
 that we wanted for example if we want 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.799
 more ram memory then change it so 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.000
 very simple through 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.690
 basically this technology looks like 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.619
 quite interesting how 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.030
 change the components press very 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.440
 easy to follow with technology and 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.909
 so they will synchronize 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.540
 automatically and we would not have to 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.760
 install certain things 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.340
 or things like that that would facilitate 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.500
 all pretty good I've been reading a 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.880
 little and informing me good seems to be 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.920
 that this is being a bit criticized 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.860
 for people because they say destroy 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.270
 a little whatever the pcn water or that 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.800
 I know maybe we could say your 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.810
 we can say open architecture not 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.220
 what has to be accelerate then 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.229
 pretty much me the truth I do not what 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.400
 nothing bad that wants to buy what is 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.820
 I bought it what is clear that this 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.070
 is made for people like me who do not 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.630
 have can I change a component and 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.040
 that is totally easy if we want 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.440
 that the 100 of the cities and text what 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.670
 they do not but there's nothing better than 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.080
 put what you eggs 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.940
 and such 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.590
 It is not always good to learn certain 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.690
 things I 'm not going to do it yourself but 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.820
 well this perhaps maybe facilitated maybe 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.200
 It makes things a lot easier for us 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.940
 the people who do not even want to 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.190
 learn or anything like that and I think 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.840
 which is a good project that really 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.060
 for a project is still not there 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.310
 knows if it will or will not come out in fact 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.020
 on the rafer page, they invite us to 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.640
 subscribe to get more 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.810
 information when it is updated and such 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.760
 but good looks 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.440
 now it's a project that you do not even know 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.140
 launch date even if not even 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.430
 whether it will or will not come out so good only 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.220
 to wait for the truth is that the design 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.540
 It's pretty futuristic and pretty cool 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.160
 so well nothing more kids that has 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.760
 been everything and nothing we go in the next 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.760
 video is next
