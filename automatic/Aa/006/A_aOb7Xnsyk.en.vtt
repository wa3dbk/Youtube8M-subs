00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello this is anne-marie vegan credit 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.730
 today I show you a little bit 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.030
 what I eat in a day 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.490
 always to arouse desires and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.990
 maybe answer some questions 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.910
 so this morning I took salads from 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.260
 bananas 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.570
 I took five banana I took some 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.029
 lettuce leaves actually and then from 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.380
 grapes here I go try no but 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.119
 some grapes anyway and 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.130
 and then I took a case that guys who 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.740
 would treat wall there that starts enough 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.420
 enough with the season that we're going 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.239
 put the belly is a fruit 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.989
 but extraordinary and when they are 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.790
 well ripe like that that's all so 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.640
 we do them when it's not already 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.579
 do we do that he is he is everything 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.370
 and then we press it and it's like 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.340
 jam falling on it 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.890
 I have a cake that is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.230
 covered like that you will find 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.670
 maybe with 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.640
 on the site in a book 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.189
 both I know more here you can 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.290
 you put me on a cake on a 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.810
 fruit preparation and spread it out as 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.009
 it looks like apricot jam 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.110
 those who do not know must really 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.280
 try 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.350
 here and then I drizzled with a bit of 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.490
 lemon always for the taste and then 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.780
 to prevent its oxidation too 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.670
 although it does not have the time to 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.450
 oxidize because I have very little 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.700
 time I have a Japanese course in a 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.780
 quarter of an hour so I'll get started 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.780
 here is a moment ago 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.480
 today I was eating 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.550
 something a little different I want to 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.080
 to eat salad at noon I have not 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.240
 want the mixture eat salad 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.370
 with bananas or dates or 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.320
 dried fruit or fruit salad 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.690
 as usual I have as I have a 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.700
 want something that will make room and 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.530
 they are saltier without this is 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.750
 of course but something that is 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.290
 rather vegetables I benefit for 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.630
 tell you 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.490
 by the way if that I'll tell you this is 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:09.369
 sometimes I get letters 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.410
 people say is what you can eat 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.060
 is you can eat vegetables 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.810
 noon why do we still need them 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.090
 eat dinner there is no fault there 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.590
 has no obligation 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.660
 there we must always remember the 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.900
 base the bass and eat plants and 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.320
 only vegetables after eating 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.820
 the biggest possible the most that the 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.030
 block larger part of these plants 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.100
 are raw and the rest do not care if we 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.480
 eat in the morning midday afternoon in the afternoon 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.760
 2 o'clock in the morning we do not care 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.620
 we love regularity etc but in 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.380
 life we ​​are not like that 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.690
 every time dancing in the nails all 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.730
 time all year and it's very 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.310
 important than elsewhere because we are not 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.900
 no robots is really I insist 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.130
 on the fact that you eat your vegetables 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.830
 and to the fruits absolutely when you 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.720
 want Thursday touch for I explain that 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.850
 it's more normal to eat the fruits 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.930
 morning and noon because we need to 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.459
 many cases lorient in the day 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.260
 we move a lot and in the evening vegetables 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.850
 which are still very low calorie 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.560
 because afterwards we have to go to bed 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.350
 simply pressure compared to India 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.600
 hours of bananas a salad is two 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.530
 or three times less calories but that 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.989
 depends on the number of patients but 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.150
 frankly his first banham we have 800 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.730
 calories a salad is 200 300 cases 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.130
 envied to the maximum 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.400
 especially if we do not put in here 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.870
 the explanation of the room 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.430
 in the evening it's still better to eat 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.680
 of that the evening meeting at noon like 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.250
 today we supervised the dance me 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.000
 I do not have a scene 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.790
 so I made radish a big step 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.239
 too big finally whole black radish that 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:48.200
 I mixed with lemon cards 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:52.370
 and then the same pickle 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.989
 conditions the claps with hats but that 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.640
 it does not matter to me it's always 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.870
 plants and I think it's worth 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.400
 marries very well with their said radish 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.440
 black 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.209
 I love it a little bit that counts 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.849
 at home I love it and then there I 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:12.079
 am my mashed agde to me this one 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.689
 she is really she likes me a lot 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.180
 there is no him there is no die 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:18.109
 but it is delicious and with games 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.030
 prague salad 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.650
 if I want I will put a small 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.280
 salad leaf I will put a small 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.650
 spoon of two priests 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.660
 of seaweed with a little gherkins and 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.250
 tools of three slices of radish and 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.570
 I see it there is a stir meal this afternoon 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.700
 it's not a lot of calories 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.410
 I would certainly end of course 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.690
 rather than if I'm going to eat but yes 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.940
 but it does not matter 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.310
 when I'm finished I'll take some fruit 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.419
 this time here it is all this 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.680
 that I meant for the meal of 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.680
 noon and I'm going to eat now 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.660
 now that I did some sport 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.920
