we have the situation where we've got

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.990 
we have the situation where we've got
the<00:00:37.530> 18<00:00:37.800> inch<00:00:37.920> tire<00:00:38.129> now<00:00:38.340> for<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.610> car<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
the 18 inch tire now for the car of the

future project that was developed over
the<00:00:40.739> last<00:00:40.860> two<00:00:41.129> years<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.879> we've<00:00:41.969> done<00:00:42.120> about

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the last two years and we've done about

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.549 
the last two years and we've done about
seven<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.660> half<00:00:42.690> thousand<00:00:43.140> kilometers<00:00:43.469> are

seven and a half thousand kilometers are

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.610 
seven and a half thousand kilometers are
testing<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.100> tire<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.289> 18

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
testing on this tire and this is the 18

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.200 
testing on this tire and this is the 18
inch<00:00:46.649> soft<00:00:47.010> tire<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.460> use<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.850> also<00:00:48.000> have

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
inch soft tire that we use we also have

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.639 
inch soft tire that we use we also have
the<00:00:48.300> hard<00:00:48.510> tire<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.079> wet<00:00:49.230> weather<00:00:49.379> tire

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the hard tire and the wet weather tire

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.400 
the hard tire and the wet weather tire
so<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> three<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> entire<00:00:50.760> championship

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
so the three do the entire championship

the 18 you can see I mean 12 and a half
millimeters<00:00:59.100> difference<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.059> one

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
tread on the tire right from the word go

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.820 
tread on the tire right from the word go
so<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.659> teams<00:01:09.900> come<00:01:10.140> along<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.470> measure<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
so the teams come along and measure the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.289 
so the teams come along and measure the
tires<00:01:11.040> early<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> weekend<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.210> they

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
tires early on on the weekend and they

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
tires early on on the weekend and they
they<00:01:12.570> keep<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.840> bit<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.020> an<00:01:13.110> idea<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.530> how<00:01:13.950> this

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
they keep a bit of an idea on how this

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.469 
they keep a bit of an idea on how this
chassis<00:01:14.400> setups<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.119> everything<00:01:15.360> else

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
chassis setups going and everything else

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.560 
chassis setups going and everything else
on<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.380> tread<00:01:16.590> we've<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:17.640> identify<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.270> tires

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
on the tread we've we identify the tires

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.990 
on the tread we've we identify the tires
uniquely<00:01:19.229> with<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> barcode<00:01:19.770> system<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.790> each

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
uniquely with a barcode system so each

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.789 
uniquely with a barcode system so each
tire<00:01:21.240> has<00:01:21.420> an<00:01:21.509> individual<00:01:21.960> barcode<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.560> we

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
tire has an individual barcode on it we

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.140 
tire has an individual barcode on it we
lay<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> tires<00:01:23.340> there<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.729> start<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
lay the tires there at the start of the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.940 
lay the tires there at the start of the
weekend<00:01:24.540> scan<00:01:24.900> them<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.170> two<00:01:25.259> sets<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
weekend scan them in two sets and the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.620 
weekend scan them in two sets and the
officials<00:01:26.340> allocate<00:01:26.759> who<00:01:26.790> gets<00:01:27.180> what<00:01:27.330> set<00:01:27.509> of

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
officials allocate who gets what set of

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.210 
officials allocate who gets what set of
tires<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.409> there's<00:01:28.530> no<00:01:28.619> way<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.979> fudge<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
tires so there's no way we can fudge the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.440 
tires so there's no way we can fudge the
system<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> bit<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.970> throw<00:01:30.119> something<00:01:30.420> through

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
system a bit and throw something through

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.390 
system a bit and throw something through
to<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.750> special<00:01:31.079> team<00:01:31.259> or<00:01:31.500> or<00:01:32.040> anything<00:01:32.189> like

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.370 

so<00:01:51.520> these<00:01:51.640> two<00:01:52.030> tires<00:01:52.270> that<00:01:52.479> we<00:01:52.570> have<00:01:52.780> wet

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
so these two tires that we have wet

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.899 
so these two tires that we have wet
weather<00:01:53.500> tire<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.250> drive<00:01:54.460> with<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.729> tire

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
weather tire and the drive with the tire

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.880 
weather tire and the drive with the tire
so<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.750> drive<00:01:55.960> weather<00:01:56.170> tire<00:01:56.440> whether<00:01:56.680> it<00:01:56.799> be

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
so the drive weather tire whether it be

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.010 
so the drive weather tire whether it be
the<00:01:57.009> soft<00:01:57.250> or<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.520> hard<00:01:57.700> compound<00:01:58.240> is<00:01:58.600> exactly

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
the soft or the hard compound is exactly

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.300 
the soft or the hard compound is exactly
the<00:01:59.170> same<00:01:59.350> in<00:01:59.590> its<00:01:59.710> dimensions<00:02:00.159> and

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
the same in its dimensions and

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.730 
the same in its dimensions and
everything<00:02:00.369> sidewall<00:02:01.299> disabled<00:02:01.780> its<00:02:01.990> 305

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
everything sidewall disabled its 305

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.670 
everything sidewall disabled its 305
millimeters<00:02:03.149> wide<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.690> tread<00:02:05.020> width<00:02:05.229> is<00:02:05.440> two

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
millimeters wide the tread width is two

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.200

hundred and eighty millimeters in

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.100 
hundred and eighty millimeters in
diameter<00:02:08.440> so<00:02:09.220> that's<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.940> same<00:02:10.179> for<00:02:10.630> both<00:02:10.929> the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
diameter so that's the same for both the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.199 
diameter so that's the same for both the

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
hard and the soft compound the wet

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.650 
hard and the soft compound the wet
weather<00:02:13.360> tire<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:14.800> same<00:02:15.760> dimensions<00:02:16.450> but<00:02:16.630> a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
weather tire is same dimensions but a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.140 
weather tire is same dimensions but a
little<00:02:16.989> bit<00:02:17.140> wider<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.160> in<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.700> actual

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
little bit wider in the in the actual

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.690 
little bit wider in the in the actual
tread<00:02:19.450> area<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:19.900> it's<00:02:20.110> exactly<00:02:20.680> 300<00:02:21.459> mil<00:02:21.580> in

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
tread area so it's exactly 300 mil in

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.490 
tread area so it's exactly 300 mil in
the<00:02:21.730> tread<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.720> where<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.019> team<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.290> going<00:02:23.410> to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
the tread and where the team is going to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.840 
the tread and where the team is going to
be<00:02:23.560> very<00:02:23.739> very<00:02:23.830> careful<00:02:24.070> with<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.459> is<00:02:24.640> it's

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
be very very careful with this is it's

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.340 
be very very careful with this is it's
seven<00:02:25.420> millimeters<00:02:25.810> bigger<00:02:26.019> in<00:02:26.170> diameter

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
seven millimeters bigger in diameter

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.590 
seven millimeters bigger in diameter
then<00:02:27.280> what<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.640> dryer<00:02:27.850> is<00:02:28.269> so<00:02:28.420> if<00:02:28.480> they've<00:02:28.570> got

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
then what the dryer is so if they've got

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.630

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.910 
in pit lane they've got to be very very
careful<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.200> everything<00:02:35.440> because<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.800> put

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
doesn't have a tread pattern because

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.350 
doesn't have a tread pattern because
what<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.190> patent<00:02:48.489> is<00:02:48.550> designed<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.000> do<00:02:49.150> is

what the patent is designed to do is

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.120 
what the patent is designed to do is
shared<00:02:49.630> water<00:02:49.840> because<00:02:50.500> it's<00:02:50.650> only<00:02:50.769> used<00:02:51.010> in

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
shared water because it's only used in

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.440 
shared water because it's only used in
dry<00:02:51.280> weather<00:02:51.310> we<00:02:51.700> don't<00:02:51.880> need<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.120> shed<00:02:52.299> water

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
dry weather we don't need to shed water

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.000 
dry weather we don't need to shed water
so<00:02:53.049> that's<00:02:53.140> what<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.410> patent<00:02:53.680> does<00:02:53.709> it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
so that's what the patent does it

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.860 
so that's what the patent does it
actually<00:02:54.220> gets<00:02:54.400> rid<00:02:54.519> of<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.640> water<00:02:54.870> between

adjust things from that because we have
