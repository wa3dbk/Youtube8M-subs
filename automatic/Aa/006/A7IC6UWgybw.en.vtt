 lamborghini back in 1963 and to 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.060
 I was not immediately stoned for the type 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.680
 wrong pronunciation is worth noting 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.229

 Italy, the British sold off no surplus 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.659
 they need technicians now and enterprising 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.429
 the young Italian took advantage of this 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.349
 so a small company appeared 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.450
 the production of tractors after a few 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.190
 years when the company founder got rich 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.800

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.080
 thinking about how that 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.810
 could improve your cars but here 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.970
 Nezhdanchik as a result, he was faced with 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.220
 commonplace rudeness and caustic phrases about 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.930
 the fact that the tractor manufacturer should not 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.180
 climb into the production of sports cars 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.920
 lamborghini was furious then he 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.989

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.480
 success was waiting for the company after the appearance 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.400
 In fact miura it was an excellent supercar 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.840

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.640
