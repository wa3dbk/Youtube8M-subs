something currently he is afraid of the

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
statute of liberty should look something

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.509 
statute of liberty should look something
like<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:12.620> and<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.769> century<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.099> liberty<00:00:14.429> is

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
like this and the century of liberty is

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.700 
like this and the century of liberty is
really<00:00:14.730> just<00:00:14.910> an<00:00:15.059> extremely<00:00:15.599> distorted<00:00:16.170> half

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
really just an extremely distorted half

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.220 
really just an extremely distorted half
shower<00:00:16.949> pattern<00:00:17.250> go<00:00:18.150> like<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.510> but<00:00:18.900> way<00:00:19.050> up

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
shower pattern go like this but way up

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.859 
shower pattern go like this but way up
there<00:00:19.400> so<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.670> leaving<00:00:21.000> work<00:00:21.300> up<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.600> is

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
there so the leaving work up to it is

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.650 
there so the leaving work up to it is
just<00:00:22.050> start<00:00:22.619> doing<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.859> half<00:00:22.980> shower<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.660> turn

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
just start doing a half shower and turn

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.910 
just start doing a half shower and turn
your<00:00:24.750> left<00:00:24.990> hand<00:00:25.260> instead<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.710> catching

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
your left hand instead of catching

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.859 
your left hand instead of catching
normally<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.609> sort<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.449> words<00:00:27.660> like

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
normally like this sort of in words like

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.900 
normally like this sort of in words like
this<00:00:29.689> leg<00:00:30.689> catch<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.109> balls<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:33.890> and

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
this leg catch on balls like that and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.440 
this leg catch on balls like that and
naturally<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> have<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.270> hold<00:00:36.390> your

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
naturally going to have to hold your

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.610 
naturally going to have to hold your
left<00:00:36.630> hand<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> little<00:00:36.870> bit<00:00:36.989> higher<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.559> way

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
left hand a little bit higher that way

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.170 
left hand a little bit higher that way
you<00:00:37.770> let<00:00:37.950> go<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> balls<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.670> move<00:00:38.910> down<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
you let go of the balls and move down to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.670 
you let go of the balls and move down to
your<00:00:39.210> right<00:00:39.450> hand<00:00:39.719> instead<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.140> following<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
your right hand instead of following the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.020 
your right hand instead of following the
ground<00:00:40.890> as<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.309> what<00:00:41.579> if<00:00:41.610> you're<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:41.910> like

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
ground as they what if you're going like

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.470 
ground as they what if you're going like
that<00:00:43.129> so<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.520> position<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.000> very<00:00:45.090> important

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
that so in position is very important

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.410 
that so in position is very important
here<00:00:45.860> now<00:00:46.860> when<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.340> let<00:00:47.550> go<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.760> all<00:00:48.270> this

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
here now when you let go of all this

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.850 
here now when you let go of all this
from<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:48.780> left<00:00:48.960> hand<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.500> want<00:00:49.680> them<00:00:49.770> to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
from your left hand you want them to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.680 
from your left hand you want them to
just<00:00:49.890> kind<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.190> drop<00:00:50.460> maybe<00:00:50.850> roll<00:00:51.149> down<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
just kind of drop maybe roll down the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.270 
just kind of drop maybe roll down the
palm<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.930> your<00:00:52.110> hand<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.469> little<00:00:52.590> bit<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.980> direct

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
palm of your hand a little bit to direct

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.740 
palm of your hand a little bit to direct
them<00:00:53.399> towards<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> right<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.629> don't

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
them towards the right but you don't

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.819 
them towards the right but you don't
wanna<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.960> throwing<00:00:55.230> them<00:00:55.320> at<00:00:55.379> all<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.680> don't

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
wanna be throwing them at all you don't

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.290 
wanna be throwing them at all you don't
have<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.129> think<00:00:56.250> about<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.550> drops<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:57.120> let

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
have to think about the drops just let

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.090 
have to think about the drops just let
them<00:00:57.449> go<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.440> they<00:00:58.559> should<00:00:58.710> fall<00:00:58.859> down<00:00:59.010> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
them go and they should fall down to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.369 
them go and they should fall down to
your<00:00:59.190> right<00:00:59.309> hand<00:00:59.489> naturally<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:01.079> point<00:01:01.320> in

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
your right hand naturally the point in

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.689 
your right hand naturally the point in
which<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.590> let<00:01:01.739> them<00:01:01.859> go<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.219> should<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.489> right

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
which you let them go it should be right

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.579 
which you let them go it should be right
before<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.210> catch<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.719> next<00:01:03.870> incoming<00:01:04.290> ball

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
before you catch the next incoming ball

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.260 
before you catch the next incoming ball
so<00:01:05.250> essentially<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.729> hold<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.210> ball

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
so essentially just hold on to that ball

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.270 
so essentially just hold on to that ball
like<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.840> until<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> next<00:01:07.619> one<00:01:07.770> comes<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
like this until the next one comes and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.500 
like this until the next one comes and
only<00:01:08.520> open<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:08.820> hand<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> catch<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> next

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
only open your hand to catch the next

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.240 
only open your hand to catch the next
ball<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.380> point<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.770> ball<00:01:10.920> should<00:01:11.040> roll

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
ball at that point the ball should roll

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.000 
ball at that point the ball should roll
out<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.640> go<00:01:11.729> down<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.970> your<00:01:12.030> right<00:01:12.180> hand<00:01:13.010> like

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
out and go down to your right hand like

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.080 
out and go down to your right hand like
so<00:01:16.250> waiting<00:01:17.250> until<00:01:17.460> you're<00:01:17.610> about<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.939> catch

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
so waiting until you're about to catch

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.120 
so waiting until you're about to catch
the<00:01:18.210> next<00:01:18.330> Bob<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.950> spaces<00:01:19.950> out<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the next Bob like that spaces out the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.719 
the next Bob like that spaces out the
pattern<00:01:20.400> nicely<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.060> gives<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.330> enough<00:01:21.540> time

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
pattern nicely and gives you enough time

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.770 
pattern nicely and gives you enough time
now<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.090> way<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> progress<00:01:24.450> from<00:01:24.689> there

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
now the way to progress from there

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480 
now the way to progress from there
always<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.140> just<00:01:25.470> too<00:01:25.560> slowly<00:01:25.860> lift<00:01:26.189> your<00:01:26.250> hand

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
always is just too slowly lift your hand

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.130 
always is just too slowly lift your hand
higher<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.060> higher<00:01:27.090> until<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.840> lock<00:01:28.020> your

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
higher and higher until I can lock your

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.800 
higher and higher until I can lock your
elbow<00:01:28.439> at<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> top<00:01:29.299> this<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.600> about

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
elbow at the top this is all about

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.390 
elbow at the top this is all about
precision<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.590> higher<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.950> go<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
precision because the higher you go the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.999 
precision because the higher you go the
more<00:01:32.520> precise<00:01:32.970> throws<00:01:33.689> need<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.170> so

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
more precise throws need to be so

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.010 
more precise throws need to be so
they'll<00:01:35.250> reach<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:35.610> left<00:01:35.759> hand<00:01:36.030> without

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
they'll reach your left hand without
