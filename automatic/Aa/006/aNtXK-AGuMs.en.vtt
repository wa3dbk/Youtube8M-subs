00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.790
 we have already seen from previous classes that 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.599
 natural names are these 012 going to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.450
 infinite 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:18.300
 the natural numbers the whole numbers 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.800
 and it is the natural numbers plus the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.210
 negative numbers 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.759
 the set of rational numbers 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.009
 are these other numbers that are between 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:34.960
 whole integers integers 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:39.129
 or are these numbers here all 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.290
 to complete the straight and they are 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.010
 represented 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.879
 then by a fractional set that is 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:53.370
 a fraction between two numbers as per 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:55.930
 example 37 years 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.390
 We also saw that the whole number 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.690
 fractional it can be divided 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.230
 dividend 3 by 7 and we have the number 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.230
 decimal 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:12.369
 national numbers are fractions and 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.929
 descends more and as we have already seen 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.210
 We are going to learn from here. 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:22.000
 how to do operations and add subtraction 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.750
 multiplication and division with 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.509
 fractions as well as decimals in the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.869
 today we are going to work with sum of 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:41.039
 decimais infringements 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:45.369
 then let's sum the 3.75 plus 2082 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:51.340
 here is almost a review on the comma case 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:53.709
 below comma and we are going to have 3 75 more 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.229
 two and 82 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:59.229
 We have to take care of the villa. 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:06.989
 is below comma and we are going to have 5 and 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:09.640
 2 778 15 11 and in the case 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:13.540
 46 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.950
 and the village will stay here so we have this 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.360
 result 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.900
 revising the sum of this more to add 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.019
 decimals 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.640
 Let's put the number here, village below. 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.640
 village and only had bad usually
