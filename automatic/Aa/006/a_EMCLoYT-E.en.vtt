00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.330
 application of this law dating back to 1992 we will try to understand what is there 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.210
 so extraordinary in the Strait of Messina and asking for protection 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.760
 of the European Union that there is the application of this law 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.450
 so much from letters in mora italia

 given talar cell passage of migratory birds the spectacle of the 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.010
 extraordinary nature that is repeated every year 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.710
 and that we have restaurant we will demonstrate during this episode 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.220
 the color of the text proposed this map of the area of ​​the strait of 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.220
 messina indicates a special protection area 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.630
 it is an area of ​​particular environmental value identified as others 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.330
 in italy and europe under the directive of the european union number 43 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.140
 in 1998 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.880
 called habitat aimed at the conservation of biological diversity 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.850
 present in the territory of the union 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.860
 within the zps the building must have a reduced impact 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.870
 environmental and its application has often been challenged by manufacturers 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.600
 and professional orders because it severely limits the possibility of building 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.030
 mainly due to its extension which also includes the urban center of 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.829
 mESSINA 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.829
 the zps debate still on 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:34.779
 but who do you protect the green area traced on this card 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.010
 acate every year over the Strait of Messina 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.849
 thousands of birds, many of which belong to species at risk of 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:49.729
 extinction 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:54.199
 counteract the wind challenge the currents struggle for life in the eternal 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.199
 spectacular mechanism of nature 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:02.419
 all under the watchful eye of a group of scholars who hold the 1980s 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:06.449
 between March and June they organize fields dedicated to observation of the flows 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:10.799
 migratory with scientific and naturalistic research objectives but also with 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.799
 the purpose of protecting poachers' birds 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:20.689
 a commitment started in 1984 when the crime of shooting migratory birds 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.079
 from these stone workstations almost regularity was perpetrated 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.079
 despite the yellow tax law 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:34.449
 since the beginning of the commitment of scholars and mentality to protect the birds of prey today 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.200
 gathered in the Mediterranean association of nature 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.879
 founded in 2003 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.489
 birds in transit on the Strait of Messina have passed by just over 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.529
 3000 has almost 40,000 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:49.839
 the shots of the poachers even those counted are instead considerably 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:54.209
 decreased from 1185 to zero in 2009 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.799
 a battle therefore almost life is but environmentalists do not lower the 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.799

 1984 we read of the fields studying surveillance of birds of prey and storks

 migration on the Strait of Messina this activity began in 84 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.590
 because at the time the species closed hunting season is regularly shot 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.999
 protected - tools that ruthlessly by law

 go early in the sicilian channel there is also a bus for myself and the sea is 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.759
 an obstacle to stepping on a strange one

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:13.999
 some chance of survival. it would be rowing to die for drowning

 pelosetta a bit like the highway exit when an arrey ends 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.249
 a path we concentrate we all know in the saddle for this I learned 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:39.389
 more car number so the same happens for birds because yes 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.250
 they are convinced that they accept a very short stretch of sea that I believe 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:45.610
 for it is not a deadly spent obstacle 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.810
 so I should concentrate on this area to overcome it

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.599
 flat menez was a very hard battle very practical to use because 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.719
 obviously extinct it went against a fairly rooted tradition over time 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:07.509
 andrea culturally there was a bit cap photo thanks to maybe in the north and in 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.590
 particularly the regional forestry body in the carabinieri 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.249
 also thanks to the cultural change that occurred between 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:20.979
 those who fired open these stakes that we see built long 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:26.579
 the shores most important areas of migration but above all because 

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:28.220
 they were more easily shot 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.160
 we have not been saying brain unused over time and now it is almost 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.770
 always they are employed for marianne pit ragazzon marmitte 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:41.789
 so poachers decrease observers increase 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:45.889
 but there are still those who sew raptors looking for new combinations every year 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.680
 to circumvent the surveillance of environmentalists and the controls of the 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.250
 carabinieri and forester for luck in recent years especially the 

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:58.409
 poaching clearly the best turret first also the attached a

 cultural change are increasingly 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.630
 those who shot at what time they appreciate instead seeing them with binoculars 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.789
 love and enjoy its beauty while they pass obviously did not disappear from 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.550
 everything even though last year we recorded
