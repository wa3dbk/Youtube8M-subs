00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
simple implementation we can don't think

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.700 
simple implementation we can don't think
we<00:02:30.640> can<00:02:30.820> respray<00:02:31.330> yeah<00:02:31.570> um<00:02:32.530> all<00:02:34.710> the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
go to different vehicles when you

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.790 
go to different vehicles when you
customize<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.570> that's<00:02:50.020> pretty<00:02:50.230> cool<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.650> know

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
great cool so I guess you could do

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.470 
great cool so I guess you could do
everything<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.850> can<00:02:54.940> do<00:02:55.060> more<00:02:55.240> play

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
everything that you can do more play

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.650 
everything that you can do more play
except<00:02:56.460> customizing<00:02:57.460> yet<00:02:57.610> which<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.210> guess<00:02:58.450> you

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
except customizing yet which I guess you

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.360 
except customizing yet which I guess you
have<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.840> go<00:02:59.230> to<00:03:00.300> los<00:03:01.300> santos<00:03:01.330> the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
have to go to los santos the
