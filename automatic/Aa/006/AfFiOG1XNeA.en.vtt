00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.540 
new attachment to call the de series
we've<00:00:10.349> never<00:00:10.650> seen<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.070> before<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.400> it's

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
we've never seen it before and it's

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.039 
we've never seen it before and it's
actually<00:00:11.880> pretty<00:00:12.059> simple<00:00:12.330> but<00:00:12.900> it's

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
actually pretty simple but it's

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.379 
actually pretty simple but it's
extremely<00:00:13.590> extremely<00:00:14.040> effective<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.120> lot

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
extremely extremely effective in a lot

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.910 
extremely extremely effective in a lot
of<00:00:15.420> situations<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.379> really<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
of situations this is really going to

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.769 
of situations this is really going to
help<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.160> out<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.180> think<00:00:18.390> it's<00:00:18.510> one<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
help you out and I think it's one of the

help you out and I think it's one of the
better<00:00:18.900> attachments<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> game<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.220> you

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
better attachments in the game so you

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.640 
better attachments in the game so you
can<00:00:20.850> put<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.150> thing<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.510> any<00:00:21.869> weapon<00:00:22.410> and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
can put this thing on any weapon and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.560 
can put this thing on any weapon and
allows<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> see<00:00:23.609> suppressed<00:00:24.090> weapons

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
allows you to see suppressed weapons

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.540 
allows you to see suppressed weapons
fire<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:25.230> your<00:00:25.560> mini-map<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:26.369> see

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
fire on your mini-map so you can see

fire on your mini-map so you can see
right<00:00:26.760> here<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.930> will<00:00:28.019> look

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
very big deal especially in game modes

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590 
very big deal especially in game modes
like<00:00:55.680> TDM<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.520> Search<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.879> Destroy<00:00:56.910> Search

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
like TDM or Search and Destroy Search

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.510 
like TDM or Search and Destroy Search
and<00:00:57.780> Rescue<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:58.199> game<00:00:58.890> modes<00:00:59.070> where<00:00:59.250> people

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
and Rescue know game modes where people

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.310 
and Rescue know game modes where people
use<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> lot<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.059> silencers<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.750> tend<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.140> play

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
use a lot of silencers and tend to play

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.750 
use a lot of silencers and tend to play
a<00:01:01.350> little<00:01:01.530> bit<00:01:01.710> slower<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.640> bit

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
a little bit slower and a little bit

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.850 
a little bit slower and a little bit
more<00:01:02.879> campy<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.870> thing<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.350> absolutely

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
more campy this thing is absolutely

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.100 
more campy this thing is absolutely
amazing<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.090> not<00:01:06.210> only<00:01:06.360> because<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.840> see

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
amazing and not only because you can see

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.780 
amazing and not only because you can see
where<00:01:07.409> they<00:01:07.530> are<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.950> your<00:01:08.159> mini-map<00:01:08.369> but<00:01:08.610> also

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
where they are on your mini-map but also

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.550 
where they are on your mini-map but also
because<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.240> tell<00:01:09.570> who<00:01:09.840> has<00:01:09.990> silencers

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
because you can tell who has silencers

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.840 
because you can tell who has silencers
and<00:01:10.740> who<00:01:10.830> does<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.130> because<00:01:11.369> typically<00:01:11.760> people

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
and who does it because typically people

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.060 
and who does it because typically people
without<00:01:12.299> silencers<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:12.990> those<00:01:13.590> type<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> game

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
without silencers and those type of game

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.230 
without silencers and those type of game
modes<00:01:14.280> are<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> ones<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.060> moving

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
modes are the ones that are moving

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.399 
modes are the ones that are moving
around<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.659> little<00:01:15.750> bit<00:01:15.930> more<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.229> being<00:01:16.350> a

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
around a little bit more and being a

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.719 
around a little bit more and being a
little<00:01:16.500> bit<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:16.860> aggressive<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.430> then

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
little bit more aggressive and then

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.280 
little bit more aggressive and then
typically<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> people<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> silencers

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
typically the people with the silencers

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.810 
typically the people with the silencers
are<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.860> ones<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:20.460> bit<00:01:20.640> more

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
are the ones that are a little bit more

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.340 
are the ones that are a little bit more
hesitant<00:01:21.030> they're<00:01:21.570> playing<00:01:21.810> slower<00:01:22.110> they're

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
hesitant they're playing slower they're

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.450 
hesitant they're playing slower they're
trying<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.680> stealthy<00:01:23.070> because<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.369> know

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
trying to be stealthy because you know

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.100 
trying to be stealthy because you know
in<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> previous<00:01:23.880> like<00:01:24.180> seven<00:01:24.570> years<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.930> Call

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
in the previous like seven years of Call

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.810 
in the previous like seven years of Call
of<00:01:25.140> Duty<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.890> had<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> silencer<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.520> that

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
of Duty if you had a silencer on that

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.460 
of Duty if you had a silencer on that
means<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.600> were<00:01:27.720> staying<00:01:27.960> stealthy<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
means that you were staying stealthy and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.960 
means that you were staying stealthy and
off<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> radar<00:01:28.890> at<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.100> enemy<00:01:29.310> team<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:29.790> not

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
off the radar at the enemy team but not

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.219 
off the radar at the enemy team but not
anymore<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:30.869> use<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
anymore so you can really use that to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.480 
anymore so you can really use that to
your<00:01:31.350> advantage<00:01:31.409> when<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.369> those

really great when paired with

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
really great when paired with
peripherals<00:01:54.810> Ripple's<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.380> kind<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
peripherals Ripple's is kind of like the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.130 
peripherals Ripple's is kind of like the
HD<00:01:56.399> mini-map<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.880> expands<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.630> mini-map<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
HD mini-map it expands the mini-map to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.719 
HD mini-map it expands the mini-map to
the<00:01:58.259> side<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.009> can<00:01:59.100> see<00:01:59.219> more<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.640> and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the side so you can see more of it and

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.550 
the side so you can see more of it and
see<00:01:59.850> more<00:02:00.030> detail<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.990> that's<00:02:01.320> really

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
see more detail so that's really

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.840 
see more detail so that's really
important<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:02.159> you're<00:02:02.280> seeing<00:02:02.460> people<00:02:02.549> with

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
silencers shoot around you can see

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.450 
silencers shoot around you can see
exactly<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.469> know<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:04.799> corner<00:02:05.159> or<00:02:05.280> what

room they're in things like that and
yeah<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.619> really<00:02:07.710> good<00:02:08.039> now<00:02:08.250> unfortunately

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
yeah it's really good now unfortunately

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.650 
yeah it's really good now unfortunately
it<00:02:09.780> does<00:02:10.679> not<00:02:10.920> work<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.580> overkill<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.450> was

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
it does not work with overkill so I was

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.740 
it does not work with overkill so I was
hoping

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
hoping

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.510

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
that you can like put a parabolic

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.160 
that you can like put a parabolic
microphone<00:02:16.090> on<00:02:16.390> your<00:02:16.630> your<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.080> know
