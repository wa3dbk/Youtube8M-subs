00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
with using them I've created a few

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.340 
with using them I've created a few
examples<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.640> how<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.909> both<00:01:26.479> think<00:01:26.869> about<00:01:27.170> them

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
examples of how to both think about them

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.649 
examples of how to both think about them
on<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.770> neck<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.310> how<00:01:28.549> you<00:01:28.610> typically<00:01:29.420> see

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
on the neck and how you typically see

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.899 
on the neck and how you typically see
them<00:01:29.840> applied<00:01:30.229> to<00:01:30.890> begin<00:01:31.250> we're<00:01:31.610> going<00:01:31.789> to

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
them applied to begin we're going to

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.929 
them applied to begin we're going to
start<00:01:32.149> with<00:01:32.299> a<00:01:32.329> standard<00:01:33.200> open<00:01:33.439> a<00:01:34.159> major<00:01:34.460> chord

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
start with a standard open a major chord

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.350 
start with a standard open a major chord
so<00:01:35.539> traditional<00:01:36.289> open<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:37.579> from<00:01:38.240> that

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
so traditional open a and from that

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.149 
so traditional open a and from that
chord<00:01:38.750> we're<00:01:38.960> going<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.200> focus<00:01:39.560> on<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:39.979> third

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
chord we're going to focus on the third

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.599 
chord we're going to focus on the third
string<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:41.329> a<00:01:41.360> note<00:01:41.689> in<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.549> into<00:01:43.549> a

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
string the a note in it and into a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.389 
string the a note in it and into a
c-sharp<00:01:44.000> on<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.450> second<00:01:44.810> string<00:01:45.250> which<00:01:46.250> is

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
c-sharp on the second string which is

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.249 
c-sharp on the second string which is
actually<00:01:46.789> a<00:01:46.820> double<00:01:47.149> stop<00:01:47.479> that's<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:47.960> major

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
actually a double stop that's a major

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.679 
actually a double stop that's a major
third<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:49.640> what<00:01:49.939> we're<00:01:50.060> going<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:50.270> do<00:01:50.420> here

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
third so what we're going to do here

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.779 
third so what we're going to do here
though<00:01:50.930> is<00:01:51.079> we're<00:01:51.259> going<00:01:51.439> to<00:01:51.560> build<00:01:52.009> a<00:01:52.250> harmony

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
though is we're going to build a harmony

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.690 
though is we're going to build a harmony
across<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.659> neck<00:01:53.869> in<00:01:54.079> thirds<00:01:54.649> traveling<00:01:55.490> from

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
across the neck in thirds traveling from

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.349 
across the neck in thirds traveling from
that<00:01:55.969> a<00:01:56.409> up<00:01:57.409> into<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:57.829> minor<00:01:58.219> that's<00:01:58.640> off<00:01:58.820> of<00:01:58.969> a<00:01:59.090> B

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
that a up into a minor that's off of a B

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.399

then<00:01:59.929> another<00:02:00.259> minor<00:02:01.030> then<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.060> major<00:02:02.409> another

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.810 
major
a<00:02:04.640> minor<00:02:05.350> another<00:02:06.350> minor<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:07.370> then<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.730> the

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
a minor another minor and then to the

a minor another minor and then to the
octave<00:02:08.800> which<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:09.890> up<00:02:10.040> at<00:02:10.160> 14th<00:02:10.580> fret<00:02:10.790> there<00:02:11.470> so

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
octave which is up at 14th fret there so

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.010 
octave which is up at 14th fret there so
that's<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.770> harmonized<00:02:13.370> double<00:02:14.030> stop<00:02:14.300> concept

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
that's a harmonized double stop concept

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.260 
that's a harmonized double stop concept
and<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.320> great<00:02:15.530> thing<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.860> work<00:02:16.700> on<00:02:16.910> and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
and it's a great thing to work on and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.420 
and it's a great thing to work on and
develop<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.810> could<00:02:17.990> do<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.290> on<00:02:18.740> lower<00:02:19.040> strings

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
develop you could do it on lower strings

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.580 
develop you could do it on lower strings
maybe<00:02:19.670> if<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:19.910> went<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.210> C<00:02:20.480> chord<00:02:20.810> standard

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
maybe if you went to a C chord standard

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.390 
maybe if you went to a C chord standard
open<00:02:21.830> C<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.310> can<00:02:22.460> build<00:02:22.670> them<00:02:23.680> off<00:02:24.680> there<00:02:25.370> or

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
open C you can build them off there or

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.180 
open C you can build them off there or
maybe<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:25.970> could<00:02:26.090> take<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.510> D<00:02:26.720> chord<00:02:27.190> do

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
maybe you could take it to a D chord do

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.360 
maybe you could take it to a D chord do
it<00:02:28.280> on<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.430> top<00:02:28.610> two<00:02:28.790> strings<00:02:29.090> from<00:02:29.240> D<00:02:30.370> you

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
it on the top two strings from D you

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.410 
it on the top two strings from D you
know<00:02:31.460> just<00:02:31.700> move<00:02:31.820> it<00:02:31.940> along<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.240> neck

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
know just move it along the neck

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.260 
know just move it along the neck
practice<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.110> also<00:02:34.040> realize<00:02:34.520> that<00:02:34.550> these

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
practice it and also realize that these

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.540 
practice it and also realize that these
are<00:02:35.450> very<00:02:35.810> popular<00:02:36.080> but<00:02:36.680> there's<00:02:37.130> other

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
are very popular but there's other

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.730 
are very popular but there's other
double<00:02:37.970> stop<00:02:38.180> ideas<00:02:38.660> of<00:02:38.810> course<00:02:38.990> as<00:02:39.260> well<00:02:39.500> the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
double stop ideas of course as well the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.930 
double stop ideas of course as well the
next<00:02:39.920> one<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.070> want<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.310> cover<00:02:40.490> is<00:02:40.670> going<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.820> be

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
next one I want to cover is going to be

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.320 
next one I want to cover is going to be
built<00:02:41.150> off<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:42.250> same<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.520> major<00:02:43.790> chord<00:02:44.209> in

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
built off of the same a major chord in

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.510 
built off of the same a major chord in
example<00:02:44.780> number<00:02:44.930> two<00:02:45.200> here<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.709> what<00:02:46.400> we're

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
example number two here and what we're

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.860 
example number two here and what we're
going<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:46.700> do<00:02:46.760> this<00:02:46.910> time<00:02:47.150> however<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.720> we're

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
going to do this time however is we're

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.810 
going to do this time however is we're
going<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.020> travel<00:02:48.380> from<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.560> e<00:02:48.650> up<00:02:49.220> over<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.790> a

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
going to travel from the e up over to a

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.230 
going to travel from the e up over to a
c-sharp<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.050> that's<00:02:51.980> an<00:02:52.130> interval<00:02:52.490> of<00:02:52.640> major

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
c-sharp and that's an interval of major

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.410 
c-sharp and that's an interval of major
six<00:02:53.950> then<00:02:54.950> we'll<00:02:55.100> go<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.370> minor<00:02:55.700> six<00:02:56.060> from<00:02:56.270> F

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
six then we'll go to a minor six from F

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.770 
six then we'll go to a minor six from F
sharp<00:02:56.750> into<00:02:57.050> a<00:02:57.080> D<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.790> keep<00:02:58.790> going<00:02:59.030> minor<00:02:59.270> then

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
sharp into a D and keep going minor then

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.210 
sharp into a D and keep going minor then
go<00:02:59.930> major<00:03:00.170> major<00:03:01.090> minor<00:03:02.140> major<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.680> then

go major major minor major and then

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.370 
go major major minor major and then
major<00:03:04.430> again<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:05.300> take<00:03:05.480> us<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.870> octave<00:03:06.260> at

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
major again to take us to the octave at

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.310 
major again to take us to the octave at
fourteenth<00:03:06.800> fret<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:08.170> there<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.290> a

fourteenth fret and there is a

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.220 
fourteenth fret and there is a

harmonized sixth interval run across the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.540 
harmonized sixth interval run across the
neck<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.650> it's<00:03:12.830> very<00:03:13.040> important<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.430> do<00:03:13.519> this

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
neck and it's very important to do this

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.610 
neck and it's very important to do this
of<00:03:13.850> course<00:03:13.880> off<00:03:14.300> of<00:03:14.510> other<00:03:14.660> string<00:03:15.019> sets<00:03:15.320> and

ear to help guide you I also mentioned
there's<00:03:21.080> other<00:03:21.260> kinds<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.620> double<00:03:21.890> stops<00:03:22.070> of

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
there's other kinds of double stops of

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.430 
there's other kinds of double stops of
course<00:03:22.430> there's<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:22.820> know<00:03:22.910> power<00:03:23.209> chords<00:03:23.810> or

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
course there's you know power chords or

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.680 
course there's you know power chords or
fourth<00:03:24.890> intervals<00:03:27.610> so<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:29.090> fourth<00:03:29.420> interval

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
fourth intervals so and fourth interval

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.140 
fourth intervals so and fourth interval
is<00:03:29.900> an<00:03:30.019> inversion<00:03:30.320> of<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.800> power<00:03:31.100> chord<00:03:31.370> fifth

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
is an inversion of a power chord fifth

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.479 
is an inversion of a power chord fifth
interval<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.739> know<00:03:33.830> there's<00:03:34.010> there's

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
interval so you know there's there's

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:35.860 
interval so you know there's there's
other<00:03:34.610> types<00:03:34.850> that<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.209> can<00:03:35.239> work<00:03:35.570> with<00:03:35.720> as

other types that you can work with as

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.800 
other types that you can work with as
well<00:03:35.900> even<00:03:36.260> octaves<00:03:36.709> so<00:03:39.790> any<00:03:40.790> two<00:03:41.060> note<00:03:41.330> chord

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.380 
well even octaves so any two note chord
can<00:03:42.110> be<00:03:42.489> developed<00:03:43.489> into<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.760> double<00:03:44.209> stop

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
can be developed into a double stop

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.960 
can be developed into a double stop
concept<00:03:44.989> to<00:03:45.080> use<00:03:45.200> as<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.709> phrase<00:03:46.040> or<00:03:46.400> use<00:03:46.700> as<00:03:46.940> a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
couple of minutes and the first one is a

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.190 
couple of minutes and the first one is a
nice<00:04:01.160> triplet<00:04:01.610> bass<00:04:01.790> blues<00:04:02.120> idea<00:04:02.390> example

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
nice triplet bass blues idea example

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.190 
nice triplet bass blues idea example
number<00:04:03.380> three<00:04:03.560> goes<00:04:03.860> like<00:04:04.010> this

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.809 

we<00:04:11.200> probably<00:04:11.410> caught<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.830> it's<00:04:12.010> all<00:04:12.190> sixth

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
we probably caught that it's all sixth

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:19.440 
we probably caught that it's all sixth
intervals<00:04:13.240> they're<00:04:17.640> very<00:04:18.640> sweet<00:04:18.880> sounding

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
intervals they're very sweet sounding

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.260 
intervals they're very sweet sounding
lick<00:04:19.660> so<00:04:20.650> let's<00:04:21.250> take<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.430> look<00:04:21.670> at<00:04:21.730> example

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
lick so let's take a look at example

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.970 
lick so let's take a look at example
number<00:04:22.300> four<00:04:22.480> this<00:04:22.960> time<00:04:23.020> I've<00:04:23.500> really<00:04:23.560> got<00:04:23.950> a

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
number four this time I've really got a

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.440 
number four this time I've really got a
mix<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.669> stuff<00:04:24.910> here

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
mix of stuff here

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.970 
mix of stuff here
there's<00:04:25.720> no<00:04:25.810> sixth<00:04:26.110> intervals<00:04:26.440> but<00:04:26.590> it's<00:04:26.740> a

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
there's no sixth intervals but it's a

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.520 
there's no sixth intervals but it's a
major<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.790> minor<00:04:28.000> thirds<00:04:28.510> we've<00:04:29.230> got<00:04:29.410> ideas

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
major and minor thirds we've got ideas

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.159 
major and minor thirds we've got ideas
like<00:04:30.010> perfect<00:04:30.400> fourths<00:04:30.730> and<00:04:30.880> even<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.630> perfect

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
like perfect fourths and even a perfect

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.260 
like perfect fourths and even a perfect
fifth<00:04:32.590> power<00:04:33.070> chord<00:04:33.400> at<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.700> end<00:04:33.850> of<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.090> lick

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
fifth power chord at the end of the lick

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.020 
fifth power chord at the end of the lick
so<00:04:34.900> here's<00:04:35.470> example<00:04:35.650> number<00:04:36.070> four<00:04:36.190> goes<00:04:36.850> like

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
so here's example number four goes like

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:48.930 
so here's example number four goes like
this<00:04:37.210> okay<00:04:46.890> so<00:04:47.890> we<00:04:47.950> started<00:04:48.250> with<00:04:48.340> a<00:04:48.400> third

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
this okay so we started with a third

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.790 
this okay so we started with a third
interval<00:04:49.240> major<00:04:49.480> third<00:04:49.810> up<00:04:49.990> there<00:04:50.200> at<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.560> a

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
interval major third up there at the a

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.120 
interval major third up there at the a
note<00:04:51.100> -<00:04:51.820> a<00:04:51.850> c-sharp<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.860> then<00:04:53.860> we<00:04:53.950> went

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
note - a c-sharp and then we went

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.720 
note - a c-sharp and then we went
through<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.340> nice<00:04:54.490> triplet<00:04:55.000> phrase<00:04:55.330> there

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
through a nice triplet phrase there

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.370 
through a nice triplet phrase there
ending<00:04:57.730> on<00:04:57.850> a<00:04:57.880> major<00:04:58.150> third<00:04:58.630> and<00:04:59.110> we<00:04:59.230> did<00:04:59.350> a

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
ending on a major third and we did a

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.790 
ending on a major third and we did a
perfect<00:04:59.620> fourth<00:04:59.950> interval<00:05:01.560> now<00:05:02.560> we<00:05:02.650> got<00:05:02.770> a

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
perfect fourth interval now we got a

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.860 
perfect fourth interval now we got a
diminished<00:05:03.280> power<00:05:03.970> chord<00:05:04.650> and<00:05:06.600> nice<00:05:07.600> hammer

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
diminished power chord and nice hammer

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.400 
diminished power chord and nice hammer
on<00:05:08.110> line<00:05:08.380> they're<00:05:08.620> going<00:05:08.830> minor<00:05:09.190> major<00:05:09.460> third

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
on line they're going minor major third

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.870 
on line they're going minor major third
ending<00:05:11.410> on<00:05:11.890> a<00:05:11.950> power<00:05:12.160> chord<00:05:12.430> again<00:05:12.550> so<00:05:12.729> that's

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
ending on a power chord again so that's

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.490 
ending on a power chord again so that's
a<00:05:13.000> really<00:05:13.360> cool<00:05:13.540> idea<00:05:13.600> and<00:05:14.020> we've<00:05:14.169> got<00:05:14.260> a<00:05:14.290> real

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
a really cool idea and we've got a real

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.280 
a really cool idea and we've got a real
mix<00:05:14.800> of<00:05:15.070> them<00:05:15.220> in<00:05:16.090> that<00:05:16.330> particular<00:05:16.660> lick<00:05:17.080> as

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
mix of them in that particular lick as

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.620 
mix of them in that particular lick as
well<00:05:17.530> now<00:05:18.010> let's<00:05:18.060> go<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.120> our<00:05:19.210> last<00:05:19.419> example

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
well now let's go to our last example

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.480 
well now let's go to our last example
example<00:05:20.290> number<00:05:20.320> five<00:05:20.800> where<00:05:21.190> I've<00:05:21.310> got<00:05:21.460> some

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
example number five where I've got some

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.760 
example number five where I've got some
double<00:05:22.060> stop<00:05:22.450> bands<00:05:22.870> down<00:05:23.169> with<00:05:23.350> double<00:05:23.620> stop

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
double stop bands down with double stop

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.260 
double stop bands down with double stop
bends<00:05:24.010> you're<00:05:24.220> hitting<00:05:24.550> two<00:05:24.790> notes<00:05:25.030> together

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
bends you're hitting two notes together

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.140 
bends you're hitting two notes together
and<00:05:25.600> obviously<00:05:25.930> you're<00:05:26.050> bending<00:05:26.290> one<00:05:26.590> of<00:05:26.680> them

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
and obviously you're bending one of them

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.640 
and obviously you're bending one of them
so<00:05:28.150> you<00:05:28.270> do<00:05:28.390> it<00:05:28.479> on<00:05:28.570> the<00:05:28.600> first<00:05:29.169> and<00:05:29.380> second

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
so you do it on the first and second

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.740 
so you do it on the first and second
strings<00:05:29.940> you<00:05:30.940> do<00:05:31.060> it<00:05:31.180> on<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.390> third<00:05:31.570> and

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
strings you do it on the third and

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.960 
strings you do it on the third and
second<00:05:32.380> string<00:05:32.590> so<00:05:32.770> you<00:05:32.860> do<00:05:32.979> it<00:05:33.070> on<00:05:33.130> any<00:05:33.310> pair

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
second string so you do it on any pair

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.210 
second string so you do it on any pair
long<00:05:34.660> as<00:05:34.840> you<00:05:34.960> can<00:05:35.140> get<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:35.530> right<00:05:35.650> pitches<00:05:36.070> in

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
long as you can get the right pitches in

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:44.000 
long as you can get the right pitches in
your<00:05:36.340> bends<00:05:36.700> so<00:05:37.240> here's<00:05:37.900> example<00:05:38.080> number<00:05:38.710> five

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.860 

so<00:05:45.010> nice<00:05:45.190> simple<00:05:45.400> bluesy<00:05:46.090> lick<00:05:46.300> there<00:05:46.540> I'm

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
so nice simple bluesy lick there I'm

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.780 
so nice simple bluesy lick there I'm
doing<00:05:47.140> a<00:05:47.200> band<00:05:47.440> on<00:05:47.650> the<00:05:47.770> eighth<00:05:47.890> fret<00:05:48.220> a<00:05:48.340> second

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
doing a band on the eighth fret a second

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.990 
doing a band on the eighth fret a second
string<00:05:49.090> trying<00:05:49.570> to<00:05:49.630> pull<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.050> upwards<00:05:50.910> from<00:05:51.910> a

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
string trying to pull it upwards from a

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.310 
string trying to pull it upwards from a
basically<00:05:52.750> G<00:05:52.990> to<00:05:53.169> an<00:05:53.260> A<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:54.430> then<00:05:55.419> hitting<00:05:56.229> it

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
basically G to an A and then hitting it

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.540 
basically G to an A and then hitting it
normally<00:05:56.680> so<00:05:56.830> we<00:05:56.950> get<00:05:57.070> a<00:05:57.100> little<00:05:57.220> bit<00:05:57.400> of

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
normally so we get a little bit of

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.879 
normally so we get a little bit of
dissonance<00:05:58.060> there

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
dissonance there

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.409 
dissonance there
go<00:06:00.039> to<00:06:00.099> a<00:06:00.189> fourth<00:06:00.490> interval<00:06:03.090> and<00:06:04.090> I<00:06:04.150> got<00:06:04.300> that

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
go to a fourth interval and I got that

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.350 
go to a fourth interval and I got that
nice<00:06:04.629> mix<00:06:04.960> there<00:06:05.699> so<00:06:06.699> you<00:06:06.789> get<00:06:06.879> that<00:06:07.000> minor

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
nice mix there so you get that minor

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.240 
nice mix there so you get that minor
third<00:06:07.689> major<00:06:07.930> third<00:06:08.319> important<00:06:08.770> element<00:06:09.129> of

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
third major third important element of
