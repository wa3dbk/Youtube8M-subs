00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.140 
feel and I think of it as part of this
whole<00:01:38.640> idea<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.229> 2014<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.700> rebirth

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
whole idea that 2014 is the rebirth

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.560 
whole idea that 2014 is the rebirth
right<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.710> start<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.280> Mayan<00:01:44.820> 5000

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
right it is the start of this Mayan 5000

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.020 
right it is the start of this Mayan 5000
plus<00:01:45.659> cycle<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:47.009> think<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.520> sort<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.850> need

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
plus cycle and I think you sort of need

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.940 
plus cycle and I think you sort of need
to<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.390> where<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.810> are<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.409> how<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.649> feel

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
about it before you can actually jump

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.319 
about it before you can actually jump
into<00:01:52.290> something<00:01:52.710> new<00:01:52.920> water<00:01:53.640> has<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> lot<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.119> do

about<00:02:04.860> self-trust<00:02:05.700> water<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.719> about<00:02:06.930> trust

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
about self-trust water is about trust

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.830 
about self-trust water is about trust
but<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.250> project<00:02:08.429> trust<00:02:08.940> out<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.720> know

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
but if you project trust out you know

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.370 
but if you project trust out you know
which<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.289> say<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:11.190> to

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
which is to say I have to

somehow control you so that I can trust
you<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.730> doesn't<00:02:16.600> work<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:17.020> never<00:02:17.170> works

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
you that doesn't work it never works

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.100 
you that doesn't work it never works
what<00:02:17.800> are<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.150> negative<00:02:19.360> aspect<00:02:19.990> of

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
what are the the negative aspect of

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.840 
what are the the negative aspect of
water<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.800> projecting<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.430> out<00:02:21.610> onto

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
water is the projecting it out onto

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.390 
water is the projecting it out onto
someone<00:02:22.270> else<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.690> mean<00:02:23.080> when<00:02:23.470> Pisces<00:02:23.890> projects

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
someone else I mean when Pisces projects

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.280 
someone else I mean when Pisces projects
any<00:02:24.700> water<00:02:25.030> sign<00:02:25.300> when<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.570> projects<00:02:25.960> itself

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
any water sign when it projects itself

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.860 
any water sign when it projects itself
out<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:27.340> capable<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:28.030> doing<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.360> lot<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.540> harm

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
out it's capable of doing a lot of harm

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.860 
out it's capable of doing a lot of harm
right<00:02:29.770> but<00:02:30.190> when<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.820> understand<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.600> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
right but when you understand that the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.030 
right but when you understand that the
only<00:02:31.900> person<00:02:32.260> in<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.530> world<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.830> don't

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
only person in the world you don't

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.590 
only person in the world you don't
really<00:02:33.190> have<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.520> trust<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:33.910> yourself<00:02:34.030> and

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
really have to trust is yourself and

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.320 
really have to trust is yourself and
then<00:02:35.110> you'll<00:02:35.230> be<00:02:35.290> able<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.740> evaluate<00:02:36.370> whether

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
then you'll be able to evaluate whether

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.180 
then you'll be able to evaluate whether
who<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:37.960> know<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.110> can<00:02:38.320> talk<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.560> or<00:02:38.830> not

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
who you know you can talk to or not

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.480 
who you know you can talk to or not
and<00:02:39.730> then<00:02:40.210> what<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.570> becomes<00:02:40.930> it's<00:02:41.140> true<00:02:41.500> you

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
and then what it becomes it's true you

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.360 
and then what it becomes it's true you
know<00:02:42.610> potential<00:02:43.290> hmm<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.650> we'll<00:02:45.160> see<00:02:45.340> more

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
know potential hmm and we'll see more

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.770 
know potential hmm and we'll see more
and<00:02:45.730> more<00:02:45.880> people<00:02:46.090> going<00:02:46.390> through<00:02:46.660> that

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
and more people going through that

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.540 
and more people going through that
process<00:02:47.020> yes<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.770> we'll<00:02:47.860> probably<00:02:48.070> see<00:02:48.310> the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
process yes and we'll probably see the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.860 
process yes and we'll probably see the
opposite<00:02:49.000> -<00:02:49.150> we'll<00:02:49.330> see<00:02:49.480> more<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.720> more

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
opposite - we'll see more and more

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.710 
opposite - we'll see more and more
people<00:02:50.110> having<00:02:51.360> difficulty<00:02:52.360> where<00:02:52.570> they

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
people having difficulty where they

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.840 
people having difficulty where they
didn't<00:02:53.020> trust<00:02:53.170> themselves<00:02:53.410> right<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.670> that's

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
didn't trust themselves right and that's

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.970 
didn't trust themselves right and that's
great<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.330> mean<00:02:55.480> that's<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.840> learning<00:02:56.230> that's

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
great I mean that's the learning that's

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.050 
great I mean that's the learning that's
the<00:02:57.250> opportunity<00:02:57.880> yeah<00:02:59.340> it's<00:03:00.340> going<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.940> be

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
the opportunity yeah it's going to be

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.390 
the opportunity yeah it's going to be
harder<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.540> harder<00:03:01.720> for<00:03:02.290> people<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.650> stay

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
harder and harder for people to stay

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.210 
harder and harder for people to stay
unconscious<00:03:04.470> really<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.680> just<00:03:05.920> go<00:03:06.070> on

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
unconscious really to just go on

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.690 
unconscious really to just go on
automatic<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:06.970> live<00:03:07.180> their<00:03:07.390> lives<00:03:07.600> because

all<00:04:01.060> there<00:04:01.690> was<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.840> big<00:04:02.290> move<00:04:02.560> towards<00:04:03.130> that

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
all there was a big move towards that

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.720 
all there was a big move towards that
and<00:04:04.590> perhaps<00:04:05.590> we'll<00:04:06.010> see<00:04:06.040> something<00:04:06.580> like

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
and perhaps we'll see something like

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.780 
and perhaps we'll see something like
that<00:04:06.940> as<00:04:07.150> well<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:07.600> 2013<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.950> could<00:04:09.459> see<00:04:09.640> that

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
that as well in 2013 I could see that

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.510 
that as well in 2013 I could see that
being<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.180> very<00:04:10.209> big<00:04:10.600> and<00:04:11.470> music<00:04:11.950> being<00:04:12.160> a<00:04:12.250> part

being a very big and music being a part

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.430 
being a very big and music being a part
of<00:04:12.610> it<00:04:12.760> music<00:04:13.180> would<00:04:13.300> be<00:04:13.330> great<00:04:13.630> yeah<00:04:14.020> because

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
of it music would be great yeah because

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.690 
of it music would be great yeah because
it<00:04:14.680> is<00:04:14.709> water<00:04:15.130> music<00:04:15.580> art<00:04:16.560> I<00:04:17.560> can't<00:04:18.400> help<00:04:18.580> but

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
it is water music art I can't help but

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.950 
it is water music art I can't help but
think<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:21.100> think<00:04:21.520> about<00:04:21.880> how<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.330> the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
think that I think about how the the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.070 
think that I think about how the the
internet<00:04:23.410> really<00:04:23.710> spread

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
internet really spread

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.070 
internet really spread
with<00:04:25.520> Neptune<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.729> Aquarius<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.659> mean<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:27.990> think

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
with Neptune and Aquarius I mean I think

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.890 
with Neptune and Aquarius I mean I think
Uranus<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.740> Aquarius<00:04:29.220> was<00:04:29.370> huge<00:04:29.699> but<00:04:30.449> it<00:04:30.690> was

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
Uranus and Aquarius was huge but it was

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.339 
Uranus and Aquarius was huge but it was
really<00:04:31.110> Neptune<00:04:31.740> that<00:04:31.979> made<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.840> internet

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
really Neptune that made the internet

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.860 
really Neptune that made the internet
just<00:04:35.069> a<00:04:35.190> part<00:04:35.490> of<00:04:35.580> everything<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.360> everyone

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
just a part of everything and everyone

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.559 
just a part of everything and everyone
that<00:04:37.860> made<00:04:38.250> it<00:04:38.400> obvious<00:04:38.879> that<00:04:38.909> we<00:04:39.330> have

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
that made it obvious that we have

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.589 
that made it obvious that we have
manifested<00:04:40.379> this<00:04:40.590> Web<00:04:40.949> right<00:04:41.669> yes<00:04:41.940> humanity

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
manifested this Web right yes humanity

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.469 
manifested this Web right yes humanity
we've<00:04:42.750> manifested<00:04:43.440> this<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:44.360> there<00:04:45.360> was<00:04:45.449> a

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
we've manifested this and there was a

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.680 
we've manifested this and there was a
there's<00:04:45.900> now<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.110> pervasiveness<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:48.060> many

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
there's now a pervasiveness that many

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.839 
there's now a pervasiveness that many
people<00:04:48.870> don't<00:04:49.139> even<00:04:49.289> realize<00:04:49.849> we're

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
people don't even realize we're

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.659 
people don't even realize we're
literally<00:04:51.120> swimming<00:04:51.690> in<00:04:52.039> you<00:04:53.039> know<00:04:53.099> we're<00:04:53.460> in

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
literally swimming in you know we're in

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.779 
literally swimming in you know we're in
the<00:04:54.349> microwaves<00:04:55.349> or<00:04:55.620> whatever<00:04:55.889> that<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:56.639> know

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
the microwaves or whatever that you know

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.270 
the microwaves or whatever that you know
run<00:04:57.539> it<00:04:57.690> right<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.469> so<00:04:58.590> with<00:04:58.770> that<00:04:58.919> grand

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
run it right and so with that grand

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.119 
run it right and so with that grand
trine<00:04:59.759> I<00:05:00.270> can't<00:05:00.930> help<00:05:01.020> but<00:05:01.169> think<00:05:01.469> that<00:05:01.710> that

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
trine I can't help but think that that

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.399 
trine I can't help but think that that
is<00:05:02.550> also<00:05:03.120> going<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.419> be<00:05:03.509> something<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:04.080> is

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
is also going to be something that is

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.689 
is also going to be something that is
heightened<00:05:05.310> or<00:05:05.490> emphasized<00:05:06.120> in<00:05:06.449> some<00:05:06.659> way

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
heightened or emphasized in some way

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.860 
heightened or emphasized in some way
this<00:05:08.699> virtual<00:05:09.330> world<00:05:09.659> the<00:05:10.319> challenge<00:05:11.219> will<00:05:11.490> be

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
this virtual world the challenge will be

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.589 
this virtual world the challenge will be
will<00:05:12.870> it<00:05:12.900> rise<00:05:13.669> will<00:05:14.669> it<00:05:14.789> raise<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.210> level<00:05:15.509> of

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
will it rise will it raise the level of

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.119 
will it rise will it raise the level of
compassion<00:05:16.020> on<00:05:16.319> the<00:05:16.440> planet<00:05:16.800> which<00:05:17.099> is

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
compassion on the planet which is

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.730 
compassion on the planet which is
totally<00:05:17.669> possible<00:05:17.810> especially<00:05:18.810> once<00:05:19.289> Jupiter

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
totally possible especially once Jupiter

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.980 
totally possible especially once Jupiter
goes<00:05:19.889> into<00:05:20.190> cancer<00:05:20.400> will<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.330> raise<00:05:21.479> the<00:05:21.690> level

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
goes into cancer will it raise the level

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.320 
goes into cancer will it raise the level
of<00:05:22.080> compassion<00:05:22.440> for<00:05:23.280> us<00:05:23.430> for<00:05:23.729> ourselves<00:05:23.849> and

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
of compassion for us for ourselves and

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.830 
of compassion for us for ourselves and
each<00:05:24.389> other<00:05:24.659> or<00:05:25.229> not<00:05:25.940> because<00:05:26.940> if<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:27.569> water

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
each other or not because if the water

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.010 
each other or not because if the water
is<00:05:28.169> only<00:05:28.919> about<00:05:29.279> projection<00:05:30.029> it's<00:05:30.240> cruel

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
is only about projection it's cruel

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.680 
is only about projection it's cruel
water<00:05:31.229> is<00:05:31.500> really<00:05:32.219> nasty<00:05:32.400> if<00:05:32.909> it's<00:05:33.479> about

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
water is really nasty if it's about

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.260 
water is really nasty if it's about
projection<00:05:34.319> right<00:05:34.889> because<00:05:35.310> it's<00:05:35.789> very<00:05:36.000> basic

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
projection right because it's very basic

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.019 
projection right because it's very basic
how<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.750> works<00:05:36.960> it's<00:05:37.259> like<00:05:37.469> if<00:05:37.949> waters<00:05:38.819> about

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:39.029 
how it works it's like if waters about

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:40.339 
how it works it's like if waters about
feelings<00:05:39.509> so<00:05:39.690> if<00:05:39.779> I<00:05:39.840> don't<00:05:40.020> want<00:05:40.139> to<00:05:40.199> feel

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
feelings so if I don't want to feel

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.680 
feelings so if I don't want to feel
something<00:05:40.860> then<00:05:41.400> I<00:05:41.430> project<00:05:41.729> it<00:05:42.029> onto<00:05:42.210> you<00:05:42.509> and

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
something then I project it onto you and

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.209 
something then I project it onto you and
I<00:05:42.750> make<00:05:42.930> you<00:05:42.960> feel<00:05:43.319> it<00:05:43.529> and<00:05:43.710> then<00:05:43.860> I<00:05:43.889> feel<00:05:44.190> like

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
I make you feel it and then I feel like

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.640 
I make you feel it and then I feel like
I'm<00:05:44.490> not<00:05:44.699> feeling<00:05:45.060> it<00:05:45.240> so<00:05:45.659> I<00:05:45.690> hurt<00:05:45.990> you<00:05:46.139> so<00:05:46.380> you

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.080 
I'm not feeling it so I hurt you so you
feel<00:05:46.949> the<00:05:47.130> pain<00:05:47.340> and<00:05:47.550> then<00:05:47.669> I<00:05:47.699> feel<00:05:47.940> like<00:05:48.060> I

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
feel the pain and then I feel like I

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
feel the pain and then I feel like I
don't<00:05:48.270> have<00:05:48.449> to<00:05:48.599> hurt<00:05:48.750> you

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
don't have to hurt you

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.649 
don't have to hurt you
I<00:05:49.139> wouldn't<00:05:49.590> do<00:05:49.680> that<00:05:49.710> but<00:05:50.400> that's<00:05:50.940> how<00:05:51.389> water

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
I wouldn't do that but that's how water

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.680 
I wouldn't do that but that's how water
works<00:05:51.779> when<00:05:52.169> it's<00:05:52.319> negative<00:05:52.550> right<00:05:53.550> so<00:05:53.879> that

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
works when it's negative right so that

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.439 
works when it's negative right so that
is<00:05:55.020> the<00:05:55.500> that's<00:05:56.190> what<00:05:56.430> we're<00:05:56.580> being<00:05:56.819> presented

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
is the that's what we're being presented

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.570 
is the that's what we're being presented
with<00:05:57.479> and<00:05:57.960> just<00:05:58.409> like<00:05:58.620> in<00:05:58.770> a<00:05:58.860> personal<00:05:59.370> life

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
with and just like in a personal life

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.279 
with and just like in a personal life
that<00:06:00.000> when<00:06:00.210> we<00:06:00.539> suffer<00:06:00.889> we<00:06:01.889> open<00:06:02.610> up<00:06:02.909> we<00:06:03.629> become

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
that when we suffer we open up we become

we go through because we all go through
stuff<00:06:11.190> I<00:06:11.629> think<00:06:12.629> that's<00:06:12.810> what<00:06:13.080> I<00:06:13.259> feel<00:06:13.620> the

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
stuff I think that's what I feel the

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.670 
stuff I think that's what I feel the
world<00:06:14.039> is<00:06:14.460> going<00:06:14.909> to<00:06:14.940> be<00:06:15.210> facing<00:06:15.479> and<00:06:15.930> I

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
world is going to be facing and I

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.800 
world is going to be facing and I
because<00:06:17.580> of<00:06:17.699> Uranus<00:06:18.120> and<00:06:18.240> Pluto<00:06:18.330> on<00:06:18.719> the

because of Uranus and Pluto on the

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.140 
because of Uranus and Pluto on the
outside<00:06:19.229> I<00:06:19.560> think<00:06:20.310> it<00:06:20.520> will<00:06:20.639> require<00:06:21.000> a

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
outside I think it will require a

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.659 
outside I think it will require a
certain<00:06:21.629> amount<00:06:21.810> of<00:06:21.930> rebellion<00:06:22.440> and<00:06:22.710> and<00:06:23.129> you
