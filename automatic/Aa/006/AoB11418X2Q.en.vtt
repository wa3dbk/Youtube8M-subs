00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.830
 and it really is a pleasure when we can 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.950
 move forward with the decoration of the house 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.590
 ximena dose and also power over 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.799
 Leather leatherette or any kind of 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.590
 material any material on fabric 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.890
 also here in this moment 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.930
 we work with corina and we paint you can 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.510
 paint all this kind of thickness 6 there 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.460
 different colors there are different colors 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.830
 you have a whole line that is more for 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.860
 graffiti that comes with bone are like 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.750
 rossi in three different types of line 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.090
 and then you have the milk spray from the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.240
 common line and soon to see more things 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.730
 about grams but we are waiting but 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.580
 good to my table soon soon how many already 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.920
 more things are going to come out and then also 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.480
 is to be frosted on glass 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.790
 we have done a lot already know 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.400
 youtube on our channel there are a lot 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.530
 of works to renovate the house the 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.720
 objects on different surfaces and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.700
 materials so remember between the 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.820
 hands to work you see youtube and search 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.900
 painting in the reason that adducts and there 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.990
 I was all those who started well 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.570
 we are going to incite all the part that does not 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.729
 we want you to mess it all 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.070
 part of the seat because the seat 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.020
 let's preserve it blank like this 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.650
 it is then all this we are going to go 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.880
 leaving 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.159
 well curb 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.969
 and we're going to try to cover the biggest 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.159
 amount of surface with the tape but 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.500
 The other thing we can do is also 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.079
 put a diary here above or a sheet 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.679
 of diary and with that we also cover 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.679
 the whole area 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:49.220
 and it's covering and then what I did 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.220
 with this was to put tape 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.490
 well and I was building triangles 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.220
 and what we have to take into account is 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.720
 that the tape sticks well and adheres 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.970
 well because because if this is a 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.870
 little bit raised the paint gets through 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.750
 down and we tipped it a bit to go 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.650
 hitting the tape better and what we're going to 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.620
 go doing they are triangles to this one goes to us 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.600
 to be more comfortable to work and 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.260
 let's do like this 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.060
 A) Yes 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.340
 and what we have to take into account is 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.099
 that the triangles that the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.349
 tape is well attached and so let's go 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.040
 working all the football is 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.040
 our only 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.670
 so that it is perfect for you 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.489
 that is perfectly stuck because if 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.829
 it is not very well stuck do not decide 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.290
 the paint is then placed underneath 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.599
 directly, everything will be left 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.730
 stuck and so we're doing all the pop 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.530
 with all the tapes if they want to know 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.500
 we will be able to do a little more here 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.500
 we have time cachito here 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.750
 we take off well and it is doing all the 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.439
 waxed after they can play with 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.829
 Stencil with tape with whatever you want there 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.829
 is 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.010
 and what I did was to paint this point for 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:25.590
 guys with colors like pink violet 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.590
 lila then I was applying like this 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.459
 and the colors 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.330
 there is that if I have not changed it does not come out 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:38.560
 the color then you have to remove it well 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.560
 so that the color comes out 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:48.870
 there with rose this later I put him lilac 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.120
 to go playing a bit I go spraying 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.190
 paint like this and now they will see what 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.430
 let's read and now I put a color a 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.740
 little darker like the violet for 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.990
 play a little with everything that light and 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.850
 shades 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.010
 and what he was also doing was 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.410
 applying to this so that it forms a 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.410
 texture a leaf 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:17.410
 then when he got up with a 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:20.230
 spectacular texture and there it is 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.710
 and I have a texture all on the bus and 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.930
 so I'm going to do all the rest that 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.520
 follow now what we have to do is 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.860
 carefully take out the tape like this 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.260
 everything we were putting that is not 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.910
 you have to wait for it to dry and directly 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:42.040
 let's take out the tape then 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.700
 and we can go spinning a bit so that 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.060
 we'll see it there, there it is 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.510
 down a little bit we are turning and we are going 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.030
 seeing how not 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.030
 is barbarous I loved it 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.070
 and let's have the puff finish 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.070
 barabbas 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.160
 we were thinking what to give them for 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.770
 you for the next let's think 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.600
 because chairs people say as a branch 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.430
 a chair, so let's go and see 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.680
 for the next idea than we were 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.840
 bring more measures so they can do 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.680
 at home we continue thanks 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.680
 doing laser
