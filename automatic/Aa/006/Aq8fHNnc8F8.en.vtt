00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:09.010
 hello friends on youtube 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.139
 as it says relocate good friends in 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.570
 this video I 'm going to tell you what the 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.290
 last algorithm 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.290
 the cube 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.060
 there is what the last algorithm 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.340
 in this q 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.340
 nothing else is said to them but they are not 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.730
 You can say but you can not teach us 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.989
 forgiveness and consists of this which does not 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.860
 comes out in 3 x 3 these are two cases and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.490
 is this one 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:47.680
 it's almost the whole cross except this 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.680
 and this is another 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.800
 that can also leave you 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.040
 what is this 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.040
 ys 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.850
 is the center and the list for what I 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.549
 I recommend them is that 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.790
 make the movement in which you already know 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:19.540
 of the beginner method as I can 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.280
 be the cross and that will come out this and 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.369
 what we are going to do with this algorithm 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.479
 what I am going to tell you and teach is to turn 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.940
 these pieces by flipping those pieces 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.250
 let's have the cross and throwing everything 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.320
 that is going to dictate capital will 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.720
 there are exceptions that are going to be master 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.190
 but the ones you tell them to do 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.140
 that will be good capital all 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.530
 I repeat all were capital letters 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.060
 we started 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.060
 master twice 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.390
 of not seeing twice 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.770
 and twice 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.390
 l master twice once sorry 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.550
 twice 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.550
 r prima master once 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.670
 twice 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.110
 r master once 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.110
 and twice 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.030
 s twice 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.819
 r master once 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.560
 efe twice 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.040
 the first master once 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.879
 go twice 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.020
 r master twice 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.270
 and well that would be the whole algorithm 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.040
 what would be doing this is yours 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.040
 decision here 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.760
 here may have come out this the ele 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.430
 who already know how to do it could have 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.030
 come out the 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.760
 the line itself or as I told them 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.760
 the complete cross may have already come out 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:27.190
 there is the complete cross 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.610
 well that was all like to subscribe and 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.610
 see you later
