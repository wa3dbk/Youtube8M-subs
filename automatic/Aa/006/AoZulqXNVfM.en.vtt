00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.169
 Let's talk about color. 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.740
 I'll take a circle. 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.039
 I'll show you what happens if you write wrongly when you use colors. 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.209
 I'll write a dark color. 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.109
 It gives off color. 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:26.359
 And a bright spot .. 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.119
 Good. 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.039
 Darkness 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.260
 And reflected light 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.460
 It's been bad since. In particular, 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.210
 I hope not. 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.560
 Uh, of course, there is a picture that is written in a simple way. 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.510
 Once you're neat, 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.559
 Give it to me here. 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.750
 Move it downwards. 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.790
 Please turn the screen back here. Up to 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.150
 After you lightly 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.170
 OK and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.250
 Give me a shadow. 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.610
 A little darker color 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.720
 I knew it 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.869
 Please put the color while rotating the screen. 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.369
 So what happens to the bright spot? 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.110
 It's the same. 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.320
 Please change it brightly. 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 Please change this and finally, 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.870
 I'll lightly light out Yogi a little more. 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.410
 Now, 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.860
 The colors are changing a bit like this, right? What does that mean 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.780
 On the right side of the work, he is very light, 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.000
 It looks hard. When I use color, I just want to scroll 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.630
 If you use only up and down, 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.720
 What do you do with this while mixing? 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.900
 It was red. I'll try it in blue as well as this theory. 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.510
 Green is fine, too. Blue is okay. 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.870
 When I used bright colors, did I go to the yellow side? 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.600
 It's the same. Here it goes down. 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.259
 First, I paint the dark color first. 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.889
 Dark color look. Upper purple side 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.939
 It's too purple to move slightly. 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.889
 I'll just give you a little. 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.930
 So lightly in a light blue color 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.399
 I hope you use it. 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:29.429
 So here's the gradient 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.259
 Free yourself. 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:36.299
 After lightly shining in a light color with a yellow feel 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.739
 Please put the contrast 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.529
 Now, and finally the reflected light 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:47.999
 If you do this a little more richly in color 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:48.499
 Can be used.
