story and track him down and extract
information<00:00:24.510> from<00:00:24.810> him<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.350> he's<00:00:26.010> embedded<00:00:26.369> in

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
information from him so he's embedded in

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.060 
information from him so he's embedded in
this<00:00:26.789> environment<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.070> militia

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
this environment with a militia

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.279 
this environment with a militia
surrounding<00:00:29.640> him<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.779> thing<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.019> think<00:00:31.109> is

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
surrounding him so the thing I think is

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.560 
surrounding him so the thing I think is
really<00:00:31.349> unique<00:00:31.920> about<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.279> level<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.759> we're

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
really unique about the level that we're

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.120 
really unique about the level that we're
kind<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.840> new<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.500> game<00:00:34.710> would<00:00:34.920> be

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
kind of new to in this game would be

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.799 
kind of new to in this game would be
going<00:00:35.489> through<00:00:35.670> an<00:00:35.730> environment<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.510> having

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
going through an environment and having

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.660 
going through an environment and having
the<00:00:36.899> feeling<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.350> early<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.370> level

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the feeling of early on in the level

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
the feeling of early on in the level
running<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.690> danger<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.410> watching<00:00:40.829> all<00:00:40.950> these

running to danger and watching all these

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.740 
running to danger and watching all these
people<00:00:41.309> run<00:00:41.640> away<00:00:41.760> from<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.480> really

so<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.549> step<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.060> single<00:01:57.360> player<00:01:57.570> you

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
so if you step in a single player you

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.920 
so if you step in a single player you
can<00:01:58.380> expect<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.860> see<00:01:59.130> Arctic<00:01:59.750> weapons<00:02:00.750> that

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
are weapons that match the environment

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.149 
are weapons that match the environment
they're<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:04.290> plays<00:02:04.560> into<00:02:04.799> spec

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
they're in and that that plays into spec

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.830 
they're in and that that plays into spec

and<00:02:21.670> expanded<00:02:22.420> on<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.930> two-man<00:02:23.440> team

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
and expanded on that so a two-man team

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.390 
and expanded on that so a two-man team
like<00:02:24.190> buddy<00:02:24.430> system<00:02:24.700> goin<00:02:25.690> through<00:02:26.160> game<00:02:27.160> mode

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
like buddy system goin through game mode

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.830 
like buddy system goin through game mode
that<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.670> entirely<00:02:28.090> separate<00:02:28.720> from

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
that is entirely separate from

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.240 
that is entirely separate from
single-player<00:02:29.410> just<00:02:29.680> completely<00:02:30.070> different

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
single-player just completely different

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.050 
single-player just completely different
so<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.940> sits<00:02:31.630> on<00:02:31.750> its<00:02:31.900> own<00:02:32.050> as<00:02:32.260> its<00:02:32.410> own<00:02:33.060> almost

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
so it sits on its own as its own almost

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.120 
so it sits on its own as its own almost
a<00:02:34.180> third<00:02:34.390> game<00:02:34.720> within<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.200> box<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:35.920> can

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
a third game within the box so you can

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.490 
a third game within the box so you can
go<00:02:36.310> through<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.700> can<00:02:36.880> play<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.090> solo<00:02:37.810> you

by<00:03:07.480> level<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.860> way<00:03:09.010> we<00:03:09.160> designed<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.700> was<00:03:09.940> we

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
by level the way we designed it was we

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.090 
by level the way we designed it was we
have<00:03:10.870> these<00:03:11.020> specific<00:03:11.470> challenge<00:03:11.800> is<00:03:11.860> built

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
have these specific challenge is built

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.090 
have these specific challenge is built
into<00:03:12.250> spec<00:03:12.490> up<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:12.940> we<00:03:13.600> would<00:03:13.810> usually<00:03:13.990> add<00:03:14.560> in

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
into spec up so we would usually add in

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.950 
into spec up so we would usually add in
the<00:03:15.220> right<00:03:15.400> arsenal<00:03:15.910> or<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.150> right<00:03:16.300> tools<00:03:16.630> to

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
the right arsenal or the right tools to

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.200 
the right arsenal or the right tools to
put<00:03:17.530> them<00:03:17.620> in<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.890> environment<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:18.730> there's

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
put them in the environment so there's

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.970 
put them in the environment so there's
even<00:03:19.450> equipment<00:03:19.750> from<00:03:20.080> multiplayer<00:03:20.680> that'll

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
even equipment from multiplayer that'll

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.160 
even equipment from multiplayer that'll
show<00:03:21.130> up<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.370> spec<00:03:21.610> ops<00:03:21.820> becomes<00:03:22.270> very<00:03:23.050> very

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
show up in spec ops becomes very very

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.170 
show up in spec ops becomes very very
handy<00:03:23.770> so<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:24.250> can't<00:03:24.550> mention<00:03:24.730> what<00:03:24.940> they<00:03:25.060> are

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
handy so I can't mention what they are

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.600 
handy so I can't mention what they are

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
but you can look around the environment

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.820
