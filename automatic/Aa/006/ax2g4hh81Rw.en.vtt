that I've actually know what to expect

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.249 
that I've actually know what to expect
but<00:01:49.560> hopefully<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.340> quite<00:01:50.579> well<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.110> this<00:01:52.110> is

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
but hopefully do quite well and this is

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.630 
but hopefully do quite well and this is
your<00:01:52.380> first<00:01:52.590> time<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.040> experience<00:01:53.340> first

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
your first time at the experience first

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.010 
your first time at the experience first
time<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.030> coal<00:01:54.240> duty<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.720> what<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:54.960> you

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
time we have coal duty for what do you

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.749 
time we have coal duty for what do you
think<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> event<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.740> far<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.159> think<00:01:56.399> is

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
think of the event so far I think is

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.069 
think of the event so far I think is
actually<00:01:56.909> very<00:01:57.119> well<00:01:57.479> organized<00:01:57.899> and

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
actually very well organized and

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.020 
actually very well organized and
actually<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.920> schedule<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.790> some

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
actually on schedule and like some

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.219 
actually on schedule and like some
events<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.479> we've<00:02:00.600> been<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.079> its<00:02:01.170> really

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
events that we've been to and its really

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.080 
events that we've been to and its really
actually<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.189> emotive<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.670> actually<00:02:02.909> being

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
actually the emotive and actually being

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.999 
actually the emotive and actually being
delayed<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:03.960> two<00:02:03.990> hours<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.799> stupid

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
delayed for two hours it's just stupid

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.150 
delayed for two hours it's just stupid
so<00:02:05.700> I'd<00:02:05.759> say<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.090> good<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160
