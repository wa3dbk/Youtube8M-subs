freedom<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:09.250> kind<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.490> comes<00:02:09.640> with<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:10.030> you

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
freedom that kind of comes with it you

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.660 
freedom that kind of comes with it you
know<00:02:10.179> my<00:02:10.300> parents<00:02:10.509> are<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:11.290> little<00:02:11.590> bit<00:02:11.860> less<00:02:12.130> or

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
know my parents are a little bit less or

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.760 
know my parents are a little bit less or
a<00:02:12.730> little<00:02:13.000> bit<00:02:13.120> more<00:02:13.300> lenient

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
a little bit more lenient

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.250 
a little bit more lenient
and<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.340> kind<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.030> nice<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.510> just<00:02:16.810> be<00:02:16.900> able<00:02:17.080> to

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
and it's kind of nice to just be able to

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.800 
and it's kind of nice to just be able to
not<00:02:17.740> have<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.070> do<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.580> know<00:02:18.700> mate<00:02:18.970> makeup<00:02:19.570> work

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
making videos which I've kind of enjoyed

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.330 
making videos which I've kind of enjoyed
but<00:05:54.360> hey<00:05:54.690> I<00:05:54.960> really<00:05:55.620> enjoy<00:05:55.949> doing<00:05:56.129> these

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
but hey I really enjoy doing these

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.879 
but hey I really enjoy doing these
videos<00:05:56.699> too<00:05:56.909> so<00:05:56.940> I<00:05:57.449> don't<00:05:58.259> know<00:05:58.319> we'll<00:05:58.740> see

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
videos too so I don't know we'll see

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.830 
videos too so I don't know we'll see
what<00:05:59.009> happens<00:05:59.430> hopefully<00:05:59.699> I'm<00:06:00.419> a<00:06:00.479> little<00:06:00.750> bit

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
what happens hopefully I'm a little bit

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.879 
what happens hopefully I'm a little bit
more<00:06:01.050> motivated

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
more motivated

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.480 
more motivated
give<00:06:02.849> me<00:06:02.909> some<00:06:03.090> motivation<00:06:03.719> why<00:06:03.990> don't<00:06:04.169> you<00:06:04.490> if

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
give me some motivation why don't you if

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.860 
give me some motivation why don't you if
you<00:06:05.580> want<00:06:05.699> to<00:06:05.729> see<00:06:05.909> more<00:06:06.120> just<00:06:06.389> let<00:06:06.509> me<00:06:06.659> know

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
you want to see more just let me know

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.640 
you want to see more just let me know
cuz<00:06:07.740> I<00:06:08.219> don't<00:06:08.849> know<00:06:09.000> it's<00:06:09.180> not<00:06:09.330> that<00:06:09.479> I'm<00:06:09.569> not

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
cuz I don't know it's not that I'm not

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.149 
cuz I don't know it's not that I'm not
motivated<00:06:10.650> it's<00:06:10.770> just<00:06:11.009> that<00:06:11.250> I<00:06:12.919> guess<00:06:13.919> it's

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
motivated it's just that I guess it's

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:16.600 
motivated it's just that I guess it's
I'm<00:06:14.400> not<00:06:14.610> as<00:06:14.789> motivated<00:06:15.060> as<00:06:15.599> I<00:06:15.779> should<00:06:16.050> be<00:06:16.259> so

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
I'm not as motivated as I should be so

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.170 
I'm not as motivated as I should be so
yeah<00:06:17.610> anyway<00:06:18.509> this<00:06:19.289> is<00:06:19.529> I<00:06:19.830> don't<00:06:20.669> even<00:06:20.909> know

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
yeah anyway this is I don't even know

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.700 
yeah anyway this is I don't even know
this<00:06:21.629> isn't<00:06:21.960> the<00:06:22.080> end<00:06:22.229> of<00:06:22.289> the<00:06:22.349> gameplay

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
this isn't the end of the gameplay

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.830 
this isn't the end of the gameplay
there's<00:06:22.919> like<00:06:23.069> two<00:06:23.250> minutes<00:06:23.400> left<00:06:23.729> so<00:06:24.150> I<00:06:24.449> might

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
there's like two minutes left so I might

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.060 
there's like two minutes left so I might
just<00:06:24.870> end<00:06:25.409> up<00:06:25.590> rambling<00:06:26.279> on<00:06:26.430> or<00:06:27.949> cutting<00:06:28.949> out

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
just end up rambling on or cutting out

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.389 
just end up rambling on or cutting out
this<00:06:29.539> cutting<00:06:30.539> out<00:06:30.630> the<00:06:31.339> commentary<00:06:32.339> or

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:32.399 
this cutting out the commentary or

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:32.810 
this cutting out the commentary or
whatever

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
whatever

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.790 
whatever
but<00:06:32.940> I<00:06:33.150> was<00:06:33.720> gonna<00:06:33.810> call<00:06:33.990> in<00:06:34.110> the<00:06:34.170> slowstar<00:06:34.410> but

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
but I was gonna call in the slowstar but

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.640 
but I was gonna call in the slowstar but
I<00:06:34.830> get<00:06:35.010> EMP<00:06:35.490> nated<00:06:35.910> of<00:06:36.150> course<00:06:36.510> so<00:06:36.990> I<00:06:37.020> can't<00:06:37.410> so

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
I get EMP nated of course so I can't so

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.830 
I get EMP nated of course so I can't so
I<00:06:37.680> just<00:06:37.860> try<00:06:38.100> and<00:06:38.220> go<00:06:38.340> try<00:06:39.270> and<00:06:39.390> go<00:06:39.450> defend<00:06:39.750> the

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
I just try and go try and go defend the

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.780 
I just try and go try and go defend the
headquarters<00:06:40.410> that's<00:06:41.010> what<00:06:41.280> I<00:06:41.310> was<00:06:41.490> trying<00:06:41.730> to

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
headquarters that's what I was trying to

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.490 
headquarters that's what I was trying to
do<00:06:41.970> I<00:06:42.240> think<00:06:42.480> that's<00:06:42.600> a<00:06:42.690> good<00:06:42.840> strategy<00:06:43.080> when

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
do I think that's a good strategy when

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
do I think that's a good strategy when
you<00:06:43.530> when<00:06:43.920> you've<00:06:44.040> captured<00:06:44.280> the

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
you when you've captured the

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.460 
you when you've captured the
headquarters<00:06:45.000> just<00:06:45.090> calling<00:06:45.540> your<00:06:45.690> if<00:06:45.960> you

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
headquarters just calling your if you

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.470 
headquarters just calling your if you
have<00:06:46.650> a<00:06:46.680> kill<00:06:47.580> streak<00:06:47.670> like<00:06:47.940> this<00:06:48.090> like<00:06:48.360> the

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
have a kill streak like this like the

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.540 
have a kill streak like this like the
lowest<00:06:48.780> are<00:06:48.900> VTOL<00:06:49.470> warship<00:06:49.860> or<00:06:50.250> something

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
lowest are VTOL warship or something

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.890 
lowest are VTOL warship or something
like<00:06:50.640> that<00:06:50.700> where<00:06:51.030> you're<00:06:51.180> in<00:06:51.360> it<00:06:51.540> and<00:06:51.720> you

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
like that where you're in it and you

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.810 
like that where you're in it and you
don't<00:06:51.930> move<00:06:52.230> around<00:06:52.500> just<00:06:52.830> go<00:06:53.280> high<00:06:53.490> and<00:06:53.520> then

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:53.820 
don't move around just go high and then

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.520 
don't move around just go high and then
just<00:06:54.090> defend<00:06:54.390> your<00:06:54.510> headquarters<00:06:55.080> as<00:06:55.230> well<00:06:55.410> as

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
just defend your headquarters as well as

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.390 
just defend your headquarters as well as
you<00:06:55.620> can<00:06:55.770> that<00:06:56.010> works<00:06:56.490> a<00:06:56.640> lot<00:06:56.790> for<00:06:56.970> me<00:06:57.150> and<00:06:58.400> yeah

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
you can that works a lot for me and yeah

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.520 
you can that works a lot for me and yeah
so<00:07:00.080> I've<00:07:01.080> been<00:07:01.140> starting<00:07:01.920> to<00:07:01.950> use<00:07:02.250> this<00:07:02.430> FAL

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
so I've been starting to use this FAL

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.070 
so I've been starting to use this FAL
because<00:07:04.530> if<00:07:04.980> you<00:07:05.430> didn't<00:07:05.700> watch<00:07:05.880> that

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 
because if you didn't watch that

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.310 
because if you didn't watch that
competitive<00:07:07.080> stream<00:07:07.470> the<00:07:07.710> UMG<00:07:08.900> optic<00:07:09.900> versus

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320 
competitive stream the UMG optic versus

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.740 
competitive stream the UMG optic versus
complexity<00:07:10.920> stream<00:07:11.600> and<00:07:12.600> then<00:07:14.060> it<00:07:15.060> was<00:07:15.270> it<00:07:15.600> was

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
complexity stream and then it was it was

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.110 
complexity stream and then it was it was
awesome<00:07:16.290> I<00:07:16.470> mean<00:07:16.530> it<00:07:17.460> was<00:07:17.610> just<00:07:17.640> so<00:07:17.940> intense

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 
awesome I mean it was just so intense

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.510 
awesome I mean it was just so intense
and<00:07:18.540> fun<00:07:18.660> to<00:07:18.810> watch<00:07:18.960> but<00:07:19.410> anyway<00:07:20.040> they<00:07:20.220> were<00:07:20.280> a

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 
and fun to watch but anyway they were a

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.310 
and fun to watch but anyway they were a
lot<00:07:20.700> of<00:07:20.730> them<00:07:20.910> reason<00:07:21.390> the<00:07:21.480> FAL<00:07:21.990> with

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.320 
lot of them reason the FAL with

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.150 
lot of them reason the FAL with
select-fire<00:07:23.130> on<00:07:23.490> it<00:07:23.670> and<00:07:24.680> so<00:07:25.680> I<00:07:25.710> tried<00:07:26.040> that

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 
select-fire on it and so I tried that

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.630 
select-fire on it and so I tried that
out<00:07:26.220> and<00:07:26.610> holy<00:07:27.000> cow<00:07:27.570> it's<00:07:28.320> insane<00:07:28.920> you<00:07:29.490> guys

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:29.640 
out and holy cow it's insane you guys

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.170 
out and holy cow it's insane you guys
really<00:07:29.970> need<00:07:30.120> to<00:07:30.240> try<00:07:30.420> it<00:07:30.450> out<00:07:30.660> it's<00:07:31.110> a<00:07:31.790> it's<00:07:32.790> a

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
really need to try it out it's a it's a

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.340 
really need to try it out it's a it's a
little<00:07:33.540> bit<00:07:33.720> of<00:07:33.930> a<00:07:34.020> grind<00:07:34.290> I'll<00:07:34.800> admit<00:07:35.250> to

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:36.350 
little bit of a grind I'll admit to

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.770 
little bit of a grind I'll admit to
actually<00:07:37.940> unlock<00:07:38.940> the<00:07:39.210> select-fire

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:39.780 
actually unlock the select-fire

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.840 
actually unlock the select-fire
but<00:07:40.380> if<00:07:40.470> you<00:07:40.680> just<00:07:40.890> kind<00:07:41.160> of<00:07:41.190> adjust<00:07:41.370> your<00:07:41.670> play

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:41.850 
but if you just kind of adjust your play

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.270 
but if you just kind of adjust your play
style<00:07:42.180> to<00:07:42.570> kind<00:07:42.960> of<00:07:43.020> just<00:07:43.260> more<00:07:43.530> defensive<00:07:44.070> and

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 
style to kind of just more defensive and

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.510 
style to kind of just more defensive and
defending<00:07:45.120> flags<00:07:45.480> is<00:07:46.070> pretty<00:07:47.070> much<00:07:47.190> what<00:07:47.370> I<00:07:47.400> do

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 
defending flags is pretty much what I do
