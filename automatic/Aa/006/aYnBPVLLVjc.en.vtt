Jackson<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.810> Jerry<00:01:31.320> Macklin<00:01:31.740> might<00:01:31.890> have

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
Jackson and Jerry Macklin might have

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.310 
Jackson and Jerry Macklin might have
been<00:01:32.100> better<00:01:32.280> served<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.630> inside<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
slot where they wouldn't have to be

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.490 
slot where they wouldn't have to be
fight<00:01:38.400> off<00:01:38.549> bump-and-run<00:01:39.090> coverage<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.259> this

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
fight off bump-and-run coverage so this

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.230 
fight off bump-and-run coverage so this
guy<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:40.979> strong<00:01:41.310> he'll<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.700> throw<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> guy

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
guy so strong he'll just throw the guy

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.270 
guy so strong he'll just throw the guy
the<00:01:42.299> side<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.960> run<00:01:43.140> down<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.500> sideline<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the side and run down the sideline and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.190 
the side and run down the sideline and
then<00:01:44.759> you'll<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.060> Macklin<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.720> Jackson

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
then you'll have Macklin and Jackson

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.679 
then you'll have Macklin and Jackson
doing<00:01:46.860> crossing<00:01:47.490> patterns<00:01:47.939> catching<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
doing crossing patterns catching the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.230 
doing crossing patterns catching the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
ball and running for 60 yards so this is

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.670 
ball and running for 60 yards so this is
really<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> help<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> Eagles<00:01:52.229> offense

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
really going to help the Eagles offense

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.959 
really going to help the Eagles offense
and<00:01:53.220> even<00:01:53.880> stretch<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.540> field<00:01:54.810> even<00:01:55.560> more<00:01:55.969> for

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
and even stretch the field even more for

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.330 
and even stretch the field even more for
runners<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:57.930> LeSean<00:01:58.290> McCoy<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.130> more

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
runners like LeSean McCoy to have more

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.990 
runners like LeSean McCoy to have more
running<00:01:59.729> room<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.979> another<00:02:01.979> good<00:02:02.579> move<00:02:02.790> by

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
running room so another good move by
