00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
better on than actually as it is so I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.520 
better on than actually as it is so I
was<00:01:09.030> kind<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.510> wondering<00:01:09.689> about<00:01:09.990> there<00:01:10.290> for

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
was kind of wondering about there for

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.100 
was kind of wondering about there for
like<00:01:10.740> five<00:01:11.040> hours<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.390> decided<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
like five hours and I decided that the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.690 
like five hours and I decided that the
seventy<00:01:13.439> percent<00:01:13.560> dog<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.159> really<00:01:14.549> really

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
seventy percent dog was really really

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.649 
seventy percent dog was really really
good<00:01:14.790> bargain<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:16.409> probably<00:01:16.650> wouldn't<00:01:17.009> get

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
good bargain and I probably wouldn't get
