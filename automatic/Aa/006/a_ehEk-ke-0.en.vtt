00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 so would have produced a bit like 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.770
 and today there is recognition in the form jeremy 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.110
 menez has a 1 80 euro were at it 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.049
 makes the tempo 780 dribbling 770 shot 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.880
 44 pasta and companies 70 physics with 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.090
 low labor law expert from frost 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.789
 made me train at 100 mph but may 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.380
 really 100 degrees for playing in four 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.060
 nine goals achieved I think that was 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.660
 primarily three or three and a half players 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.070
 more relevant educator training games 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.219
 Now, Juras are leading an 80s yet 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.380
 already a little bit lost on 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.420
 what brings you to the field? 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.969
 A cent in the form of one must say 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.670
 the tempo is really good at 87 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.010
 But it came so fast 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.690
 a little bit happier 780 and that's why 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.100
 is he for the first plus point 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.730
 biggest plus point may be 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.660
 now and for the outstanding 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.489
 That's sort of orson's dribbling 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.760
 it is cool in the conversion is cool 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.750
 to reality and his agility 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.610
 overly good and that's easy 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.049
 wonderful with the three walls 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.729
 no problem at all, it was real 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.580
 it was really I'm already taking out 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.040
 a bit of fun again a 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.900
 more offensive wilfried bony and mario 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.820
 gomez with of the match then jeremy menez 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.380
 put down info and they were both 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.939
 about right and agility and that is 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.460
 just wonderful the longchamp 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.930
 I put in the ingame wonderful 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.780
 Pretty shit people with 70 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.579
 cap and so 770 long shot though 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.409
 He completely convinced me 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.210
 in the end to paint very fast as 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.950
 fitness but otherwise right here already 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.150
 once the latte gone and the citizen 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.740
 So it's dangerous for me too 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.049
 longchamp a positive point to that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.759
 matching game that was right game could 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.200
 great combination games with the 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.899
 pull up there as a center forward behind 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.520
 Chelsea and left think was Jonathan 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.780
 and right and left follow very good 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.119
 Combinations possible and I can too 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.409
 send wonderful 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.759
 long ago because no one made because stop 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.439
 Most sara mandy sent 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.640
 either sold or net metrix code 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.070
 Generally, you will like this topic 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.630
 I see so many elfmeter think four 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.520
 or five of the nine gates was one 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.719
 eleven meters of the most values ​​I 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.369
 ever had with the player review though 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.869
 So okay there anymore, I can also 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.850
 Without his, I do now positive point 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.340
 but just take it 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.480
 just gone is the next positive point 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.030
 course ahead that gates and 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.290
 frankfurt the left is as good as 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.540
 his right course is not that good 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.910
 because very very acceptable and yes 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.090
 the photos with the agility and the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.900
 just an absolute charm 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.110
 Out of this is the positional game and deal 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.930
 on the trails are very very good 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.930
 yes even at home for work nothing 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.190
 he has internet against but against all 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.050
 offensive work-free placed differently 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.330
 sitting in the left is really good too 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.920
 to the really not so good thing that 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.410
 is definitely one 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.970
 nerve-wracking conclusion of the was 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.490
 before I mean mine still has 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.240
 high will shoot me in four games 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:03.450
 but the conclusion of the often 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.610
 quite often yes there is my controller 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.230
 now and then a bit off the hook 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.700
 but he still has it 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.250
 So survived statements since have before 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.570
 all with me someone with a bit 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.910
 very aggressive when he is 100 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.790
 to accept the percent go as said that 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.410
 four or five 119 5 meters but otherwise 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.600
 the conclusion is not pretty shit though 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.400
 really very much when he went to the 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.740
 annoying and the last negative point 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.180
 is his body strength because when it into 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.460
 Unfortunately , he loses physical fitness 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.320
 Often the ball can sometimes be lloret with 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.030
 his good treatment and that 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.040
 his body is very close to expect 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.270
 is as usual in general 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.160
 Of course, the body is not quite stronger 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.110
 The family has it so good anyway 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.550
 very very positive surprised and also 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.490
 That's why I'm convinced of myself 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.810
 in the end in the new comma and I could 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.070
 you just I recommend white on 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.630
 the first in the form of a not played 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.740
 but the second formula 1 career 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.830
 definitely recommend 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.200
 and give a thumbs up that 's it 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.700
 from in this player review i hope so 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.740
 liked stockmann comments 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.080
 like jeremy menez event and ask her 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.020
 played him as always and 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.600
 then you write the comments in 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.740
 Suzuka is still coming tomorrow 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.850
 then actually rarely from the 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.800
 Chris Morris and the three Frenchmen 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.870
 could team of the week comes today 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.590
 actually the new team out right there 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.820
 could you ever have the comments 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.260
 I am out there writing and measuring 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.070
 also the man did not fall into the gate 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.500
 and is not forgotten 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.820
 What a terror today I am 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.400
 I wish you a beautiful 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.360
 day and say then 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.360
 temporarily, at least
