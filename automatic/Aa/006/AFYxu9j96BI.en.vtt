00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.690
 chocolate the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.000
 need are 3 egg whites 100 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.549

 sugar icing 40 grams of sugar 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.450
 white and 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.900
 sugarfree 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:27.540
 for the cream we need 100 milliliters 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:30.450
 of liquid cream 35 1% fat and 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.600
 100 grams of dark chocolate for 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.809
 melt let's put in the bowl of the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.590
 blender the whites to beat at speed 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.040
 high once you are more or less taking 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.590
 consistency we will add the sugar and 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.430
 we will leave it beating until it is 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.160
 totally the whites mounted once 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.890
 more we have assembled we are going to catch that 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.070
 we have in a bowl prepared before the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.000
 sugar with the almond flour and the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.890
 chocolate 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.229
 previously sieved if we are adding 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:10.110
 little by little the egg whites 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.590
 with enveloping movements so that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.439
 We can not lower the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.630
 the whites and once we have all the 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:23.840
 well homogenous mass we will throw it in a 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.350
 pastry bag to proceed to make 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.330
 our 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.330
 the caps of the macarons 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.700
 take a sleeve with a mouthpiece 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.579
 round that does have to be a 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.270
 round mouthpiece and we'll do more or less 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.039
 a few rounds and once we have all 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.020
 the round ones that take us in a 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.530
 baking tray what we are going to do 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.920
 we take it and throw it we let it fall 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.649
 in order to remove all the bubbles 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.450
 of air and we will leave it during the 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.060
 time you need until they are 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.939
 totally dry that when touching not 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.729
 are stuck on the finger and will go to 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.970
 van oven they look dry for 10 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.370
 150 degrees and now we take a 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.970
 saucepan and let's make the cream we put 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.450
 the cream and we're going to leave it until 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.540
 point of which begins to boil once 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.910
 boil and we are going to throw it on top of the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.970
 chocolate so melt it we remove it 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.030
 very good until we have the chocolate 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.640
 totally fused and we're going to leave it 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.670
 cool until it takes a consistency 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.710
 a little bit dense and once we have 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.010
 the cold masks 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.150
 colder we proceed to fill it 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.530
 that we are the cream of a sleeve 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.630
 pastry does not need to put the 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.840
 mouthpiece and we cut it a little bit 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.470
 point and we're going to fill in a 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.230
 little in the middle 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.940
 as you see it is better not to fill in justito 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.900
 up to the edges because if it's not going to put 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.240
 the lid would go all out 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.360
 and as you see this recipe 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.319
 very easy and delicious is already ready 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.319
 I hope you like it
