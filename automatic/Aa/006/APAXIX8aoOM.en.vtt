house<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.190> know<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.670> use<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.540> over<00:02:22.990> a<00:02:23.110> socket

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
house you know I use it over a socket

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.190 
house you know I use it over a socket
it's<00:02:23.890> an<00:02:23.980> extension<00:02:24.490> or<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.540> long<00:02:25.750> handle

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
it's an extension or a long handle

00:02:26.200 --> 00:03:01.680 
it's an extension or a long handle
ratchet<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:27.310> get<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.760> boats

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.340 

I<00:03:01.720> used<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:03.520> magnet<00:03:04.150> extension<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.020> get<00:03:05.200> the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
I used this magnet extension to get the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.120 
I used this magnet extension to get the
boats<00:03:05.560> out<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:07.180> not<00:03:07.330> necessary<00:03:08.080> but<00:03:08.290> helpful

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
boats out it's not necessary but helpful

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:30.620 
boats out it's not necessary but helpful
you're<00:03:09.460> not<00:03:09.640> losing<00:03:09.850> them<00:03:10.210> somewhere<00:03:10.600> in

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.420 

now<00:03:31.630> put<00:03:32.110> on<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.380> hose<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:33.099> work<00:03:33.280> the

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
now put on the hose and work the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.790 
now put on the hose and work the
thermostat<00:03:34.000> housing<00:03:34.180> out<00:03:34.630> so<00:03:35.080> you<00:03:35.140> can<00:03:35.349> get<00:03:35.530> to

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
thermostat housing out so you can get to

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.940 
thermostat housing out so you can get to
it<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:36.630> had<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.870> do<00:03:38.020> over<00:03:38.050> again<00:03:38.380> I<00:03:38.590> would

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
it I had it to do over again I would

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.280 
it I had it to do over again I would
probably<00:03:39.790> remove<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.239> hose<00:03:40.450> before<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.959> set

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
probably remove the hose before I set

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.190 
probably remove the hose before I set
those<00:03:41.470> folks<00:03:42.160> out<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.610> housing<00:03:43.200> you'll
