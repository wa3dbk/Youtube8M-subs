00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.120 
now this fight probably would have been
a<00:01:56.909> lot<00:01:57.119> easier<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.750> replaced<00:01:58.469> bananas<00:01:58.979> with

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
a lot easier if I replaced bananas with

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.270 
a lot easier if I replaced bananas with
a<00:01:59.159> mechanical<00:01:59.909> because<00:02:00.869> bees<00:02:01.409> take<00:02:01.710> bonus

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
a mechanical because bees take bonus

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.209 
a mechanical because bees take bonus
damage<00:02:02.490> from<00:02:02.880> mechanicals<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:03.950> regardless<00:02:04.950> I

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
damage from mechanicals but regardless I

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.819 
damage from mechanicals but regardless I
got<00:02:05.460> through<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.630> monkey<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.110> really

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
got through it this monkey is really

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.460 
got through it this monkey is really
damn<00:02:07.979> annoying<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:08.580> he<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.300> use<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> stun

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
damn annoying because he can use a stun

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.199 
damn annoying because he can use a stun
fairly<00:02:10.979> frequently

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
fairly frequently

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.390 
fairly frequently
and<00:02:12.299> he<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.140> does<00:02:13.439> a<00:02:13.469> lot<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.769> damage<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.189> June

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
and he just does a lot of damage in June

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.479 
and he just does a lot of damage in June

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
but I was able to do it just barely due

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.990 
but I was able to do it just barely due
to<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.209> swirling<00:02:18.930> sprouts<00:02:19.579> mushroom<00:02:20.579> dot
