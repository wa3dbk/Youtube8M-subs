00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.820
 hey guys creamy 4 and in this video 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.860
 which six weapons and objects 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.450
 show the original times in gta 5 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.610
 so in there were still in it as the game 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.960
 but the beta phase was then out of the 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.160
 were taken out as the game 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.140
 game was released and this 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.090
 Weapons will be here in this one 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.230
 show video and yes you can actually 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.550
 Do not say that these weapons 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.080
 were taken out because the run 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.820
 actually are still in play in it 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.050
 but not unlocked for us 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.160
 and I will tell you in this video 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.480
 just a few times 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.340
 pictures of these weapons and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.750
 We will show you objects 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.610
 At first, that would be it at all 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.500
 has found and indeed the American 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.809
 painter in spite of that just from the corning 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.489
 gta 5 taken out that these weapons 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.290
 originally planned him in 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.670
 the game to come in because they just 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.500
 but also indoor game trends are for 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.820
 We just can not buy it in the jain 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.400
 amo nations gate but as said in 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.019
 Kolding are in it and I was later 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.250
 also prove that these weapons 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.030
 really are in the game though 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.379
 more on that later 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.089
 and I would say we start her 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.680
 just first time with the first post 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.240
 he just made pictures and 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.740
 Here you can first four times weapons 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.659
 and objects it would see that would be 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.610
 first a shovel one 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.020
 firefraught a rope and somehow like that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.340
 a funny detector or something 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.850
 should I honestly even 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.950
 not so sure 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.560
 In any case, we can first two 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.700
 see such handguns and take place there 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.440
 First of all, just look at the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.090
 shovel yes a chance personal 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.380
 extremely cool imagine you one 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.770
 can spade for people in the mouth 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.680
 beat 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.060
 who do I think is pretty funny and what 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.410
 there is more to say then we see 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.850
 take it up nor the fireworks to 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.350
 and from having to actually 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.120
 I circuit at that time a firework 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.730
 but was planned just now with the 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.110
 next version will be this one because 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.340
 still has come to just for the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.690
 People are already on the old town 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.220
 so it was apparently playing 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.510
 already planned a little longer that one so 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.440
 what then as an axis where the 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.990
 play should come in 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.310
 it continues with the rope and at the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.630
 But tent is not at all honest 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.890
 what i should say to that because i just 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.870
 no idea why you have one 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.340
 second the gta introduces maybe 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.170
 planned to hang people or something 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.479
 I honestly do not know why 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.860
 rope should be there maybe around 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.659
 to do something with horses or something 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.340
 I honestly do not know what you mean 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.720
 to do with it as they can me once 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.260
 like your ideas in the comments 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.030
 write 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.739
 and then we come to the last one 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.480
 item for this post and that of 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.489
 detector and I honestly said that 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.870
 also no idea why rockstar games 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.700
 Install a detector in the game 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.319
 because what can you do with a detector 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.760
 Bach I do not know what that should be 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.990
 maybe another one left then 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.069
 I am there you have ideas you can too 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.230
 like to write in the comments 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.020
 In any case, this item is also in 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.450
 the coaching of gta 5 with built-in 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.010
 If he continues we will continue now 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.690
 with the next post and there we can 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.130
 again two weapons and objects 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.480
 see or actually more objects 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.160
 I do not know if that is necessarily as 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.050
 weapons can view and initially 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.330
 here a speaker and then 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.520
 another fire extinguisher at the 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.050
 loudspeakers honestly no 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.340
 of people had fun with what the 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.900
 everything should start and everything 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.740
 why rockstar games ever in 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.240
 Build the coaching 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.040
 In any case , you can still one here 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.420
 see speakers and just another 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.709
 Fire extinguisher I think a fine 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.510
 Personally still extremely cool when you're there 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.890
 could also extinguish fire or if 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.450
 you just like one 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.980
 water cannon we just in gta 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.810
 that as well as people a bit 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.700
 with purpose stream that could if I 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.530
 personally extremely funny but at the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.700
 speaker with the speaker must 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.560
 I also honestly say I have 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.300
 no idea for what that should be good 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.770
 it certainly makes sense that 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.569
 Six items enter into the game 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.310
 are installed in kolding next to 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.930
 but were programmed just for us 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.880
 not unlocked and not 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.440
 in the amo nation store to buy 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.849
 now you are wondering where from 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.290
 I then know that these items 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.420
 then in the game at all 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.099
 and if you the modder carlos co 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.239
 dia de knows he always does the game like that 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.739
 so a bit moth and things 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.060
 unlock in the game are in it but 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.650
 for us are not unlock 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.540
 and he just did it with a mission 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.709
 made where you just fire instead of me 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.060
 I'll let you have a look here now 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.410
 show a picture in the background that 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.940
 a excerpt from a video of him 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.129
 and he just made it that way 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.780
 fire extinguishers are in gta 5 in there but 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.400
 to play similar to us are the seeds 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.870
 he just unlocked and proves that 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.400
 simply that these items really 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.090
 in the game are in but for us 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.500
 not to buy 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.060
 no idea why rockstar games the 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.200
 I took things out again 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.970
 my, it's not exactly everything 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.590
 things you really need but 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.910
 Nevertheless, I think pretty much 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.410
 Funny just write it 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.670
 your opinion in the comments I am 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.569
 I'll just get out of here 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.580
 of course, how to do that correctly 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.319
 liked Vanins is now time traffic lights 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.370
 until then skin purely on the like button 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.370
 people or creamy
