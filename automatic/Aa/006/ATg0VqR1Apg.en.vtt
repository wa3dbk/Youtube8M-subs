00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.390
 the delivery usually does not present difficulties the bunnies are born with 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.880
 eyes closed and without hair and deaf 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.139
 and weigh about 50 60 grams 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.860
 in the intervals between births the free rabbit to newborns from in want 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.839
 fetal ingesting 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:20.320
 he cleans them, he covers them with a fur egg 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.480
 at the end he leaves the nest to return only for feeding 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.480
 which happens once a day for a few minutes 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.390
 the nest should be checked for two or three days 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.230
 not to leave the human smell on the little ones 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.550
 it is better to work with clean hands 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.880
 better if previously discharged on the back of the rabbit or with hay 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.650
 otherwise you risk that the rabbit rejects the puppies ooh worse still there 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.360
 kill 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.649
 during the check the number of births was kissed 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.649
 any deaths and the state of the nest 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.659
 the rabbit at 8 nipples activity 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.290
 therefore they are drawn in greater numbers 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.030
 they must be transferred with caution to another immediate - numerous 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.030
 to form groups of homogeneous bunnies 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.950
 the passage must be performed within the third day possibly after breastfeeding 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.380
 so that the rabbit does not notice it 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.860
 the bunnies take on the smell of the new nest 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.330
 if all proceeds regularly, breastfeeding continues for 5 weeks 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.520
 but the little ones already towards the twelfth day 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.219
 when they opened their eyes they put the hair on they are able to maintain 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.920
 body temperature constant 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.080
 they leave the nest and begin to feed on the food they find in the 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.120
 surroundings 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.920
 mortality in these first 5 weeks 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 is around 15% 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.710
 me 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.340
 at the end without chin, that is after about 5 weeks from the birth 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.630
 the female is changed of cardiac 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.450
 the real weaning begins around the 32nd day 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.460
 when their weight reaches 500 36 100 grams the bunnies remain 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.289
 however together final eighth ninth week
