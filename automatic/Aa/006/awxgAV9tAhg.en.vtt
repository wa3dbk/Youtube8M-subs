00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.189
 how to tint foamiran and give 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.599
 he needs your product shade with 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.090
 using acrylic paints 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.710
 besides, we will test three types of Thomas 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.080
 you and so this is our chinese very 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.470
 thin forms only 0 5 millimeters 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.900
 this is our chinese foamiran 1 and 2 and 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.880
 it's about 08 and fragrant which 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.310
 made in iran 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.130
 we take a few shades of ours 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.990
 paints that we will need in 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.660
 In this case, the extent you are purple 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.820
 petal is black to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.219
 make max and shades of mustard 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.110
 brown and green to 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.930
 toned leaves give them more 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.510
 such a mustard actively take 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.170
 a small amount of paint will apply it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.170
 on a sponge 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.150
 testing masks on paper to 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.100
 see how it will stain after 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.320
 we will try to process it first 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:20.540
 edge and making sure he doesn't 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:25.840
 Sharp big strokes do these 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.840
 small Moscow from the center side 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.460
 in the same way we will process the following 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.460
 petal 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.729
 if your paint came out but most 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.729
 products than you planned it does not matter 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.280
 we can then toned it in white 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:20.700
 and blurred by just wet sponge 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:26.900
 I will do the same with the rest 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.900
 petals in shades 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.330
 we see that it turned out brighter I do not know 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.659
 can you see before and after that i just 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.849
 take 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:46.140
 sponge rubbing the back side 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.140
 clean sponge rubbing acrylic on petal 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.660
 such beautiful products we have 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.660
 it turned out our poppy petals 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:26.900
 take our petals for make 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:31.980
 take a brush with a thin pile edge and 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.900
 take a little black wash or you can 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.040
 even take the purple paint dima that 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.040
 it will be already very beautiful 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:50.220
 paint on the brush and make medium 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.459
 movement after which we do nothing 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.459
 masks 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:09.420
 do the same with the next sand 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:09.420
 and there and red the same quality foul 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.780
 acrylic paint is well washed off 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.660
 after drying it is covered 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.690
 special film she will be very 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.860
 the quartet is stable this very white 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.860
 problematic to wash later 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:48.659
 this is our poppy petals we are ready 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:53.699
 leave them dry and go to our 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:56.479
 leaves and now i tint our 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.800
 leaves in this case I tint 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.679
 green leaf mixed green 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.399
 shade and shade archintsy and darker 

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:07.679
 Leaves on tint simply mustard 

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:14.669
 the color of mustard I just completely 

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:16.740
 I paint over a piece of paper on the movement 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.269
 lines lived like a leaf there 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.649
 then in this case even 

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:21.869
 some stripes they will 

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:23.449
 look very natural you see 

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:26.849
 that this leaf acquires such 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:29.309
 real shade shade present case 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:32.490
 not green leaves is simple just tint 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:35.389
 mustard and you can see all that u 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.389
 we got 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.430
 mustard removes Tibet this is now 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:03.990
 bright greens and give leaf 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.990
 more natural shade 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.050
 I hope you can see the difference 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.590
 and we can already look at the result of our 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:30.020
 work and so you can already see that 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.759
 we've got and what I will do these 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.509
 petals you will see a reference under 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.509
