so<00:00:08.440> we're<00:00:08.559> going<00:00:08.650> to<00:00:08.710> do<00:00:08.860> the<00:00:09.719> posterior<00:00:10.719> lower

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
so we're going to do the posterior lower

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.350 
so we're going to do the posterior lower
extremity<00:00:12.040> vasculature<00:00:12.549> and<00:00:13.120> we're<00:00:13.210> going<00:00:13.330> to

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
extremity vasculature and we're going to

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.760 
extremity vasculature and we're going to
start<00:00:13.570> up<00:00:13.719> here<00:00:13.900> in<00:00:13.960> the<00:00:14.020> gluteal<00:00:14.379> region<00:00:14.410> that

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770 
start up here in the gluteal region that

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.070 
start up here in the gluteal region that
we<00:00:14.860> have<00:00:15.010> gluteus<00:00:15.429> maximus<00:00:15.869> retracted<00:00:16.869> here

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
we have gluteus maximus retracted here

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.780 
we have gluteus maximus retracted here
and<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:17.890> first<00:00:18.099> thing<00:00:18.220> you<00:00:18.279> want<00:00:18.430> to<00:00:18.460> look<00:00:18.610> for

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
and the first thing you want to look for

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.550 
and the first thing you want to look for
is<00:00:18.880> piriformis<00:00:19.509> again<00:00:19.779> and<00:00:20.110> you're<00:00:20.380> going<00:00:20.529> to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
is piriformis again and you're going to

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.410 
is piriformis again and you're going to
look<00:00:20.680> for<00:00:20.890> vessels<00:00:21.310> emerging<00:00:21.849> above<00:00:22.150> the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
look for vessels emerging above the

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.159 
look for vessels emerging above the
piriformis<00:00:22.989> which<00:00:23.619> will<00:00:23.739> be<00:00:23.829> these<00:00:24.779> here<00:00:25.779> and

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
piriformis which will be these here and

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.600 
piriformis which will be these here and
these<00:00:26.259> are<00:00:26.380> going<00:00:26.470> to<00:00:26.560> be<00:00:26.649> superior<00:00:27.099> gluteal

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
these are going to be superior gluteal

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.620 
these are going to be superior gluteal
vessels<00:00:28.000> all<00:00:28.149> right<00:00:28.239> so<00:00:28.360> we're<00:00:28.450> going<00:00:28.570> to

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
vessels all right so we're going to

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.690 
vessels all right so we're going to
order<00:00:28.869> these<00:00:29.050> veins<00:00:29.320> and<00:00:29.680> nerves<00:00:29.800> coursing

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
order these veins and nerves coursing

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.830 
order these veins and nerves coursing
down<00:00:30.730> in<00:00:30.970> this<00:00:31.090> area<00:00:31.329> and<00:00:31.419> they<00:00:31.540> are<00:00:31.570> going<00:00:31.779> to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
down in this area and they are going to

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.340 
down in this area and they are going to
be<00:00:31.930> located<00:00:32.230> deep<00:00:32.619> to<00:00:33.660> gluteus<00:00:34.660> medius<00:00:34.870> right

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
be located deep to gluteus medius right

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.630 
be located deep to gluteus medius right
so<00:00:35.440> you<00:00:35.500> have<00:00:35.559> to<00:00:35.649> move<00:00:35.800> gluteus<00:00:36.160> medius<00:00:36.280> out

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
so you have to move gluteus medius out

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.100 
so you have to move gluteus medius out
of<00:00:36.790> the<00:00:36.850> way<00:00:36.969> to<00:00:37.450> be<00:00:37.540> able<00:00:37.600> to<00:00:37.719> come<00:00:37.899> to<00:00:38.020> the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
of the way to be able to come to the

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.140 
of the way to be able to come to the
superior<00:00:38.559> gluteal<00:00:38.860> muscles<00:00:39.190> then<00:00:39.700> we<00:00:39.820> go<00:00:39.940> back

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
superior gluteal muscles then we go back

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.400 
superior gluteal muscles then we go back
to<00:00:40.180> piriformis<00:00:40.810> when<00:00:40.930> we<00:00:40.990> go<00:00:41.110> below

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
to piriformis when we go below

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.830 
to piriformis when we go below
piriformis<00:00:41.980> now<00:00:42.160> and<00:00:42.760> we<00:00:42.880> have<00:00:43.060> some<00:00:43.300> vessels

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
piriformis now and we have some vessels

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.870 
piriformis now and we have some vessels
emerging<00:00:44.320> from<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:44.890> inferior<00:00:45.400> side<00:00:45.610> of

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
emerging from the inferior side of

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.310 
emerging from the inferior side of
piriformis<00:00:46.540> and<00:00:46.630> these<00:00:46.810> are<00:00:46.930> all<00:00:47.020> going<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.260> be

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
piriformis and these are all going to be

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.370 
piriformis and these are all going to be
inferior<00:00:47.770> gluteal<00:00:48.280> vessels<00:00:48.640> also<00:00:49.380> emerging

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
inferior gluteal vessels also emerging

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.750 
inferior gluteal vessels also emerging
here<00:00:50.500> we<00:00:50.650> have<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.920> sciatic<00:00:51.340> nerve<00:00:51.490> which

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
here we have the sciatic nerve which

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.710 
here we have the sciatic nerve which
we'll<00:00:51.910> come<00:00:52.060> back<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.329> in<00:00:52.420> a<00:00:52.480> minute

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
we'll come back to in a minute

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.920 
we'll come back to in a minute
moving<00:00:53.560> down<00:00:55.800> down<00:00:56.800> here<00:00:57.070> behind<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.579> knee<00:00:58.120> in

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
moving down down here behind the knee in

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.319 
moving down down here behind the knee in
this<00:00:59.320> area<00:00:59.680> here<00:00:59.980> is<00:01:00.160> where<00:01:00.190> we<00:01:00.520> see<00:01:00.730> the

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
this area here is where we see the

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.930 
this area here is where we see the
popliteal<00:01:01.810> vessels<00:01:02.200> emerge<00:01:02.770> we<00:01:03.760> have

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
popliteal vessels emerge we have

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.350 
popliteal vessels emerge we have
popliteal<00:01:04.869> artery<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:06.070> popliteal<00:01:06.520> vein<00:01:06.610> next

popliteal artery and popliteal vein next
to<00:01:07.420> each<00:01:07.540> other<00:01:07.630> we<00:01:08.290> can<00:01:08.409> trace<00:01:08.680> these<00:01:08.890> down

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
to each other we can trace these down

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.399 
to each other we can trace these down
here<00:01:09.460> we<00:01:10.030> have<00:01:10.149> to<00:01:10.240> move<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.659> calf<00:01:10.990> muscles

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
here we have to move the calf muscles

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.719 
here we have to move the calf muscles
out<00:01:11.560> of<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.740> way<00:01:13.620> here<00:01:14.620> and<00:01:15.250> we're<00:01:15.490> just<00:01:15.550> going

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
out of the way here and we're just going

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.170 
out of the way here and we're just going
to<00:01:15.820> move<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.150> nerve<00:01:16.330> out<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:16.990> way<00:01:17.110> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
to move the nerve out of the way and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.469 
to move the nerve out of the way and
here<00:01:19.180> we<00:01:19.630> can<00:01:19.780> see<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:21.550> popliteal<00:01:22.060> vessels

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
here we can see the popliteal vessels

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.149 
here we can see the popliteal vessels
here<00:01:22.690> crossing<00:01:23.320> behind<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.740> knee<00:01:23.860> this<00:01:24.040> is

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
here crossing behind the knee this is

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.130 
here crossing behind the knee this is
going<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.370> be<00:01:24.460> popliteal<00:01:24.970> artery<00:01:25.240> one<00:01:25.840> next<00:01:26.049> to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
going to be popliteal artery one next to

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.899 
going to be popliteal artery one next to
it<00:01:26.260> there's<00:01:26.409> in<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.680> popliteal<00:01:27.130> vein<00:01:27.220> we're

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
it there's in the popliteal vein we're

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.469 
it there's in the popliteal vein we're
going<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.120> take<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.390> artery<00:01:28.690> right<00:01:28.900> here

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.050 

and<00:01:31.570> lift<00:01:31.930> up<00:01:32.110> on<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.350> there<00:01:33.070> we<00:01:33.729> can<00:01:33.880> see<00:01:34.030> that

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
and lift up on it there we can see that

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.639 
and lift up on it there we can see that
this<00:01:34.420> split<00:01:34.719> right<00:01:35.020> here<00:01:35.229> is<00:01:35.320> going<00:01:35.439> to<00:01:35.500> be

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
this split right here is going to be

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.980 
this split right here is going to be
popliteal<00:01:36.280> artery<00:01:36.909> splitting<00:01:37.390> into<00:01:37.570> anterior

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
popliteal artery splitting into anterior

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.319 
popliteal artery splitting into anterior
tibial<00:01:38.560> artery<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:39.070> posterior<00:01:39.880> tibial

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
tibial artery and posterior tibial

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:41.669 
tibial artery and posterior tibial
artery<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.990> veins<00:01:41.200> are<00:01:41.380> going<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.560> do<00:01:41.649> a

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
artery the veins are going to do a

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.010 
artery the veins are going to do a
similar<00:01:41.950> thing<00:01:42.100> right<00:01:42.490> next<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:43.020> follow

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
similar thing right next to it follow

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.840 
similar thing right next to it follow
down<00:01:44.289> posterior<00:01:44.920> tibial<00:01:45.189> artery<00:01:45.460> and<00:01:45.610> we<00:01:45.700> can

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
down posterior tibial artery and we can

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.490 
down posterior tibial artery and we can
see<00:01:46.060> that<00:01:46.509> we<00:01:46.600> have<00:01:46.689> a<00:01:46.719> branch<00:01:47.049> coming<00:01:47.289> off

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
see that we have a branch coming off

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.139 
see that we have a branch coming off
laterally<00:01:48.039> here<00:01:48.250> which<00:01:48.700> will<00:01:48.850> be<00:01:48.970> your

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
laterally here which will be your

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.359 
laterally here which will be your

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
where these vessels sweat and if we just

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.300 
where these vessels sweat and if we just
move<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.170> vein<00:02:11.380> down<00:02:11.680> out<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.010> way<00:02:12.040> here

can follow tibial nerve all the way down
back<00:03:46.340> behind<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:46.790> ankles<00:03:47.090> here<00:03:47.300> and<00:03:47.510> if<00:03:47.810> we

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
back behind the ankles here and if we

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.809 
back behind the ankles here and if we
just<00:03:48.170> take<00:03:48.380> posterior<00:03:49.040> tibial<00:03:49.340> artery<00:03:49.610> that

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
just take posterior tibial artery that

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.250 
just take posterior tibial artery that
we<00:03:49.880> saw<00:03:50.030> before<00:03:50.239> and<00:03:50.480> move<00:03:50.660> that<00:03:50.900> out<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:51.080> the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
we saw before and move that out of the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.650 
we saw before and move that out of the
way<00:03:51.380> right<00:03:52.100> here<00:03:52.130> you<00:03:52.489> can<00:03:52.640> see<00:03:52.850> tibial<00:03:53.600> nerve

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
way right here you can see tibial nerve

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.009 
way right here you can see tibial nerve
splitting<00:03:54.380> into<00:03:54.970> medial<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.180> lateral

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
splitting into medial and lateral

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.750 
splitting into medial and lateral
plantar<00:03:57.950> nerves<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:58.400> that's<00:03:58.550> going<00:03:58.700> to

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
plantar nerves and that's going to

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.340 
plantar nerves and that's going to
follow<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.150> same<00:03:59.360> path<00:03:59.569> as<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.930> arteries<00:04:00.230> and

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
follow the same path as the arteries and

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.840 
follow the same path as the arteries and
veins<00:04:00.410> down<00:04:01.100> towards<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.430> bottom<00:04:01.550> of<00:04:01.790> the

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
veins down towards the bottom of the

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.030 
veins down towards the bottom of the
foot
