just throw it rerun the test I've run

just throw it rerun the test I've run
these<00:01:34.770> quite<00:01:35.010> a<00:01:35.040> number<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.310> times<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:35.790> it

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
these quite a number of times and it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.350 
these quite a number of times and it
seems<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:37.430> they'll<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.550> pretty<00:01:38.820> close<00:01:39.119> on
