00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.969
 let's make orange cookies 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:16.820
 we need for it 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:20.029
 150 grams of sugar and icing sugar is 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.990
 say powdered sugar like half a kilo of 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:29.070
 150 olive oil flour 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.490
 150 of orange juice 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.750
 an egg yolk 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.910
 an egg to later paint them 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.710
 when we go to bake them and a 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.710
 small teaspoon of yeast 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.840
 in a container we have put the 150 of 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.820
 icing sugar 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.610
 the yolk of egg now we add the 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.600
 150 of orange juice 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:03.110
 has been in total orange and average for 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:08.170
 get the 150 of juice and now we go 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.170
 to add 150 olive oil 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.890
 I go here is the olive oil to the 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.890
 150 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.340
 and now a teaspoon of coffee 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.340
 yeast 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.340
 let's mix all these well 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.700
 ingredients and then we will go 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.310
 adding flour I think it will be 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.050
 like half a kilo what we need but 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.430
 good that we see that a mass is formed 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.220
 as always homogeneous well worked and 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.050
 that does not stick in our hands 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.050
 then we are going to add 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.090
 well you see we are adding the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.090
 flour 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.070
 when we see what 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.820
 so let's look at the hand to knead 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.260
 well you see how the march is 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.280
 put a vinyl glove so that it does not 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.620
 I stick to this single mass fingers 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.230
 but we return to take half a kilo of 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:35.140
 flour we have kneaded and now we are going to 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:37.090
 to form with all of this a ball and 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.250
 we're going to have it in the fridge resting 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.730
 well, about half an hour 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.260
 then we will extend the mass and 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.260
 we will start to form the cookies 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.970
 as a variation I have taken a portion of 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.130
 the dough and has added grated coconut 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.860
 because with the orange is very good 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.970
 coconut then now I'm going to knead this 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.190
 so that it gets wet choose the ingredients 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.990
 and well I'm going to put the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.720
 fridge so that it takes a little bit of 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.120
 body the dough but well this is a 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.610
 portion that apart from the ingredients 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.850
 that you have already seen I add coconut 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.620
 grated 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.200
 and half an hour has passed since 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.750
 we had the dough in the fridge and then 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.970
 I have taken out in this case the one that has coconut 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.490
 but good is indifferent and now with the 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.970
 I'm going to extend the roller 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.580
 make it fine and then with the 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.220
 cut pasta or simply with the 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.260
 mouth of a small glass then we will go 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.349
 forming cookies 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.340
 we have prepared the first batch 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:48.970
 now we only have left 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.580
 with another game that we had 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:56.200
 removed the egg white from the yolk and then 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:04:00.210
 with the yolk we will paint the lines 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.210
 well above with a brush 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:06.050
 so that it takes the best color in it or not 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.050
 when ordered 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.880
 in the oven we have it preheating 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:16.030
 180 degrees 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.760
 and we will put the tray in the second 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.880
 height starting at the top 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.620
 and we will have them like 15 minutes 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.300
 when we see that they begin to brown 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.310
 it was time 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.259
 so now let's wait for 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.930
 the oven is hot and we will put 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.090
 the first cookies because this is 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.540
 our first registered batch of the 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.290
 oven 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.320
 now we wait for them to cool down to 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.290
 to be able to touch them because when they leave the 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.640
 oven are usually quite squishy 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.640
 then you see how pretty they are 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.200
 and they are actually easy to make 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.690
 I hope you do not get lazy 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:02.460
 do not tell me you 're super appetizing 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:05.520
 this with a coffee by law if we go from 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.790
 here to heaven come I hope it's 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.790
 dibise
