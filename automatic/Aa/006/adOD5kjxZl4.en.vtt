fingers<00:00:56.489> looking<00:00:57.489> at<00:00:57.610> the<00:00:57.760> tool<00:00:57.969> we<00:00:58.570> can<00:00:58.719> see

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
fingers looking at the tool we can see

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.410 
fingers looking at the tool we can see
how<00:00:59.200> the<00:00:59.260> long<00:00:59.590> edge<00:00:59.920> corresponds<00:01:00.850> very<00:01:01.210> much

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
how the long edge corresponds very much

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.930 
how the long edge corresponds very much
to<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.840> ulna<00:01:02.020> Ridge<00:01:02.350> often<00:01:03.250> used<00:01:03.489> over<00:01:03.789> the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
to the ulna Ridge often used over the

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.100 
to the ulna Ridge often used over the
broader<00:01:04.210> areas<00:01:04.989> of<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.560> body<00:01:05.740> itself<00:01:06.990> when<00:01:07.990> we

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
broader areas of the body itself when we

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.660 
broader areas of the body itself when we
look<00:01:08.260> at<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.470> ends<00:01:08.770> we<00:01:08.979> see<00:01:09.190> that<00:01:09.369> one<00:01:09.520> is

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
look at the ends we see that one is

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.670 
look at the ends we see that one is
relatively<00:01:10.119> narrow<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.780> slightly<00:01:11.229> pointed

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
relatively narrow and slightly pointed

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.399 
relatively narrow and slightly pointed
and<00:01:12.250> this<00:01:12.369> is<00:01:12.460> very<00:01:12.640> much<00:01:12.820> like<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.900> profile

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
and this is very much like the profile

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.929 
and this is very much like the profile
of<00:01:14.920> our<00:01:15.159> own<00:01:15.340> thumb<00:01:17.070> meanwhile<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.520> rounded

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
of our own thumb meanwhile the rounded

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.240 
of our own thumb meanwhile the rounded
end<00:01:19.090> has<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.540> profile<00:01:20.049> which<00:01:20.290> corresponds<00:01:21.100> very

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
end has a profile which corresponds very

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.920 
end has a profile which corresponds very
much<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.570> our<00:01:22.689> own<00:01:22.979> elbow<00:01:24.659> rather<00:01:25.659> than

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
much to our own elbow rather than

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.780 
much to our own elbow rather than
talking<00:01:26.200> about<00:01:26.380> this<00:01:26.740> let's<00:01:27.159> look<00:01:27.250> at<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.610> in

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
talking about this let's look at it in

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.660 
talking about this let's look at it in
action<00:01:27.939> with<00:01:28.450> some<00:01:28.630> examples<00:01:29.310> we'll<00:01:30.310> start

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
action with some examples we'll start

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.179 
action with some examples we'll start
looking<00:01:31.150> at<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.360> long<00:01:31.570> edge<00:01:31.750> of<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:31.960> tool<00:01:32.259> and

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
looking at the long edge of the tool and

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.070 
looking at the long edge of the tool and
we'll<00:01:33.369> see<00:01:33.580> how<00:01:33.880> this<00:01:34.330> works<00:01:34.540> over<00:01:34.960> the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
we'll see how this works over the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.590 
we'll see how this works over the
iliotibial<00:01:35.530> band<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:37.060> first<00:01:37.270> thing<00:01:37.450> we'll

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
iliotibial band the first thing we'll

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.289 
iliotibial band the first thing we'll
notice<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:38.170> how<00:01:38.380> tightly<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:39.640> contours<00:01:40.150> of

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
notice is how tightly the contours of

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.630 
notice is how tightly the contours of
the<00:01:40.360> tool<00:01:40.630> actually<00:01:41.259> fit<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.250> tissues<00:01:42.610> of

the most of them now let's look at the
why

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
why

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.089 
why
round<00:02:16.359> our<00:02:16.569> end<00:02:16.719> of<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.930> tool<00:02:17.200> we're<00:02:17.799> going<00:02:17.980> to

round our end of the tool we're going to

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.459 
round our end of the tool we're going to
use<00:02:18.310> this<00:02:18.519> around<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:19.060> Ilia<00:02:19.390> crest<00:02:19.810> covering

Junction<00:02:58.569> we're<00:02:59.439> going<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.680> have<00:02:59.769> a<00:02:59.799> look<00:02:59.980> at

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
Junction we're going to have a look at

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.920 
Junction we're going to have a look at
the<00:03:00.189> same<00:03:00.430> technique<00:03:00.939> but<00:03:01.180> we're<00:03:01.659> going<00:03:01.840> to

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
the same technique but we're going to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.569 
the same technique but we're going to
work<00:03:02.139> a<00:03:02.319> little<00:03:02.560> bit<00:03:02.680> higher<00:03:02.889> up<00:03:03.069> in<00:03:03.189> the<00:03:03.310> spine

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
work a little bit higher up in the spine

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.289 
work a little bit higher up in the spine
over<00:03:03.909> the<00:03:04.120> paraspinal<00:03:04.599> muscles<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:06.340> we<00:03:06.879> adapt

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
over the paraspinal muscles if we adapt

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.509 
over the paraspinal muscles if we adapt
this<00:03:07.629> push<00:03:07.959> technique<00:03:08.469> to<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.769> paraspinal<00:03:09.250> x'

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
this push technique to the paraspinal x'

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.309 
this push technique to the paraspinal x'
we<00:03:10.060> suggest<00:03:10.449> using<00:03:10.629> similar<00:03:11.199> holds<00:03:11.790> but

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
we suggest using similar holds but

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.809 
we suggest using similar holds but
angling<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.500> working<00:03:14.919> edge<00:03:15.159> of<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.549> tool

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
angling the working edge of the tool

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.050 
angling the working edge of the tool
note<00:03:16.750> how<00:03:16.989> close<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:18.010> spinous<00:03:18.489> processes

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
note how close to the spinous processes

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.939 
note how close to the spinous processes
we<00:03:19.719> can<00:03:19.750> get<00:03:20.169> using<00:03:21.129> this<00:03:21.280> technique<00:03:22.949> we're

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949 
we can get using this technique we're

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:27.360 
we can get using this technique we're
using<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.579> pushing<00:03:25.000> action<00:03:25.709> but<00:03:26.709> just<00:03:26.739> as<00:03:27.159> well

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
using a pushing action but just as well

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.330 
using a pushing action but just as well
we<00:03:28.090> could<00:03:28.269> reverse<00:03:28.569> that<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.199> make<00:03:29.889> a<00:03:29.919> pulling

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
we could reverse that and make a pulling

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.369 
we could reverse that and make a pulling
action<00:03:30.729> as<00:03:30.849> we<00:03:31.299> did<00:03:31.479> around<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.900> eye<00:03:31.930> layout

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379
