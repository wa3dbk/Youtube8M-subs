got an ipad mini today and I'd like to
do<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.649> side-by-side<00:00:08.069> test<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.389> with<00:00:09.870> my

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
do a side-by-side test of it with my

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.950 
do a side-by-side test of it with my
third<00:00:10.380> generation<00:00:11.130> ipad<00:00:11.690> here<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:12.809> are

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
third generation ipad here we are

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.039 
third generation ipad here we are
looking<00:00:13.320> at<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.650> home<00:00:13.830> screen<00:00:14.280> first<00:00:15.269> off<00:00:15.540> you

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
looking at the home screen first off you

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.859 
looking at the home screen first off you
can<00:00:16.289> obviously<00:00:17.010> see<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> hardware<00:00:18.840> of

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
can obviously see that the hardware of

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.840 
can obviously see that the hardware of
the<00:00:19.170> iPad<00:00:19.830> Mini<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.340> smaller<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:22.340> the<00:00:23.340> screen

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the iPad Mini is smaller and the screen

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.500 
the iPad Mini is smaller and the screen
is<00:00:24.090> obviously<00:00:24.869> smaller<00:00:25.320> as<00:00:25.800> well<00:00:26.279> which<00:00:26.730> makes

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
is obviously smaller as well which makes

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.070 
is obviously smaller as well which makes
the<00:00:27.779> app<00:00:28.170> icons<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.760> text<00:00:30.390> look<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.840> bit

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
the app icons and the text look a bit

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.780 
the app icons and the text look a bit
smaller<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:33.270> not<00:00:33.510> like<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:33.960> too<00:00:34.230> small

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
smaller but it's not like it's too small

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.819 
smaller but it's not like it's too small
even<00:00:35.790> though<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.360> resolution<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.170> half<00:00:37.800> that

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
even though the resolution is half that

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.840 
even though the resolution is half that
of<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.760> third<00:00:39.239> generation<00:00:39.450> ipad<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.710> still<00:00:41.579> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
of the third generation ipad it still is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.410 
of the third generation ipad it still is
very<00:00:41.879> adequate<00:00:43.550> let's<00:00:44.550> kind<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.850> compare<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
very adequate let's kind of compare the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.590 
very adequate let's kind of compare the
speed<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.110> these<00:00:46.289> two<00:00:46.559> devices<00:00:46.860> now<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:48.329> just

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
speed of these two devices now we just

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.119 
speed of these two devices now we just
swipe<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:50.899> the<00:00:51.899> speed<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.260> about<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.890> same

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
swipe here the speed is about the same

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.119 
swipe here the speed is about the same
and<00:00:53.840> what<00:00:54.840> about<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.320> press<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.949> home

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
and what about if we press the home

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.650 
and what about if we press the home
button<00:00:57.170> that<00:00:58.170> appears<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.800> same<00:00:59.390> we'll<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.539> it

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
button that appears the same we'll do it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290 
button that appears the same we'll do it
one<00:01:00.780> more<00:01:00.899> time<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.640> we'll<00:01:02.640> search<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.210> an

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
one more time and we'll search for an

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.969 
one more time and we'll search for an
app<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.170> books<00:01:05.240> it's<00:01:06.240> open<00:01:06.659> these

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
app like I books it's open these

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.000 
app like I books it's open these
simultaneously<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.780> they<00:01:09.780> open<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.830> at

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
simultaneously and they open just at

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.570 
simultaneously and they open just at
about<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.580> same<00:01:11.610> time<00:01:12.650> here<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.130> see

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
about the same time here you can see

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.899 
about the same time here you can see
that<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> text<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> iPad<00:01:16.110> Mini<00:01:16.409> is

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
that the text on the iPad Mini is

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.240 
that the text on the iPad Mini is
definitely<00:01:17.909> smaller<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.750> still<00:01:19.140> not<00:01:19.920> too

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
definitely smaller but still not too

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.640 
definitely smaller but still not too
small<00:01:22.100> now<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.159> think<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.700> terms<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.180> reading<00:01:24.689> I

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
small now I think in terms of reading I

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.969 
small now I think in terms of reading I
would<00:01:26.189> probably<00:01:26.400> want<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.939> use<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:28.110> ipad<00:01:28.710> mini

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
would probably want to use the ipad mini

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.819 
would probably want to use the ipad mini
and<00:01:29.070> portrait<00:01:29.820> mode<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:31.560> great<00:01:31.799> thing

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
and portrait mode and the great thing

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.789 
and portrait mode and the great thing
about<00:01:32.100> holding<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.240> device<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.049> it's

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
about holding this device is that it's

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.560 
about holding this device is that it's
very<00:01:34.979> lightweight<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.270> imagine

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
very lightweight and I can imagine

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.789 
very lightweight and I can imagine
holding<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.369> quite<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> bit<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.390> time<00:01:39.799> where

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
holding it for quite a bit of time where

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.300 
holding it for quite a bit of time where
is<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.240> iPad<00:01:42.240> itself<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.740> definitely<00:01:44.280> a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
is the iPad itself is is definitely a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.929 
is the iPad itself is is definitely a
lot<00:01:44.460> heavier<00:01:45.439> all<00:01:46.439> right<00:01:46.619> now<00:01:46.799> let's<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.610> web

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
lot heavier all right now let's do a web

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.330 
lot heavier all right now let's do a web
search<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:49.399> we're<00:01:50.399> going<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.920> search<00:01:52.920> for

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
search and we're going to search for

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.410 
search and we're going to search for
some<00:01:53.729> images<00:01:54.409> how<00:01:55.409> about<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.799> do<00:01:56.420> dictation

favorite things to eat and the search
came<00:02:09.000> up<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.810> about<00:02:10.110> this

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
came up and about this

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.670 
came up and about this
same<00:02:10.619> time<00:02:10.890> there<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.930> let's<00:02:12.930> see<00:02:13.140> with<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
same time there and let's see with the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.980 
same time there and let's see with the
images<00:02:14.130> they<00:02:14.700> loaded<00:02:15.180> at<00:02:15.390> about<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.960> same

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
images they loaded at about the same

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.370 
images they loaded at about the same
time<00:02:16.230> too<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.450> we'll<00:02:18.450> take<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.690> look<00:02:18.900> at<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
time too and we'll take a look at the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.070 
time too and we'll take a look at the
resolution<00:02:20.100> here<00:02:20.420> side<00:02:21.420> by<00:02:21.450> side<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:24.080> they

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
resolution here side by side and they

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.510 
resolution here side by side and they
look<00:02:25.320> pretty<00:02:25.680> comparable<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.940> say<00:02:28.520> so

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
look pretty comparable I have to say so

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.780 
look pretty comparable I have to say so
that's<00:02:29.760> really<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.120> quick<00:02:30.540> test<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:32.190> ipad

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790
