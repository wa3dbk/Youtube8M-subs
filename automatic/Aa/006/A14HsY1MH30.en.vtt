the triple loop but she just wasn't able

the triple loop but she just wasn't able
to<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.680> landing<00:05:10.979> wasn't<00:05:11.220> good<00:05:11.340> it<00:05:11.610> wasn't

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
to the landing wasn't good it wasn't

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.070 
to the landing wasn't good it wasn't
good<00:05:11.910> enough<00:05:12.000> it<00:05:12.210> was<00:05:12.300> close<00:05:12.479> to<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.750> barrier

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
good enough it was close to the barrier

it<00:05:13.229> didn't<00:05:13.830> look<00:05:13.979> like<00:05:14.039> that<00:05:14.460> was<00:05:14.639> in<00:05:15.090> her

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
it didn't look like that was in her

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.600 
it didn't look like that was in her
thoughts<00:05:15.600> so<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:16.020> didn't<00:05:16.320> in<00:05:16.650> which<00:05:16.770> case<00:05:17.039> what

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
thoughts so it didn't in which case what

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.930 
thoughts so it didn't in which case what
on<00:05:17.729> earth<00:05:17.850> happened<00:05:18.120> mentally<00:05:18.750> there<00:05:19.820> so<00:05:20.820> if

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
on earth happened mentally there so if

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.430 
on earth happened mentally there so if
she<00:05:21.060> can<00:05:21.210> do<00:05:21.389> it<00:05:21.510> because<00:05:21.660> she's<00:05:21.900> going<00:05:22.200> for<00:05:22.350> a

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
she can do it because she's going for a

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.290 
she can do it because she's going for a
difficult<00:05:22.919> combination<00:05:23.220> with<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.030> looks

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
difficult combination with the looks

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.050 
difficult combination with the looks
first<00:05:24.830> into<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:26.010> triple<00:05:26.400> toe<00:05:26.639> which<00:05:26.820> gives

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
first into the triple toe which gives

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.690 
first into the triple toe which gives
her<00:05:27.210> a<00:05:27.419> high<00:05:27.810> overall<00:05:28.200> base<00:05:28.500> value<00:05:28.889> Frank

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
her a high overall base value Frank

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.120 
her a high overall base value Frank
Carroll<00:05:30.030> with<00:05:30.210> her<00:05:30.330> then<00:05:30.510> he's<00:05:30.720> seen<00:05:30.990> it<00:05:31.139> every

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
Carroll with her then he's seen it every

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.790 
Carroll with her then he's seen it every
way<00:05:32.310> winning<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.210> losing

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.010 

and<00:05:36.310> when<00:05:36.490> she<00:05:36.699> get<00:05:36.879> the<00:05:37.150> day<00:05:37.389> it<00:05:37.539> all<00:05:37.720> comes

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
and when she get the day it all comes

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.070 
and when she get the day it all comes
together<00:05:38.259> Simon<00:05:39.000> then<00:05:40.000> she's<00:05:40.240> right<00:05:40.419> up<00:05:40.629> there

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
together Simon then she's right up there

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.980 
together Simon then she's right up there
I<00:05:41.610> think<00:05:42.610> pranks<00:05:42.879> just<00:05:43.000> is<00:05:43.360> waiting<00:05:43.810> for<00:05:43.930> the

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
I think pranks just is waiting for the

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.390 
I think pranks just is waiting for the
day<00:05:44.139> and<00:05:44.259> you<00:05:44.319> see<00:05:44.590> the<00:05:44.740> glimmers<00:05:45.069> of<00:05:45.220> it<00:05:45.310> you

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
day and you see the glimmers of it you

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.059 
day and you see the glimmers of it you
see<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.759> possibility<00:05:46.530> it's<00:05:47.530> beginning<00:05:48.009> to

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:48.069 
see the possibility it's beginning to

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.059 
see the possibility it's beginning to
become<00:05:48.430> an<00:05:48.520> if<00:05:48.759> rather<00:05:49.150> than<00:05:49.330> a<00:05:49.599> when<00:05:49.919> for<00:05:50.919> me

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
become an if rather than a when for me

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.820 
become an if rather than a when for me
for<00:05:51.580> me<00:05:51.699> I<00:05:51.879> always<00:05:52.150> have<00:05:52.419> it<00:05:52.539> it's<00:05:52.750> a<00:05:52.870> win<00:05:53.080> okay

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
for me I always have it it's a win okay

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.260 
for me I always have it it's a win okay
I<00:05:54.009> just<00:05:54.250> want<00:05:54.400> to<00:05:54.460> be<00:05:54.520> there<00:05:54.669> on<00:05:54.699> the<00:05:54.940> day<00:05:57.270> she

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
I just want to be there on the day she

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.749 
I just want to be there on the day she
doesn't<00:05:58.599> look<00:05:58.750> any<00:05:58.990> closer<00:05:59.409> to<00:05:59.680> it

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
doesn't look any closer to it

doesn't look any closer to it
60<00:06:01.750> 73<00:06:02.759> sixth<00:06:03.759> place<00:06:03.970> still<00:06:04.750> four<00:06:05.050> to<00:06:05.199> come

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
60 73 sixth place still four to come

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.279 
60 73 sixth place still four to come
it's<00:06:05.919> very<00:06:06.819> unlikely<00:06:07.210> to<00:06:07.389> be<00:06:07.599> a<00:06:07.629> podium<00:06:08.050> place

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
it's very unlikely to be a podium place

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.510 
it's very unlikely to be a podium place
for<00:06:09.039> Gracie<00:06:09.250> girl<00:06:09.550> too<00:06:09.849> much<00:06:10.060> work<00:06:10.300> to<00:06:10.479> do<00:06:11.520> very

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
for Gracie girl too much work to do very

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.240 
for Gracie girl too much work to do very
disappointing
