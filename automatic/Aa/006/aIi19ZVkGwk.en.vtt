00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
the same about 11 ounces are in that

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.940 
the same about 11 ounces are in that
they<00:01:41.700> both<00:01:41.909> started<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.600> 60<00:01:43.229> gigs<00:01:43.470> internal

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.760 
extend a lot more with the micro SD card
about<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.240> processor<00:01:51.240> speed<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:52.409> ipad<00:01:52.740> mini

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
about the processor speed the ipad mini

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.749 
about the processor speed the ipad mini
it<00:01:53.399> came<00:01:53.909> with<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.750> 5<00:01:55.409> chip<00:01:56.009> 1<00:01:56.490> gigahertz

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
it came with a a 5 chip 1 gigahertz

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.789 
it came with a a 5 chip 1 gigahertz
dual-core<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.840> top<00:01:58.049> 3<00:01:58.350> comes<00:01:58.619> through

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
dual-core and the top 3 comes through

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.190 
dual-core and the top 3 comes through
with<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> 1.5<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.210> could<00:02:00.360> hurt<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.689> do<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> CO<00:02:01.079> as

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
with a 1.5 you could hurt to do a CO as

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.800 
with a 1.5 you could hurt to do a CO as
well<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.680> they<00:02:01.770> both<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:01.950> dual<00:02:02.340> core<00:02:02.810> tap

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
well so they both have dual core tap

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.630 
well so they both have dual core tap
threes<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.140> little<00:02:04.350> faster

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
threes a little faster

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.460 
threes a little faster

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.130 
so right now I'm just kind of wait for
these<00:02:07.979> two<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.340> boot<00:02:08.550> up<00:02:08.959> just<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.020> little

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
these two to boot up just a little

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.980 
these two to boot up just a little
correction<00:02:10.760> that<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.940> ipad<00:02:12.060> may<00:02:12.390> only<00:02:12.600> have

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
correction that the ipad may only have

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.800 
correction that the ipad may only have
the<00:02:13.319> one<00:02:13.590> point<00:02:13.860> two<00:02:14.100> megapixel<00:02:14.580> for<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.569> face

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
the one point two megapixel for the face

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.199 
the one point two megapixel for the face
for<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.860> front<00:02:17.040> face<00:02:17.250> camera<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.000> tap

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
for the front face camera in the tap

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.420 
for the front face camera in the tap
three<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.630> 1.3<00:02:19.380> megapixel<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.160> little<00:02:20.340> bit

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
three is it 1.3 megapixel a little bit

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.240 
three is it 1.3 megapixel a little bit
difference<00:02:21.350> okay<00:02:22.350> let's<00:02:22.770> see<00:02:22.950> which<00:02:23.070> ones

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
difference okay let's see which ones

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.250 
difference okay let's see which ones
will<00:02:23.370> be<00:02:23.490> ready<00:02:23.670> for<00:02:23.760> oh<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.540> samsung<00:02:24.900> LCD

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
will be ready for oh so the samsung LCD

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.890 
will be ready for oh so the samsung LCD
types<00:02:25.440> ready<00:02:25.740> first<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.820> then<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.360> f<00:02:27.600> at<00:02:27.750> mean

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
types ready first and then the f at mean

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.810 
types ready first and then the f at mean
age<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.320> less<00:02:28.709> than<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.950> second<00:02:30.620> right<00:02:31.620> after

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
age is less than a second right after

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.059 
age is less than a second right after
anyway<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:32.880> above<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:34.050> resolution<00:02:34.950> that

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
anyway so above the resolution that

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.750 
anyway so above the resolution that
meanie<00:02:35.400> has<00:02:35.760> 163<00:02:36.480> ppi<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.010> tab<00:02:38.220> 3<00:02:38.520> has<00:02:38.730> a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
meanie has 163 ppi and the tab 3 has a

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.979 
meanie has 163 ppi and the tab 3 has a
189<00:02:39.450> PPI<00:02:40.160> not<00:02:41.160> really<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.850> significant<00:02:42.720> big

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
189 PPI not really a significant big

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.660 
189 PPI not really a significant big
difference<00:02:43.350> but<00:02:43.560> about<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.100> know<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.640> looks

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
difference but about you know it looks

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.690 
difference but about you know it looks
fabulous<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.720> both<00:02:45.930> units<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.700> the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
fabulous on both units and the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.030 
fabulous on both units and the
touchscreen<00:02:48.269> is<00:02:48.390> extremely<00:02:49.170> responses<00:02:49.920> on

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
touchscreen is extremely responses on

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.790 
touchscreen is extremely responses on
both<00:02:50.250> units<00:02:51.050> there's<00:02:52.050> no<00:02:52.200> lagging<00:02:52.440> at<00:02:52.680> all

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
both units there's no lagging at all

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.040 
both units there's no lagging at all
right<00:02:52.890> i<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.160> see<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.360> FI<00:02:54.660> media<00:02:54.900> doesn't

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
right i can see so the FI media doesn't

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.710 
right i can see so the FI media doesn't
have<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.560> home<00:02:56.100> screen<00:02:56.459> but<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.510> tap

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
have the home screen but the the tap

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.280 
have the home screen but the the tap
three<00:02:57.930> does<00:02:58.140> have<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.350> home<00:02:58.590> screen<00:02:58.920> with<00:02:59.670> more

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
three does have a home screen with more

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.600 
three does have a home screen with more
customization<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.650> notification<00:03:02.220> bar<00:03:02.250> up

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
customization so the notification bar up

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.000 
customization so the notification bar up
at<00:03:02.820> emmys<00:03:03.180> looks<00:03:03.570> quite<00:03:03.900> simple<00:03:04.350> compared<00:03:04.860> to

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
at emmys looks quite simple compared to

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.100 
at emmys looks quite simple compared to
the<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:06.090> tap<00:03:06.360> three<00:03:08.360> about<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.540> screen

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
the the tap three about the screen

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.390 
the the tap three about the screen
rotation<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:12.450> looks<00:03:13.250> pretty<00:03:14.250> much

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
rotation that looks pretty much

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.430 
rotation that looks pretty much
identical<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:15.060> think<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.750> tap<00:03:15.989> three<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.350> a

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
identical I think the tap three is a

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.430 
identical I think the tap three is a
little<00:03:16.739> slow<00:03:17.040> very<00:03:17.459> little<00:03:18.060> bit<00:03:18.299> slow<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.959> can't

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
little slow very little bit slow I can't

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.590 
little slow very little bit slow I can't
even<00:03:19.500> notice<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.030> be<00:03:21.209> fair<00:03:21.239> in

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
even notice that and so to be fair in

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.870 
even notice that and so to be fair in
this<00:03:21.780> video<00:03:22.140> I<00:03:22.380> turn<00:03:22.739> all<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.310> settings<00:03:23.700> up

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
this video I turn all the settings up

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.940 
this video I turn all the settings up
both<00:03:24.120> units<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.930> max<00:03:25.170> level<00:03:25.380> including

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
both units to the max level including

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.580 
both units to the max level including
the<00:03:26.010> brightness<00:03:26.489> volumes<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.480> there<00:03:28.440> are

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
the brightness volumes and there are

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.830 
the brightness volumes and there are
both<00:03:28.829> in<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.370> same<00:03:29.640> without<00:03:29.850> condition<00:03:30.600> so

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
both in the same without condition so

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.110 
both in the same without condition so
you<00:03:30.959> can<00:03:31.110> kind<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.440> get<00:03:31.590> an<00:03:31.620> idea<00:03:31.769> of<00:03:32.280> what's

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
you can kind of get an idea of what's

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.310 
you can kind of get an idea of what's
going<00:03:33.329> on<00:03:33.570> so<00:03:34.530> now<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:34.890> load<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.310> this<00:03:35.910> game

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
called a temple run and I've had many

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.430 
called a temple run and I've had many
finish<00:03:40.739> up<00:03:40.980> first<00:03:42.560> which<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.769> awesome<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.440> the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
finish up first which is awesome and the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.120 
finish up first which is awesome and the
top<00:03:46.650> three<00:03:46.890> finished<00:03:47.280> right<00:03:47.640> after<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.950> can<00:03:49.950> see

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
top three finished right after I can see

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.520 
top three finished right after I can see
right<00:03:50.310> now<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.519> top<00:03:51.000> three<00:03:51.299> is<00:03:51.570> richer<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.440> the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
right now the top three is richer in the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.009 
right now the top three is richer in the
collar<00:03:52.769> compared<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.459> iPad<00:03:53.579> Mini<00:03:54.090> but<00:03:54.900> you

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
collar compared to iPad Mini but you

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.420 
collar compared to iPad Mini but you
know<00:03:55.140> different<00:03:55.470> tablet<00:03:55.920> load<00:03:56.130> things

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
know different tablet load things

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.860 
know different tablet load things
differently<00:03:56.880> right<00:03:57.209> so<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:57.480> can<00:03:57.690> really

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
differently right so you can really

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.770 
differently right so you can really
blame<00:03:58.170> each<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.680> them<00:03:59.360> anyway<00:04:00.360> about<00:04:00.600> the

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
blame each of them anyway about the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.620 
blame each of them anyway about the
typing<00:04:01.260> experiences<00:04:01.950> they're<00:04:02.790> both<00:04:03.030> very

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
typing experiences they're both very

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.440 
typing experiences they're both very
awesome<00:04:04.200> very<00:04:04.500> responsive<00:04:05.239> touching<00:04:06.239> is

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
awesome very responsive touching is

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.800 
awesome very responsive touching is
amazing<00:04:07.260> but<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.430> tap<00:04:09.150> three<00:04:09.420> hands<00:04:09.630> in

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.860 
amazing but the tap three hands in
America<00:04:10.320> was<00:04:10.500> one<00:04:10.709> tough<00:04:10.950> for<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.400> four

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870
