name implies it controls the function of
all<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.119> components<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:53.280> battery<00:01:53.579> this

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
all the components like the battery this

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.980 
all the components like the battery this
is<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> big<00:01:54.030> topic<00:01:54.210> there<00:01:54.540> are<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.659> lot<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.780> things

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
is a big topic there are a lot of things

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.780 
is a big topic there are a lot of things
to<00:01:55.110> know<00:01:55.200> about<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.469> controller<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.640> nice

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
to know about a controller the nice

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.100 
to know about a controller the nice
thing<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.000> if<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.299> buy<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.509> kit<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.930> really

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
thing is if you buy the kit you really

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.300 
thing is if you buy the kit you really
don't<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.619> worry<00:01:58.740> about<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.159> can

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
don't have to worry about it you can

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.100 
don't have to worry about it you can
treat<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> black<00:02:00.030> box<00:02:00.329> simply<00:02:00.780> plug

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
treat it like a black box simply plug

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.800 
treat it like a black box simply plug
everything<00:02:01.350> into<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:03.600> final

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
everything into it and go the final

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.069 
everything into it and go the final
piece<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.380> puzzle<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.920> bike<00:02:05.189> itself

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
piece of the puzzle is the bike itself
