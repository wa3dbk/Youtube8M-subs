00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
not only is he the fauces but he has the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.280 
not only is he the fauces but he has the
best<00:01:26.280> financial<00:01:26.700> also<00:01:27.659> when<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> comes<00:01:28.140> down

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
best financial also when it comes down

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.620 
best financial also when it comes down
to<00:01:28.350> long<00:01:28.680> shots<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:29.250> okay<00:01:29.700> they<00:01:30.150> stole<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
to long shots there okay they stole the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.990 
to long shots there okay they stole the
same<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.409> other<00:01:31.770> Robin<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.490> don't<00:01:32.729> think

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
same as the other Robin I don't think

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.569 
same as the other Robin I don't think
his<00:01:33.210> shot<00:01:33.479> has<00:01:33.689> gone<00:01:33.720> an<00:01:34.259> upgrade<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.070> did<00:01:35.460> I

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
his shot has gone an upgrade I did I

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.190 
his shot has gone an upgrade I did I
just<00:01:35.850> didn't<00:01:36.119> feel<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.450> shot<00:01:36.630> upgrade<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.079> my

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
just didn't feel the shot upgrade in my

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.530 
just didn't feel the shot upgrade in my
opinion<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.650> finesse<00:01:37.950> shots<00:01:38.310> definitely

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
opinion but finesse shots definitely

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.539 
opinion but finesse shots definitely
dribbling<00:01:40.170> he<00:01:40.500> felt<00:01:40.710> stronger<00:01:41.220> when<00:01:41.400> you're

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
dribbling he felt stronger when you're

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.450 
dribbling he felt stronger when you're
just<00:01:41.880> running<00:01:42.299> past<00:01:42.509> defenders<00:01:43.259> even<00:01:43.890> when

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
just running past defenders even when

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.950

I know I said his shooting hasn't been
upgraded<00:02:45.160> but<00:02:45.730> he<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.209> not<00:02:46.360> in<00:02:46.510> formal<00:02:46.900> even

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
upgraded but he the not in formal even

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.289

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.120 
the in-form have amazing shooting anyway
so<00:02:49.780> if<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.110> team<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.500> year<00:02:50.530> Robin<00:02:50.950> I

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
so if the team of the year Robin I

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.100 
so if the team of the year Robin I
definitely<00:02:51.670> suggest<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.390> try<00:02:52.660> them<00:02:52.780> out<00:02:52.870> in<00:02:53.019> a

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
definitely suggest you try them out in a

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.500 
definitely suggest you try them out in a
four<00:02:53.349> three<00:02:53.590> two<00:02:53.799> one<00:02:54.069> formation<00:02:54.670> because<00:02:55.360> as

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
four three two one formation because as

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.449 
four three two one formation because as
a<00:02:55.569> right<00:02:55.930> forward<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.890> could<00:02:57.010> take<00:02:57.280> advantage

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
a right forward you could take advantage

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.390 
a right forward you could take advantage
of<00:02:58.090> his<00:02:58.269> deadly<00:02:58.780> finesse<00:02:59.230> shots<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.769> that<00:03:00.280> is

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
of his deadly finesse shots and that is

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.920 
of his deadly finesse shots and that is
the<00:03:00.579> biggest<00:03:00.849> I<00:03:01.269> don't<00:03:01.480> know<00:03:01.569> that's<00:03:01.780> the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
the biggest I don't know that's the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.780 
the biggest I don't know that's the
biggest<00:03:02.769> broken<00:03:03.069> thing<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.640> could

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
biggest broken thing you could

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.740 
biggest broken thing you could
try<00:03:03.910> out<00:03:04.120> with<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.299> team<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.720> year
