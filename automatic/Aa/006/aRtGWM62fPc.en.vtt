00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.080
 today we are going to make stuffed aubergines 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.080
 first we will open them to the middle 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.139
 we will think some cuts 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.959
 we will put a little salt and a 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.470
 little bit of oil and we will introduce them 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.470
 baked 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.690
 once the cuts are made so that the 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.360
 heat between well inside the eggplant 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.390
 and can be detached from the housing that 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.910
 have we will add a little salt and 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.090
 a splash of olive oil as soon as 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.760
 is not preheated to 200 degrees the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.489
 furnace instruments as you will see the 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.930
 meat is already peeling off the skin 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.160
 then we separate the meat that has the 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.960
 eggplant skin 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.380
 and then once we have 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.350
 done this we will apply half onion a 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.050
 pair of garlic cloves and sautÃ© the 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.090
 meat with onion and cloves 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.170
 once put garlic onion and down 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.329
 we add the meat in henna 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.890
 when we eat dinner this is what 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.320
 we will incorporate a little meat 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.150
 chopped in our case we have left over 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.549
 the macaroni a little meat 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.840
 chopped tomato if you do not feel like it 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.460
 you can do it with minced meat 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.810
 normal 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.720
 the meat with onion tomato and the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.159
 garlic and everything mixed we incorporate it to 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.900
 the shell that we have left the eggplant 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.900
 then we will make a bechamel 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.880
 complete one teaspoon butter 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.619
 butter is dissolved 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.090
 throw the flour when it is already done 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.869
 the phase we are incorporating the milk 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.869
 little by little 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.800
 we already see a little salt 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.550
 as we express it, we add it 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.570
 milk to reduce the thickness and it will go 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.570
 getting quantity 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.530
 once the bechamel is done, we add 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.410
 above and we will cover with a 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.950
 little bit of grated cheese and we will remove 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.950
 baked 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.780
 Once the cheese has been removed, we have the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.780
 recipe made
