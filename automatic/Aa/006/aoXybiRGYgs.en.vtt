00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.710 
way of finding out what this music is
really<00:03:08.620> talking<00:03:09.160> about<00:03:09.190> now<00:03:09.880> we<00:03:09.940> get<00:03:10.209> lots<00:03:10.420> of

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
really talking about now we get lots of

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.280 
really talking about now we get lots of
keys<00:03:11.170> from<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.430> tempo<00:03:13.000> indications<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.200> know

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
keys from the tempo indications you know

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.140 
keys from the tempo indications you know
the<00:03:14.440> texture<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.250> music<00:03:15.760> how<00:03:15.940> its

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
the texture of the music how its

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.089 
the texture of the music how its
constructed<00:03:16.359> and<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.079> on<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:17.380> we<00:03:17.739> can<00:03:17.769> get<00:03:18.040> a

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
constructed and so on so we can get a

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.670 
constructed and so on so we can get a
lot<00:03:18.400> from<00:03:18.639> that<00:03:18.730> but<00:03:19.660> if<00:03:19.810> I'm<00:03:19.959> finding<00:03:20.650> that

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
lot from that but if I'm finding that

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.509 
lot from that but if I'm finding that

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
and I always get something valuable from

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.839 
and I always get something valuable from
that<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.200> it<00:03:53.799> doesn't<00:03:54.160> matter<00:03:54.310> what<00:03:54.669> it<00:03:54.730> is

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
that and it doesn't matter what it is

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.970 
that and it doesn't matter what it is
and<00:03:55.269> nobody<00:03:55.630> needs<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.989> know<00:03:56.109> what<00:03:56.650> it<00:03:56.799> is

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
although it almost always involves the

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:04.979 
although it almost always involves the
phrase<00:04:00.190> i<00:04:00.459> love<00:04:00.519> you<00:04:03.209> that's<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.540> one<00:04:04.750> that

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
and the minute you put words to it the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.140 
and the minute you put words to it the
phrasing<00:04:30.020> becomes<00:04:30.650> exactly<00:04:31.610> what<00:04:31.820> it<00:04:31.940> needs

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
phrasing becomes exactly what it needs

should be doing with that try saying
some<00:04:56.300> words<00:04:56.750> that<00:04:57.290> make<00:04:57.650> some<00:04:58.250> kind<00:04:58.520> of

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
some words that make some kind of
