00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 in Tokyo a man called suzaku 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.220
 arakawa has decided to create the houses 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.350
 least comfortable in the world 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.570
 these Japanese are already able to create 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.400
 anything I certainly do not 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.700
 I would buy a house that I'm not going to 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.380
 be comfortable attention to details 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.779
 because the images you are going to see 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.590
 below are from houses that are 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:29.040
 made to complicate life houses 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.570
 which according to the creator says 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.690
 awaken a person's instincts 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.190
 and make him live more years 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.340
 you can see some images in which 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.300
 you can look like toy houses look 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.730
 houses because they have geometric shapes 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.970
 as if it were a playground they have 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.240
 in squared circles good all 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.560
 inside this house is complicated until 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.360
 the fact of taking a book the 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.150
 shelves are designed so that 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.400
 when you're going to leave a book or what 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.290
 you think catch you fall to the ground and 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.560
 you have to put it back on 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.140
 switches are hidden being in 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.820
 unsuspected sites many times there 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.370
 have to climb up a ladder to 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.350
 I can turn on the switch 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.540
 the colors that are usually used as 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.390
 you can see are very bright red colors 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.250
 intense blue and green yellows that 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.030
 supposedly they keep awake the 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.000
 senses while the floors 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.520
 inclined and narrow steps oblige 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.240
 to continuous changes of position and 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.240
 push-ups 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.460
 It seems to lie not in such an environment 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.119
 accommodate is completely 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.880
 impossible 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.240
 according to arakawa says that this keeps you 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.330
 on alert and awakens your instincts by 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.030
 what I saw is better and for a longer time 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.090
 the first homes designed by 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.850
 Arakawa went on sale ago 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.149
 a few years in Tokyo and it is anticipated 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.600
 build similar houses throughout the 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.170
 world 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.289
 the name of this type of housing is 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.230
 reversible sting and lofts that's how 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.410
 have been baptized and represents the 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.350
 more disgusting housing model than a 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.660
 person can buy if really what 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.690
 you want to go wrong if you want to go to the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.970
 room going up a huge slope and 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.400
 have to use the ladder to light 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.310
 the light switch 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.060
 You can buy this house and enjoy 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.060
 your masochism
