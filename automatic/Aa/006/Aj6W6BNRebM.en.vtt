 girls hi until I threw this one 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.190
 cream, I still decided to make a review to me 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.799
 this jar is empty now I don’t know 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.150
 I probably will give the month today another 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.570
 once stretched that in this jar 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.490
 throw away and thought but I'm not done 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.970
 she did not review the gas place 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.090
 so doing this remedy for club 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.390
 clarans day cream 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.759
 jellies and cemetery th th th th 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.739
 or whatever it is the soul in general 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.860
 french day cream energizer 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.160
 cream gel 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.640
 and this series they have a whole lot of different 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.670
 Energizer Series products charge your 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.920
 skin here you become right there such 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.190
 young and all that stuff in general 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.949
 series for young skin for those who 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.420
 There are no problems of wrinkles and pigmentation 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.410
 everything is easier in general is the most ordinary 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.769
 means that practically no 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.740
 have no special effect 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.610
 in this series there is cream plump there is 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.540
 cream gel 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.549
 which I'm talking about today is all 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.400
 there little ozil kiira know things 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.729
 I liked what was here 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.509
 this whole series seemed to me as a whole 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.750
 interesting to say so but not so much 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.689
 so I bought it twice so I once 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.570
 I bought myself everything I usually do like that 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.970
 Interior I buy at once all series products 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.110
 I try everything in a row I use them all there 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.790
 some time and if I somehow don’t 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.119
 very much I come to the next 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.909
 series in general this series 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.780
 it was interesting in it was one of mine 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.180
 pets 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.480
 it's such 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.490
 tonic he was also called energizer something 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.710
 there is a tonic that's just super 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.550
 things I still have in my I'm at it 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.940
 also a body review but this cream gel 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.160
 I probably liked him from the whole series 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.190
 least of all I'm there at home 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.570
 dam I will say in the latter when we are there 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.410
 already a little left not sorry 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.470
 toss out 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.170
 I you are already on the knee smeared adjuster 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.560
 I do not remember where it is only not mozilla 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:27.209
 because honestly for the person he is me 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.000
 it didn’t fit at all why it’s hard to say 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.040
 I honestly first first 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.480
 a few days I was delighted not in 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.430
 good so light to me so 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.190
 some kind of texture 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.840
 too creamy kind of cream like 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.120
 diluted with water is so liquid 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.160
 a little bit i thought about and so and nasty 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.870
 a bath of linen 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:52.230
 but actually he has a texture 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.680
 It turned out to be a feeling that 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.280
 would bath skin smeared with greasy film 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.110
 she is thin that is she is in union with 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.870
 to the rear and since they spent smeared 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.150
 and then this film you have left to 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.400
 you neither did me all the time after that 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.980
 cream gel wanted to wash me straight 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.380
 I wanted to make soap to enter the ring fire 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.940
 strong washing all just wipe off 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.150
 your face because your face was getting 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.950
 It feels like my face mask 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.170
 This is so smooth and this is how it is 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:28.290
 you will and she somehow does not act Nick 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:33.090
 in general, frankly speaking, such an effect to me 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.880
 I did not like the composition at all, too 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.150
 hands in principle all these series are ordinary 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.370
 composition I can not even some separate 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.980
 atom component super highlight ordinary 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.049
 such a cream and composition there all these 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.180
 cream ingredients but for some reason darin 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.989
 this texture is some kind of gel creams 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.570
 diluted cream is poorly absorbed i 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.569
 Here I put this cream on my skin 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.879
 combination skin 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.709
 and those places that I have fat there 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.139
 even as he seemed to be not 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.569
 contact at all with the skin on top of it 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:08.329
 This skin wants to go and then somehow 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.389
 not absorbed anywhere and where the plot 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.879
 dry he sort of absorbed something but everything 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:16.489
 anyway , you want to know so well under 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.910
 do as if that's so and plenochku 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:24.380
 remove throw away if you can do 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:27.410
 in general, I am not happy absolutely and under 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.750
 end well as at the end of the week in three 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.849
 in a month by the use of this cream 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:37.220
 it seemed to me that my skin had become 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:40.970
 worse worse in what sense she became 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:45.919
 some kind of fat on the one hand a 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:49.940
 on the other hand, there is not even an effect 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:52.880
 describe when washing such a feeling 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.970
 what comes out of it was stitching the ears 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.770
 keep it but his skin comes off as if not 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.259
 I like what's there for her little on 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.909
 somehow falls off to the rock in general i'm not 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.990
 you may have understood or not 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:08.030
 if you had similar situations in general 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:12.349
 what else about them about this cream say 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.930
 Here's how the cream out there for your knees to heels 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.000
 he is excellent 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.180
 mozilla and ok it all looked 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.370
 very much I think that his money as he 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:28.849
 not worth it and considering what else is in this cream 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.880
 no no hyaluronic acid her 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.320
 from no special here at least 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.240
 any such components for which 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.710
 you could love him that is 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.110
 business almost analogous to ordinary 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.150
 baby cream that's what happens 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.460
 sold in tubes like toothpaste then 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.159
 hand cream here's cream or 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.020
 some kind of baby cream that's essentially 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.719
 This is the same children's cream in which 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.820
 nothing special but he still 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:56.810
 somehow falls by foolishly not absorbed 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.110
 and 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:03.470
 nothing so pleasant it is my skin 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.410
 did you get a negative review 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.200
 but I hope that this review does not 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.960
 will affect your decision I generally think 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.470
 that the review means they should not affect 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.900
 on buying decision because girls 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.060
 we are all so individual my skin 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.560
 this cream did not like your can 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.840
 to love 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.389
 therefore, I am reviewing reviews of tools 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.430
 as soon as additional information here 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.250
 when you already bought some kind of tool 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.830
 you for me at least i will buy cream 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.400
 and I immediately wonder who what's what 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.740
 thinks the length of such entertainment 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.470
 see who what how so again 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.479
 spoke test at least on 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.580
 yourself if you don't want to be wrong 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:49.070
 take a little sampler 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.490
 or who else has this cream 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:55.970
 enjoys there scrape and slice 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.470
 ask and try on yourself maybe 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.320
 it will suit you maybe you will 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.780
 squeal with delight as many girls 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.680
 who write on the forums it's just 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.870
 super super that's good i hope that 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.450
 you were interested, I will shoot now 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.860
 in the continuation of a bunch of any reviews 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.169
 because I have accumulated just 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.240
 a million of some empty jars 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:20.030
 here by the way showing you this cream 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:25.010
 close so you never have it 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:28.220
 confused here all thank you so much that 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:30.520
 We were all good to see you soon 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.520
 meeting
