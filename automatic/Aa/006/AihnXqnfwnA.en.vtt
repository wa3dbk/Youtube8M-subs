basically they limit how much you attack
the<00:02:34.150> boss<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.750> six<00:02:35.080> different<00:02:35.650> sets<00:02:36.370> of

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
the boss to six different sets of

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.699 
the boss to six different sets of
attacks<00:02:38.430> because<00:02:39.430> otherwise<00:02:39.930> like<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.140> single

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
attacks because otherwise like a single

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.240 
attacks because otherwise like a single
person<00:02:41.890> could<00:02:42.569> take<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.599> boss<00:02:43.959> down<00:02:44.349> like<00:02:44.739> an

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
person could take a boss down like an

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.330 
person could take a boss down like an
eighth<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.970> its<00:02:46.180> health<00:02:46.450> or<00:02:46.690> something<00:02:47.340> it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
eighth of its health or something it

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.009 
eighth of its health or something it
gets<00:02:48.489> pretty<00:02:48.700> ridiculous<00:02:49.390> like<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:49.780> pay<00:02:49.959> to

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
gets pretty ridiculous like the pay to

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:56.160 
gets pretty ridiculous like the pay to
play<00:02:50.230> with<00:02:52.080> pay2win<00:02:53.130> players<00:02:54.690> are<00:02:55.690> just

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
play with pay2win players are just

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.140 
play with pay2win players are just
ridiculous

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.789 

so<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:04.140> should<00:03:04.950> be<00:03:04.980> about<00:03:05.489> finished<00:03:06.799> yeah

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
so I should be about finished yeah

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.649 
so I should be about finished yeah
there's<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.189> bit<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.340> lag<00:03:08.700> between<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.360> sound

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
there's a bit of lag between the sound

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.500 
there's a bit of lag between the sound
of<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.079> get<00:03:10.920> tax<00:03:11.189> but<00:03:11.549> oh<00:03:11.730> well<00:03:11.970> what<00:03:12.239> can<00:03:12.269> you

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.339 

yep<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:01.939> got<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.150> ok<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.959> got<00:04:03.109> it<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.319> first

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
yep I got it ok I got it the first

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.160 
yep I got it ok I got it the first
attack<00:04:03.980> number<00:04:04.849> of<00:04:04.939> attacks<00:04:05.299> is<00:04:05.629> right<00:04:05.810> here

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
attack number of attacks is right here

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.440 
attack number of attacks is right here
the<00:04:06.709> amount<00:04:06.890> of<00:04:07.040> damage<00:04:07.430> I<00:04:07.609> did<00:04:07.640> is<00:04:08.030> right<00:04:08.239> here

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
the amount of damage I did is right here

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.170 
the amount of damage I did is right here
so<00:04:08.629> I<00:04:08.689> took<00:04:08.750> that<00:04:09.200> one<00:04:09.890> attack<00:04:10.250> I<00:04:10.549> hit<00:04:10.849> him<00:04:10.939> for

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
so I took that one attack I hit him for

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.199 
so I took that one attack I hit him for
over<00:04:11.299> a<00:04:11.480> million<00:04:11.900> points<00:04:12.560> of<00:04:12.769> damage<00:04:12.950> I<00:04:13.549> think

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
over a million points of damage I think

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.710 
over a million points of damage I think
this<00:04:14.329> is<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.890> team<00:04:15.890> damage<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.699> chain<00:04:16.970> damage

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
this is a team damage the chain damage

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.930 
this is a team damage the chain damage
and<00:04:18.289> then<00:04:18.739> this<00:04:18.949> is<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.130> total<00:04:19.459> amount<00:04:19.669> of

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
and then this is the total amount of

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.230 
and then this is the total amount of
damage<00:04:20.299> I<00:04:20.449> did<00:04:20.620> with<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.919> chain<00:04:22.220> damage<00:04:22.639> this

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
damage I did with the chain damage this

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.110 
damage I did with the chain damage this
is<00:04:23.389> without<00:04:23.539> it<00:04:23.900> this<00:04:24.530> is<00:04:24.680> with<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:25.039> this<00:04:25.910> is

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
is without it this is with it this is

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.770 
is without it this is with it this is
important<00:04:26.630> because<00:04:27.940> there<00:04:28.940> are<00:04:29.090> events<00:04:29.389> where

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
important because there are events where

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.980 
important because there are events where
you<00:04:30.680> can<00:04:30.919> get<00:04:31.310> stuff<00:04:31.729> depending<00:04:32.419> on<00:04:32.419> how<00:04:32.750> high

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
you can get stuff depending on how high

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.249 
you can get stuff depending on how high
your<00:04:33.259> damage<00:04:33.620> is<00:04:34.630> this<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.750> how<00:04:35.840> many<00:04:35.900> points

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
your damage is this is how many points

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.890 
your damage is this is how many points
of<00:04:36.530> lux<00:04:37.099> I<00:04:37.460> got<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.060> Lux<00:04:38.750> is<00:04:38.990> use<00:04:39.229> for<00:04:40.900> your

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
of lux I got and Lux is use for your

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.930 
of lux I got and Lux is use for your
weekly<00:04:42.229> score<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:43.099> your<00:04:43.340> weekly<00:04:43.669> score

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
weekly score and your weekly score

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.510 
weekly score and your weekly score
determines<00:04:44.509> how<00:04:45.080> many<00:04:45.139> metals<00:04:45.740> you<00:04:45.949> get<00:04:46.160> to

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520

determines how many metals you get to
buy<00:04:46.699> stuff<00:04:49.419> normally<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:51.289> lux<00:04:51.560> that<00:04:51.949> I<00:04:51.979> get<00:04:52.340> is

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
buy stuff normally the lux that I get is

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.150 
buy stuff normally the lux that I get is
one<00:04:52.940> hundred<00:04:53.060> percent<00:04:53.560> but<00:04:54.560> because<00:04:55.009> it's

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
one hundred percent but because it's

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.580 
one hundred percent but because it's
left<00:04:55.370> up<00:04:55.580> time<00:04:55.849> it's<00:04:56.150> doubled<00:04:56.690> so<00:04:57.139> I<00:04:57.169> get<00:04:57.349> two

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
left up time it's doubled so I get two

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.219 
left up time it's doubled so I get two
hundred<00:04:57.800> percent<00:04:58.479> plus<00:04:59.479> I<00:04:59.780> have<00:04:59.990> eight

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.279 
that because of my cards so in total
because<00:05:05.960> of<00:05:06.080> all<00:05:06.229> the<00:05:06.380> multipliers<00:05:07.010> I<00:05:07.490> got

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
because of all the multipliers I got

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.570 
because of all the multipliers I got
almost<00:05:09.289> three<00:05:09.680> hundred<00:05:09.800> thousand<00:05:10.400> bucks

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
almost three hundred thousand bucks

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.719 
almost three hundred thousand bucks
which<00:05:10.909> is<00:05:10.940> pretty<00:05:11.630> insane<00:05:12.070> it's<00:05:13.070> not<00:05:13.250> the<00:05:13.460> best

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
which is pretty insane it's not the best

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.620 
which is pretty insane it's not the best
but<00:05:14.409> the<00:05:15.409> boss<00:05:15.590> is<00:05:15.830> really<00:05:16.039> low<00:05:16.370> level<00:05:16.820> like

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
but the boss is really low level like

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.540 
but the boss is really low level like
level<00:05:17.990> 27<00:05:18.500> is<00:05:18.770> really<00:05:19.099> low<00:05:19.340> and<00:05:21.190> once<00:05:22.190> I<00:05:22.340> get

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
level 27 is really low and once I get

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.850 
level 27 is really low and once I get
past<00:05:22.580> like<00:05:23.150> I<00:05:23.419> don't<00:05:23.690> know<00:05:23.840> level<00:05:24.199> 50<00:05:24.620> I
