these are the contents inside the box
again<00:01:35.159> standard<00:01:36.000> antenna<00:01:40.040> it<00:01:41.040> looks<00:01:41.310> like

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
again standard antenna it looks like

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.469 
again standard antenna it looks like
this<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.960> weird<00:01:43.229> cable<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.180> will<00:01:45.299> show

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
this in a weird cable and I will show

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.240 
this in a weird cable and I will show
you<00:01:45.540> later<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.320> video<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:46.890> I'm<00:01:47.009> going

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you later in this video what I'm going

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.600 
you later in this video what I'm going
to<00:01:47.280> do<00:01:47.520> with<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> video<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
to do with this so this is the video and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.819 
to do with this so this is the video and
audio<00:01:50.700> cable<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.950> power<00:01:52.950> cable<00:01:54.590> which<00:01:55.590> I'm

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
audio cable a power cable which I'm

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.539 
audio cable a power cable which I'm
going<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.189> transform<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.119> lower<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:58.549> cable

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
going to transform to lower the cable

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.510 
going to transform to lower the cable
let<00:02:00.000> me<00:02:00.180> show<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.420> later<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.290> here<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
let me show you later and here is the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.709 
let me show you later and here is the
transmitter<00:02:03.829> pretty<00:02:04.829> lightweight<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:06.420> let's

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
transmitter pretty lightweight so let's

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.260 
transmitter pretty lightweight so let's
say<00:02:06.869> that's<00:02:07.229> nice<00:02:07.640> doesn't<00:02:08.640> weight<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> lot

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
say that's nice doesn't weight a lot

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.470 
say that's nice doesn't weight a lot
again<00:02:10.259> with<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.069> antenna

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
again with the antenna

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.030 
again with the antenna
connecter

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.460 

so<00:02:15.670> these<00:02:15.879> are<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.269> contents<00:02:16.810> that's<00:02:16.989> inside

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
so these are the contents that's inside

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.619 
so these are the contents that's inside
the<00:02:17.650> box<00:02:17.860> when<00:02:18.069> you<00:02:18.159> order<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.459> boss<00:02:18.760> game<00:02:19.060> FPV

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
the box when you order a boss game FPV

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.240 
the box when you order a boss game FPV
said<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:22.120> I'm<00:02:22.299> going<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.870> attach<00:02:23.409> one<00:02:23.890> antenna

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
said so I'm going to attach one antenna

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.030 
said so I'm going to attach one antenna
before<00:02:25.060> I'm<00:02:25.150> going<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.480> power<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.049> up<00:02:26.170> this<00:02:26.830> is

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
before I'm going to power it up this is

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.119 
before I'm going to power it up this is
a<00:02:27.090> standard<00:02:28.090> cable<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.170> bought<00:02:29.709> through

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
a standard cable that I bought through

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.600 
a standard cable that I bought through
eBay<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:31.390> connect<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.080> GoPro<00:02:32.620> with<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.920> USB

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
eBay to connect the GoPro with a USB

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.229 
eBay to connect the GoPro with a USB
connector<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.560> FB<00:02:36.069> Fiza<00:02:36.310> but<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:36.879> one<00:02:37.090> is

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
connector to a FB Fiza but this one is

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.670 
connector to a FB Fiza but this one is
doesn't<00:02:37.629> go<00:02:38.260> into<00:02:38.440> fit<00:02:39.360> because<00:02:40.680> my

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
doesn't go into fit because my

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.850 
doesn't go into fit because my
transmitter<00:02:42.340> needs<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.970> cable<00:02:43.450> like<00:02:43.540> this<00:02:43.860> so

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
transmitter needs a cable like this so

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.220 
transmitter needs a cable like this so
I'm<00:02:45.129> going<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.579> transform<00:02:46.329> this<00:02:46.599> cable<00:02:47.019> and

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
I'm going to transform this cable and

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.170 
I'm going to transform this cable and
I'm<00:02:47.670> using<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.970> black<00:02:49.209> wire<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:50.879> yellow<00:02:51.879> wire

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
I'm using the black wire and yellow wire

to focus so injector with the GST
connector<00:04:13.019> take<00:04:14.019> this<00:04:14.169> out<00:04:14.349> I'm<00:04:15.250> going<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.699> cut

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
connector take this out I'm going to cut

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.020 
connector take this out I'm going to cut
off<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:17.229> GST<00:04:17.739> connector<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.489> I'm<00:04:18.609> going<00:04:18.910> to

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
off the GST connector and I'm going to

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.170 
off the GST connector and I'm going to
attach<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.630> female<00:04:20.590> balance<00:04:21.549> plug<00:04:21.849> for<00:04:22.150> my

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
attach a female balance plug for my

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.940 
attach a female balance plug for my
lippo<00:04:22.599> battery<00:04:23.370> this<00:04:24.370> is<00:04:24.520> a<00:04:24.550> tree<00:04:24.909> s3<00:04:25.630> cells

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
lippo battery this is a tree s3 cells

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.760 
lippo battery this is a tree s3 cells
li-po<00:04:26.950> battery

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
li-po battery

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.930 
li-po battery
that<00:04:27.889> produce<00:04:28.099> at<00:04:28.460> 12<00:04:28.699> volts<00:04:29.090> voltage<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:33.940> so

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
that produce at 12 volts voltage and so

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.080 
that produce at 12 volts voltage and so
now<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.180> can<00:04:35.330> power<00:04:35.810> my<00:04:36.110> seven<00:04:37.009> inch<00:04:37.190> LCD<00:04:37.669> screen

now I can power my seven inch LCD screen

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.570 
now I can power my seven inch LCD screen
and<00:04:38.659> I'm<00:04:39.349> also<00:04:39.560> going<00:04:39.979> to<00:04:40.099> shoulder<00:04:40.580> a<00:04:40.819> cable

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
and I'm also going to shoulder a cable

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.740 
and I'm also going to shoulder a cable
